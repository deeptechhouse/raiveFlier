Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the Associate Editor at Resident Advisor. How the records you buy make the journey from studio to turntable may not routinely cross your mind, but behind the scenes is an endangered breed of professionals who form a critical link in this chain. We are, of course, talking about distributors. One of the last remaining companies in this field is South London's Prime Direct Distribution. Working with over 300 labels, including the likes of Drum Code, Wolf Music and Hypercolor, Prime operates on a global level and looks after everything from vinyl pressing to artist management. There's a great deal more to the distribution game than meets the eye, which is why we were keen to speak with Prime's Spencer Broughton to find out how they've managed to survive for the last eight years amid a crumbling industry. Being 17 in 1987 was quite fortunate. Well, firstly, I had hip-hop when I was about 13, 14. Hip-hop and electro was massive. It was our music and it sort of progressed into the whole house explosion. I was a lucky age. And after many jobs, proper jobs as I call them, I actually realised, no, I want to do something for a living that is my passion. After enjoying the whole acid house explosion, I thought I could do this for a living and that's what I did. I was a DJ, I still am a DJ, I suppose, you never really stop. So it sort of went hand in hand and as from 1994... I worked in distribution and that's sort of progression working for other people to have my own company. So what were some of those first distribution jobs? My first job was for Pinnacle and I was a sales, I was a telesales guy selling to HMV, selling pretty awful music to HMVs. And I quickly realized after about two months that wasn't for me and they moved me to import. So I was selling. Stuff like relief, it was US imports, so I was sending stuff like relief and casual that we were bringing in from there. then New York One Stops, then New York Distribution Companies. So even after eight weeks of hell, I quickly got into what I wanted to do. We were selling some really cool labels. And I kind of did that really for ten years. It was predominantly US imports, bringing them into the UK, whether I was selling them myself or buying them. I later became a buyer. and that's what Prime actually started off as a US import distribution company. I mean, did you feel like you specifically wanted to get into distribution when you started out? No, it was... It was a friend of mine, Rob, knew a guy called Phil that worked at Pinnacle. That's Phil who runs Peace Frog now. And he begrudgingly thought, well, he's your mate, I'll put a word in, and it kind of happened. At the time, I was a DJ around... around the bigger, more well-known clubs in London at the time. And I just needed a day job because it was getting a bit out of hand. The partying was getting a little bit too crazy and I thought, no, I need something to focus my attention on. And maybe a little bit of foresight at a crazy age, thinking this isn't going to last forever. I need something a little bit more rigid. So did you sort of reach any great levels as a DJ? I ended up being a resident at Ministry for a couple of years. I was kind of a London DJ. I played at lots of different clubs. places like the inner mid 90s late 90s Hanover grounds and legends and Club UK I was resident of Club UK which is an infamous club if if you can ever say it quickly closed down for being rather naughty and letting letting too much go on, shall we say. But it was fun times, it was fun times. So what was the sort of climate like in the distribution world during the 90s? It was so relaxed because there was, especially in the vinyl world, there was really no rival. A DJ played vinyl, a DJ needed new vinyl and needed new music. So being an importer, there was pinnacle imports. There was Greyhound. There was a few guys, a few companies that were good US importers. We were just one of them. So it was my job to source, well, firstly to sell. and secondly to source new releases from the States and bring them over and obviously that gave me a great foot up being a DJ because in those days there was no file sharing it had to be in your hand, you had to own it so getting that that TP, getting that promo of that casual release, you were off. So in the 10 years before you set up Prime, were there any sort of changes you saw just in that time period? Or would you say that this was just all boom time? It wasn't all boom. The CD thing, I left Pinnacle and joined Prime, old Prime, because we are not the Prime that started in, I think it was 95. We came out of that and they went under nine months later, which was tough for them, but quite fortuitous for ourselves. because we picked up quite a lot from that. I'd say around 2000, 2001 was when you first started to, this CDJ started to emerge and you started to see a shift. There was loads of crazy ideas happening then. People would put... like a CD on the front of a vinyl release. So you'd buy a shrink-wrapped vinyl with a CD on the front as well, so it gave you the option. A few people tried that. Obviously, it failed. It was impacting in that people were dealing with test pressing and stuff on CD-R. Yeah, the promoing changed. Soon as the... The email came along, you would get sent sound clips rather than TPs. We don't send out TPs now, and that's been the way for quite some time. If one of our... If somebody specifically asked for one, we send them one. But it used to be like Christmas every day. I mean, was that even a difficult decision for you? No. To be honest, in the end, I think people got a bit annoyed with it. so many TPs to check. You just got an email with links or a sound file clip and you could tell within 10 seconds whether it was for you or not. Yeah, sure, sure. Do you want to talk a bit about setting up Prime and what led to that decision? Well, Prime came out of Prime Direct. PDD, the company that is now, came out of the larger company, Prime, who wanted to get rid of their UK arm. They wanted to totally concentrate on export because they saw the UK as a declining market. They offered me and my partner, Richard, the company solely for a pound, which was nice. to take on seven of the staff and guarantee them work so they didn't have to pay them off basically. So we did that, we did just that. What year was that? That was 2003. January 2003. We're just, we're eight and a half now. So, and by the September or October of 2003, Prime had gone under. Which was sad because a lot of labels got hurt. A lot of people had a lot of money tied up with Prime. But it was quite badly run, if I must say. I'm not Alan Sugar myself, but it was there for all to see, unfortunately. What was your line of thinking? Why was it like, OK, I've got to do this myself? Yeah, well, it was a choice I ever worked with. My options were, I was an import buyer. I used to bring over the US releases from New York, but they were scrapping servicing the UK. And my job for the last 10 years before that was bringing stuff from the States and bringing it, and Germany and Europe, but predominantly the States, bringing it and giving it to the stores in the UK. By getting rid of their UK side, that wasn't an option. So they offered me to still continue that. So it was an absolute no-brainer. I took it up, borrowed money from whoever. I don't know how we quite managed to do it, but we started up. And as I say, eight months later, the prime went under. So there was a massive void for the UK releases that they looked after on export and where we could pick that up. And we've slowly grown the company to where it is now. Right, I see. And what was the kind of mission statement, if you like, when you set up? Firstly, just to make sure the seven guys that I had working for me. could earn a living by selling music that they felt part of. And that's been the kind of ethos within Prime to this day, that everybody has to feel that the release is us, the way we listen to music now. when a label delivers a track to us is it's played to everybody. So the whole company have to feel it's one of our releases. And that was kind of set in stone from the beginning. That was the main aim at the beginning, to bring in music we wanted to distribute to the world and to the UK and to earn a living off it. Sure, I mean, would that kind of encompass any type of electronic music genre, would you say? I mean, is it that broad, we just need to be feeling this? Yeah. I mean it's changed we were HOUSC at the beginning because we had those roots with US House it's always been House with a capital H and I'd say 50% of our labels are that House has sometimes got a dirty word now I hear house releases now that are called Techno overnight they've been called Techno which I don't quite get But, I mean, one man's house is another man's techno, one man's techno is another man's house. I don't know where the line is now on what's what. I just think there's good music, be it house or techno. It's probably simpler to deal with in those terms, I think. So what were some of the key labels you were dealing with when you started out? When we started out, I mean, we didn't really have many exclusives. It was beg, steal and borrow. We try not to steal too much because we've never been deemed a callous label to go after somebody else's, a callous distribution company that would go after somebody else's labels. That's not really our style. If they fell on our laps, we'd take them. Much like the football analogy of tapping a label up. It's not really our style. It's not really our style. Is that something that is quite prevalent? Yeah, there's lots of it goes on. We lost a label four months ago. We've gone to one of our German partners. We work with... weekly we've got lots of releases we share with each other and somebody's left us but it's part and parcel of the business and it probably it was right for it to happen right so in these sort of cases what would the other guys be offering why is a label going to come to this decision I don't know naive question I suppose it could be a personal relationship breakdown where It's kind of, you've had a few too heated discussions on the common one is a label thinks the release is better than the distribution company thinks it is. There's always a saying, quite a negative saying, that if a record sells well, then the label said it was because the release was good. And if it didn't sell well, it's because the distribution company didn't sell it. Usually the distribution company can be on a loser from the off. Yeah, sure. That does happen quite a lot. Do you very often get honesty from labels that just hold their hands up and are like, yeah, actually that release was... There's some really cool labels there. You're actually finding, or I'm actually finding over the last few years, it's got to be honest now. Vinyl is a tough market to sell, even with really established labels, it's still tough to sell. Just because it's obviously taking a kicking from the digital side of things and it's got to be a love. It's got to be a love and it's got to be loved. So sometimes when a release doesn't sell as well as it could, because for instance the summer's a down time for selling releases, there's a release that they've got pending for digital for the middle of July, we have to release the vinyl the middle of July, it's not going to sell as well as it would in the end of September or October. So lots of labels are quite accepting of us. do your best you know what you're going to do with it sure I mean do you have to have quite tricky conversations on occasion yeah I've always been I've always been honest from the off if I don't if I think something I'll pre-warn the labels. But with what we do at Prime, we try to absorb as much of the hit as we can. We've never, ever charged a label for a deficit on a release, purely based on the theory that I said earlier. they send us the release. It's up to us to put it out because we're financially backing the label to put it out. If we say yes, then it's on our heads if it doesn't sell. So we absorb any loss. We've never charged the label in eight years for any loss. So would it ultimately be a label's decision if they put out vinyl or would you just have to come to some sort of agreement? We say, if we hear a release... and we think it's risky that it would break even or earn them much, I'll just tell them from the off. Sometimes I'll say, look, I'm not sure this is going to be viable. If you want to release it, then you can. pay for the manufacturer we'll do we will do our best to sell it is that just coming down to you sort of your perception of the quality of this piece of music absolutely yeah totally down to the to the team the guys that are selling it the guys that are sending it off to manufacture just a feel of what is going to sell for vinyl i mean in in the office there that The seven guys that sit round that boardroom-shaped table, between them, Christ, there must be over 100 years' experience between them. So they kind of know what's going to sell. Yeah, I mean, so that's certainly something that needs to be developed over many, many years. Oh, it's hard. It's hard to call even... I've been doing this many, many years. It's hard for me to call it. Surely with seven people calling it, you've got a much better spread. So yeah, it takes a long time to work that out. I mean, are there certain things that you can pick out that you think lend themselves to higher sales, like particular genres? Yeah, there are vinyl styles. There are genres. vinyl release that sell better, the edits do really well. There's obviously certain artists that sell well on vinyl. For example, the last Hud Tracks, one of our well-liked labels that we have, if there's an Agnes release on Hud Tracks, it's going to sell bucket loads compared to the other releases. He's a great producer and it sells well. Great track history. It doesn't really need to be listened to. I mean, we obviously do, but we know that's going to... what it's going to do. Just to backtrack slightly, could you sort of like outline the scale of the operation and the sort of complete range of services you offer? Yeah, well, Prime is a distribution company that offers physical and digital distributions. We are primarily... primarily CD, vinyl and digital so we can handle all that. We've got a publishing company. We can do promotion or we can tell people we can push them towards promotion companies or marketing companies. So it's pretty much a one-stop for a label. If they don't want to get their hands dirty at all and they just want to give the release to us, we can do it all or we can do some of it. 50% of our business is still vinyl and the other 50% is made up between CD and digital. In terms of the sort of scale, I mean how many staff members do you have? We've got seven in the London office and we've got two in the Northern office and one part-time so there's ten in total which for I suppose one of... the UK's bigger electronic music distribution companies. It's tiny compared to how it used to be. But sometimes I call myself Spenny Five Hats because you do have to do about... four or five jobs at certain points. I mean, do you feel quite stretched at times? Oh yeah, I've lost my hair and everything the past eight years. I had a full head of hair when I started it. Okay, so lots of 12-hour days. Yeah, lots of 12-hour. When we started, it wasn't uncommon for me to come in at sort of six, seven in the morning and leave eight, nine at night and that went on for a long time. And the guys are really good, all the staff are really good. Lunch hour can be just grabbing a sandwich and scuffing it down after checking out tracks and getting back to labels or picking orders or selling tracks. It has to be a labour of love, it has to be. Christ, if you wanted to earn lots of money, I'm sure there's many other jobs you wanted to do, but how you can't sit around listening to house music all day. So what are your sort of, what are the primary things you're getting through on a day-to-day basis? What, my jobs? Yeah. Lots. I mean, it can be anything. for brokering a new deal with a pressing plant or a mastering company or the manufacturing side of our business or getting back to labels. I think you should switch the sides on the releases. I think you've got this down as the A-side. I think you should maybe possibly put this as your A-side. we should shelve this release, put this digital only, or I can't believe you're not putting this out on vinyl. Why have you got this digital only? It's lots. We're always listening to new music. We've got, there's, it's never quite in the office. Even when the guys are selling, we're checking out new releases all the time. So how many labels do you currently deal with? We just count them up before you come. It's 266 as of today. Obviously that might change on Friday. That might actually be different next Wednesday. There's so many coming. all the time so it's so there's a lot of kind of chopping and change Yeah. There is a natural culling of obviously the decline of the vinyl market. There is a certain style of house that is just a digital sound. The more mainstream house that we used to do, if you name your top ten labels on Beatport, you could... possibly say that they aren't they well 50% of the time they're not going to do that well on vinyl just because it's a different market I mean I sort of have an inkling but what do you think that's come down to? I hate to say it, maybe some of those digital releases are what I'd call throwaway house. It's kind of, it does something for the moment then. So vinyl has to be something that you want to own. It has to be something you want to keep. Maybe you don't get that with these possibly named throwaway releases. Some work, some work, just some don't. Yeah, sure. So who are some of your... your bigger sellers and who are some of your bigger labels that people would... One label we love, and it's great because we've had them since day dot, was Wolf Music. The Wolf Boys have just... Their A&R is fantastic. I've never advised them on what they should or shouldn't put out. They've just... They've got it absolutely nailed and each release sells well. And it's widely received, openly received from everybody. It's well liked. Wow, there's just so many. The Colour Boys from Detroit. who started off when they first came to us, we'd sort of lost faith with vinyl because the US distributors maybe didn't know what they had. And again, great A&R, great label. Anything from edits to deep house to techno, it's just good music. Sure. I mean, how many units would one of your bigger labels hope to shift, would you say? What's the sort of maximum? Well, we can make a viable press. Our lowest press is 300 units, and we can actually make that viable for a label. We can press, manufacture, and distribute 300 units and still earn a little bit back for the label. which 10 years ago, even eight years ago, was unthinkable. 300's kind of the standard across... No, 300's your base. Your base, but is that kind of an industry-wide standard or is that just something... you guys employ? Well, I wouldn't know which other distribution companies or P&D companies can do, but as I say, we can make it viable for 300, so that's kind of our base. And a lot of the labels we start at that, unless it's an established label like Zed Recordings or somebody that's been around for years that we already know selling more. Left Room came to us. a couple of months ago and are obviously established. So we know we're not going to start those figures. And it goes up to, I suppose, a decent label now selling 1,000. And then you get the odd... Happy accident or just a great record. I mean, our best-selling record the past year and a half sold around 3,000. You've got a few releases selling 3,000, but that's rare these days. How often do these happy accidents come along? Well, I wish they happened more, but not so much nowadays. To be honest, 1,000. we're delighted if a release is selling 1,000 because the label earns, the label earns, we earn, and the next release is looking good because the last one's just sold to thousands of people looking at the label. So you're saying that even at 300, both parties could stand to make even a small amount? Yeah, well, the way we see vinyl now, if you're... looking at vinyl to order your next Learjet or get your helipad built, it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. But if you want your release to be on black plastic and you want your release to be held... you want it in your hand, then vinyl's a great, it's a great promotion for a lot of artists. And why not? If you think you can sell 300 releases, 300 copies of your release, then we can earn you a little bit. It probably pays for your promotion. So why not? Yeah, sure. And what sort of packages do you offer to labels? And what sort of... terms do you offer? Well, we've got a two-year deal on our P&D, but anybody can leave if it doesn't work. But as I said, only three have left in the past eight years, so something must be going right. and I mean there's a wide array of packaging options the hyper colour boys have gone for a die cut sleeve with a different colour in her we've just we've got loads of different sleeving options. It depends how much you want to throw at it. Usually we ask the labels if they want some extravagant design to put in a little bit because it's not fair on the guys that just want a nice cut on a nice press in a black disco. So we maybe asked the labels to put in a little bit there. What's the competition like these days? It was a lot worse. I think when the digital age first hit us, I think people panicked a bit and there were a few backstabbing moments going on where people were scrambling for labels, offering crazy deals. But now it's a lot more friendly. We have deals with word and sound. Intergroove, DBH, three big vinyl distribution companies within Germany. And it's quite amicable, as in, we're going to take this label from you and give it to them because it's not really working there. And they're all cool with it. And much the same, we look after a lot of word and sounds releases for the UK market. Same with all the German guys. Hasten to add, they are the two biggest final markets, Germany and the UK. The rest, sort of the third place is a long way behind the UK and Germany. Is there a sort of specific turning point that you can mark out when we sort of got or were starting to go towards this place we find ourselves now? I'd say the first one was probably the start of Beatport. That changed everything. And it was almost overnight. Vinyl wasn't as important. If it was totally to do with revenue and getting your stuff out, Beatport became number one almost overnight. It felt that way anyway. Probably didn't happen overnight, but it certainly feels like it did now. And we had to change and adapt. That's why we went to the manufacturers, manufacturing companies that produce the vinyl, that do our cuts, the cutting houses, and said, look, the deal's going to change. We have to bring down the amount we can press, the minimum press, to make this viable for the labels. So we fought on that side to make, to keep hold of labels, to make. to still make sure that they kept their vinyl presses viable to keep the thing going. I mean, was it a time that you saw coming? Yeah, yeah, I think so. I think it did, once you saw digital, I always think there'll be a place for vinyl, but being totally realistic, it was always going to get smaller and we had to be bespoke. We had to tailor. pressing deals and manufacturing deals and our deal to the labels to make it viable for both ourselves and for them. We had to protect ourselves because we have to protect ourselves so we can still pay them. Yeah, sure. I mean, why do you think it is that you've kind of managed to float while others have sunk? Well, there's been a plethora of... of distribution companies that have gone. Many reasons, I suppose the bigger ones, like your Pinnacles and Amato's and Unique's, I suppose the way they went down because they didn't change, they didn't adapt quickly enough. So maybe the change your dye theory didn't register quickly enough for those guys. And there was maybe other companies that just stuck to the music they know. There was some great distribution companies that only did broken beat, acid jazz, soul, afrobeat styles or whatever. Whatever they chose to do, they just pigeonholed themselves. So when it moved slightly, they were more seen as that kind of distribution company. I mean, do you feel like you've had to personally make compromises? along the way? Oh, there's, they are, there have been labels in the past that mean absolutely nothing to me and we have to make that conscious business decision of can we sell it? I'd love to say that all the labels we have had over the years have been absolute favourites of mine but I think I'd probably have half the labels. I'd probably have half those labels now, if that was the case. You have to have that. We've looked after some big, major labels who are putting out big commercial releases over the years. To have those, if I've got a, what am I saying, if we've had a head candy release, not that we do head candy anymore, but we did, if we had a head candy release, by selling enough units of the head candy release means we could back the colour release from Detroit. And I don't really mind doing that. I've never really had a problem doing that. And I think a few companies along the way wouldn't have. have touched the more commercial labels but but i see it as you have to have one with the other to to make the the vinyl distribution viable yeah sure i mean do you think there's been kind of mistakes along the way oh yeah there's maybe we went a little bit too commercial at one point but we we there was a few releases that uh i think i'm probably going red now thinking about it but But we quickly backtracked. We're honest about mistakes we've made. We quickly backtracked because it wasn't us and it was mainly purely a financial decision. But I'd like to say, I mean, I'd... Out of our 260 odd labels now, I'm pretty pleased with the bulk of them. Another thing you guys said to me before the interview was that you felt that vinyl was having a bit of a renaissance. Yeah, I think it's certain styles that are having a renaissance. I thought the edits thing was maybe over or had sort of come to the end six months ago, maybe a year ago. But I don't think that's the case. It's obviously down to each release. There must be new people coming into the scene that don't even know the track from its original form. I just thought edits were for people that liked the original and wanted to hear it in a new way. But I actually now think there's people that don't know the original. Much in the same way that... I found a love of 70s jazz, funk and soul because of the samples in hip-hop records and the... 80s and 90s I'd find back that that was Norman Connors or find back that that was Roy Ayres and then get into Roy Ayres and Norman Connors I think maybe the same is happening again with the edits thing the kids are where's this sample from and maybe they're searching back I mean could you sort of put a percentage on it sort of year on year like what the sales yeah well I think gradually there's a big been a decrease maybe 5% a year in the last sort of three, four years, 5% a year falling off on vinyl on the general sales. But certain styles of music, your edits, your cooler techno house crossover, I suppose your Detroit sound, if I must pigeonhole it, has raised. I mean, there's stuff that we're selling. thousand units on some releases. Four years ago, we'd be happy to do four or five hundred because it would be deemed maybe too underground. And I don't know... No, because we've got a wider web we're selling. We've got a wider spread of sales. Or maybe there's just more kids, more punters getting into, or record buyers getting into the more underground sound because that's what vinyl has become. It's not about throwaway house. That's totally gone to digital. Do you see it being a continuing upward trend? Bloody hope so. Yeah, I really hope so. I really hope so. I mean, have you, as a company, sort of continued to grow over the eight years? Has there been sort of fluctuations? Well, from January to the end of April, the first four months of this year was our biggest four months ever. And this is in a declining industry, in a global recession. So, as I said, we must be doing something right. So just kind of looking to the future, what do you see as being the main challenges you face? Well, I suppose the possible sword of Damocles is the fact that how long will vinyl stay viable? Would I have to push it to a 250 press to make it viable? realistically, I don't think that's going to happen just because of the costs incurred for mastering. So how small will it get before it lasts? But then I've got to be lightened by the fact that you do have these splinter genres that are selling more than... they were four years ago. So I just think that us as a company have to look for those new styles, those new labels that could sell more than they were or could continue to sell good amounts and I'm sure they're out there. I'm sure they're out where we've got. We've got the Hypercolour Boys have just come across to us. So I'm really excited about their releases. Their sub-label, Sneaker Social Club. There's a lot of good stuff. stuff out there. So this is something you're participating in actively? Yeah, absolutely. We're always looking for new labels. It has to be the right label and it has to be something, as I mentioned before, the boardroom of PDD. Every person in PDD has to feel part of it or a voting system. They maybe can't get everybody to agree. They're quite democratic. you
