I'm a hustler, baby. That's what my dad has made me. Yeah, I'm a hustler, baby. That's what my dad has made me. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Tidal Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Simian Mobile Disco are one of the more slippery acts in electronic music. Some may know them for their big room hits like Hustler, while others may remember their collaborations with singers like Beth Ditto and Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor on Temporary Pleasures. The duo followed that one up, however, with a collection of 12 inches aimed directly at the dance floor called Delicacies that snuck out. under the radar and their highly accomplished DJ mixes are just as liable to feature Conrad Schnitzler and Tomita as they are Paul Wolford and Peter Van Huizen. To put it simply, they love electronic music in all its forms and that's why we were pleased to be able to speak to them as part of our ongoing live RA Exchange series at this year's Sonar Festival in Barcelona. It seemed like after the last official album that it's a change you're not working with a lot of collaborations getting back to basics was that the point was that the uh when you went into the studio that was the decision that you wanted to do um yeah i mean we never really have a very strong plan when we go into the studio But I think definitely we'd kind of, we'd learnt from Temporary Pleasure that maybe we had too many vocals on that. And I think we were conscious of the fact that we, having done the delicacies thing, we knew we wanted to use some vocals on this, but not as many. And we honestly had no idea how we were going to use them. We're really quick at going in and making tons of instrumentals. But how to kind of integrate vocals into that, it's much more difficult. Like with, I guess on the first record, we kind of use them like synths. We kind of loop them up and run them through synths. and kind of and then on the second one because we had so many vocals and I guess because both of us were doing a lot of a lot of production for other people we did that thing of like making the vocal the centre of the track and arranging everything around it which I think made it it just made it to the vocals kind of lent too hard on those vocals and so we knew we didn't want to do that but again you know we tried we tried doing some verse chorus kind of stuff and it just didn't feel like it meshed with the instrumentals that we had and it was only when we kind of you did some verse chorus stuff on the new album no well it actually yeah i mean we just we tried we tried doing stuff we tried loads of stuff i mean you know we we wrote tons and tons of instrumentals and we tried some all sorts of different vocal things and like there was one bit where we had a vocal and we just looped a little section of it up and we were working on it and it was just like this is just we don't want the rest of it this is fine how it is and yeah that was kind of I think that was one of the turning points for us to go towards using more loopy vocals, which I suppose is a little bit there on the first record, but we'd never really gone for that kind of, you know, very hard loop that doesn't go anywhere and there's a kind of rigidity to it. So the creative process, just messing around for two months and then being like... Okay, what do we have here? Kind of, yeah. We tend to work very much from the machines in the studio. And like Joss says, we work quite quickly and do a lot. And then, you know, leave them in a pile and then come back to them later on and choose the ones we like the best out of the pile, if you know what I mean. I think in a way that kind of self-editing process, I think we were much stricter on it on this record. I think stuff that we've done in the past, maybe we've just been like... good, put it out sort of thing. Whereas I think on this one we were a bit more careful to make sure we really liked it. Coming off the delicacies things, which seemed like just get it out there, just finish it up. It must have been strange to have a similar sensibility to some of the tracks, but labour over them a long time. Yeah, I mean, the delicacies thing really was, it was because we wanted to not consider a whole album. And I think perversely, it actually all fits together quite well. But at the time the idea was, okay, we definitely don't want to make a whole body of work. And like, there's something about making an album where at the start of it, it's so broad and you're trying loads of different things. And then as you get towards the end, you really have a kind of quite a closed area to explore. And we just sort of felt like we needed some time to just try stuff out, you know, and then also in order to sort of push you forwards. to actually finish things rather than just to do them and then they just sit on your hard drive. We thought it would just be nice just to, you know, you get two or three tracks done, you play them out. If they work, boom, they're out, you know. And that kind of, that simple, like, it's like a simple win, you know, kind of weekend's worth of, sort of like a week's worth of mucking around in the studio and then boom, you've got 12, you But that said, when you're working in terms of 12s, like for the dance floor or whatever, there's a definite format for it, which I don't think necessarily translates to home listening. And I don't really necessarily think it translates to an album. And I still think an album's an interesting thing. It gives you room to do some more left-field things that maybe don't really, they're not on their own type tracks. You need to hear them within the context of the whole thing. What on the new album do you need to hear in the context of the thing? What wouldn't work on the dance? for in your mind? I mean, even something like Paridolia, like with the last track, I kind of feel like that wouldn't be, if you just started with that on its own, it doesn't necessarily make that much sense, but in the context of the whole shape of the record, it makes a lot more sense, you know? The Delicacies thing, I imagine, also came out of you guys just DJing more? Just trying, not hearing the tracks that you wanted to play all the time? It was exactly that, because, you know, we definitely play, I suppose, kind of, you know, more kind of techno and deeper stuff when we play out, and we really realised we couldn't. really play much of temporary pleasures as DJs and that was quite a kind of eye-opener because it was like hang on but you know we we started making music with this whole thing just so we could play tracks out as DJs you know I try and make a track that would fit in and no one would know that it wasn't you know someone else's track that was literally the the starting thing and So, yeah, I suppose that was the delicacies thing was just us going back to try and make tracks we'd want to play that would fit into our sets. I also, when I listen to your sets, at least mix CDs and podcasts, they're really wide-ranging, and I wonder if when you're making stuff... with the delicacies thing that you were just making tracks that could get you to other places, like bridge tracks almost, to get to give you a chance to get deeper. I think so, yeah. I don't know. I think we're kind of... We obviously set out a stall at the beginning of our process of what people expected of us, which is not necessarily what we expected of ourselves, if you know what I mean. And so I suppose the delicacies thing, to a certain extent, was us just expressing another side of ourselves. of what we do. What do people expect of you? in your mind? I mean, it varies a lot. Like, places that we DJ frequently, it's actually comparable to what we do. But places that we're not there very much, you know, obviously, like, the biggest stuff that we've done is stuff, you know, probably stuff like Hustler, which we virtually never play. Do you know what I mean? So... And so if people expect us to go along and play music from that time, they'll be pissed off. going to. But places that we DJ frequently, it's usually fine. It's just that slightly frustrating thing where one night you can play and you'll be playing with other people who play similar techno and then once in a while you go to a club and you turn up and it's like 130 BPM, brutal, screeching electro. Just like, what am I going to do with this? I do find you guys, as I said, are quite wide-ranging. It must have taken a while to train crowds a little bit in terms of what you do. I think we, which is a very double-edged sword, send out very mixed messages quite constantly. And I think, obviously, we'd probably do much better if we just sort of stuck to one thing. But, I don't know, we just literally make music that we're excited by at a particular point in time and we can't really explain it much more than that. And we don't really have a game plan in that sense. which is kind of pretty obvious by how we've kind of zigzagged around, you know. But, you know, it's kind of our journey through electronic music and what we've been excited by and inspired by to make, and it's as simple as that, really. What's been inspiring you lately? I think a lot of the British, like, stuff is really super healthy at the minute, you know. I think that new actress album is amazing. Obviously all the stuff like Blow On and Lone and all the RS stuff is brilliant. And then actually, I don't know, I think for us, some of the more, I suppose, stemming from the BBC radiophonicky stuff, we've been a lot into that kind of... you know, the motion sickness of time travel thing and the Pi Corner audio and all that kind of quite, I suppose, nerdy synth music. But loads of stuff. Do your tastes align really, really well? I mean, is it almost always, I like this, you're definitely going to like this? Or do you have secret dividing points? Not really. I mean, James and I have been making music together for a long time. And before that, we lived together for ages. So our record collections overlap considerably. Yeah, I mean, generally speaking, I think we pretty much see eye to eye on stuff. I mean, it's interesting, like recently, a lot of the stuff that we've been getting into, it sort of feels... not like it almost like links back to some of the stuff that we were into when we first got into electronic music they're kind of like warp like all that kind of like early uk electronica kind of sort of seems almost kind of feels current again um and i guess all those kind of those influences which were the things that like drew us in you know the kind of really kind of weirdy psychedelic and um like i just remember like listening to records and having absolutely no idea how any of it was made you know it was so alien to the kind of guitar music and stuff like that that we were into um and just that that's that same level of excitement of music being kind of it's like an unimaginable space you know it's this like weird sounds that don't necessarily, you just can't see how it all fits together. And I don't know, there's something about a lot of the stuff that's around at the moment. It kind of reminds me of that whole time. But having made music for as long as you guys have, I mean... at a certain point you're still hearing stuff that you're just like what the hell did they I mean often I mean I guess now you know it's not the same like now you can like listen to a record and be like oh that's probably this and I know how I'd make that but it's still the kind of the emotion of that I think there was like there was a time when I suppose when we were getting more and more into DJing where we were looking for music that was like maybe more aggressive and more pushy, you know, whereas I guess we're kind of like, particularly now we're playing like much later slots. Um, like we're kind of trying to like play like the end slot. So you can kind of like, you know, like DJ to keep people dancing for a bit and then just weird out at the end. And so you're looking for those records that like maybe, um, like stuff. off that you can like mix in and then like kind of like really kind of freak out at some point and I kind of feel like you know a lot of the kind of the Ortega stuff that you listen to it's kind of you can tell it's like functional kind of bassy music but then it just like goes completely absolutely noodles somewhere in it you know And I sort of feel like there's a lot of that in music at the moment, but not necessarily that bedroom-y. It's stuff that you can actually play, but has this real weird psychedelic edge to it. I think a lot of producers are making it with that in mind, sort of, and now they all have. been on dance floors and it's been regularized when the fruit was first coming around obviously it was sort of like obviously there were dances but it wasn't quite as uh we know what works yeah exactly in a way that we do now and it's something that um something that because it's that format that you have like a very normalizing thing like for an electronic record where there's this much intro and then it comes in and it ticks along a bit there's a breakdown and it all comes back in again and it's something that actually made things easier on the delicacies record because we knew we were making it to play out and so there was almost like a kind of a structure to either rail against or to engage with. which we, to a large extent, didn't have on the Unpatterned's record because we were trying not to make it, you know, a lot of them we've actually realised are a pain to mix. Because they don't follow that format, you know. There's nothing to kind of, like, help you mix through the start. And those formats sometimes can be really helpful, but equally, they're boring. You know, they make music sound more and more similar. And, you know, like, I think a good example of, like, you listen to some of the Daphne stuff. It's really weird sounding. And, like, when you mix it in, it's, like, sometimes it's just like, ah It doesn't... change some of the stuff on but like They're so they're so they're so interesting sounding records and they're so good that you just don't care you play them anyway, you know and so I kind of feel like that side of it where people maybe are like pushing away from this kind of very rigid formatting that has kind of almost subconsciously been pushed on people just by like if you do it like this people will play it because these two mix and if you have a thing here, then people will play it because it works. It's also just ingrained. Yeah, of course. As well, as you said, you just sort of like have these structures that you can work with or work against. Did you come to a certain machine quite a bit for this new album? I know you guys are really into gear, but was there one thing over another that was very... I think we did most of it on like about three or four machines really. And we tried to not do programming from a computer much. So it was mainly like 808 actually was like the... for a lot of it and then we'd take triggers out of that to trigger sequences and there's like a big modular thing that Jass is building which looks like a wardrobe like hand hand kit built thing which is a bit of a still building untameable beast yeah it's one of those things that he'll you know you see those old guys who kind of go mad from solder and they have a ponytail and sit on forums all day and i think that's what jess has got in store for him later down the line it's not that long i'm working on it i'm working on it i mean that's the thing though with modular stuff that it's never done. And then as soon as you've only got a few spaces left, you get a bit like, I need another cab. It's a disease, really. It is. But the nice thing about it is that you get one or two new things in. there and then it's like like with a like with your record box if you go out and you don't have anything new like jesus these records again but like you put five or six new tunes in there and it casts all the other things in a different light and they all it somehow will fit together differently and it's exciting again and it's the same thing you just put like one extra module in there and that then relates to everything else in a completely different way and As James said, with the 808 being like a clock, a lot of what we did was just like you build like a kind of a system. You kind of build like a weird little algorithm and then you just play around with it for a bit and then either you've got something that you like and you record it or you don't. You go and get a coffee and start again. As well, it was like trying to simplify the palette a bit as well. Just trying to have like... With the modulars. Well, yes, you know, but, you know, modular, we count that as one thing. But, you know, like, we didn't really, apart from the vocals, we didn't use any samples, and we never really do. And it was, you know, drum machine-wise, it was probably 808 and 909. You know, the odd bit of drum tracks or something else like that. And then there was Juno and an ARP 2600, and that was pretty much everything, apart from some effects pedals and stuff. But I don't know, just because I think that thing of having a limitation in a system, of not opening up to being able to do anything, importing sounds from... you know, Ableton or, you know, all of those millions, myriad programs you can have now. I think that gets confusing, you know, and I think to just be able to have the one system and get the best out of it you can, I think is more powerful than just... you get lost in the mire of decisions otherwise. Are there any synths that you've jettisoned along the way that you use and you just can't hear that anymore? Or use that? I don't use the MS-20 much anymore. No, it's true. Although, yeah, it's one of those, like sometimes you just don't go back to stuff that much. Like when we started, we used the MS-20 loads and there's a couple of tracks that it got used on. Oh, maybe. There's one track where we rooted, we had all the synths in the studio going all simultaneously and then we rooted them all through the MS-20, which is a slightly stupid thing to do. But yeah, I mean, I guess it's one of those, like, there's so much to get into, just on, you know, even just like, just the ARP 2600, honestly, you could make stacks of records with just that. There's so much in there that, you know, you're scratching the surface, even doing a couple of records on it. And sometimes, yeah, like, as you get further in. you sort of feel like you just want to keep going with that synth, you know, and that's not to say that, like, you couldn't do the same thing on the MS-20, you know. It's just that it's there. I wanted to talk a little bit more about the modular because I find it really interesting, especially lately. It seems like it's become a thing. A lot of people have it. Has the price point gone down for certain things on it? It's just got easier. Okay. Like when we first started getting into it. It was, I mean, you know, it's not like they were like super rare or anything. You could still get those, you know, those Dofra and analog systems. But like now it's so much choice. There's tons and tons of manufacturers. And it's just, it's really easy. You just get one case and like particularly like the little Eurorack stuff. It's like, they're like guitar pedals in terms of cost. You just, you know, it's the same. You see those board like this big they all started out with like five they were like i just need one more chorus pedal i just need one more delay you know and like and the thing is you buy that new delay pedal and you get three tracks out of it done it's well worth it you know it's like it's just something to kind of get you sparked off um and like james says though it is a bit of a sickness you end up like the dude with the ponytail and the house all filled with wires and girls won't talk to you and all that stuff. But yeah, like... What do you, I mean, aside from the freedom it gives you, which I think is the thing that people say, what else is so appealing and especially to other producers right now, I think, what is, why is modular? It's very, like it's just the right amount of granularity in terms of you can basically build yourself a custom synth in about half an hour. So you're not talking about down to like a resistor level. You're talking about, you know, just the basic component parts. And you have a degree of flexibility with a hardwired synth, but you can't do that thing of like, I wonder if I put a... And then the other thing, you can put other parts of the studio, you can strap them in the middle, put a pedal halfway through the... the flow of the synth. And so that's, it's just about the right amount of time before you kind of like, this is boring now. I need it to make some sound. So it's just like, it's, there's enough, there's enough Legoness to it that you can like make something cool, but you don't have to spend a whole day making it. And that, that's really nice because particularly with electronic stuff. It's very sound-based. It's a very sonic medium. I'm not saying that other music isn't... that it's not important, but sometimes when you actually... There's almost no notes in some of it. It's just pure timbre and pure sound. And so with that being so integral, like building your own kind of custom little sound maker is perfect for making electronic music. You use it live, right? Yeah. Is it tough to play? We use... We send it MIDI, but then there's a sequencer by which you can modulate the MIDI, and obviously you can modulate all the parameters, the effects, and the filters, and all that sort of stuff. So we've kind of got it to a midpoint where... it's usable in a live situation where there's strobes and it's very loud and stuff. And you roughly know what, you know, we generally have a system set up so you know what knob is going to do what, you know, it doesn't change that much. But still, it can fly off the handle if you're not careful. Like this, this is my cheat sheet. No, not this one. This is my cheat sheet and it's like just pages of do like unplug this, plug that into there. And especially tonight with your name. That's for tonight, yeah. And that's the thing is that like as you like, so for tonight we're kind of breaking away from. essentially like a system that's been evolving for ages and we've got kind of really good at it where it was really you'd kind of really intuitively know where you were going and a lot of the time as he says the strobes are going and you kind of can't see what you're doing so you're having to sort of patch kind of by feel and stuff like that and I think we kind of forgotten how much we'd learned on that. So yeah, it's like, it is really nerve wracking, but you know, it's kind of the alternative is, you know, you press the space bar, you just let it run. One thing I saw you in New York, like four years ago, four or five years ago, and I was really struck by how much work you seem to be doing at the very least. I don't know how much, you know, everything means, but it just looked nice to see people on stage, like, incredibly running around doing something. It's all, you know, all the machines are doing. things, you know, like the basses and the leads and the poly and, you know, it's all real machines making that noise. Plus it's through a desk with like a weird matrix of effects that go to quite odd places once you... route a few things to a few things if you know what I mean and then all the structures are up for grabs as well you know the structures of the songs can change you know sections lengthen and shorten or get skipped out or you know so it is very flexible which you know we really wanted it to be you know because otherwise I don't see much point in a live show. I think all the stuff that you go and see that you really liked were the ones where you'd go and see them and one time they were a bit shit and the next time they blew your mind. Because it's kind of the... It gives a bit of... You can tell there's a freedom within the music. Yeah, it's light. And so, yeah, we wanted to try and get as much of that into an electronic show as we could, really. And the technology is there a lot more now than it ever has been to make that possible, especially back in the days where... you know, people having to play off darts and that kind of thing. You know, it was much more difficult to kind of create a fluid live show, but now there's no excuse not to, really. Was that always the case when you guys started out doing live shows? I mean, or did you come to that position of, man, we have to get away from a laptop? No, that was integral right from the start. Like, I remember when we were talking about doing a live show. And, I mean, we come from a background of, you know, being in bands and stuff like that. So we did kind of have... We did talk about, you know, basically, I mean, I guess it would have been like a backing track and us playing stuff over the top. And it just didn't feel like it was how we worked. And then we actually looked at the studio and we were like, this is portable. Like, it's a desk, it's a bunch of synths and drum machines and effects. This is, we can take this on the road. And so we were like watching other live shows. Who were you watching? That was actually an inspiration? A real inspiration was Jamie Liddell, who's someone that we've followed for ages, back from Super Collider. And his show is exactly what you were saying. Or was, I'm not sure what it is. Yeah, I mean, I haven't seen him play that recently, actually. But when he was doing, I mean, he had like... I did that weird kind of looping delay max patch and an MS-20 and a desk and a bunch of random stuff around him. And it would go wrong a lot. I saw it like everything crashed. And sometimes it bombed. But sometimes it was so, so... good and it made me want to see him every time and then I remember going to see I won't name any names but some electronic things and the first time I saw it I was like Jesus that's so good that's amazing and then I saw it again I was like they must be brilliant at it because it was identical and yeah, I don't know, like, it really felt kind of dead. And so, you know, like, the way we recorded, even the first record, the way we recorded it, it's a desk, it's synths and all that kind of stuff. It was just, and I suppose we were just around at that time, as James said, where it was possible to not have to just run an ADAT and make some wiggly noise over the top, you know. You could run a computer and, like, trigger different sections and that this this flexibility was available um and so i guess we were kind of fortunate that we were like building building the live show at that time that right from the off it was kind of it was like a jam-based kind of To be honest, we still use a computer, so there's still an imposable structure there. We still have some control over it. I think in an ideal world, we'd... pull the rug and actually just do it without any of that. So what's stopping you? You can't do vocals, can you? You can't. Well, I suppose you could. It's just the amount of programming and stuff it would be. But I think it would have to be a very, very different type of show than we're doing at the minute. Yeah. And starting again and we just, yeah, we just didn't do it this time. Because we were talking about it and we were just like, is that a little bit like in Spinal Tap where they have the capes? We have our new live show. It's ten hours long. I mean, like, because it's actually, like, the way, so the way we record is we do these kind of, like, half an hour, 40 minute jams. But then we edit them down. And you can't edit it down for people. You can't edit that time out. And, like. For us, we're happy to listen to a single track's 100 variations over 40 minutes. Maybe you should just do a week-long residency in a city and just be like, tonight we're going to do this song. But even with the setup now, we could play the same song for the whole set and change it enough so it would feel like different songs. There is a lot of malleability in there. It's just, yeah, I suppose it's just the balls to do it, isn't it? Yeah. What is the new live show looking like? I mean, you're going to do it tonight sans new visuals, but... There's a lot of new stuff in this one that you haven't done before. Yeah, well there's a lot of the new material. We're not playing very much of the old material at all. We're kind of, we're hinting at it by using some acapellas and stuff as much as we can just because... You've got to get those hands in the air. Well, you know... Especially at a big festival like Sonar, you know, it almost seems churlish not to. Do you know what I mean? It seems a bit like, I don't know. Anyway, but yeah, but it is going to be a very different set than we've ever played. You know, for us, it's totally new structure and, you know, order. a lot of songs we will have never played before so yeah we're bricking it basically. I mean I feel like in terms of like the balance which I guess you're hinting at like it's something that we have we've kind of learnt through DJing that when we started DJing we were incredibly unfriendly DJs if we were playing in a techno place we'd be playing like Sun Ra records and Eden Arbets and stuff like that and you know if we were playing it like in a bar we'd be playing Drexia and you know and you kind of realise that there needs to be a bit of give and take otherwise there's no connection at all. And you sort of have to take on board the fact that a lot of the people that come along are not going to have heard. They wouldn't have no idea about Delicacies. That was just slipped out onto the radar and they probably won't have heard the new record either. And so it's somehow trying to make sense of the whole thing without it just becoming a total dog's dinner. Yeah, it's a tough one, especially with... hits as big as the ones that you've had it must be tough to figure out how to balance that put it in a context that is okay enough for you to be doing it but also pleasing some portion of the crowd yeah but you know I think that's that's a balance that you strike every time you go out DJing or you know and it's one of those things that you kind of just learn from doing the shows you know you kind of And to a certain extent you feel from the crowd because it's not set. If we're going in there and we're playing and we're like, we don't need to play vocals now. These people, they're fine. We can just play it without them. We just pull them down on the mixer. Done. But often you're there and you can just see girls in the front row and they're like, Jesus Christ, are you going to play anything that we know? Aside from Sonar, which you basically don't have the entire live show ready, you'd like so much to come and play here. Where else are you really enjoying playing these days? It really differs from gig to gig with us. Like you mentioned before, we get quite a wide variety of gigs. Especially in America, it runs the gamut from brilliant to shocking. You're in a very strange position in America, I imagine, right now as well with all these festivals emerging. Exactly. I suppose in some people's minds we kind of fit into the dreaded EDM term, do you know what I mean? But we've worked as hard as we can to run in the opposite direction, honestly. I think, yeah, you know, it's different from gig to gig, you know, but that's part of what I like about the DJing thing is you know, it's partly about, you know, your kind of thing about DJing, but it's largely about you adapting to the room and to the crowd and joining the dots between the DJ before and the DJ after and getting the shape of the whole night and trying to get all of those balances and factors right, I think is challenging and interesting on a daily basis, you know, so. Yeah, I don't know. Favourite places to play? I mean, it would have to be like individual clubs. Do you know what I mean? So what's the best club in the world right now? Best club in the world? You know what, perversely, I've got to say, one of the best ones that we've done was We Love. Yeah. And we were massively resistant, so we looked like out in Ibiza. In Ibiza, yeah. So we were hugely resistant to going out there because we weren't around for the whole kind of like when Ibiza was like super cool and underground. And so when we kind of got into electronic music, Ibiza was like a complete no-no. It was like, from what we knew of it, it was like, it was evil commercial music. You know, that nasty dance business. And so they were like, oh, come out and play. And so we got out there and realized we're playing with Carl Craig and Paul Wolford, which is like sold straight off. It's like an amazing sound system. Like the crowd out there, like we're really knowledgeable. We were totally wrong, you know? But yeah, I mean, there's tons of places. Glasgow's always brilliant. Yes. They're like... mainly with the like you know people like Optima I think that you know like one club can school a whole city and continues to school yeah you know generation after generation and you know I think that Glasgow are a great mix of mental and clued up which is kind of all you ever Yeah, like, I guess, comparable in the States, like, playing in Philly. Yeah. It's just that thing where, like, it's a wild party, but you don't have to play obvious stuff. And, honestly, anywhere that you can play where it's, like, you have that balance of it actually being a fun party, but it not being, like, a commercial. boring, straight down the line thing, that's a good party, right? You know, like honestly, it's not guaranteed every time anywhere you go. It's kind of, it's who else is playing, it's like, it's all the same. I think you were saying about live shows, you want it to be different because if it was always good, it wouldn't be good anymore. Yeah, yeah. Are you guys doing any production for anyone these days? Actually, at this particular point in time, no. And that was like a conscious decision just to take a step out of the production thing. We were, you know, I think a thing that maybe had a fairly detrimental effect on like past records was the fact of trying to juggle. you know, three or four albums for other people at the same time as doing your own one. And so you just kind of settle for, you know, like making music with jazz is really fun and easy. And so it's like, oh, you know, that's great. This works, you know, sort of thing. Whereas, so on this album, we decided to actually take a step out of production, both of us, and have just been doing this, and it's actually been really fun and a lot more rewarding, you know. You said it had a... ...metrametral effect on past records. Do you mean temporary? Yeah, at that particular point in time, yeah. I find it very interesting. I don't often find artists who seem to pretty publicly express an amount of regret about an album. It's very unprofessional. As much as I... You shouldn't do it. It just seems like everything I've read with you guys kind of just hinted at... around like, yeah, it wasn't quite... It's really frustrating actually because I think there's some really good stuff on there, but I think there's a lot of our worst stuff on there. And it's purely, like as James said, we were just busy. And it's like, yeah, this is great. Cool, we're done. And I kind of feel like if we'd had another four months to just, you know, like... have a bit of space from it and then come back to it it could have been a much much better record and that's annoying because it's out there now like not only can we not do it but we can't be bothered but like It's not just the time, but it's also kind of like a headspace thing, just in terms of when you're producing someone else, in the back of your head you've got this thing of not putting yourself into something, of trying to focus in what they have. Whereas when you're making your own record, that's not there. It's just a different dynamic. And I think it's surprisingly difficult to swap those hats. And I think that you can hear us thinking like producers on Temporary Pleasure because of the way that we're taking each of those people and trying to make... them sound as good as possible rather than being maybe more cruel to their vocals and like chopping them up and giving them less respect it's a featuring blah blah blah exactly yeah yeah and you know we kind of we weren't pushed into that that's what we wanted you know like that that wasn't something that they asked for. I'm sure it was a very interesting sort of problem to solve. Like, how can we do this? Yeah, it was. It was almost harder for us. Our default is to make... you know, instrumental dance music, you know, that, like, it's actually harder for us to try and, you know, incorporate vocals and work with people like that. It's kind of more out of our comfort zone. And we thought that was kind of more exciting, you know, at that particular point in time. Do you think you'll ever come back to it and try again to see if you can do it in a way that... Yeah. I mean, I think to a lesser extent, I think the collaboration we did with Beth kind of lived in that world. Obviously... Her EP, you said? Yeah, her EP, yeah. And I think it's a dangerous area when you start putting vocals in, particularly songy kind of vocals with electronic stuff, because if you've got a band, you've got a format there. Band, vocals... called done. If you're making electronic stuff, you're in that world. And when you start mixing them together, you can go an awful long way wrong. And I think we have gone an awful long way wrong from time to time. But I think there's like a, I think it's worth having a try. You know, it's like some of the things that I feel are like really strong. I think, you know, a good example would be like LCD sound system. Like somehow they've managed to not go wrong, but like it's like an electronic aesthetic, but with vocals and it's kind of, there's a lot about it that I really like. And I feel like it's got a real kind of identity and longevity in a way that maybe some tracky stuff you like it you move on you know like I don't feel that's the case often like when you get it right with vocals I think you get it more right sorry to sort of end on a more positive note what's the best record you feel like you guys have made what is the highest high in your mind highest high like whole record particular one track do you mean yeah one tune that's like What's the one you're most proud of? And sort of you pulled it off in a way. One true faith. Which is the one true faith? I don't know, it's quite weird actually because in this new live show we've been going back to the first album and trying to incorporate some of that and we actually opened up some of the sessions and there's a track called Wooden that we've got a new version of that, you know, it sounds remarkably similar to what we would do now, you know. And I think in that same way, I think my favourite track that we've done is probably Sleep Deprivation, just because we can still play it when we DJ now, but it... kind of fits into that first album well. I just think, you know, it'd obviously be easy to pick a new track because we're more excited about them, but trying to look on a longer view, I would say. What was so similar about Wooden in the way that you constructed it when you opened it up? Why was that surprising to you? I think it's that kind of like... warpy kind of sound to it. It's really kind of, I mean, you know, it's kind of that like Raymond Scott-y, very early kind of synth pioneer kind of vibe. that I guess we're still chasing now. And yeah, we got there then and we got back there. It's got that kind of, I mean, it's really simple. It's just like a kind of like a weird, like blippy little synth line and it kind of like... just like shifts around in a kind of kind of pleasing way and like I think it I guess it's to a certain extent it was made in a very similar way you know it's like a it was like a kind of a synth jam um and we like
