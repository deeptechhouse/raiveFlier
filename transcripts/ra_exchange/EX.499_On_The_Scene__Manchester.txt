Thank you. Hello and welcome to On The Scene, RA's city-focused podcast shining light on electronic music communities across the world. Each month, three individuals will tell us three things about their city's scene. Capturing an entire vibrant dance music community in just one podcast is of course no small task. but we hope to shine a light on these incredible scenes and transport you across the globe through your headphones. My name is Martha and I am a podcast producer and presenter at Reset Advisor. This week we're in Manchester, coming to you from the wonderful School of Electronic Music here, and I'm joined by my trio of Manchester insiders, Sophia Raisin, DJ and RA contributor, and writer. Hi, Sophia. Hi. Tracy, who goes by the DJ name Abina, and is co-founder of the Manchester-based collective All Hands on Deck. Hello. Hi, you're right. And Joe, Synchro, producer, DJ, and founder of SK1 Record Shop in Stockport. You're right. Thanks, everyone, for being here. And thank you for bringing us into Manchester's music scene. Very much looking forward to hearing all about what has been going on lately. So the three things that each of you will be sharing today are a party that you've attended in the city in the past month, a piece of music you've listened to recently that is somehow related to the city. and one other thing that you want to spotlight about your local scene so that could be a record shop a venue or a person so let's start with your raving experiences over the past few weeks then Sophia, would you be up for getting us started? Of course. What's been a key dance floor moment for you lately? So I think a standout night for me over the past few weeks was the White Hotel New Year's Eve party, which I was fortunate enough to be on the lineup for. What I really like... about the White Hotel specifically, but also about the wider Manchester scene, as I'm sure we'll make very obvious throughout this podcast, is that community is a massive thing. The lineup was mostly local people. So it's myself, Annabelle Fraser, who's another NTS resident, who's amazing. Hesker from Castles in the Sky. Connor Thomas and Saar from P13 and then we had Proteus from London come up for that. But it was a really nice mix of different sounds. And yeah, it just felt like a real good community party. And there wasn't a headliner for that as well, which I thought was really cool. Everyone just played and enjoyed each other's sounds. Wicked. Tracy? So a night I've been to this month, I actually haven't been going out that much because I'm broke. And I'm also quite tired. Broken tired. Broken tired, a big mood. But somewhere where I've been is White Hotel as well. And that was also for a night where I was playing. And it was the Tom Boogism night, called Boogism. And some members from my collective were playing, including Anna. who goes by the name of Anna and Rosa, who goes by the name of Babs. And it was just a really, really good night because Tom, for starters, is like a really, really good selector. And if you haven't listened to him before, check out his NTS show. It's brilliant. And Anna and Rosa were playing like such great music. as well and the energy in the venue was like the one. So yeah, that was definitely memorable for me. Would you tell us a bit more about your collective and what you guys do? Yeah, sure. So my collective's called All Hands on Deck. And what we do is that we run open deck nights and just general parties and DJ workshops for people who identify as women, trans or non-binary. And we came up with the idea a couple of years ago, inspired by one Bristol called Mixed Nights, who do like something similar as well. And then we thought we'd bring it to Manchester. weirdly blown up but it's it's really nice we've built like a nice little community as well and we always say that anyone that plays at our open deck parties can like immediately join the collective and it doesn't really matter what level of skill you have as long as you like have tunes you're fine you're in the gang so yeah that's us lovely uh joe uh I was going to say something at the White Hotel as well, but you beat me to it. Is this a... very important venue around here then yeah it's a good space yeah definitely but um another good spot is soup kitchen um me and my mates put on a night last month with uh christoph de babylon he was he was headlining and then it was just basically us lot just doing support like We had a little dub siren and a space echo and it was just like, it was a pretty like dank, moody vibes in there, but it was good, like really good. But yeah, Soup's definitely another good spot in Manchester for underground music. So do you prefer smaller venues? I mean, a lot of people that ask about Manchester's nightlife are going to be thinking about the Warehouse Project. Yeah, yeah. But you like it in the small rooms? Yeah, definitely, yeah. Like small, little, vibey rooms. I mean, obviously, it's always good to go to a big warehouse party and stuff, but I always prefer the energy in smaller venues. It's a bit more personal. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, it's good. How do you guys think the energy in Manchester's nightlife scene changes when Warehouse Project is on or not on? it changes that much I mean I feel like a lot of big acts will play at warehouse projects and stuff but I guess the flip side of it is that most of your mates that end up playing in like the tiny venues and stuff so even if there's something happening you know during warehouse project people will still be playing at soup kitchen white hotel or partisan which is down the road as well um and they're always really really good nights and they're a lot cheaper so It makes it easier to go to that as well. But it doesn't really change much. I don't know what everyone else thinks. Yeah, I think the thing with Warehouse is because it is so massive, people come from all over the country for it. People come from further afield. I personally wouldn't really describe it as a Manchester party. It's just a party that happens to be in Manchester. so I don't think there's ever really much change with the smaller venues say Partizan, Soup Kitchen, White Hotel because those people who are going there probably wouldn't even be at Warehouse Project anyway unless it was like some outrageous line up which don't get me wrong of course they have but yeah I don't think it changes too much I don't think so at all no and even if it does like because we have again white hotel even if people go to warehouse project they'll be like oh right okay it's only four o'clock now let's go white hotel which finishes at eight so you can just keep on rotating between all these venues all the time yeah Okay, so no one misses out. So guys, I would love for you to talk me through your normal slash dream night out in Manchester. Tracy, would you be up for going first? Sure. You know what, I'll use an example of a really, really great night out that I went to last year, actually, and it was with Strange Rhythms. which is a collective based in Manchester. Chris from Limbo's in it, but people like Craig and I don't know their DJ names, but James and Henzo. Henzo and Hans. Henzo, Hans. And Hans. You know who you are. You know what I mean? Strange rhythms, brilliant crew. And it was, I think it was when Hagen was playing and someone... based in Leeds as well they're part of a collective that do similar stuff like All Hands on Deck they're called Equalizer and Tammy is part of them and she was playing there too and the whole night was just brilliant like it was like what three to five pounds to get in for starts which like I'm a student that's brilliant um and like we were just dancing the whole night and then afterwards we just went to like the most beautiful afters because it was at Chris's old place And it was the last time that we could have a party there. And it was just ideal, like really, really good energy, good vibes, good people like Henrietta Afro-Deutsche, Tom Boogism and her part. they were all there and it was just beautiful and I think every single time I've got those night outs where I don't really intend on going but they end up being cheap and they're right there and all your mates are there they always end up having a great afters too and I think I think the morale of the story is that my ideal night out ends with an afters okay so there's a big afters culture here yeah for sure for sure interesting Sophia dream night out Hmm. So trying to think. Generally, I think in Manchester, something to be aware of is that people are really skint. So if it's if it comes to like a pre situation, you won't go to a pub, you won't meet a bar, you'll sit in your mate's living room somewhere and then go out to the party and then you come back for like an afters that will last days. Yeah, I think I just back what Tracy says, really. Like, those afters moments are really special. When Limbo Radio was run out of the house, that was, like, particularly good for afters. you'd have like a full set up. Sometimes you'd just be like broadcasting at like six in the morning or probably a lot later. And then you'd like see like, oh, there's like one person listening. And I remember my friend Bink, who DJs as Prowa. She's amazing. I had her on my NTS show once, but she also used to be a Limbo resident. I think she was like their first ever resident. Actually, like she's wicked. she was like dressed as a sort of sea captain and emceeing like, like, yeah, stupid o'clock in the morning. And then we looked and we were like. oh no there's actually like five people listening to this afters of like think just like chatting rubbish um but yeah it's very like i'd say that going out in manchester can be very like silly but in like a nice way um there's no pretense about it and i think that is consistent across the whole night. So like in the club, at the afters, at the pre's, like, you know, people don't take themselves seriously. Like I'm from London. So I have only ever really like. been out in like London and Manchester so it's all I can compare it to but yeah I'd say like Manchester is way more relaxed um yeah generally you just be at a club until like eight in the morning go back to your mates be there until eight in the morning the next day probably have like loads of outfit changes and stuff like like in in between a nice shower yeah yeah yeah probably like a mid mid after the shower or something But yeah, I'd say that's probably what going out feels like up here. Okay. Joe, how is it adding the additional stockport section to your night out? It's good. It's good for warm-ups. We had one recently in December and there was a finders keepers party at the plant shop so Doug Shipton and Andy Votel and Benjamin Hatton and loads of big crate digger dudes were playing records at the plant shop and my mate Wineboy who's got a natural wine store in the marketplace in Stockport. He brought a good few crates of natural wine down. So this is like six o'clock, do you know what I mean? And then everyone's swigging the wine. And then train into town after that, go for one in soup, meet a bunch of heads, and then go on to the White Hotel. Project 13 with Mika Levy, Andy Stott and Demdike Stare who absolutely killed it. Sean and Miles just destroyed it. And then back to Stockport, back to the flat. keep it going until the early hours there's one thing I'm learning about how you get down in Manchester is like requires stamina yeah definitely but we're used to it because it's so cold up here anyway I mean it warms you up that's it it's just you're saving energy through it to be honest better gas bills let's move on to the pieces of music that you've all decided to share with us. Tracey, what have you brought along? So one piece of music that I've been listening to is a track from the new Joe Orbison EP, which I'm frantically scrolling on my phone for. It's called Burn and it features Infinite and Mansur Brown. And it has like this really nice bassy burial sound in it. And I feel like even though Burial is like London based and stuff like that, it still has like that really industrial edge that describes Manchester really well. And one thing that's really great about Manchester is that it's really flat. So you can literally walk everywhere. And I just really love walking to this song because it just energizes me. And it just also reminds me of just like. I don't know, nights that I spent with like mates and stuff in their living room, just listening to tunes and having a really nice relaxing time, which I do a lot. So yeah, that's the main track. Again. Joe, a piece of music that you want to share with us. It's something, it's one of the tracks from my recent album on Apollo Records, but I got one of my favourite producers from Manchester to do a remix on the remix EP, Claro Intellecto. He's like a kind of godfather of Manchester techno. He's like, you know... a lot of early releases on Modern Love, some of the early Modern Love releases, and also labels like Delson and stuff. He's put out some really good stuff, but he's definitely a producer that I look up to that comes... from Manchester and the whole crew like the Modern Love guys you know Demdike Stare and you know Andy Stark people like that it's like yeah it's some of my favourite music to come out of Manchester And what were you listening to when you first started producing music? All sorts a lot of dub and reggae to be honest like But I kind of came up through the dubstep movement, but then kind of moved away from it as it was getting a bit too aggy. But yeah, yeah. But there was a lot of good music at that time. Like the Modern Love guys kind of were a big part in me changing direction, do you know what I mean? Because they were doing like stuff that was on the fringes of dubstep but was much more techno orientated. Yeah, and it kind of switched up my vibe after hearing what they were doing. Do you know what I mean? And because they were from Manchester as well, it was like, it felt like a logical progression from... what I was doing with the dubstep stuff which was really like a London thing do you know what I mean but I feel like they took elements of stuff and kind of really gave it a sound that I feel when you hear it like I can hear Manchester in that sound do you know what I mean so yeah And is that the kind of thing that you stock at SK1? Yeah, yeah. We stock all sorts at the record shop, but yeah, we've definitely got some good Manchester tech now. You need a section. I've thought about it, yeah, definitely. There's enough of it. And what's it like being in Stockport? So for those that don't know, as I found out today on the way here, Stockport is well near. Yeah, it's like 10 minutes on the train and there's a big bridge in Stockport that when it was built, the deal was every train coming out of Manchester has to stop at Stockport. So there's a benefit with that. It's pretty easy. Nearly every train leaving Manchester you can jump on and it'll stop at Stockport. It's not as built up as Manchester. It's got more of a town vibe to it. It's not really a city. It's an old marketplace and stuff like that. So it's quite picturesque. But there's still an appetite for buying music in physical form. Oh yeah, definitely. There's a big history in Stockport because the Strawberry Studios, which was one of the most famous studios in the North West really, recorded things like Joy Division. Even bands like ESG recorded there, 10cc, Godley and Krem, they were basically like the in-house musicians. So there's a lot of history in Stockport with music and a lot of locals that are still into vinyl, so you come across good collections of just more obscure stuff. you know like proggy stuff and like psyche stuff and library music and all sorts like yeah it's wicked so for anyone living in manchester who hasn't been to sk1 yet it's only one stop away Thank you. Sophia, what have you brought to show with us? So yeah, the track that I selected to talk about today is it's called Wiggle That Thing and it's by a guy called Terry Perez it's currently unreleased but you can still find it online it's on YouTube and the only way you can find it is by watching a live performance of Terry performing in the loft space at a club called Hidden for people as well who have never heard of Terry. He's actually a carpenter and that's where his studio is. And he makes this amazing, these sort of acid-y instrumentals that are very hoods-up sort of vibe. But then he sort of shouts over them with a delay on. And it just reminded me a lot of a duo called Suicide. I'm not sure if people know, but... Yeah, like Alan Vega. And I can't remember the name of the other guy in Suicide, so I'm really sorry. But Alan Vega and someone else. And they, I believe they're from New York or something like in the late 70s, used to make like... really electronic post-punk and that's pretty much what Terry's music sounds like um yeah and he's collaborated a lot with like Rough Doug um Randy Marsh as well so yeah I think that's like a very exciting sound that I've not really heard represented in modern dance music at all uh so yeah that's why I selected that. And how did you come across this? So I used to be a resident on a radio station called Limbo Radio. Shouts out to Limbo. Is that based in Manchester? Yeah. So that's a completely DIY community radio station. It was ran out of just their front room up until like, what, eight months ago. Yeah, something like that. And now they've got... permanent studio space right opposite Terry's studio in Hidden and he used to come in like you know with his brews and just chat and then one day I think yeah like Rough Doug was recording him performing his track and Chris who runs the station shout out to you so nice he's also a wicked DJ plays like 140 and stuff really good Chris was like walking through and like saw them recording it and basically texted me was like oh my god you're going to be obsessed with this and then as soon as it was on YouTube Yeah, they sent me the link over. I think he might have something forthcoming on rough cuts, but that's currently unconfirmed. Just from your detective. Yeah. So you mentioned radio. in Manchester. So Limbo, I've not heard of. I'm very curious to hear about that because I love radio stations. And there's also NTS Manchester. Do you guys play on that often? Yeah, so I'm a monthly resident on NTS Manchester. I've been a resident for like a year and a half, like coming up to two years. Tracy, you've done some guest shows as well. Yeah, I've played a couple of times. I played with Tom Boogism in the summer. And then my collective also played like a little show, which was really fun to do as well. It's a really nice studio too, like lots of open space and comfy sofas. How important would you say radio stations are to Manchester's music scene? I'd say incredibly important. I have only kind of gotten into the scene over the past few years, but I feel that if it wasn't for radio, I wouldn't feel as comfortable as I do right now. There used to be a radio station called MCR Live where I had a residency and they were really supportive in like letting me try things out and like doing lots of mistakes on air. and Chris from Limbo has been super, super helpful as well. And the space that they currently have is like so relaxing. And if it wasn't for radio, I wouldn't be able to like feel more comfortable, be more happy about making mixes and be able to like share that knowledge with people that are part of the collective as well. Because we run a lot of our workshops at Limbo and we also have like practice sessions. So it kind of... I think radio ends up being a route for people to figure out new music, new people, different scenes. It's kind of built a really lovely music community in Manchester, I think. I think that if it wasn't for NTS and all the other radio stations like Limbo, the scene wouldn't be as tight-knit as it is right now. I love to hear it. Okay, well, this one's up to you guys. It could literally be anything at all. Joe, what have you brought as your kind of third, your wildcard piece? I don't know. I was just going to like big up Stockport in general. Stockport is a big... No. Tell us more. It's just, I don't know, there's definitely something happening there. We opened the shop maybe a year and a half ago, but then there's loads of other independents, like magazine shops, like Rare Mags, Plant Shop, loads of bars. Another record shop's just opened around the corner, All Night Flight as well. There's an old school record shop that's up the road from us as well. It's been there for like 20 odd years. So there's like three good spots and loads of charity shops. So it's like a really good spot for digging. But yeah, there's kind of like a really small scene building there because we put nights on at our shop. Tom does little things at all night flight the plant shop does things you know and it's I organised a festival last year with you know we got loads of people coming through like Graham Massey from 808 State played live Neo Tantric which is like Jane Weaver, Andy Votel and Sean Canty John Kay did a DJ set in an old Topshop building in the precinct that was like pretty trippy but yeah yeah it's just you know There's definitely something happening there and it's cheaper than a lot of spots out, you know, around Manchester, you know, so it's like Reddish and places like that, Levensham, it's like the city's kind of just getting bigger, do you know what I mean? Stockport's like the next spot, I reckon. what could be a good little scene. Heard it here first. So was that Stockport's first music festival? Stockport's first obscure electronic, very avant-garde music festival, yeah. Like I said, Stockport's kind of got this old 70s-style shopping precinct and a lot of the big... you know, big names have left. So there's like loads of like, it's basically just like a dying shopping precinct in a way, but, um, We managed to get what was a massive top shop. We got that for two weeks and we put an art exhibition in there with people like Mr Penfold, John Powell Jones, Andy Votel did some pieces. Andy Votel's dad gave us some pieces. The head of Stockport College Art Department, Ian Parkin, he gave us some stuff. Yeah, it was pretty surreal. And we did like a few things in there. Like I said, we did a night with John Kay and Sam from Soup Kitchen, who DJs under the name Heron. But yeah, it was a vibe. We're going to do it again this year as well. We're in the process of planning what we're going to do this year. And hopefully it's just going to be bigger and better. Sick. What's the name of the festival? SK1 Festival just keeping it simple just postcode it's like yeah Love that. So Stockport, basically, that's what we need to know. Okay, thank you, Joe. Tracy. So my wildcard that I've brought with me is a venue and a community space where I volunteer quite often called Partizan, which is just down the road. It's based in Cheetham Hill and Partizan is basically a DIY space completely run by its members. And aside from hosting events, we also have a couple of offices upstairs where a lot of charities and like organisations related to social justice are based. So a few examples are Safety for Sisters, who help with women who are refugees, asylum seekers or just migrants and who have been affected by domestic violence. They give them advice and they campaign for them. and they're a brilliant organization acorn as well they're a renters union that are based Partizan and some other political groups are there too and it's just a really lovely community like I think that if it wasn't for Partizan I wouldn't have started DJing because I went to a workshop there like three years ago now and it was run by Meat Free actually and they like did this little workshop for like people who don't identify as cis white men And that's how I got to know people like Anna, who's in my collective as well, and got chatting about music and stuff and kind of got more interested. And all the parties that we run there as well, it's all like fundraiser gigs. So like all of it goes back to the space, which then supports these organisations. So some big parties that we've had over the past few years were like Shanty Celeste, Lakuti, Object and Call Super. Ben UFO as well, who have been like really long time supporters too, because they just love the idea. And yeah, I think Partizan is just amazing. The people that are amazing, literally all my friends are from there and they are just like a great platform. for artists to get to know each other and to build their platform too. Like I think All Hands on Deck started off as like a fundraising party and now Partizan is just like our home and we do that there all the time. So yeah, definitely a big up Partizan for sure. Amazing. That sounds like an incredible idea. I've been to Partizan so many times as well. And like, just a second, what Tracy said, like, it's definitely one of the most exciting places I've ever been to. Yeah. Even like outside of dance music, just a community space that's supporting all these like really important things. But yeah, it was where like I started to get all of my first gigs were like at the Partizan day parties, which were all fundraisers for the space. Yeah, and they really took a chance on me. And now I guess I'm kind of like a resident. I think everyone's a bit sick of me there because I've just played so many times. You've been sick, don't worry. But exactly, it's like I keep coming back. I'm always gassed to do it because it's, yeah, we know each other through, just through Partizan, countless mates. As well, all the people who will be staff members on the night, they're all volunteers. But it's like the same people who come and volunteer again. So it's really nice. Everyone's just dead friendly. And yeah, there's nowhere like that that I've ever been. And you have a lot of DJs as well, including myself, who like do like a two hour volunteer shift behind the bar and then afterwards just do a set straight afterwards. People will be like, wait, you're the person that's playing but serving me drinks. It's like, that's what it's about. You know, there's no like hierarchy. Yeah. No hierarchical system or whatever. Everyone's just equal and the same. It's brilliant. I love that. That's really important for the way like. DJs are treated these days I think that's good make them all do a shift and Sophia what is your wild card thing that you've brought so this was probably the easiest question I found to answer because unfortunately we had a very tragic loss like in the community this week so the very important person that I'd love to talk about very briefly is Alex T who was from Manchester originally but then he went to uni in York and then lived in Leeds for like the past what really long time a number of years but He was an amazing DJ, like general supporter. He was one of the most supportive people I ever met of me personally. I think of you as well, Tracy. You mentioned today that he was there at the very first All Hands on Deck gig. Yeah, it was after the Object and Call Super thing and we were all really hungover. I didn't know how mixes and CDJs and stuff worked and it was all hands on deck's first party and he just helped us out straight away like no question like an amazing person yeah he was wicked um so yeah he he passed away a few days ago and he's absolutely just touched so many people even beyond Manchester beyond the north like uh we've all been checking socials and stuff There was a RA article about it as well. um and also in fact so like the tributes have been absolutely touching I'm like feel really blessed to have lived in like his home city and get to spend as much time with him um and like know him so personally uh but yeah he played like mainly garage but we actually did a rinse fm show together um when he asked me because I play mainly like Italo and Disco I was a bit like are you sure hun But he was like, no, like, I love it. I love your tunes. And he really loved music. as well, like a sort of story at Partizan. Was it on New Year's Eve two years ago? He was on right after me. I had the midnight slot and I finished on like these sort of like 140 ballroom tracks and I saw his eyes from across the room and he was raging because he'd prepared something much slower and he came up to me and he was like... since when did you play ballroom? Like, you're a disco DJ. What the hell? I'm sorry. And he's like, you will be. But no, like, obviously he smashed it. He rose to the occasion. Like, he could just drop records anywhere and absolutely kill it. So yeah, he's definitely someone that's so important to Manchester and the wider community, for sure. Thank you for sharing. Much love to Alex T. Yeah, I'm feeling like I've gotten to know the Manchester scene a lot better now. So thank you, everyone. Thanks, Tracy, Sophia and Joe for sharing their love for Manchester. And thank you for listening to our very first episode of On The Scene from Resident Advisor.
