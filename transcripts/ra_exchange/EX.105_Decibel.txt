Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Tidal Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Decibel Festival in Seattle is one of the finest dance music events in North America, meticulously curated by founder Sean Horton. It will bring together big name acts like Orbital and Eric Abdu in 2012, alongside underground names such as actress Demdike Stare and Carl Craig. It's a tricky balancing act, but in Horton's hands and in venues throughout the Pacific Northwest City, it all seems to make perfect sense. We caught up with Horton earlier this year to find out more about the history of the event. and see what its future might hold. You started Decibel almost a decade ago. Yeah, it was in 2003. What was Seattle like at that time as far as electronic music goes? I assume you felt there's a place for a festival of electronic music in Seattle. There's a need for it. Yeah, without question. Seattle has an incredible music scene. It's very well-rounded. everything from hip-hop to indie rock to rock, but it didn't really have much of an underground electronic music community in 2003. It was the beginning of sort of the laptop set, if you remember, Ableton version 1, and people doing interesting things with laptops in a performance setting, utilizing tools like Ableton. And that's really the technology caught up, I think, to the creativity and allowed for a lot more improvised performance. And that was really the impetus, I think, for Dustable more than anything was that we had all these new tools. and know where to showcase it, and furthermore, know where to learn how to use it. And that was also part of Dust Bowl, was an education. Were there festivals that you were looking at that you had seen elsewhere, or were you just, I want to put on a big event, and we'll figure it out? Mutech was definitely influential. I went to Mutech that same year, the first year I went. and was really impressed with the curatorial expertise. that they put into the program and also the visual art. I've never seen anything, you know, on that level of abstraction and beauty and chaos and ingenuity, you know, over a five-day really consistent period. And it kind of left me... really inspired. So when I went back to Seattle, I went back with that inspiration in my mind and reached out to people within our community there. And that's really what triggered it. Who are some of the people that, I mean, in that community? far as I can remember at least if the ORAC label was correct around Randy Jones was a huge inspiration on everyone and still is to this day um probably one of the few musical geniuses I know um you know Both technically and musically, I think he's so far ahead of the curve, it's kind of scary. But, you know, he's definitely an influence. There was a really popular, well, really popular, meaning there was like 150 people there. There was a, I should say, an interesting club night called Robo Trash that when I moved back to Seattle. in 2002, RoboTrash was going full swing and that was a very live-oriented electronic music night that was, if you remember Electro Clash, that was part of the impetus there was that whole kind of emerging trend in music being a performance art and very tied to New Wave. and even rock to a degree. So that was kind of what Robotrash represented, but it also had a lot of great techno, electro, and IDM as well. So it was fairly eclectic, much like Decibel. So what did the first festival look like? How many days was it? How many events was it? The first festival program was four days. We started on a Thursday. It was the last weekend in September, which is where it currently is today. It was very small. I had very little money to work with and really not a whole lot of experience. So I agreed that it was better to start small and kind of... see if it's even achievable, you know, if there's even an audience interested in that type of festival. And there was, surprisingly. We had about 2,500 people show up the first program and, you know, only lost, I think, like $20,000 or something, enough to be able to put on credit cards, which is how we funded it the first. six years. But it proved to me that there was a community of people there that were passionate about electronic music and visual art and really electronic music performance. and where visual art and those two kind of cross-promote each other and cross-breed. To me, that was the most interesting thing, is that you're kind of creating a whole new platform on which people to perform. And that was the beauty of both Mutech and Decibel, is that people gravitated towards that and were now inspired. to do all sorts of interesting things with technology and music and visual art. So there's emphasis on live things? Without question. We historically have been about 80% live performance. Every performance has a visual art component, whether it's the artist performing an AV set or whether it's a VJ or an installation that we've used to synchronize with music. There's always a visual element and not your traditional sort of park hand lighting and smoke machines that you're used to seeing in rock shows, but really thought through visual art. as collaborative as possible. It's obviously not always possible, but I really believe in the ability to collaborate, you know, in that format. And, you know, in that sense, everything you do is a world debut. Everything you do is improvised. And that really appealed to me as well. What were you doing in Seattle before? Were you putting on events already? I was. I had a production company that I started in 2002 when I first moved there for a job. It was called Dreaming in Stereo. And we, our first event, I say we because I was working with a graphic designer and an artist by the name of Jerry Abstract. He also does music for the Chicago Label and other labels. He's a very talented producer and graphic designer. But we started a little production company called Dreaming in Stereo. And out of that, we booked T. Ram Shmir, who I saw at MUTEC, I think, that year. We booked Funk Strong was our very first show. We booked a schematic tour with Richard Devine. So we were kind of more on the experimental, almost IDM kind of, I hate the term IDM, but you know what I mean. Experimental electronic dance music, I'll just say that. But that was sort of the first foray I had into booking shows in Seattle. utilizing the club market there. You found out that there was an audience for it, but was it clear that... Seattle was ready for something like that or were you pretty nervous? I'm nervous to this day. At that point in time, it was very low risk. And the first show we did, which was Funk Strong in 2002, did really well. I think we had like 250 people. And it was a very energetic show. People were dancing and everyone stayed till the very end. And, you know, I actually performed for the first time as Nordic Soul, which is currently the moniker I use. So for me, it was sort of a... you know, coming out event, you know, as far as music goes. And, you know, kind of created this weird community just based on that one event. Because you met all these people for the first time that were like, I love this music. I was wondering when I could experience it. And thank you for doing this event. People are very appreciative. And, you know, I think at that moment in time. I knew that we had something and we needed to continue to do it. With the event itself, I mean, in the first couple of years, you said you were doing it on credit cards. I mean, how? Up through 2010, we were using credit cards. Is it an initial payment source? Yeah. Is it an initial? way of funding it that was what we that was what i did um and luckily i had good i always joke that had i not had good credit i would have never been able to produce a festival yeah I imagine a lot of people don't know that about festivals, you know, exactly how much. My friends do. Yeah. My wife certainly does. But, you know, people, like, complain about ticket prices and things like this, and I always think to myself, like, there's probably a reason those ticket prices are so high. It is. Every show is budgeted to break even. Yeah, it's true. And... I don't bring it up that much. Well, now we've got funding via sponsorships and ticket sales have continued to increase as the attendance. So we're in a less self-funded festival program. I'd say really beginning this year, it's kind of in a new... new arena in that we actually have some capital to begin with as opposed to starting with nothing but credit essentially. Was it a big decision for you? to do the sponsorship thing? Or was it, man, we just have to wait, or we have to do this now because we can't do this any longer? I mean, what was that discussion like with the sponsorship stuff? We've always held on to the Creative Integrity Festival, so no sponsor that we've ever had has infringed upon that. And that's key. No sponsor we've ever had, I feel, stands for anything that I'm against. No sponsor that we have, I think, is really that far off from what we're doing. And that's why they're coming to us now and why they're interested in the festival is because really the music speaks for itself. And if we can put together a program... and a sponsor comes and says, we love your program, we want to work with you, then of course there's not going to be any issues with creative integrity because they're coming to us. And that's always kind of been the way that I've approached it. It is like I cast a net out and see what that net returns. And those are the people that we've continued to work with over the years. And, I mean, we've had sponsors for, you know, eight years now that totally get it, that love us, and that support us. And every year are excited to be involved, you know, whether it's a media partner, whether it's Red Bull, whether it's... You know, KXP radio station, you know, they all really want to see the festival be successful. And that's why I consider them partnerships more than sponsorships. You know, and they're not, it's not like we're Coachella. We're not getting millions of dollars here. We're getting thousands of dollars. But it's enough to allow us to. continue to grow every year. It seems like the festival has grown an enormous amount in the past two or three years, especially. Yeah, it has. What would you attribute that to? Is it just a number of different things? Or is there a couple? key things that you can say, yeah, that's why we decided to take it to the next level or could. What changed was, you know, every year we have a certain set of venues. I don't know if you don't know the format. It's a club-based format. There's theaters and parks and other things that we incorporate, but every year we were selling out of everything. And it got to the point, this was around 2008, where we were like, we're at 95% capacity and people are upset because I can't get into a show. What do we do? Well, I took it upon myself as director and curator to say, well, we need to change venues. We need to grow without changing the dynamic of the festival too much. just changing the locations. We still work with a lot of the same venues we worked with from day one, but what we did is we added in 2010 the Paramount Theater, which is essentially 3,000 capacity, Showbox Soto, which is essentially 2,000 capacity, Market, which is 1,100 capacity. So all these venues that are fairly large, and you do them multiple nights, and it really adds up. We still have a lot of smaller, more intimate spaces. We have a beautiful theater space that holds around 600 people. So fairly similar to Mutech, actually. If you look at the venues and the sizes of venues that they're working with, there is some similarity there. And then we also expanded the program to five days in 2010. No, 2009, I apologize. 2009, we expanded it. Having the extra day and all the other activity that's happening around the festival and the larger venues, we went from 2,500 to 23,000 over a period of eight years, which is substantial growth. You have, what, 15 venues now? 15 venues. And you're still one person. So it must be tough to feel like you have a handle on things in a way. In terms of scheduling, every night there's at least three, four, five things going on. Yeah, I think we're up to six now of events happening simultaneously at night. It must be nerve-wracking. I'm blessed to have an incredibly versatile, open-minded, and motivated team of directors, people that are direct reports for production, for technology, anything tech-related, marketing. volunteer coordination. And we do have, last year I think we got up to 120 volunteers. So you have a really solid team of about 12 directors and a team of about 120 volunteers. And that's what it takes to pull off the type of event that we're talking about. And, you know, the interesting thing is all those people. are doing it as volunteer-based and none of them are getting paid, which to this day... It's difficult for me to even have the gratitude to thank those people. You obviously have an amazing team of volunteers. I wonder if there's ever a thought to making the festival like movement, where it's in one place. Well, I could tell you my team would appreciate that. It's been on the table for the past, really, you know, when I started Decibel, we had a sort of meeting of the minds, and that was the question that I posed to this group of local DJs, promoters, and friends that, you know, had some interest in electronic music. And that was my question, was like, should we look at Seattle Center, which is a massive venue similar to Hart Plaza. I think it's actually bigger, as it has a lot of venues on the outskirts that you can utilize. Or should we look at a club? Well, most of my friends were 21 plus. Most of them didn't really have much of a desire to be outdoors listening to house techno, experimental music under the sun in the middle of the city. clubs have traditionally been where that music took place. And I think it was just too difficult a concept. And it's really interesting that you say my friends were 21 plus because I think that is the essential divide, right? It is. It really is. And to this day, we do have an older demographic. I mean, I think when we did the marketing surveys a few years back. We were like at a, the average attendee was 31. You know, in most electronic music festivals today, when you look at, you know, Electric Daisy Carnival movement, I mean, they got to be 1920 is a pretty standard age. You know, but, you know, we started 10 years ago as well. So that has a lot to do with, I think, the older demographic. I do think that an outdoor event is possible. There's a couple venues, The Gorge, Seattle Center, Miramar Park. These are all Washington State sort of outdoor festival areas that I think we could utilize and come up with a really interesting program that would take place during the day. And for me, the real, you know, the beauty of that is you could do after hours all over the city and just start them a little bit later than you normally would. At that point, I think you're really looking at an interesting shift in the demographic and the culture and the festival itself. I don't know if we're there yet, but I can tell you if we keep selling out venues the way we have been. We have no choice, you know, unless we wanted to do like a street fair, which is, you know, the other option. Yeah. It's an interesting one to think about. But you just want to keep growing it bigger if you can, as long as you're keeping the vibe. kind of similar? As long as I can continue to curate the festival that I have from day one, artists that I respect, artists that are doing innovative and interesting things, diverse artists, international artists, as long as I don't have to change the way that I curate the festival, then I'm all for growth. If I can book Aphex Twin, who is one of my idols from day one, and have him play a 20,000-person outdoor festival, that is totally in line with what Decibel stands for, from a curatorial standpoint, if that makes sense. Where do you come from musically? You mentioned to me that the headliner this year, one of the headliners, Orbital, is seminal. They were the first electronic, well, I take that back. Nine Inch Nails' Pretty Hate Machine was technically the first electronic music I bought. But at that point, it was industrial. It felt like a different thing. It was. There was vocals. I think that was the real key difference. It was the first instrumental electronic music dance album that I listened to in its entirety and I wondered how they created it first and foremost. I was like, I need to understand this. It was like this weird puzzle and I was so... blown away by the intricacy of it and the sound design. And I've been a musician since age 12. I've been a guitarist. I've been in rock bands. So for me to take that plunge into electronic dance music after listening to hip-hop, rock, and soul and funk for so long, being raised in Detroit, that it really was a dramatic shift. And it was working in a music store that exposed me to that. Telsa would expose me to Apex Twin, which I discovered, I think, the same week, and Mouse on Mars and Warp Records, early artificial intelligence. That was all through working at a place called Harmony House Records on Woodward Avenue in Detroit. And it was an import record store, and the people that worked there were awesome. It was the best job I've ever had in my life. You know, I have very fond memories of working in a record store in Detroit. Obviously, there's also a couple of people from there, musicians, who are slightly well-known. Were you going to parties in Detroit when you finally discovered electronic music? I remember you saying a plus-eight party. Correct. That changed your... That was, I mean, hearing the music... is what got me interested, obviously, in both the production side of it as well as, you know, what does a performance look like? And I was very lucky to have a friend that was well-connected. And I grew up in Berkeley, Michigan, which is a suburb of Detroit. But as with many of the parties in Detroit, this would be the... you know, late 80s, early 90s, or yeah, late 80s, early 90s, it was largely fueled by suburban culture. Royal Oak, Ferndale, Windsor, you know, all these surrounding cities would flock into this. abandoned, you know, sort of post-industrial culture, which was Detroit at the time. This was not a good period in Detroit's history either. And, you know, pack into these abandoned warehouses. And in the case of the Plus Eight Party, it was a party called Spastic in 1992. And Richie Hawn performed live. It was the first time he performed live as Plastic Man. Jeff Mills played, John Acquaviva played, Matthew Houghton played. There was thousands of people there, many of them incredibly attractive, well-dressed. fashionable, you know, Canadians and rich suburban kids, you know, piling into this abandoned car factory. And there was black visqueen everywhere. There was a laser, you know, projecting the plastic man symbol. There was a strobe light. I remember it like it was yesterday in terms of the experience. And I was completely sober. And there was also an ambient room, which is one of my greatest loves musically is ambient music, which is why it's a pretty big component of Decibel. But all of that experience, I think, at that particular party, that particular moment in time. clicked for me and I decided that I wanted to help produce events in that nature and you know I wasn't until 96 that I actually was able to produce my first underground dance music event on my own at Evergreen State College where I moved to go to school but it had a very lasting impression on me and have always had a very fond fond recollections of Richie Hodden, of Detroit techno, of the warehouse movement, and of everything that happened prior to the police crackdowns, which really ruined that underground warehouse movement. One of the things I found really interesting... talking to people about those parties is that the production level, the music was great, but the production level in terms of what they went to to transform the space or even the simple things that they did to transform these spaces was kind of amazing. And it was just very... high quality and just very thoughtful. A lot of care put into it. And I think that must be enormously influential to see that and then want to put on parties. Yeah, it wasn't even about the music or the visual art or the people. It was about the entire experience. And, you know, you put it all together, and that's what you take away from that. And that's what I try to recreate time and time again when I produce events that feature Detroit techno artists. I want to recreate that warehouse experience. How do you do that in Seattle venues? You do it in a warehouse. Yeah. You... You keep it minimal, not from a musical standpoint, but just an aesthetic standpoint. You have hardwood floors. You typically have a hardwood ceiling. The walls can be concrete. That's fine. From an acoustic standpoint, that's the best type of material to dance on acoustically. So you want to create that kind of warm, thick, bassy vibe. I'm also an audio engineer, so I'm fascinated with sound and psychoacoustics. So for me, it's all about creating that environment, usually setting a sound system up in quad. immersing people in music and keeping it really dark from a lighting perspective. But it was up to me. Every dance party we do would kind of have that aesthetic, but you know, we've grown up. We still work with clubs. We work with theaters. We work with event spaces that obviously aren't conducive to that. But guaranteed, if you go to Decibel, you will at some point in your experience get a flavor. for what warehouse party culture was like because that's part of our experience, really. It's what I hope to create with a lot of the events we do. I think the interesting thing about Decimal, at least for me, was the variety of venues, though, that you could see different things, and there was so much, so many different places, the outdoor park thing and then sitting down in a theater. sort of what felt like an indie rock club basically. Yeah, it was an indie rock club. I worked with several of them. Yeah, and then just a bar with a dance floor type of thing. And I really enjoy that. I guess... although you're just trying to find spaces that are just going to work more than anything else. I often relate it to, and not sure if many of your listeners are familiar with it, but South by Southwest. It's one of the largest, if not the largest, music festival, and they also have an interactive component. What they do is they transform Austin into a gigantic festival in literally every venue, whether it's a restaurant, a bar, a backyard alley, whatever. It's transformed into a music venue. And I've been in the past two years, and I'm absolutely blown away. by the level of talent and creativity that they use to kind of make that happen. We're nowhere near that. They have 200 venues. I think we're working with 15. But it's taught me something that if you live in an urban environment and you want to create a festival, you just go to the area with the coolest venues, which is what Capitol Hill is. This is the neighborhood in Seattle. This is where it began was Capitol Hill, which is like the Brooklyn. of Seattle and you make friends with every venue owner, every bar owner, every club owner and you gain their trust, which is what we did when we were doing Dreaming in Stereo productions prior to Decibel. And then you just kind of, once you gain their trust. You just bring in your own sound, you bring in your own lighting, you bring in your own video, you completely transform the space and promise you'll return it to its original form, and you throw a gigantic electronic music festival. We mentioned this in an interview we did with you last year, but I wanted to touch on it a little bit. Bars, venues close at 1.30. Well, technically, last call is 145, so they'll generally let the music go until around 130, 140. But it's Washington State Liquor Control Board. I think next to Utah, we have the strictest, and I'm being serious. in Utah's Mormon, I think next to Utah we have the strictest alcohol laws in the United States, which blows me away because it really is a very liberal, kind of left-leaning state if you look at it. So I've always been amazed by how that exists, and I just kind of think of it as like they've made so much money. doing it, that they don't want to let go of that from a state perspective. But there's a lot of talk of changing those laws, including a 24-hour liquor license, which... That could change the decibel considerably as well. That would change everything. And I'm all for it. And I will continue to work with local government as a way to try to... voice my um my approval of that and what it would do for the economy what it would do for um drunk driving what it would do for violence what it would do for everything that's associated with people being pushed out onto the street at 1 30 across the entire state and stumbling home to their families or to their cars or wherever i think it's it's absolutely stupid specifically to the parties that you're throwing, though, it seems like it would be, I guess everyone who's from Washington is used to it, used to that sort of like, here's the party, and now it's over, and now we're moving somewhere else. Well, we've created the app. party movements to really help keep the the events going and and you know we have events starting at 1:30 across Seattle during decibel and even outside of decibel we'll do after parties quite a bit they're usually more intimate They're almost always DJ-oriented, whereas Decibel is live. So it's just easier. It's more intimate. And it's a different experience. That warehouse kind of environment that I was talking about earlier, a lot of times that's the after party. And those are usually, from the diehard perspective, the place to go. So if you do come to Decibel... I would definitely save your energy and know that there's going to be events happening every night of the festival going till God knows when. I will be sleeping, but I hear they're really fun. I guess let's talk about the festival in general. You have obviously club stuff, but you also have this optic component as well. Optical, yeah. That was there from the beginning. Optical, as an idea, was there from the beginning. We didn't really brand it until 2000. 2006? 2006? These are events that happen earlier in the evening from usually 6 to 10 and they're seated and the emphasis on the visual art is in many cases even more prominent than that of the music. Whether it's a collaboration between say Lil Yven the European visual artist in Finesse doing a North American debut of an AV performance, whether it's Scott Pagano and Speedy J doing a debut film presentation that they've been working on. It's always something where the film and the video component is as important to the experience as the music. Hence the term opera. and the emphasis on being able to sit down and really experience it, much like you're sitting in a movie theater. How do you connect that? How does that cohere with the club portion of the festival in your mind? Well, I set up the festival so that you can really experience the conference, the optical events and the club events in succession. And it sort of sets you up for the evening. I'm a big fan of meditation and of kind of giving yourself and your body and your mind time to relax before you go. running or playing basketball or dancing, whatever it is that you do that requires some physical extremity. And to me, optical events are the perfect sort of like, ohm or, you know, meditative experience that will allow you to really capture more from your festival experience. You know, a lot of times people come out of the optical events just almost catatonic. And in a lot of ways, I think it's sort of like resetting anything that happened the night before so that you can go out and do it again with a kind of fresh perspective. And I have the optical events, you know, which range from experimental to noise to, you know, electronic folk. to basically everything that would work in a seated environment, typically beatless, more textural. But I specifically pair them with club events happening to build an experience that I think, well, if it's an ambient show with really beautiful, pretty music, I think the next progression would be like a deep house night, for instance, where it's melodic and sexy and very feminine and has that quality. Or on the flip side, if I have an experimental noise event, like rust or notin or touch, something kind of more visceral, it might be followed up beautifully with a techno event. So for me, it's about creating an experience over five days that each day has a very unique... sort of cohesion to it. It's interesting though with so many venues you can have a lot of different journeys. Well I know where I'm going to be. I definitely I'll be very frank about this. I book music that I want to see and typically it's not the stuff that you're going to see at the bigger venues. There is always the exception to the rule. But the stuff that I'm most excited to see usually is the optical events and some of the smaller kind of club events like Numos. So how do you balance this then? How do you, you know, you have this festival. It's getting bigger. And you kind of have to. You're booking artists that are big that maybe you wouldn't personally go see now. I mean, I know that you don't book anyone that you'd like. I hate them, but I've hated them after the performance. OK, not naming names. I wouldn't book anyone that I either haven't seen prior, which is usually the first. That's the deal breaker. And I've learned my lesson on that. So having some prior experience, and even if it's like a YouTube live video that's recent. I'll sometimes base a decision on that. So I wouldn't book anyone that I don't think would be a good performance. And considering 80% is live performance, that's a huge... portion or 85% is live performance. That's a huge portion of kind of what the festival represents. The other thing I wouldn't do is I wouldn't book an artist that I think would be offensive or overly political or that would cause too much controversy. And that's happened in the past. And, you know, I just try to keep politics, religion, you know. really deep opinions out of the festival program if I can. It doesn't always happen that way. But I also wouldn't book anyone that I wouldn't want to see myself. So in the case of Moby, which people were, some people were really scratching their head over that booking last year. I saw him at Movement two years prior and was just floored. He was such an incredible performer and he played great music. He was enthusiastic, and the crowd loved it. So, I mean, don't ever judge booking by the artist's name alone. There might be something deeper there, whether it's a personal experience I've had with them, whether it's a nostalgia. In the case of Orbital, I mean, obviously there's some nostalgia there. But I encourage people to really keep an open mind when it comes to some of the bigger acts because... I'm not just booking them because they're bigger acts. I'm booking them because they do fit in some unique way with the festival program. Do you think with the rise of EDM in America that, you know, there's... you're coming to a really interesting point with the festival where you're going to need to make some tough decisions on how you want to continue. Or does it not affect it at all? It doesn't really affect the way I approach curation. I'm not going to dislike an artist because they're popular. I'll be upfront about that. I mean, there's Skrillex tracks that I really think are actually pretty cool. I mean, we booked Deadmau5 in 2007. We booked Justice in 2007. We've booked Simming Mobile Disco, Diplo. We've booked huge artists, but they're usually earlier in their careers. And now would I book some of those artists? I don't know if I could afford to, to be honest with you. And yeah, they've changed their sound and probably don't have the same appeal. But we have a history of... booking artists that have gone on to do incredibly huge things, particularly artists from Canada and the US. And you're right, it has grown into every aspect of mainstream culture, whether it be fashion, whether it be top 40 radio, whether it be Hollywood. Electron music is spread like wildfire across the United States in a way that I've never seen. its heyday in the mid to late 90s, electronic music was never as popular as it is now. Why? Why did it take hold, in your opinion? Technology improved, giving producers infinite possibilities when it comes to sound design, when it comes to sequential structuring of content. You know, there's more tools. It doesn't make it more popular, though. Well, it makes the music more interesting. to a ADD youth culture that is wanting the most overly compressed, loud, in-your-face, complex. I mean, dubstep is popular because it's taken the place of heavy metal. and loud arena rock in the United States. It's the same testosterone-driven youth teen listening to that music that was listening to Metallica when I was a kid, you know. And regardless of whether it's a guitar generating that sound or a keyboard or a computer, the emotion's there. And that's why it's popular is because... Skrillex figured it out. Bassnectar figured it out. Deadmau5 figured it out. They knew that in order to attract a young population, a young crowd, they had to change the game. It no longer could be this faceless, anonymous, underground, inhuman thing. It had to be something that had a face. It had to be something that had a brand. And all of those guys have branded themselves in a way that... They're no different than a lead singer in a rock band, really. They're up on stage waving their arms around. They're wearing LED helmets. They have video walls behind them. The perception's changed because the performance has changed. And the sound quality's changed and the technology's changed. I think the performance is a big aspect of it because... Well, that's why festival culture has grown to where it's at. Yeah, for sure. Aside from time, what's the biggest challenge that you feel like you're facing right now with the festival? Well, time and money. Okay, aside from time and money. Okay, take time and money out of the equation. The biggest challenge? Yeah. I would say, for me personally... retaining our identity in a landscape of the United States, where it's at now, in a landscape of mainstream electronic music threatening to exploit electronic music as a whole. and run it back into the ground just like it did at the end of the 90s. I don't ever want to see that again. We did Decibel at a time when electronic music had been exploited as a drug culture, as a bunch of weird kids in baggy pants. I mean, the fashion. and the drugs and the fanaticism that ruined electronic music in the 90s. That could happen again today. And I just sincerely hope that it dials itself back before it becomes the butt of every joke, which it could. What is Decibel's identity in your mind? We are lifelong electronic music fans that have grown up with it going back to the 80s. We've seen it progress through the rave boom of the 90s. We've seen it reemerge. And throughout all of that, we've never lost the joy and the love of the music in its purest form. whether it be Brian Eno, whether it be Orbital, whether it be FX Twin, to really enjoy Decibel, I think you have to look at electronic music from a historical perspective. And you'll see a lot of that. There's artists ranging from 70 years to 17 years performing at Decibel this year. And, you know, to me, that historical perspective is crucial. Because if you forget from where you came, you'll never know where you're going. Is there anything specifically, when I was there a couple years ago, there were a lot of local artists, but I wonder, in your mind, is there a specific sound? to the Pacific Northwest or Seattle specifically that's bigger than elsewhere in the States? I mean, Detroit, obviously, it's very easy for them to say, here's Detroit techno people. I mean, is there something that, you know, you can point to that's like, that's what we do better than anywhere else? The interesting thing about Seattle... is that it's an incredibly transient place. One of the most transient that I've ever seen. Very rarely do you run into people that have been there their whole lives. It's usually, you know, they've been there 10, 15, 5, sometimes a couple years. In fact, Decibel... I think it was a catalyst for bringing some people out there. Because I do talk to people that first experienced Seattle through Decibel. It's a very transient place, meaning there's a lot of different influence. People from Detroit, people from Chicago, people from San Francisco, L.A. have all kind of brought their own historical perspective and experience with electronic music there. making it a very eclectic mix. And one of the reasons why Decibel is so eclectic, we have to be. It's a very eclectic city. I would say Seattleites, people that both have grown up there but also have moved there and produced music, tend to be very technically minded. Many of them work for technology companies. Microsoft, Amazon, Nintendo, Real Networks, you know, they're all, you know, Expedia, they're all based out of Seattle, and it's a very tech-savvy town. So you're going to see an artist like Luzine, for instance, who I think is a perfect embodiment of Northwest music from an electronic perspective. It's beautiful, it's melodic, it's serene, it's sad. at times, and it's incredibly technical. And you can't really call it any one genre. It's not techno, it's not down-tempo, it's not ambient, it's just Luzine. It's what he does. Another great example of that would be a close friend of mine, and actually somebody who works in the festival quite a bit, The Sight Below, a.k.a. Raphael Irasare. And Raph really fits in well with the Northwest landscape. He loves, you know, shoegaze. He loves depressing film. I just think of rain. Yeah, he loves rain. And the thing is, he's such a productive person. And being in Seattle, you need to be productive and have a hobby. because the amount of rain you get there. So you have very technically adept, sometimes depressed producers. that are very honed in on their skill, very productive. And those are two artists that I think embody the Northwest sound, neither of which are from Seattle, mind you, but both of which love it there and have pretty much since moving there kind of taken a very strong stance on Northwest culture and been very productive in doing so. What else do we need to know about Decimal? What's important that we haven't talked about? It's a labor of love. I mean, you know, I don't do it because it's profitable or I ever imagined getting rich off of it. You know, I have a day job for a reason, and most of the organization, the people that work with Dust Bowl are the same. It's something that we feel obligated in some ways to continue because it's become... family really I mean the people that come out that you'll see the same faces whether they're from Canada you know Detroit Montreal you see these people every year similar to me tech where you want to see those people at least once a year and you want to go dance with them and you want to talk politics and enjoy each other's company and after five days part ways and know that it'll be there next year. But you want to do it in September when the weather is great. You want to do it in September when the weather is great. Thank you. And the other thing I would mention in relation to that is you will not find, and this is my opinion, you will not find a more beautiful urban landscape than Seattle in September. It's breathtaking. We have boat parties that go throughout the Sound and the lakes. And I would highly encourage anyone coming to take time during the day to explore. Even just outside the city, there's mountain hikes, there's trails, there's canoeing, there's fishing. It's why I love it there so much. It has everything to do with the rain making it such a beautiful place in the summer. You sound a little bit like a travel bro. I don't mean to be, but I've had many, many people over the course of the eight years, nine years we've been doing this, tell me that part of the reason why they come is because of Seattle. And the people there are very friendly as well. So if you want an experience that, you know, from a musical standpoint, Decibel's okay. From an experience standpoint, the culture and the city... I think it's one of my favorite festivals in the world, not just because I'm involved with it, but because at the end of the day, I'm really happy to be around the people and in the environment that I'm in. And that's why I do it. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Unleash the fever, it's so strange. It's a precious day.
