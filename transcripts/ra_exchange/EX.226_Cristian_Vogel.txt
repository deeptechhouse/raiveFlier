Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. He's a two-decade veteran of labels like Mille Plateau, Tresor, and Novomute. But that wouldn't get you any closer to pinning down Christian Vogel. From fiery rave tracks to deeply experimental electronic explorations to something resembling pop, Vogel has been a musical shapeshifter over countless albums, EPs, and aliases. Polyphonic Beings, which has just been released via Shit Catapult, is his latest evolution. It's heavy, appealingly strange, and a wholly unique statement for 2014. But in conversation with Holly Dicker at our Berlin office recently, he gave the sense that the care he puts into his productions and compositions is meant to help them stick around longer than a particular time and place. The pair touched on his latest musical turn and his personal and artistic history, one which winds through Chile, Barcelona, the University of Sussex, and Prince Lauerberg, to name just a few. So, Christian, I was hoping we could start in Brighton and you could paint us a bit of a picture about the kind of early 90s scene there. Okay, flashback. So I was in Brighton when I was... three or four years old my family when we arrived from Chile like 1975 and somehow ended up living the University of Sussex campus because my father somehow had managed to get some research post there right so strangely I arrived there first when I came to the UK then we moved around a lot in the UK and later when I went to go to university and at that time in there I think it must have been 1990 91 There was very few electronic music schools or any places where you could study production. It was really limited and still a very new phenomenon, you know, difficult to... think about that how it is now you can study it everywhere now one of the few universities that had an electronic music studio that was accessible for someone like me was the university of sussex so i applied there and ended up studying 20th century music studies so that degree is already out of date The third year of the course, you were allowed to use the studio, but I managed to get access to that electronic music studio the whole time. I was really interested in learning. So you actually kind of returned to the place where you first lived as a three-year-old. Well, somehow, yeah. I was living on that same campus and remember having some really weird flashbacks. We're talking flashbacks within flashbacks now. Getting fractal now already. We've only just started. Anyway, so I was there really learning my craft in that studio, like how to mix on a big board, how to use a sampler as effects units. And I had already been exposed to Acid House and tapes and rave culture. I was really hot on the sound. And I wanted to make that music in this studio. So I recorded my first albums and releases in that electronic music studio of the university. At the same time, in the culture of life around me in Brighton, around the studio, there was obviously a big, quite famous club scene from lots of clubs that at that time were quite well known, like the Zap Club under the arches on the beachfront and also the free party scene in Brighton would happen on the underground. There were sound systems doing illegal parties on the... beaches and some great sound systems like positive sounds and the slack sound system and so on. For me personally it was a very kind of rigorous development of my music aesthetics where I would study it, apply it, you know, practice it in the studio and then go out and hear the results, not of my tracks but you know of the whole music soundtrack. that time and when did you kind of start becoming more actively involved in the scene so acid box club nights when did they well you've done your research there dug out some paper flyers i thought we only did paper flyers and stuff well i wanted to um i was already being invited as a As my productions were going out on underground, one of the biggest reaching ones was my first sort of commercially released EP on a label called Magnetic North, which is also a Brighton label, which was founded by Dave Clark. And he signed me for my debut, official kind of debut in 1992. And so that got connected with a lot of minds over here in Germany, specifically guys like Triple R and Bleed, who were reviewing for Front Page magazine at that time. Orsink, guys in Frankfurt. This, I don't know if that scene has a name, but there was also a big warehouse, free party feeling, but kind of more organized. Some of it was really big and commercial and some of it was just taking over spaces. And they were connected to that sound straight away, my EP. So I was being invited over to... spin and do anything in this very crazy chaotic scene in Germany in the early 90s and I wanted to bring some of that energy back to Brighton because the Brighton club scene it almost felt like old and established already in the early 90s it was very clubby you know it had this like clubbing ritual going on And there was no techno, really. Guys like Dave Clark or whatever, they weren't playing in Brighton. Techno was very marginalised in some ways. So what was the kind of general sound then at that time in Brighton? It was house music and psychedelic trance. think it's still called psychedelic trance is it these days go a trance and stuff like that so there was this uh sound and this house music sound because the guys that were running the systems and taking the risks to do the parties that their djs that's the sound they were playing and there was some acid house which was really good highlights for me in the in the parties when some deep acid house would come on i love that more you know with that more. But this sort of hard experimental edge of Dutch techno or German techno was not coming into Brighton. So I had to act. I don't know if I had to, but I felt compelled. to do something about it. Some of the DJ fees that I was earning over here, I would just invest them into flyers and backdrops because we used to have to hang backdrops up for some reason. Backdrops? Yeah, you know, you do a club night. Well, you do a club night and then you have to get a backdrop painted and you go an hour before the club opens and you hang up the backdrops with gaffer tape. And then the warm-up DJ starts. Would you ever be active in the painting of said backdrops? No, but I would hang them up with a staple gun. And I remember this as being, it's not quite as glamorous as Masters at Work scene or something, the Brighton scene. But, you know, it was still there. a little like this, but once the music was going, it was great because I was able to spin some of the sound that I was picking up over here. I was getting promos over here, you know, handed to me like one time I remember in the, in the Frisur, which was a very early. crazy underground venue in Berlin at that time. I think it was very early Love Parade, 1992. And these guys with funny beards, really funny, like who were standing in the dark in the corner of this crazy sort of hairdresser club concept. One of them would come and give me a record. And then because the other guys saw that that guy had given me the record, they would come and give me their record too. And each one had their own record and I would come back and check them out. And you got yourself a whole club night right there. Yeah. And these records, they were strange and mysterious, like just holes drilled through the labels and not much information about them. I just knew it was these guys with the funny beers. And later I found out it's all Seiko and they were all the Finnish guys and little electronic sound bombs on vinyls and they had to just give them to somebody and I was the chosen one that night and I got you know and I'd get these records and then hear this stuff and just like wow man and it's so power it was so powerful these sounds that I just couldn't listen to them in my room or something. You know, I had to do something about it. So that's why this Brighton scene, that's why I got involved in the club scene. It wasn't for fun. It was really just, yeah, it was, I had to get it out. So very early on, you were kind of playing out in Germany and Berlin. When did you kind of get connected to Tresor and that sound? Well, first through the productions, the vinyl releases that were coming from... the Detroit Alliance, the Berlin Detroit Alliance that Carola Stoiber helped establish with Jeff Mills and Rob Hood and Juan Atkins. And also there was Maurizio and also some very mysterious but incredible production coming out from the German Berlin scene, also through these channels of the compilations. And Album Techno was being pioneered. the album format of Fortechno was being pioneered by Trezor at that time. I mean, it was, other album electronic music was more, how would you say, like soundscape-y or something. And this idea of a double EP vinyl of something that is very DJ-able, but at the same time, very challenging music. and an album you know this was for Trezor so I got into it that way through the sound and then I was invited to play the club at some point nobody came I remember and it was one of those down points in that because the club had sort of cycles of massive popularity and then the old club we're talking about yeah like um sort of really popular and then there would be a season where somehow it wasn't so popular and it wasn't like a complete hysteria all the time in that old club. But there were times where it was intensely popular and other times where, you know, I would say like with the time I went to play, or maybe it was just me, I don't know, but nobody really came. I remember that. about 10 people but I had a great time it was like wow here I am and then I met Carola and then we got to know each other separately and then she signed me and I think it was quite lucky and I'm you know very grateful that that happened because it placed me more in the Berlin scene yeah I guess, was it sort of all connected with all the Edinburgh guys? So Cy Begg and Neil Landstrom and Dave Sherida. Was that how, like, when did you kind of meet all of them? I'm not very good with exact dates. How did it roughly begin? Well, I guess Dave Clark was already going up to Sativa, which was this big night in Edinburgh that Dave Tereda and a bunch of other guys around him were involved in. So in Scotland at that time, there was Sativa in Edinburgh and Pure in Glasgow and they were doing this... an outlet for this amazing energy in this music, including all of it. So it's not just house and techno. And it was like all of the, the sound electro experimental. They had back rooms where you could hear William Burroughs being played on top of ambient soundscapes and then like super heavy main room with. real drummers hitting bass drums or in lab coats you know it was totally wild brilliant parties so I think Dave probably hooked me up for a Magnetic North thing and I went up there and did a live show with a television and a computer and the television and the computer yeah I used to play with a computer that you plugged into a television so I used to have to have a television on stage okay why I think that's the way it was. We didn't have monitor screens. We just had home computers that plugged into TVs. So you had to put this on the technical lineup. This is why I started DJing, actually, because the whole thing with moving the TV around was just too much. And I learned how to DJ it so I could. So you leave the TV at home? Yeah, I leave the TV at home. Right. That's the way to put it. Yeah. So I met the Scottish guys that way, just like hooking up with them through Sativa and having amazing experiences and staying up all night, having the right laugh. And they would invite me back and then I would invite them down to the events I was doing in Brighton and we built up. a bit of a network. Yeah, because I mean, is it fair to say there was a bit of a Brighton-Edinburgh access going on between you guys? Yeah, we had to... Well, Neil Landstrom had a pretty good analogue set up at that time because I was quite limited in my technical resources. Are you still at university at this point? I think I just left now. I think I was... I was definitely not... thinking that a degree was going to help me in any way at that point, because, you know, this scene was just amazing. And I was having so many experiences already that the academic path was not going to be for me. I realized as a young man, I mean, I might regret that now, but I had to take some time to concentrate on the music. I did finish my degree, though, for the record. I did do it, yes. And then I was quickly out of the door and touring straight away. But yeah, I think it must have been sort of like 93, 94, and then Neil had this analogue set up in his room with Jupiters and 909s and stuff like that and all those machines that I just didn't have access to at that time. And that was the sound. It was just really great. So we started to collaborate and did, I released his debut EP on my label Mosquito Records. So I put his first record out and. I also did records for Sativa Records, for Dave Tereda and so on. So we had this whole flow on production mostly. And then you did quite a bit of work with Cy Begg as well. Yeah, Cy actually goes back before all of that happened. Okay, maybe... let's backtrack a little bit time slipping like forwards and backwards now so much for the chronological order yeah I mean size before Brighton I was living in another part of the UK called the Midlands right Leamington Spa Stratford-upon-Avon Warwickshire maybe all of that maybe it's okay if you've never been there oh it's fine I know what you're talking about so you know what I'm talking about And yeah, there was a big rave scene going on up there in Coventry, clubs like The Eclipse and probably a couple of others I can't remember. So it was in Birmingham and Coventry, it was a big rave scene. So a lot of DJs coming up and a lot of tapes coming out of that scene. I was listening to those tapes more than going to the raves. You know, Easy Groove, Top Buzz, Groove Rider, these guys. And that time was famously discussed in the electronic musicologists talking about that time where rave music was, you could play Richie Horton, Cybersonic, and you could play like a Blaps Posse, Break Sound or whatever. And it was all really mixed up and wild and wonderful. So the tapes were brilliant. And that's where I first heard Technarkey. Dutch Gabbard stuff and you know it was really good so around that time I was totally crazy about the sound and was trying to make it on my computer home computer all the time but I didn't really know so much about the culture I was very disassociated because we didn't know I mean we didn't have the internet really you just had the record shop in the Midlands there wasn't so much record shop action either so it was difficult to know what the tracks were where they were coming from And Sy was in Leamington and he was much more up to date with everything. And he introduced me to organize where everything was coming from. It's like that sound, that's Juan Atkins, that's from Detroit. These records, Metroplex, Transmat, they're coming from Detroit. And this is a Chicago sound. You know, he totally like mentored me. there and helped me organize what everything was so he's definitely an important cat in my story but we then grounded the label mosquito records together tried to run this together for a while but he uh kind of went off production-wise into a different direction more into breaks and stuff and i don't know what happened back there sometime later I think he's working more in film, sound production and stuff now. But he does put albums out every now and then, doesn't he? Are you still kind of in touch? We do. I mean, like, yeah, we keep in touch like with Facebook and stuff like that nowadays. But we're not necessarily planning a... Come back, yeah. Come back. You never know. And then he moved to Edinburgh. Well, Si has always stayed in London. Okay. Yeah, and the Scottish guys are mostly still up there. I think Neil was in New York for a while. I think everyone is more or less. in one place for a while now. I mean, I ended up in Berlin actually out of all of that crew, the No Future crew or whatever you want to call it. Yeah, well, is this the No Future Collective that we're talking about here? More or less, yeah. It was graphic designers, well, one crazy cool graphic designer, Matt Consume, he was our visual artist that did a lot of quite emblematic artworks. Emma Solo, who was running the office with me and organising our activities and... So you had an office. Interventions. Yeah, we had an office and a phone number. We had a fax machine. We were serious. Whoa. Oh, yeah. And when internet arrived in 96, then... Changed everything. We had to... Like stop relying on the fax machine and do emails and stuff. I never looked back. So what kind of things did you do together? You said interventions. Well, that's right. We would organize happenings like with crew. We would bring people together. like with the Spy Mania crew, for example, kind of merged with them for a while. And we were like this big collective group of crazy DJs who would just turn up and play five turntables and CDs and drum machines at the same time. We did this in the Meltdown Festival in 99, I think. John Peel curated one edition and he invited like the whole messy collective like all of you lot up so we all just went up in a van you know and play everything all at the same time that's my recollection of it In the South Bank, in the Barbican. Great. So stuff like that. So the collective initially had quite a manifesto behind it and was quite anti-industry, but also avoiding being, like it wasn't completely anarchic, you know, it was quite technology-based and structured. I was grounding conceptually like activities on post-structuralist philosophy and stuff like that. I mean, it was a bit crazy. It wasn't just a hedonistic mad thing, although that was an aspect of it at that time. But there was some thinking going on behind it too. And like alternative structures for production and using this to basically... allow the music to underneath the official licensing stuff that you have to do, you know, like these things that used to be called backdoor factory pressings, because they kind of come in and out of the back door of the pressing plant. They're not recognized with numbers and things like that. So we were trying to find, it wasn't just DIY. The DIY ethic that people knock around, oh yeah, it's like DIY ethic. It kind of sounds like easy or something, you know. But it was really hard work and challenging that you had to... even the white label idea. Do you know what I'm talking about? So you would make these white label records, so thereby avoiding the whole label structure. So you don't even have to have a record label. You press yourself and get it all done. You still have to drive around in your car and sell them one by one to the record store and stuff like that. It was really hard work even back then. So this kind of current era of the digital band camp and, you know, try to sell your stuff. Kind of wipe clean all of that hard work, really. Well, for me, it's just like more of it. It's even harder now. Really? Yeah, it's like... there's something not quite right about the way it is now. It's like, well, that's how we were doing it back then. Different media. We didn't have digital files. If I'd had digital files, I would have been doing it with digital files too, you know, but it's pretty old fashioned. It's not a new thing. The way the digital, the DIY thing is coming. It's like we were doing it already 20 years ago. And before then as well with cassette labels and posting things through the posts. So sometimes I think about like, have we really solved anything? Is anything actually improved? Have we progressed in any way? I look at the major labels that we used to rally, try to, you know, go under major labels and label deals and stuff. and be indie and I look at the situation now with Google and Apple and like investing so much in music as a commodity you know like the Google Play and all of this stuff I mean they're investing millions in music they don't invest millions in literature crazy and so they could just a friend of mine said this morning you know where they could buy the whole music industry with just the spare change in their pocket these huge companies and they're even bigger than the major labels were back then and they're controlling the whole thing so it's even harder to do be independent you know what i mean okay yeah i mean this is a whole i don't know if you want to go into this topic but i've got plenty of ranting i bet you do But it comes from really way back there and, you know, when I was younger in the early 90s and setting up these collectives or whatever they were. They were structures. You've had several of these sort of... collectives. I guess, you know, am I right in thinking the next one was something that you set up in Barcelona? Well, I tried to do then, because it's really difficult to keep people together. As anyone who's tried to start a band knows, I don't know if you've ever tried to start a band. Which you've also done as well. Right, yeah, so it's really hard to keep people together because everyone, even though you might all begin with the same focus, but... Everyone's got their own dynamics going on in their lives and inevitably sort of pulls people apart. It's only exceptional situations where you can get a band or a group of people to go 25 years together. And I really respect bands like that, like the Young Gods. in Switzerland, you know, like, and others around, it's like, just, you just have to love them, whatever they play, just love them just for managing to keep it together. Yeah. You know, and inspiration. So in electronic music as well, we have, we don't have this band group format. You don't have to have it. You know, you can be a solo artist and have a whole career. But we have other relationships like the one with the label or the one with the record shop owner. And some of these have been lost on the way. I was saying for these reasons, I was kind of... I would say that collective period and that sort of ideology and let's try and do something to... Change the world. Yeah, yeah. It seemed like totally radical at the time, but actually, as we've seen now, it became completely normalised, right? In the 2000s or so, I went to Spain in 2001. I left the UK. Is there a particular reason why? Big beat. Drove you out of the country. Quick answer to that one. Okay. Yeah, I had just become very saturated with purely hedonistic electronic music in Brighton. It was, I think, the Brighton bubble. It was just before Brighton became... really famous for indie alternative music and great bands coming you know like yeah Electro Lane and all these bands they were just kind of like after that time and I was just all I had was just saturated with like Norman Cook playing at that time you know and and the whole thing we're taking great soul records full of feeling and chopping them up really badly and making them go and drunk people falling over because the drugs had changed you know so it wasn't like an ecstasy generation anymore it was vodka and speed and and coke and it's like really unpleasant and the dance floors were just like sticky floors and like vomit everywhere vomit and it was like that we were saying earlier the mega mega white thing lager lager Spawn Slippy captured that time for me. I mean, that song is like that bit of tone in that song was what made me want to leave the UK because it was just like I got so tired of it. Felt like it was just like the sticky floor on the dance floor, you know. So I had a chance to get out and go somewhere completely different. But why Barcelona? Well, I was Spanish speaking because of my Chilean background. So language wasn't so much of a barrier. And I went there with a relationship at the time and stayed there for 10 years. Suddenly, boom. Just like that. You know, there's these streets. Have you ever been to Barcelona? Yeah. Okay, so there's the Ciutat Rea, which is the really old part of the city, which is from the medieval times or something. So there's all these tiny, thin, narrow streets. It's all in complete darkness, right? It's very dark. And then it's like enough for two people to pass down between these buildings. I have this memory of the nightlife being in one bar, getting drunk or something and dancing to the radio, you know? Like they would just put the radio on really loud and you'd dance to the radio or something and then somehow just the door of the bar is open and you just kind of... fall out of the door into the into the door on the other side of those little narrow streets and you're in another bar so the part between leaving one bar and going to the other bar is literally just a few steps across you know and then then you're in another bar and then there's like some flamenco music or something i was awesome it's great so basically a complete change yeah well completely delirious uh different type of uh i've hedonism and then all the sort of beach culture and the Mediterranean lifestyle is much more relaxed. So it took that whole time there took a bit of the edge off my young sort of ambitions to set up a music alternative music empire. Okay. I kind of like slowed down a bit and just thought no no I just build a little studio and Which is the Studio 55. Yeah, it was called, yeah, Station 55 it was called. And it was just a sort of, a way of integrating production from studio to release to getting stuff out. So it's all in-house. Yeah, in-house. And I put a lot of time into the studios all the way through my career. I've tried to do the best studio with the resources I've got. So the one in Spain was my masterpiece design, that one. And I really had it. a great studio at that time for a few years and I did albums on Nova Mute Mute Records I did these and I did the album called The Never Engine which was my last output on Trezor in 2005 and it was this period of my production and I worked with my band project I mention it because it kind of makes sense, actually, in this discussion, because I told you about how I admired the way that musicians can stick together or collectives can stick together. And I think, you know, there's a certain power in the music itself. that helps groups form around the sound and stick together. So I thought, look, I want to just try and have a band and do it because... you know, it's a real challenge and I like to have challenge and so I want to do this. And also the other reason why I wanted to do it was to take away songwriting ideas from my electronic music to get my electronic music more pure and abstract. So I didn't want to have this thing where you put words on top of techno. Which is what you were doing before. I've never really done that, but I was trying to do it a bit on the album called Station 55. I was experimenting a little with this, but I felt it wasn't right. There was something wrong with trying to mix the two worlds up. I separated them and I was able to do all my songwriting ideas with my guitar playing and in a more conventional band format. So I wrote songs, sang them on stage, played, you know, did the whole thing. And then I was able to do this, the most pure techno album of all of them, which was the Never Engine that I mentioned before. And I guess to slightly backtrack and maybe illustrate that... would be maybe using Super Collider as something that you would use. Yeah, right, so we skipped that over. We completely glazed over that one, but I want to bring it back in because would that be where you were trying to sort of write lyrics over electric music? Yeah, again, that was the, obviously it wasn't just one album where I experimented with it. I experimented with Jamie Liddell, who's an exceptional talent and not just... with his voice, but the way he thinks and also in the studio in production, he's an exceptionally good mixer and has great technical awareness, you know. So Super Collider, the project for the listeners that might not have done their research quite as well as you and have got this far in the interview, they probably know already what it is. But yeah, it was my collaboration with Jamie Liddell where we... signed something like as close to a kind of major deal as I have ever come close to which was with Loaded Records and Skint Records in Brighton who at that time were had just been bought by Sony Records so it was like quite close to the you know, the man and all everything I'd been kind of going against all these years. But it was a chance to get this incredible music that we were doing, which was totally out there at the time. And we could feel that it was very modern and very grounded at the same time. So it was a chance for, and Jamie for his voice. To get that stuff out to a massive distribution, I was interested in that. This is why I tagged along that project. The studio was getting really used to the max, like every possible thing we could do with every machine. We were stretching all the limits. I get the impression that it was quite an important... project for you and quite a you invested a lot of you know thought and passion behind it but you were disappointed with the results perhaps well what happened is the reception to it was all let's say that they could they couldn't get past Jamie as front man and me as the scientist operating the machines or something this kind of like standardized view of things and we were working and we were collaborating in a very different way you know it was just because he was up there more visible it wasn't we weren't erasure or something like that you know and I felt like it was just being held back by people weren't ready for for this type of music yet or something I don't know what's going on and actually in in the long run everyone And lots of people ask me about, are we going to do another album? And they missed the spark that was going on in those records. Okay. And would you? It's kind of difficult, basically, because... Jamie lives in America, I think, and I live here. And, you know, we don't have that major deal anymore. So there's no budgets going on. But I don't know if that's something where I want to be, because as we were talking about earlier. I then would feel that the songwriting ideas, singing songs about stuff, it's not sitting comfortably with the abstract language of music, electronic music, which is about sounds and sonorities and energies and it's much more freedom in it. And I think I'm more interested in that. It took me a while to figure that out, basically, a few albums. Yeah. Yeah, just a few. Let's put it like that. Oh, you're around album number 10 by now. But I don't have any negative feelings about that work at all or anything like that. I mean, I enjoy to listen to them sometimes too and I'm very proud of that work. Maybe it's almost a good thing that people didn't really get it at the time, but now they're kind of thinking, oh, we missed the boat here. Yeah, and maybe it's... It's not about people either, whoever the imaginary audience are. Maybe it's just about me. And I was not quite finding my right place, you know, which might bring us right up to date. I don't know if you're ready. We've got so much more to go. Well, it kind of slipping nicely into your band project, which is Night of the Brain. Yeah. Obviously, it would be, it was quite a different setup. right between how you were working with Jamie this is like a very pure somehow yeah about rehearsing and getting getting the chops and doing the changes and you performed I'd imagine a few times not very many shows and mostly it's a studio project like Super Collider was because all the way through this interview I hope listeners get the impression that where the shit happens is in the studio, right? For me, that's where everything's going down. It's the most important part of the whole music production process. And touring and playing live and all that is not really my main priority. Okay. Other musicians see it the other way, you know, but that's the way it is for me. So most of my time and thinking and creative energy is happening in the studio. In the studio. But then where we have... to take the stuff out on on the road somehow and that's always been very difficult for me to do does it help when you perform in other kind of situations for example um keema and real-time stuff is that something that you feel more interested in performing because it's almost like your studio is is the performance That's a good question. And when you are challenged by performance, if it is an issue for you, like it has been for me, like how do I translate this level of creative work and thinking that I'm doing in the studio in this mode, which is often a very deep listening mode. You listen to these speakers in this great room in your comfort zone and, you know. How do I translate that into this situation where you've got shitty monitors, people shouting at you, drinking, no one's, some people with their back. to you and you know you've got to do the best show ever or they're disappointed and they'll come and tell you how disappointed they are you know how do you how do we map that it was difficult so I started to find affinity with improvisers in Barcelona there's a long tradition of improvisational musicians going back into flamenco music which is a purely a very improvisational form and is deeply embedded in the culture there so you have improvisation music very structured deeply embedded in culture and i got that in spain really deep and also working with the more punk noise scene no wave scene there in catalonia So I started to see that as a way of having an experience performing that was closer to pure creation of sound. And also I could do a lot of the creative work in my studio by designing systems. So programming and coding systems that could in themselves interact in ways that can generate something like techno that I like. So that somehow would optimize, the systems would optimize themselves to make the kind of rhythms and sounds that I was looking for when I would go to the record store and try and find, when I was DJing, you know, I would try to find these records. It didn't matter who was making them. They had to have a certain sound, right? So I tried to build a system that could create something close to that sound real time. And to operate it, I have to... improvise from nothing since 2006 I was doing this live show every show improvising from nothing so I go up there live on the system and just play but most people in the club scene have not they just didn't appreciate that element but it doesn't really matter it's the in the end you know as long as I'm up there and I'm doing it and then that's it so it worked really good for me for a number of years and I stopped DJing and buying records and just got more and more into refining the code behind that system So at this point, are you kind of moving more and more away from club music in general and the club scene and kind of slipping more into sound art and I guess kind of composing for dance and contemporary ballet? Yeah, I worked in contemporary dance for six or seven years in Switzerland at Gilles Jobin's company. director there and produced a number of large-scale compositions for contemporary dance. How did you meet and how did that sort of come about? We met through Franz Treichler, who's the founding member of the Young Gods in Switzerland, who's a very important alternative musician in Switzerland. He was already working in contemporary dance and he wanted... to concentrate on his band career a little more. So he pulled someone in. He chose someone, chose me and placed me in that context. And I stayed there for some years and learned a hell of a lot about theatre work, about culture outside the club scene. about sounds the materiality of sounds about what happens to electronic sounds when people actually listen to them like so in theaters in these dance pieces that the public They're seated and they have fantastic listening conditions. It's like a cinema, you know, you have really good sound system and you've got something to keep your eyes entertained. You've got incredible dance and physicality on stage, you know, and this sound and music. And I was able to compose in four speakers or more and quadraphonic stuff and all of this massive, limitless. plays to do electronic sound and is much better. than the club scene. I was going to say, it sounds like something that definitely suits you more as someone who... It was much better. But then I also found that it was limited in some ways because you can't do, like, there's some music that doesn't work there either. It's got too much energy. So, for example, if you start putting kick drums into that sort of situation and the people are sitting in the chairs and they're dancing, you know, it's too much rhythm. It's too rigid. And you can't do like micro composition, which is something I'm also interested in, which is working on a hyper detailed level with sound. So one composition might last about one and a half seconds, you know? Okay. Right. You can't do this on stage either because it's like somebody might cough and miss it. Could you maybe tell us about some of the pieces that you worked with during this period? What I particularly want to know about this text to speech. That was a great one because it was quite real time generated. I've seen some videos, so can you maybe describe what was going on? Yeah, the soundtrack was intertwined with... the choreography to such an extent that the dancers had to be at a certain, at them computers for example, at a certain time in the choreography in order to type phrases into a text-to-speech software system that would speak certain texts and then that Text perhaps might get processed and manipulated in real time through about eight or nine different speakers on stage. And sometimes the dancers would take the speakers and dance with them. And the speakers and the sounds became... elements in the choreography so you know you get the idea it's like a lot more and there's sorry maybe say how many how many dancers how many people were on a stage on that piece uh I think there's six five or six and you're all kind of working together I mean what's your role in in this it changed uh during that time I was either um composing the piece over a period of three or four months intensive work with the choreography, like it's being composed together. And then it would go on tour with an operator who I would teach how to operate the sound score. And for another piece, for the final one that I did for the company called Spider Galaxies, I was operating that piece in real time. Maybe you could explain how this whole piece works. That one, well, how it works, I don't know. Or maybe describe it for people who don't know. The score, yeah, the similarities. I mean, it's... This one was quite difficult and challenging because the score is generated on a real-time generative algorithmic music system called Kima. You mentioned it earlier. So this is a professional system and it's not really a kind of a laptop language. It's quite... difficult to learn, has a big learning curve. I've been studying it since 2006. So I created that piece with the maker of that system, Carla Scarlatti. So she's the creator of Kima. collaborated together on this score. Her company, Symbolic Sound, is based in Champaign, Illinois, in Chicago. So we would collaborate with video footage and back and forth composition. And then I was executing the timeline. It's called the timeline of code, which creates the music in very tight synchronicity with the choreography. So it was really exciting to do it and nerve-wracking because the music is structured and similar enough for the dancers to know what's going on. But within it, it's changing and different every time it's performed. Is this something that is kind of rehearsed extensively? Like how does it, what's the relationship like between the dancers on stage and you as a... There's a whole lot of different, the choreography is a huge sphere. I mean, you can go from free improvisation to a purely conceptual dance. example some pieces where no one actually moves but they're on stage and there might be slight movement or something and it's very conceptual or to ballet to so music also maps the whole range from having a band live on stage playing electric guitars to Completely free, Merce Cunningham and John Cage, you know, they wouldn't even meet before the peak. They would meet on stage, the music and the choreography would happen on stage at the premiere for the first time, for example. So, you know, there's a whole range. But in the work that I was doing there, it was very tightly composed and very tightly choreographed and intensely rehearsed for six to eight months or so. Right. Thank you for asking me about that, though. The problem with dance pieces is that the music and the piece go to theatres, and so not that many people get to see it. Yeah. Is it something that you would still like working with now or would like to? Yeah, I'd like to, but it would need to be at a certain level. of production and conditions because I'm not ready to start down in the rough scratch DIY, you know, let's do a jam in the empty warehouse kind of level. So I really very much enjoyed the conditions of theatres to work in. like a sound check in in club scene you get sound check for an hour if you're lucky and in the rock scene if you're if you're unfortunate enough to be in a festival with lots of bands you might not get a sound check but you might get five or ten minutes to plug in your guitar and tune it right and then play the best show you've ever played ever it's incredibly demanding and in theater you get five days or something to set up and sound check and tune the you know maybe even a couple of for me it was so much luxury it's like oh I can hear the sound and oh I can adjust the equalization and the volume and stuff so it was it's really great condition so for that reason I would I would like to okay so and then what was the turning point that kind of After all of this brought you essentially back to electronic music and I'm now bringing us kind of almost back to date. Yeah. So you moved to Berlin in 2012. Yeah, yeah. I did move to Berlin in 2012 and I had to meet these guys. Again, we've met lots of times over the years. These guys that run a record label called Shit Catapult Records. Daniel Mateo and T-Ram Shmiya Makahas. So you've known them for like the time before when you would be coming to Berlin? Yeah, I've known them somehow for a hundred years or something. A hundred years. Yeah. And so then they said, look, things were going quite well for them actually. And they've managed to keep their shit together. quite some time now I think they're on 150th release right now so one way or another still there and they said Christian you know they kind of pulled me in from the desert a bit and me back in and said hey you know make a record for For us. For us, for our scene, for where we're coming from. And, you know, so I made the album called The Inertials in 2012 for that label and put some beats in there and stuff. How did it feel? It felt really good, you know. It was nice to also bring some of the depth from the contemporary composition, like bring that deep electronic listening experience that I'd had in Switzerland and bring it into the album. Or did I read somewhere that it was kind of the assimilation of everything that electronic music represented to you in one album? Right, yeah, that sounds like the press release to me. It does, that smacks of press release, doesn't it? But in essence, was it kind of like you've had this kind of... It can't be everything, obviously, on a limited format of about 45 minutes before people's attention is lost and they put another CD on. It's a big part of the way, yeah, I'm honest to where I've been coming from. I don't feel like I was turning my back on anything and saying, I'm not going to do that style because of this and this. I wasn't limiting myself. But the language that came out in that release was really beautiful listening experience. And, you know, I'm proud of that work. I tried to keep the technical level of my work as high as possible, given the resources I've got at the time. So it lasts for years. That's one of the reasons why I keep that production level so high. So it will last for 10 years, 15 years. You listen to it again and it's still amazing sounding. So that's the kind of thinking behind the album. Then they asked me to do another one, which is where I am right now. Via the Eselbrook. Oh, right. I was going to skip over that one because I didn't want you to get upset. Yeah, you can play a bit of that one in the background. Just so people get a feeling of what that little... detour was but no I don't see that as a as a for me I understand it all in a very like a composer if you can go through if you want to dedicate some time to following a band or a composer or something you know they're going to be going all over the place exploring what they need to explore and that album Again, a wonderful sound world, conceptually very strong, but no beats on it. And you can't really dance to it in the conventional sense of a rhythm that you can hook on to. I wanted to pick up on the reference to Ioannis Xenakis. Is that correct? That's right. He's a composer from Greece, 20th century. Pioneering and sort of turning mathematical modes towards composition. Right, yeah. He's like a lot of the... academic, more academic world of composition, you know, a lot of it is very reliant on conceptual work, conceptual grounding. So club music, it's not so reliant on conceptual grounding, let's say, you know, they have other frameworks, like cultural references to their own culture and stuff like that. So in the more academic composition world, there's things like mathematics going on. Sometimes it's musicology, like music history, like references to other composers from the past and stuff. And in the case of Xenakis, he was really interested in formal structures, almost like algorithmic stuff, much more complex than simple algorithms, but getting inspiration from natural phenomena, like the movement of particles, like all sorts of stuff. like this so it's incredible incredibly deep and how does it tie into into your album or your work that you would well i think in that particular example of the aces book album i felt like exploring what it's like to have a really strong conceptual grounding before you start making them sounds it's like the challenge thing you know it's like yeah i want to do this to give myself some meaning to complete yet another album because I think that one is numbers 15 or 16 or something and I just can't sit in front of my drum machine and hit some buttons and expect that anything amazing is going to come out I have to be honest you know you've got to put the you need some structure first to it and I found that to be a very fruitful year of study and research and the result is that album. Okay. Does that kind of lead into your now, your current album? Yeah. So 59 minutes, 20 seconds later, I'm going to promote my new album, which is called Polyphonic Beings and it's on said ship catapult label from Berlin. This one in itself is based on some, I also did some, how can we say prepare the ground or the like get conditions. Lay some groundwork. Yeah. Is that the English expression? Lay some groundwork. Get some fertile conditions. for some innovative creative work from me, not in reference to anybody else. I mean, I'm not listening to other people in the scene or anything like that. You know, I just want to originate on my own path. So in this album, what I did was... try to open the phenomena that might be affecting the moments where I do the composition and the creation, the actual creating of the raw material from nothing to something. like this kind of improvisation mode where before you're going to blow your horn you know you're just kind of like trying to tune into your space like where you are an awareness of your place of the now of the moment of like all these things from outside like a raised sensitivity and awareness and i tried to like do this with the electronic music okay so which means in the studios. And the way I try to force it through is not go to my studio and sit there and sit there and hope that some great inspirational bird will come down and start programming the 909 for me. You know, it's like what I did was call up a few people around the world and called up my network and said, hey, man, you know, would you mind if I come over and record a bit in your studio and do some sounds and stuff like that? And I traveled. And I traveled on a budget. So one of the places I was. that opened up for me was a studio in Los Angeles in West Hollywood called Chalice, which is actually a $2,000 a day mega studio that's frequented by... great recording artists of the R&B and hip-hop industry. So who's your friend that you know there? Lady Gaga and so on. Well, I have a colleague there who's a tech. So he said around Christmas time, there's not a lot going on here and maybe you can get some downtime working through the night on the SSL consoles, all these machines. So I scraped together some. some cash and got a ticket to LA and took him up on it. And that, for example, was incredible experience and the music transformed massively. So it was about sort of the physicality of you in a space making music. Yeah, and trying to, just trying to do these things that you get these opportunities open up and just seeing them, being aware of them. doing it instead of thinking i can't go to la because i've got to like do this or that or i can't i can't afford it or you know and then on the other hand i went to just quickly before i have to say the other part of this which is that similarly there's a crazy uh opportunity that came up that was to go to a tiny village in the southernmost part of the japanese peninsula called uh kawakami and a tiny village about two, three hours into the forest. And I spent some time in a little hut next to the forests with two Genelec speakers. Nice. Was this part of the second hometown project? That's right. It was a kind of creative retreat that some friends of mine from the dance scene had for their own reasons that we won't go into here. They're trying to bring some artists into this very sort of extremely unknown part of Japan and ate oranges from trees and the locals would bring, would kindly bring sausages for me to eat. I had no need for coins or money. And I saw hunters with rifles shooting boar and skinning boar and so many experiences that I had and so connected with the nature there. I had a very moving experience there. And was creating and writing music all the time. So really just trying to open to all of these experiences and the music just really transformed. And then I did similar studio sofa surfing. That's what I'm calling it, you know, in Copenhagen, in a kind of more punky style studio, which reminded me of the days in Barcelona and stuff. Also in Berlin here in my home set up. I live in Prenzlauer Berg, so the baby's crying next door and the gay couple arguing upstairs and trying to make the music. That's how the music is shaped on this album. And that's all I can really say about it. We could go through the techniques and stuff involved, but I'll leave that to the listener. And is something that you're particularly proud of? Just kind of sum up everything that you've kind of got to at this point? Yeah, somehow. I'm always working on the next thing, though. What's the next thing? You're aware that the public gets everything with a delay. Oh, yeah. Don't blame me, it's the music business. It's still really slow. But I'm working on a follow-up to this album already. You're just a serial album maker. Yeah, somehow. I do other things in between as well. But I'm already planning it. It's in the planning stages. How am I going to approach it? But I expect to have that one finished sometime in 2015. Okay. First part. And it should be out hopefully. If I'm fast before the summer. And I just wanted to maybe kind of wrap up perhaps on this crowdfunding project that you... Oh God, yeah, I have to mention that. Well, that would be great if anyone who's got this far in the interview is still listening, then they can tune into the crowdfunding project. They can log in there. It's on start next. which is a German can you tell us what what's it what's it about so you're wanting to restore and remaster yeah it's about restoring and remastering and reissuing a large part of my back catalogue which is about 80 to 100 tracks the entire Tresor albums wow the Foursink and Mill Plateau albums and a box of DAT tapes that my mum found. So why are you doing it now? Just as a kind of... A couple of reasons. One of them is that... I'm rather shocked that somehow now that we live in the future, the quality and fidelity of music is like much less than it was in the past. So I'm hearing all this stuff ripped up onto YouTube at 320 or less MP3 quality through people's crappy preamps and stuff. When I recorded it 15 years ago, I was trying to keep the quality much higher than that. So that's not satisfactory for a representation of my life's work. So someone's got to take the initiative for me to really archive it and have it up there at the best quality intended. And no one else is going to do it for me. So I have to ask for some help to raise the money to master it properly because all of that stuff is quite expensive. The machines and the... remastering process. So that's what the fundraiser is about. That's actually an ongoing project in parallel with my album for next year. It's also just re-released about 15 albums at once from the past. Lots of past, present, future mash-up going on. Yeah, yeah, that's the good thing about music. You can just plug the past into the future and generate a secondary now. Thank you. ♪ ♪ Thank you.
