*outro* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Adrian Thors, who you will know as Tricky. He's a child of Bristol sound system culture and his fusions of post-punk, hip-hop and electronica have been matched by a dynamic attitude on everything from class and cultural divisions to gender politics. After releasing one of Trip Hop's defining statements with 1995's Max & Quay, Tricky has returned to his roots with a new project called Skilled Mechanics. In conversation with Christine Kaker, he heaps an eye train on family and history as he dissects the ups and downs of a remarkable career. As always, you can access our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. An exchange with Trujillo is up next. So Tricky, first thing I wanted to ask you about your debut album Maxine Kueh. 20th anniversary and I was thinking that things like landmark anniversaries they tend to lend themselves to things like nostalgia. How do you feel about that album now as compared to 20 years ago? I don't think about it at all. You don't think about it at all? And being 20 years means nothing to me at all. The only reason I know it's 20 years is because you've said it and a couple of other people. It just doesn't interest me. Okay. So the significance of that period of time. There isn't. It's gone. that will never be again. So it doesn't matter. That's like a dream of yesterday. You don't really have much consequence. That's time past. That time will never be again. It's great the things it's done for me. It's given me a career in the music industry. I've traveled all over the world. I've met a lot of people through my travels. But it doesn't really mean anything to me. The only time I ever think about it is, say, if I hear something which I know sounds like it. I quite like the fact that sometimes I'll hear a new band and I can tell they've taken from kind of my vibe. but they might not even know who I am because so many years have passed. Some people don't know where they're influenced from even. So I think that's quite funny. But I don't ever think about it. I'm always thinking about my next record. If I mix something, I'm bored of an album anyway, so that it's over for me. any album. So the album I've just done now, I'm thinking about touring. The next time I'll hear it is when I'm on stage. Yeah. So would you say generally that's reflective of you as a person? Do you consider yourself to be a nostalgic person or are you somebody that just kind of is happy to leave the past in the past and just move forward? No, I don't think I'm nostalgic as such. But then, you know, like when it comes to family and stuff, you know, and I talked to a friend the other day I haven't talked to for many years and I've known him since I was a kid. And we used to like... get into trouble with each other and travel together. It was like, his name was Whitley. And he's actually on the new album. I talk about him on the new album. He's got an amazing memory. He remembers things that I don't, you know? So it's like talking to him is good, but not really. I'm not kind of... One of those people who kind of get sad at Christmas, kind of thinking of the family and stuff, you know. I don't even celebrate Christmas. So I'm not really, I'm kind of a move forward person. Sure. You kind of touched on family and perhaps feeling nostalgic or sentimentality about your family. And I wanted to ask you about the Maxine Quay album particularly because your mother is a figure who... really looms large for that album and perhaps for the rest of your career as well, or rather the absence of her is very apparent. How have you moved through that absence of your mother with your music? Is it something that's still as present to you now as it was 20 years ago? Yeah, and it's kind of, I don't look at it as, it's almost not a sad thing. She's kind of given me everything. If you think, this guy wrote a really interesting thing when the album came out. I don't know subconsciously if it was that, but he kind of said in a way, because I didn't really know my mother. The first time I remember, my mother is in a coffin because she used to keep the coffin at home, the glass coffin, open coffin. So he said, you know, I called the album that. So when I go into record shops, I can see my mum everywhere. Cool. And I don't know if that's subconsciously, but it's not a sad thing. It's a positive thing. Like she was a writer, right? She used to write poetry. In her times, in where she was, it wasn't possible for her to have a career as a writer. You know, she had two kids. You come from a poor family. She had epilepsy. You know, she couldn't really drive a car because of epilepsy. And just in those times, there was no, there was nothing there set up for her to be able to say, all right, I want to be a writer now. You know, she didn't go to the best school. Like me, I didn't go to the best school, but I had more opportunity than my mum. And it's almost like she gave up her life so I can... do mine. So it's kind of like she's always there because I didn't really know her. I was always my mum's ghost to my grandmother. You know, she used to sit me on the floor when I was a kid and she'd watch me playing Billie Holiday music. This is where I first get my first music is I ever remember is Billie Holiday. And she used to play up Billie Holiday and she'd smoke a cigarette just watching me and say things like, well, you look like your mother. It's harder for her than it is for me. For a woman to lose a child rather than a boy to lose his mother, I think it's much harder for my grandmother. Especially if she's bringing up the boy who looks like her. Right. That's why my family took care of me so good. So I suppose it's a big part of my life. Your experiences go with you. Of course. Whether it's in music or art or writing, your experiences go with you. Yeah. I thought it was interesting, though, that obviously the first album was named for your mother. But your most recent album was your name, like your actual name, which I just found to be interesting because if I think of you as an artist, I think of, in terms of sound quality, somebody who's quite obscured in a way. There's like a lot of dense layers. It's not always 100% apparent where you are in the music, which I think is part of its magical quality. But what was... the idea behind presenting that album as you, as Adrian Thor's? Max and Quay was the beginning and I've come full circle now. I've gone through some crazy periods when I was living in America. Some crazy stuff was happening and some people said I wouldn't live that long. You know, the way I was behaving and stuff. Just like, it was crazy. Partying and I was a big mess. And now, and I took five years off. I didn't do any music. And it's not like I took five years off. Five years just went without knowing it. I think I did blow back and then nothing happened. You know, I was all right for money. So I didn't need to do shows. I didn't have to do anything. So I just lived in LA and my life became partying. Then I did an album with Domino and I can remember the first time I did the interview, the guy said to me, it's five years since you've done an album. I was like, wow, I just couldn't believe it. It kind of shocked me. And then I just thought, I don't want that to happen again. It's like... A year, two years, two years at the most, I think, without putting music out. For me, anyway. By the time I got to Adrian Falls and I got my new deal, I'm more focused again. I'm more loving what I'm doing. I really love what I'm doing and I feel like I'm really lucky to be able to like... Last time I was in London, sometimes I'll come out of a studio at five, six o'clock in the morning and there's old men working on the street and stuff. Freezing cold. And I've just come out of a studio and I get picked up in a car. I fly around the world. So it was just like Max and Quay was the first chapter. Adrian Falls is the next chapter. Max and Quay give birth to me as a baby boy. I was called Adrian Falls. And then the letter she left. She said on the letter, it's funny, I feel a bit bad for my sister, but my sister wasn't mentioned in the letter. She left a letter to my auntie saying, look after Adrian. For some reason... Not that she didn't love my sister. Maybe she thought I needed more love. Are you younger? No, I'm older as well. That's the funny thing. Maybe she thought, maybe it's because I was the only boy as well, though, you know? And the first baby boy. So it was just like a right time to call it that, you know? It just felt like a right time. I wanted to cycle back again, back towards Maxine Quay to ask you a little bit about the actual making of it. Because there's a couple of things that have continued to stand out to me. Obviously, before that, you were involved with The Wild Bunch and kind of connected with Massive Attack with your appearances on their first two albums. And I have always been curious about... the kind of lyrics of yours which appeared on both albums so like Karma Coma on Protection became Overcome and Eurochild became Hell Is Around The Corner with the same lyrics but the musical context is completely different and has a completely different atmosphere and also the public enemy cover that you did, Black Steel, which I thought was brilliant to have this like inversion of having Martine singing the vocals, but still from the perspective of a black man. Like I just love the way that you. give the same lyrics different context. So I'd like to ask you a little bit more about that. With the Massive Attack stuff, I thought those lyrics were wasted on the Massive Attack album. Not that the album wasn't good, it just wasn't totally my thing. There was like five of us in there, you know, and that's like... different pieces of personalities. Some of the mixes I went happy with. Some of the things, like, I didn't think certain things sounded right for me. Not for them, but for me. And these lyrics, they were kind of like, they weren't written for Massive Attack. I wrote those not thinking of doing music even. always written you know so when I did my stuff they're my words and they're more personal on my album than they are on and you can hear it if you hear if you hear the Massive Attack and then you hear it on mine it makes more sense on mine it's more personal and these lyrics were really personal and it's nothing it's not Massive Attack's fault I should have maybe written something else for them which was more to do with a group thing. So it was really personal to me. So by the time I met Martina... I knew she was the girl to sing these lyrics, you know? So basically that's all it was. It was like more of a personal thing for me. Black Steel was like just one of my, I used to play that song over and over and over. Public Enemy, forget rap, forget hip hop. One of the best bands ever lived and forget. putting Public Enemy into a hip-hop label and they changed the face of music. When I first heard Public Enemy, I was just like, what is this? The first album, I didn't like it. And then the second album, I loved it. And then I went back. to the first album, and I understood it. That's how genius they are. So with Black Steel, one of the reasons Martina doing it, everybody thinks it's because I was taking the male, putting it into the female role. Maybe a little bit of that, but to be honest with you, the song is so good, I wanted other people to hear it, who are not people who are into hip-hop or rap. I thought the song is, the lyrics are so good that I know if Martina does it, it's going to go to people who might not hear Public Enemy. We still do that song sometimes, like in Russia. You know, you know the thing with the government there, the government is not easy. And you see these young white kids who weren't born. when Max and Quay was done singing along to Public Enemy, like a revolutionary song. And it's just amazing. So it's more because I just got so much respect for Public Enemy, really, to be honest. And stylistically, that track kind of stands out from the rest of the album, I think, just because it does have that kind of heavy punk. sound beneath it is that what you intended yeah yeah yeah I've always I've always been into rock music yeah you know I was into the specials and um and then hip-hop came I was more into the rock like T-Rex Mark Boland and then I was just like, become kind of like a b-boy. I was obsessed with hip-hop, you know. I've heard you speak about the specials in other interviews before and I thought it was interesting that you said that kind of growing up in Bristol that they kind of seem to represent you as somebody who comes from a mixed racial background. Yeah, and also, like say for instance, like if I was a Prince fan. I could listen to a Prince album, but I can never want to be Prince. I can't do that. You know, I can't dance around in aisles. I can't sing in falsetto and stuff like that. He's a born musician. He grew up as a musician, you know. I'm a street kid. It don't matter how much I would have liked Prince. It doesn't give me anything. I can't say, do you know what? I can change my life. I can do that. But when I first heard the specials, these are kids who are coming from the same place I come from. They've learnt to play guitar, they've learnt to play bass, they've learnt to sing. Terry Orr is not a natural singer, but he made it work. So when I first heard Terry Orr, I thought, I can do this now. Because I was in love with music, but there was always a divide between me and the music. But then when I first heard the specials, it's like, well, I can do this if Terry Orr can do it. And the things he was singing about. The stuff like I know, getting chased, going into town, getting into fights, not feeling you belong anywhere and walking around council estates. I could totally relate to that. So with the specials, it kind of made me feel like I can do this. That's when I decided. I wanted to be a musician when I heard the specials. Because before that, I used to listen to old hip-hop as well, like UTFO and all that. But I can't do that. I'm not American. I can't sound like an American. The specials kind of made me feel like this is what I'm going to do with my life. Yeah. Was it also because maybe they sounded British as well? Yeah. Something to do with it. British, and they lived the same lives I lived. Yeah And I had the best of both worlds. My mum is half white. I grew up with her family. My grandmother's white. So I grew up in a white community, in a white ghetto. But my dad lived in a black ghetto. I didn't start seeing him until I was about 12 and then not for a while, 15. I'd go to clubs, reggae clubs, with like say Whitley for instance, and Whitley was from the North West, he was a black guy and a white girl, and we'd go to a blues and there'd be no white people. Then we could go to the Top Cat, which was just North West Arkliffe, we were the only black people. people in there and we didn't even you know when I was younger I've been in clubs when I was younger and I've had a friend say to me you're the only black guy in there I've never even noticed it and like I wouldn't notice it being in a black club so I kind of been lucky you know I've had friends who are black friends who are white and they're racist but they just don't know it you know like uh oh he's all right for a black guy or a white guy he's blah blah blah blah so sometimes I was in the middle and then when I seen the specials I realized ah this is what it's all about you know I come up through the skinhead thing as well which was quite racist thing sure you know so um we used to go to clubs in Bristol and stuff and it was like uh Quite a bit of racism. Bristol could be quite a racist place. So with the specials, it kind of broadened my horizons, you know, and it gave me a voice. Moving a bit further forward to when you fell in with The Wild Bunch, did it feel at that time that... the division socially or even musically had moved beyond racial barriers or borders. Yeah, definitely. Urban music wasn't like it is now. See, like the St. Paul's Festival back then was for everybody. It was funk, hip hop, reggae, you know, used to get played by DJs in Bristol. And everybody used to go to it. And it wasn't really no-colour thing. There wasn't no-colour thing at all. I used to go to clubs with my white friends and they couldn't get in the clubs. just because they were from the North West. So that's racism. You know what I mean? So I've experienced racism to what... The first time I ever experienced racism is when I started doing well, which is funny. I'd never been on a plane before I made a record. You know, I couldn't afford to. When I first started travelling, that's the first time I'd seen racism. I'd seen racism, stupid things, like someone shouting out a name from a car. That's ignorant, stupid stuff. But the first time I experienced racism is when I had a first class ticket and I was on British Airways and I was flying to New York and I walked on the plane and the first class is there on the left. An economy there on the right. So I went to turn left and the stewardess said, sorry, no, you're going the wrong way, that way. And I said, why am I going the wrong way? She goes, no, economy is that way. And I said, what makes you think I'm in economy? That's just blatant racism, you know, and like things like being in the business class. and a guy with a suit next to me and you know they want to talk straight away like within 10 minutes like oh so what do you do? And I just tell them any rubbish. I lie, I say I'm an international drug dealer, anything to mess their heads up. So I didn't really see racism until I became successful. Because in my house, at Christmas, you've got black, you've got white, you've got Asian-looking people, you've got every colour in my family. Still on this topic of... people's perceptions about race. Do you feel like you are more accepted as a black man because you are a performer? Because I have a theory that... Definitely. Yeah. I know certain clubs I wouldn't even get into if I were tricky. And, like, I've got friends, like, in London, and they can't get into the clubs, right, if they're not with me. And that's black and white. Definitely. Without a doubt, it changes things. And you said you've been living in Berlin now for a few months. All apparent or non-apparent are these kind of issues for you here? I'm curious to know. Well, I live in Norton, but in the ghetto part. So they run it down there. Turkish, there's some Africans, you know, they're from all over Lebanon and you ain't feeling no racism down there. And to be honest with you, I really like Berlin because it's so, like, everything I need is in Neukölln. I don't really go out to clubs much anymore. I don't really like... doing much, I'm just about my music and touring. Like when I tour, I do so much. When you're at home, you just want to chill. So I'm not really seeing anything in Berlin. You know, I'm not really noticing anything, but there's definitely racism here. There's racism everywhere. But where I am, it's all good. One of the funniest things more than racism is these hipsters, the dudes with the beards. What is going on with that? There's a lot of them around. Yeah, it's like, dude, you know, really, you're not cool. And it's like, don't bother trying to be cool. You know, just be yourself. But it's like, I see all these like baseball cap with these big beards and it's like. Hipsterville. Well, I'm going to make a really awkward tangent here about kind of style and coolness. I'm going to drag you back towards Maxine Quay again. The style of that album is so specific and I was kind of rereading some of the reviews about it and they kind of described it as being very dark. and dense and paranoic and dystopian and all of these like quite evocative words. How reflective or how... Accurate would that be for your kind of state of mind at the time when you were making that album? Well, it all depends how you look at it, right? It's like almost like when people say it's dark and that was the main word, right? It was dark. Yeah. Now, I went out with a girl from Washington, D.C. from a hardcore ghetto, like hardcore ghetto. And she found it positive. And she didn't think there's nothing dark about it. She found it uplifting. You know, she grew up in a place where there was murders. They were catching bullies two blocks away from the White House. You know, you've got people like Rayford Edmonds and his crew killing people everywhere. She knew that guy, you know. So maybe a writer from England might find it dark. but this ghetto girl from Washington, she found it uplifting. So it all depends. I think it was just a time and a place. Like, for instance, Blowback is much darker than Max and Queen, much darker, because my life was a lot darker then as well. Right. I think it's a perspective. And, like, I think Blowback's a much better album than... way is some new music and it's like there's stuff on blowback just way ahead of things you know I think Adrian Falls is better in a lot of ways you can see the growth you know I also wanted to ask you about something stylistically that I've noticed through a lot of your albums like pretty much all of them I love the idea of having these of twinned vocals like a lot of the time male and female but sometimes you'll even have male guests as well just the idea of kind of layering the same vocals from two different people onto the same track like what's the reasoning behind it like what what does it represent well some of it was it's because like um when i first met Martina and we started recording, the name, I wasn't going to call it Tricky, I wanted to call it a band called Max and Quay. Right. That's what the name of me and Martina was going to be. It was like, we're a band, I'm going to call it Max and Quay. Because I didn't see myself as like the upfront person. Island Records was like, nah, nah, nah, you've got to call it Tricky. And I went against it, but you've got to call this tricky. This is, you know, your thing. So I said, all right, cool. But then I'm writing all the lyrics and I'm writing the songs for Martina, but I'm not even on there. So it's almost like the first one, Aftermath, happened as an accident. I just did a vocal. And then it was almost like, ah. that sounds like that's my thing. But then also it had to do with, if I'm going under this name Tricky, my name, which I had before the music, this was my nickname, I've got to put my voice on there somewhere. And I can't sing. And I want into rapping then. Like, on my new album now, there's me kind of like rapping. It's more like, it's like a rap album. But when I did Max and Quay, I didn't want anything. to do with rap. I listened to rap and I loved hip hop and some of the music is influenced from hip hop but I didn't want to be a rapper. I felt like I'd grown out of being a rapper, you know, so that was the only way I could get my vocal on there. I wanted to ask you about working with Island Records and with Chris Blackwell. Wonderful. Yeah, you've spoken very, very fondly. That was like, I feel sorry for new artists, you know. It's difficult now. If a new artist on the label, if they don't get it. in their first couple of singles they don't get a hit they usually get dropped chris blackwell bob marley when he first came out saw no records it wasn't till his third album he started selling you too didn't sell tom waits didn't sell Grace Jones didn't sell straight away. He believed in supporting an artist and he believed there would be change. If the artist is good enough, there would be a change. Polly Harvey, PJ Harvey, she didn't sell no records in her first couple of albums. You know, you go on YouTube and some of her songs are like some of her best songs. There's only like 20,000 views on there. That was a time when music mattered. Music doesn't matter so much anymore. It's like, yes, it is newspaper. You know, it's like music, the old vibe, the energy of it, it's become a business now. You know, music is designed to steal from children's pockets money. That's why they have Justin Timberlake or Justin Bieber and Justin Timberlake. It's all the same thing. There wasn't a teen market. You know, the teen market was invented. This has been invented by the corporate companies. Like, if you see the specials, if you go back and watch some of the specials, live shows, they were young men playing to young kids. The corporate companies developed this teen thing because they know it's kids who buy the music, spend the money, bug their parents, spend their own pocket money on it. and it's a huge market so they had to develop a teen market and by doing that it was like getting loads of young kids getting someone to write their songs it's not actually real there's no there's no teen market as such that's just made up back then chris i can remember i missed the interview with time magazine in new york and i went up to chris blackwell's house afterwards He said, you're funny. And I said, why is that, Chris? He goes, people like Bill Clinton are trying to get to do interviews with time and you miss it. He supported me in anything I wanted to do. And, you know, I never knew how many records I sold on Ireland. I never found that out until when I signed to Hollywood Records to do Blowback. There was this guy, Robert Covello. He's like an old school egomaniac. And when I first had the meeting with him, he's a well-known guy, Robert Covello. And his son is a producer. His son's a good guy, though. But Robert Covello, again, he's a bit old school. And he gave me the Prince talk. He worked 99.9 album, whatever. he said to me, we're sat there and he's in a big chair and I'm in a little chair over there and he said, you know, when we did the Prince album, I said to him, you need that one more track, you know? And then he come up with 1999 and I said, well, did you write that? Did you? He said, no, no, but you know, he's trying to say he inspired it. Taking credit. I just said to the dude, do you know what? that you want to do business with me and then he said how many records you sold i don't know i just thought i had you know what i don't have a clue and he goes oh you don't know how many records you sold i said because me and chris never talked about it me and chris blackwell you see each other all the time we never discussed how many records i sold and i don't think he cared because his attitude was do you know what You two are huge. That's support tricky to do what he wants to do. So that's over. You've got the independent labels trying to do their thing, but music will never be like that again because it's like big business. So you started your own label, False Idols. Yeah. In some way, are you trying to recapture that? Yeah, but it's impossible, but... I can support artists, you know, like I can say, like with Francesca Balmonti, she's going to go on to do another deal now. But I started off her career. I helped start her career. And the album she did with me, we released, she don't have to have a hit record. She knows I believe in her talent, so I can support people and be like, look, I don't care how many. As long as we don't lose money, you don't need to make me money. do what you want to do musically. And like, for instance, like if I've got artists and they come to me, I could give you an opinion and say, well, I don't really think that track's good, but they only say you have to listen to me because I don't like it. It doesn't mean someone else might not. You've got to... Do you really believe in what you're doing? And if I've got an artist, there's no way Chris, if I did 10 albums with Chris, there's no way I'd expect him to like everything. That is not the point of it, trying to please Chris Blackwell. I was trying to express myself so I can give what Chris has given to me in a smaller version. That's the object of false idols. Do you still have somebody like that in your life, whether it be Chris or somebody else who is just... Horst. Horst. Yeah, he supports me. Sometimes I think Horst sees things in me I don't see in myself because he's like a real support. He wants false idols to do well and he thinks I should be bringing... new talent and introducing people to music and um i put out too much music but what supports me like what do you mean too much well you know you've got a fan base right there's only so much you're going to support of you if you've got this out this out this out so you can't flood the market almost And Horace, I'll do something and he's like, oh, my God, where are we going to put this? But instead of, like, saying, do you know what, you need to stop for a while, you say, like, we'll find a way of doing it. He's like my Chris Blackwell now. And I'm still in contact with Chris as well. In 2012, there were a bunch of live dates that you did performing. In Bristol. Yeah. Yeah. I think Bristol won in London. Yeah, there's one in Sundance, London. Yeah. Is a date that I remember seeing. What kind of preceded that decision for you and Martina to kind of come together again? A tax bill. Yeah, I owed like, I think it was $200,000 or pounds to tax. And they were getting quite heavy. But I was just like, I moved around so much, I just went about paying my tax at the time. I was just like, you know, I live in New York, then I live in LA, and da-da-da-da-da. So I just wasn't on top of things, you know? And I didn't really get the all tax thing. It's like mafia, isn't it? It's like, that's protection. It's like... why do I work and then I have to pay these people for what? You ain't building no roads, you ain't building no hospitals, where's this money going to? So I had a big tax bill at the time, so that's the only reason I did that. Because I know I could get good, quick money for that. It feels like there's been rumours swirling for years that perhaps you and Massive Attack will... collaborate again or perhaps you've recorded material or you'd go on tour again like is it something that you're willing to to speak on a little bit yeah I've thought about it no I just don't see the point of it I just I just don't really like 3D one of the reasons he's very successful he's very persistent he's been going on now and me for a long time about uh this track we did five years ago and he wants to use it now. My manager is like, why not do it? And I'm like... There's nothing against those guys. I met up with Dee and stuff. It was funny. And I actually talked to him last week. We were talking. It was funny. And we've had our ups and downs. But when there's been so much time in between, you forget about it. It's like, all right, those days are over. So we talked about it a week ago, and he was just really making me laugh on the phone because he's a really funny guy. And it was almost like there'd been no time between us. When we talked on the phone, it was like I'd seen him yesterday. And it was kind of cool. It was like, wow, we just connected straight away. You know, sometimes you ain't seen someone for a long time. He's still the same guy. I have to think, what is the point of me and them doing music? Unless it's going to be exceptional, it's almost like, what's the point? And I feel like they got their lane. They're the biggest electronic band in the world, which is crazy for how long they've been around. They're huge. They don't need me. I feel like I'm doing something else now. I'm still experimenting as well. I'm still searching where I'm going. You know what I mean? It's like, I ain't trying to do another Max and Quay. I'm trying to grow all the time. So then sometimes I think, how is that going to help me grow to go back and do anything with them? And then my manager says it's a good thing. And D, I spoke to him the other day. So I don't know. I'm kind of... Actually thinking about I had this conversation just before I came here. So I'm thinking about it now. It's like I've got to get back to my manager today to tell him whether They can use this track or not. And he really wants me to do it. Even my cousin Misha. He's like my sister She said just do it. Why do you want to do it? Let him use a track on the album. It'd be good for you But I don't think good for me, you know, I don't Because in the business sense, it probably is good for me. You know, they've got a huge listener. So some people, if I put something on their album, might come back to me and say, all right, who's this tricky guy? you know but then i just think what's the point so i don't know at the moment i'm right right in the in limbo yeah in limbo with it yeah yeah do you consider yourself to be someone who's hard on themselves i'm kind of getting that sense when it comes to music not in real life like in real life kind of very easy going but when it comes to music I'm very very hard on myself like say for instance many years ago Madonna wanted me to do some stuff for her but I know why she wanted me to do it it was because I was trendy I'm not going to help you sell records it's going to be in fact do the exact opposite if I would have done that my career could be a lot different. So I'm hard on myself musically because I'm not going to do something. If I could get a million dollars tomorrow for someone to do something I don't want to do, I'd turn down a million dollars. I'd rather go in. Some of my shows in certain countries are... not as big as they should be. Like even in London, I can only do 3,000 people at the most. That's my own city. There's things I could have done to make that different, but I won't sacrifice my music or do something I don't want to do just to get that. So I'm pretty hard on myself musically, yeah. Speaking of live shows, I hope you won't take this question the wrong way. I feel like perhaps in the earlier part of your career there were maybe some shows that didn't go ahead or that for various reasons people kind of came away from those performances feeling like you weren't present or et cetera, et cetera. Like how are you willing to talk a little bit about that, first of all, and how perhaps that's changed for you if you've got a different... relationship with performing? When I first started performing, it's difficult. It's a new thing. When I was with Massive Attack, they only got a live band after me. When I did my thing, I've always had a live band. So, um... After Massive Attack with the Turntables, I didn't want to do that anymore. So it was hard. But then again, I don't care about that. You know what I mean? If people go away feeling whatever they want, it doesn't worry me at all. I don't even think about it. I don't care what anybody thinks. First of all, it's like, say me and my band, I always say to them, The main thing is we have a good time on stage. Don't fake it. Don't be unreal. I don't want no secondhand emotions, any of the stupid quivering mouths and pretending you're into it and dance moves. Be real. There's no change. People know, don't change before you get on show as well. My band know. You wear what you wear in the day. Whatever you get up and put on, that's what you're wearing on stage. I don't want to go in a dressing room and see you getting changed for a stage. It's got to be real. And then put 100% of your soul. And that's all we can do. Everybody else, I don't really care about it. Speaking of dance moves, I'm sorry, I have to ask you about Beyonce and Glastonbury. Was that terrifying? Right, that was TERRIFYING. Like, not because I've headlined a classroom before, I think many years ago. I think I headlined it, but yeah. So I've done huge crowds. It's not the crowd, but the smoke. Just the machine around her. The dancers, the lights. When I go on stage, it's intimate. It's not a show like synchronized dancing. It's intimate. There was lights, there was smoke, there was dancers. And it just wasn't my thing. It just wasn't me. So it was just like, and I didn't realise it until I walked on there. So it was funny because she's such a nice girl. Such a nice girl. And I was kind of like shocked how she handles things. She's just like. I said to her, do you realise you're one of the biggest artists in the world? Because she just answers it well. I don't think I can answer that being Beyonce. You know, you can't go anywhere. Like, you know, after this, I could go to a bio store. buy my food, sit and have a cup of tea. If I walk down the street, maybe one or two people notice me and they don't bother me. But Beyonce couldn't walk down the street now. I wouldn't want that. So I was just impressed with her. But then when you get on stage, so I'm dealing with her because I was talking with her, you know? And then going on the stage, it's like from this girl, she's a small little girl as well, you know, really nice. And then it was just like, you walk into a machine. Yeah. And it was like... I'm not business. I give 100% of my soul, but I'm not a business-minded person. I just couldn't believe it. And the dancers. There's not much atmosphere on a bright, lit-up daylight stage. You can't lose yourself. You can't close your eyes and lose yourself and get into it. Forget that. You have to be professional. Her show is very professional. My show is more like voodoo. It's like the Beyonce thing was big business. So it was just like, wow. I got a lot of respect for how she handles it. Because I don't know... I don't have the temperament to handle that. Right. And I don't think I can deal with the pressure. But at the same time, what you've just mentioned about your own kind of performances, if it's something as intense as something like voodoo or kind of a spiritual experience, it sounds like it must be quite taxing, like quite exhausting in a way to give of yourself that much. This is why sometimes... you get into the drinking afterwards, right? You like, get on stage, you give 100% of your soul, and then when you get back in the dressing room, it's just quiet. It's just like, there's nothing glamorous about touring. As soon as you're off on that stage and you go into that dress room, the dress room is just like this. You don't get a fancy dress room. And that's everybody. I can remember watching a documentary about Elvis and he was doing the shows in Vegas. He's one of the biggest artists in the world. And they had backstage... They were filming backstage and the dressing room was just like, I was like, wow, even Elvis is in a crap dressing room. Right. Because it don't matter, some of the best places you play, some of the dressing room, it's just a room, you know? After you give out all that energy and then you come back and it's just quiet. And then sometimes the band are packing up, you know, my drummer and everything. So I'll be in the dressing room by myself. So you've gone from a huge high. So then it's like, all right, I'm going to have a whiskey then. You know, you start trying to find that vibe again and it's never going to happen. So now it's like I go with a trainer now. So when I do a show, I train afterwards or I train before. So I'm totally exhausted and then just back to the hotel. At what point did you start using that as a strategy to deal with that kind of like imbalance of energy from touring? Like, is that something quite recent or? I've had a trainer for a while, but it started back when I knew my health wouldn't continue. There's no way you could do a four-week tour and drink every night. Like a few years ago, I'd drink half a bottle of whiskey in a night. Like on stage. And what's funny is I don't drink. You'll never find any alcohol in my house. And I'm not the sort of guy to go for a beer. I don't really socialise. I watch people. So I go to a cafe, get a mint tea, a peppermint tea, and I watch people. That's my Same thing, Friday night, I'll go get a tea, sit out one inside one of the Turkish restaurants and just watch people. And then I'll go home, 10 o'clock, I'm listening to music, I'm in bed by 12 o'clock. my life isn't really exciting I don't party a lot you know so from not drinking at home and then drinking a half a bottle of whiskey on stage it's just like your body there's no way your body can cope with it and a few years ago I got sick because you know alcohol is um it's a chemical imbalance you keep drinking we are chemicals and you know it gives us an imbalance So I was just like, just not great, you know, and I could feel just like being exhausted all the time. So I just said I had to stop it. Has that had an effect on your music, you think? Not at all, because I've never drank, I've never, never drank and made a song in my life, ever. Never made a song with alcohol, ever. May I ask you about weed? I smoke now and again, but not like I used to. It got to a point where, like, I get somewhere, I fly somewhere, and I need someone to have to be there. And it's like, you've got to have weed for me when I get there. You're like a slave to it. I smoke now and again and now, but I could go fly somewhere, not get it and not worry about it. But before I had to have it. And I didn't like that, being a slave to this. You know, I used to tell the promoter as soon as I get off that plane to have weed in the car for me for when we're driving. I just think that's just ridiculous. There's a documentary that you did a few years ago. I was watching clips of it. too long ago and you were talking about that exact thing of yeah I didn't want to be I don't want to be a slave to it but I saw smoke landing in but it's not a factor like it was yeah was there any fear in letting that go in terms of how it may affect you creatively no no he's um Being creative is in you or ain't in you. No weed, no drug, no, you know, you say people like, you know, you've had artists who took heroin because they want that heroin sound. If you've been through certain things and if you can feel, if you're sensitive, that's going to come out without, to me, the more healthy you are, the better your music's going to be. The healthier you are, the more focused you are. So I think the healthier you are, the better, you know, I train three times a week. So to me, like that tortured artist drugged up, that's all rubbish. Does it at all bother you, though, that people may still perceive you as kind of a tortured artist just based on the kind of... sound signatures that you've had over the years? I don't care about people, how they perceive me. It doesn't matter to me. Like, how someone perceives me, I don't know about it because that's not part of my life. There's people who follow me who don't know me, so they're bound to have... their own story about me. You know, it's like, I get some people, like I had someone on Instagram the other day saying, do you remember me from some girl from 20 years ago? It's like, what makes you think I'm going to remember you? Do you think that much of yourself that you met me in a club twice, maybe, and you're my friend? She's like, I'm your friend from back in that... No, you're not. Because all my friends, I remember. I know where they live. You know, I could call them now. One guy from my... He said, don't you talk to your old mates anymore. I was like, listen, when I lived in Nor, I know you from school, but we were never mates. So it That's obviously his perception. He thought we were mates. I know differently. So it's not worth worrying about that stuff. When did you move away from... From Norwest? Yeah. At what age? 15. But I didn't really move away. I moved down the road. Right. I still stayed with my friends. But moving away was good though because I moved to an easier place. It's still... a street place, but it was easier, a lot easier. It was closer to town. and stuff. But I still hung out in Norwest and Arkliffe, because I grew up in Norwest, and some of the time in the rival area, Norwest and Arkliffe guys don't really get on. Territorial. Yeah. But I grew up in Arkliffe as well some of the times. So I grew up and I nearly went to Arkliffe school, but I couldn't have got away with that. because I was from North. I kind of didn't leave the area as such, if you know what I mean. It wasn't until I moved to London that I really left North West. Right. And you've kind of been on the move ever since, more or less. But I was in North West about four months ago. It's not changed at all. It's just not changed whatsoever. But you've changed. Yeah, yeah, I've changed. But the place is still the same, which is kind of beautiful in some ways and sad in the other. But it's kind of strange going back there. I'm seeing people I haven't seen from school and stuff, and sometimes I can't remember them. Does it feel like home when you're back there? No. it's too rough for me. I said to my auntie, I don't know how I survived there. It's a rough place. You know, it ain't the Bronx, but it's a rough, rough place. I think I'm just too mellow for that. You know, you've got to be kind of tough in a way to be there. Mentally tough and physically tough. That's just not me, you know. So you think it was luck that got you through? No, I was part of it then. I was a Nor'wester. There's young guys who don't know me there. My family used to run that place. Like Bristol, my family used to run Bristol. My uncles, they ran that there. There's no doubt about it. If you ask who my uncles were, they were the biggest things in Bristol. My family, the Goffers, they were very well known. I was always known as a Goffery. And this is where all my best friends were. So I had no problems, but going back now, people don't know me. To them, I'm a stranger. So, you know, I've had, you know, guys test me and stuff. Like, when I'm there, I'm testing me. But usually I've got a few people with me, you know what I mean? Some guys who don't know who I am, and they're thinking, who's this guy? Why is he? Because when you're not from the West, you go there, people You could go on the green there, there's a green called Melvin Square, stand there and then cars just start driving past, seeing who you are. If you're like with a group of people, people start coming out. I did filming up there a few years ago, filming on the grass, like for this kind of internet thing showing where I'm coming from. Cars came round, people looking, then it was someone recognised me. But until then, there could have been a problem. And then they said, oh, no, that's the Goffrey. And then it was all right. That sounds fairly nerve-wracking to be kind of moving through a space or moving through your community and feeling like... you're kind of being watched and evaluated and you need to kind of be vouched for to... Well, when you're well-known as well, you become... Like, for instance, Mike Tyson. Who would want to fight Mike Tyson? People will test him, Mike Tyson, because he's Mike Tyson. Right. If you've done OK for yourself, you become a target. It's just natural. I don't have security, but I've got friends who live that life. I've got cousins, I've got uncles, I've got nephews. So if I'm going to a certain place, I'll go with certain people who know, like my uncle. I've been out with my uncle. My uncle's knocked people out in a club, straight in a club. For testing us. That's not my life. I've moved away from there. But if you do want some of that, though, you know, I'm not an idiot and I've got people around me. So certain places you've just got to go. Certain places you've got to go with certain people if you want to go to those certain places. Or lock yourself off and just go to the high-end places and stuff like that. So is it a... I don't know, maybe I'm putting words in your mouth. Is it something of a relief to be able to do the things that you mentioned before about being in Berlin, being able to go and sit in a cafe quietly and just observe? To be too famous. The talent thing is not how we say it. It's talented. It's a great thing. In Latin, it means heavy burden. With talent. Sometimes comes fame, and fame causes mental illness. Look how many famous people are sick on drugs or they've got problems like Kanye West, for instance. You can't tell me he's a well man. You love yourself that much. there's got to be something wrong with you. And no disrespect to him at all. I've never met the guy. But saying, you know, they'll be writing about me when I'm gone and, like, if it was back in the days, I'd be one of the 12 disciples. He's like, there's something wrong with you. And it's fame. Fame. strokes the ego and just blows things out of all context and it takes you away from real life. I don't want to end up like Kanye West. like his life is a movie you know it's like only thing would make you start thinking like that so um that's something I've always been wary of and it's like I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it if someone wants to be famous but like being a doctor or being a lawyer being a singer that's an occupation being famous is like some people just want to be famous you don't know nothing about fame why would you want to be famous what does it what you've got to be really insecure to want to be famous I can understand wanting money or wanting success But one in theme, I don't get that. Yeah, I just wanted to ask you one last thing, because it seems like a lot of the albums, specifically the album titles of albums that you've released previously, have spoken directly to either your life, as we spoke about Maxine Quay and Adrian Thors and Noel Westboy, etc, etc. What is Skilled Mechanics going to be saying about you? Skilled Mechanics is a rap album. It's the first album where it's mostly me on the vocals. People for many years have been saying, would I ever do an album which is prominently me doing the vocals? With Tricky, I like writing for females. It's like you give a female your words and they change them. It changes when they come out of their mouth when it's recorded. So Skill Mechanics is like, even though it's not a hip-hop album, but there's some rap on there and there's some stuff like... which is really weird, there's a song called Boy, it could have been written 20 years ago, about, I met my dad in the phone book, I found him in the phone book, I'd seen my dad when I was young, but I was too young to remember him, and then I was looking for a phone book in my auntie's house, I always used to look for the phone book, looking for my last name. I think subconsciously that's probably looking for identity. Then I found my last name, which is an unusual last name. So I said to my auntie, who's this with my name? And she goes, it's your dad. Why don't you call him? So I called him. And when I used to go and see him, he used to forget my name and call me boy. And that's the song starts off. When I was 12, I found my dad, his name was Roy. He'd forget my name and call me boy. And it goes on about my mum's suicide and then me and Whitley hustling and getting up to stuff. And it's like a true story. A true, true story. It's more personal lyrics than on... any of my albums like boy is more personal which is funny because it's more of a rap song but it's um more personal than anything on max and quay and it's like it's my it's my story and there's nothing on that song which isn't real about my uncle being murdered and hearing my nan scream because the police came to the house. Because the police used to raid my house, you know, they used to come looking for stuff and, you know, hassle me sometimes because I was known for certain things. So... I thought they were coming from me. But when you see a police woman and a police man, you know that's bad news. Because that's to give you some serious bad news. They ain't coming to arrest you like that. You know? They usually come with a van. I seen them out the window and they said my nan's name. She said, are you Dada Godfrey? She said, yeah. She goes, your son has been murdered. And my nan screamed like, but not like a scream I've ever heard before. It was, I've never heard a scream like that. This was a, it was like a, more like an owl. I pretend I was asleep and my nan's a strong woman. Next day I was going to school and she got me up for school, cooked me and my sister's breakfast and I pretend it didn't happen. because I didn't want to talk to her about it. And she didn't mention a word. She didn't say anything, nothing at all. She got us ready for school. She sent us off. When we got back, she made our tea. You know, I went out with my friends and never said a word and just got on with it. She's a very strong lady. And it's like I've had two murders in my family. Two murders. You know, my cousin was shot in the back of his head. And My Uncle Was Stamped to Death. It's a song, every word in this song is just actual fact. And that's indicative of the album? That kind of real... Yeah, it's like... Honest. It's an album I could have done if, when I left Massive Attack, if I was still into rap. It's the album I would have done instead of Max and Quaid probably if I wouldn't have found Martina almost like Like when I did Max and Quaid I didn't want to rap anymore I just was not into and I've never really rapped it was more spoken word, but I didn't really even want to do that Skill mechanics, it's not even smoking word. It's loud in your face. It's the loudest I've ever... I always put myself back in the mix. This is the loudest you've ever heard me. And it's like one of the few songs you probably understand every word I'm saying. Because a lot of the times you can't understand some of the things I'm saying. So it's like really in your face. At 12 I met my dad. His name was Roy. He'd forget my name and call I met a girl, I jumped for joy Stealing cars and play with toys No time to grow, cause my mother go To the other side, she chose suicide But I can't complain, though I miss her such Got some sisters, but we don't stay in touch I dream, I dream, I dream I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Smoke weed in council flats Until my lungs collapse My uncle's earned with muscle Me and Whitley hustle Keep the dream alive And try to sign with Russell And get a record deal But Whitley's way too real My nana lost my mum Then she lost her son Those memories ripe Kill my uncle Mike. Heard my nana scream. No, it's not a dream. I dream I'm drowning. Asleep into the darkness. But I dream I'm drowning. Asleep into the darkness.
