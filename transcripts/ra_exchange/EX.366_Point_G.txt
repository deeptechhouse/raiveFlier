Bye. Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Point G. Gregory Darcer describes his early Point G productions as "beginner's tracks" produced while completely stoned on an SP-1200 sampler. But these 12" contains some of the chunkiest house tracks made in the late 90s. Tunes like "Chicken Coma" just do not go out of style, but at the time they didn't make much of an impact. They since became cult classics and D'Arce was thrown back into the project in 2013 following represses of his early work. In the meantime, he made a prodigious amount of music as DJ Gregory and as a higher producer in the early 2000s. But as Antoine Carbonneau found out a few months back in Darce's Parisian studio, Point G is again filling the frame. giving the project a new lease on life that's seen DASA return to making some essential house music. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Point G is up next. Thank you. Hello, Gregory. Hello, Antoine. How are you? I'm good. And you? Very fine. Thank you. Thank you for having us today. We are in your studio, surrounded by your vinyls. How many do you have here? Honestly, I think I couldn't tell anymore. As you saw, there is a vinyl in the living room also. I've been buying records since... 88. So I just don't count anymore. Are you still buying records? Yeah. What kind of stuff do you buy these days? Still the same as before, you know, everything. That's the problem because I love to sample. I love also the records to play, you know, in the clubs. So I buy all kinds of music and I love to discover music all the time. And so you're releasing the Point G Experience. So it's going to be on vinyl, actually. Actually, the Point G Experience is an album that is going to be on digital, as I did four years of vinyl only on Point G Records. And this is going to be the second compilation. I did a compilation last year. And this is a new one. So tell us the story of the project. So you're starting to produce under the Pongy moniker, but you actually started doing stuff. back in the in the 90s under point g yes actually back in the 90s i did start as dj gregory i had a radio show in paris called a deep groove a deep groove means alex deep and gregory so it was a midday mix from monday to saturday with alex from tokyo and dj deep We were playing basically what we liked, which was Chicago House, New York Garage, all kinds of tracks, the early Detroit stuff and some disco stuff. I was pretty young, you know, back then, and I slowly start to to learn how to make music. And we had, you know, some some dads. like Chaz and Laurent Garnier and Ludovic Navarre from Saint-Germain. So as I was very much hypnotized by the sound of New York and I was going to New York every year, As my best friend moved to New York in 1990, I was going there on vacation every summer, sometimes in the winter. And I was completely blown away by the sound of the early Masters at Work stuff, the very first Sandy Rivera stuff, you know, when he did K.O.T. on Black Whiz, the beginning of Mood to Swing, the Merck records, and of course, Todd Terry, you know. I did both an SP-1200 because I understood that this was the sampler that could make those type of groove with that type of sound. So as I was learning the process of making music, right after Sunshine People on Versatile, that I did for Gilbert. Alain, DJ Yellow from Yellow Productions, did ask me to... because he knew that I was making a lot of beats with this SP-1200, you know, recording on that, you know, back then, sequenced also with... an Atari 1040. It was like, you know, I love those beats that you have on your DAT and I would love to release a project with those beats. Dub oriented, very minimalistic and very raw. So this was back in 97. I was a bit shaky, you know, because I was still learning. And to me, if you weren't doing Frankie Knuckles or David Morales or all the type of, you know, music masters at work and everything. you weren't supposed to show off too much. But after a while, as I was playing the tracks on acetate, because I was making acetates in New York of those cuts, I felt, okay, maybe we can do it. And this is how... I came with Alain and the Yellow Production crew with the very first Pongy Records, which is the raw EP. So what was your mindset? when you were producing under the point G moniker? It was very simple. No, you know, I mean, the idea was to have some beats between the vocal. For your DJ set? Yes, exactly. Because, I mean, I was playing a lot of garage stuff. And those days were very much, you know, a lot of vocal, amazing stuff. So it was, you know, to have some beats, some tools, some tracks between the vocal. Compared to your DJ Gregory production, we're more like a produced. That became produced. It took some time. It took 97, 2003. It took six years before we have the very produced DJ Gregory. I did a lot of stuff between the very first Pongy and the beginning of Fire Combo, which is a completely different story, but yes. Yeah, because when you're listening to the raw EP, it's very different. The sound, the Pongy sound is very different to the DJ Gregory remix. You really sound versatile at the same time. Yes, I know, actually, because the equipment was pretty much the same, but it was the same year. Once again, you know, I love mixing genre and I love all kinds of stuff. And for this, and back then, you know, even though I was very much into the sound I told you about, the filter, the disco filter stuff, you know, became very popular. In the underground, not on the other on the other ground. The other ground came right after like a year after or slightly a bit after, you know, but in 97, it was very much still inspired by, you know, the sound of Chicago with a relief, the sound of New York from Henry Street from, you know, guys like DJ Snake, Nicky P, all those people. So when I did remix the track of Gilbert he had a sample but as I was a bit confused I didn't know what to do I did an original track but with another sample. just to stay on the line. And I gave him this original called Sunshine People as a remix. So what was the reception of your first Pongy records on Yellow Production? Because Sunshine People was like a big track played all the time. Yeah, it was huge. The sales were crazy, actually. Yeah, man. And it never stopped because it has been reissued every three years. since then still nowadays yeah what can i say it's uh do you know the numbers no i don't know the numbers but what i do know is that it's that uh it's a remix so i just got a small fee for a remix but you know i mean i was young and i was learning and this you know this is the this is the game also So what about the first Pungi? The first Pungi was more into this deep house garage scene. And for example, I remember I gave the acetate of the track that is on the EP called Jean-Claude to Joe Clossel back then, you know. He was playing it a lot, actually. Were you close to the New York scene? Yeah, I lived in New York from 98 to 2000. But before that... I was going in New York every year. So you would meet with the producer? Yeah, but, you know, I mean, I was the kid around, you know. So when you see a kid in parties all summer long, in the record store all day long, every day. Yes, of course, when I moved, also, I was, as I had the radio show, when I was going to New York, I was making interview for the radio. So this is how I met everybody. Actually, I met Sandy. when he did Black Whiz at the very beginning, but through the interview. I met John Cutler. He was working at the way before Distance. Distant or Distance, I forgot. Way before he had his label, he was working at the distribution for DJ Duke. You know, all those type of... Were you talking production with these guys, these producers? Yeah, a little bit. I remember I used to hang a little bit with Matteo and Matos. They were doing the final cut label stuff. And I had some acetate. I had some stuff, you know. But once again, you know, I was in the learning process. So you said when you were a teenager, you spent your summer in New York. But after that, you actually moved to New York. What was the reason why you moved there? The reason is very simple. So in 1998, I had the radio show. The first year, it was a deep groove with DJ Deep and Alex from Tokyo. Then Alex went back to Japan because he finished his study in France. But then he went back to Japan. DJ Deep... moved to Radio Nova and I kept the radio show for 13 years in a row. This is why I was doing the interview in the summer in New York and everything. But you know, I mean, I was then, because of the radio show, getting some bookings, you know, in Paris with the TGV party, with the first parties of Pedro Winter. that were garage and house at the beginning, played at the Palace. A lot of different type of gigs I did for four years. Still learning the process of making music, but I missed the idea of going to New York for a little bit. So in 98, I was like, okay, I'm young enough to move there. This is the right time. And I moved to New York for two years. And this is exactly where I really learned the production process, hanged more and more with the DJs and the producer. Even there, to be very honest with you, what I did wasn't that, you know, that mental. What did you produce there? I did a few remixes. One of my friends, Mandrax, who was a DJ in Switzerland, had a room. We were living in the same building and he had a room at Tommy Musto, a Northcott production office. And actually Tommy, that used to make music. with Frankie Bones. He was doing Tommy Musto and Bones. And then he created the label Suburban with Victor Simonelli. And then he did start heavily the Northcott production process with a label like Henry Street. He was the very first one to sign Yoruba Records. This is how I met Osun Lade at the very, very beginning. A lot of label. And of course, he had the studio, you know, where he was producing all those vocals and remixes. And I was hanging there every day, all the time, all the time. So back then, you know, I mean, I was playing a little bit. at the 205, a bit at the Shelter, who became the vinyl, some parties here and there, the thing for respect, you know, when they were coming to New York for the PS1 stuff and everything. I did a remix for Terry Hunter. I did, this is when I met Mousty at the early Peppermint Jam stuff. So I did a remix for Musti, a few stuff, a few beats and pieces. This is when actually I did start the SOA project with Julien Jabre. And Julien was very close with two kids, Michael and Maxime, who did start a label called Basic. It was very much a very deep house label. Can you explain who's Julien Jabre? Julien Jabre that I did met in 94. came one day with a tennis racket and a friend of him called Lionel Riley. They were listening to the show and they wanted to meet Cyril, DJ Deep, who wasn't there that day. So instead of saying, I'm starting the show, you have to leave the room, I told them, why don't you stay? And we became friends. It's really as simple as that. And they were involved more and more and more and more in music. They were students back then, but I think two years after. after Julien stopped his study and really went to do the music production. And this is how actually he did the project called The Deep with Cyril, with DJ Deep, with that track, that famous track called Dum Dum Jump. But after a while, they split. And he was a bit, you know, he was a bit confused. And I told him, why don't you come to New York? I mean, I have everything. I have the flat. I have the equipment. You've never been to New York. Come. We hang out. We go out. And maybe we do something. And this is how we did start slowly the SOA project. And the two first releases were on basic recording for the label of Michael and Maxime. Because... We did, you know, the very first SOA stuff in New York. And I was messing around all the time, of course, you know, with the SP-1200 and, you know, the synth. And one day I did a track, you know, very kind of KOT oriented, early KOT. oriented with a twist you know i called it underwater and michael and maxim really liked it and they were like man we want to sign this track and i was like yeah of course you know we had a very good relation and this is how the track was released the first time were you happy with this track because yeah very happy actually very happy Because when I'm listening to you, I have the feeling that you were a bit frustrated with your first production. You think that they were like tools, not really finished? Or is it the look you have nowadays? Yeah, but you know, it's much more a spirit. You have the people, they spend 20 minutes on a track and they think they are a genius. Me, I'm going to spend years and years in making music. And I still, still nowadays, I'm still shaky and I'm always... To me, the process of making music is a miracle. How did you record Underwater? What's the story behind the track? Actually, if you listen to the other stuff that I did before New York on Backup, the B&O beats and all that type of stuff, I just don't know why. And there's also some unreleased stuff that I have here that maybe I could release one day. I always had an open mic where I was saying some stuff or whispering with delays to give a dub feel. Underwater is really, to me, is really the stoner track. I mean, I was in New York and back then I was younger and smoking weed all the time. So this is for me the stoner track. You are stoned behind your console and you do mute. and you tweak the synth and you let it go, you know. So, and what happened when the track got released? Did it work? Yeah, it worked nicely. You know, I mean, back then the sales were different. So, it was a nice one. It wasn't a crazy one. But as I recall, we sold 4,000, 5,000. But in those days, you know, we didn't... have internet or maybe no I think it was maybe slowly starting no CD pressing it was really just about vinyl so people were buying vinyl like crazy because I'm asking you this because the track after like maybe 10 years got like famous again on dance floors you have like people that were asking you if they could reissue it I think the first one was Loco Dice. No, alors, what happened... is that in 2000, I went back in Paris and I had a studio, which is a long story, for quite a long time in Paris with Michael and Maxime and Julien. And this is when I did the Africanism. I did start the Africanism a bit before, but the Africanism day, Les Enfants du Bled with Julien, the Faya combo years released in the UK. The Prasai stuff that were on Wall of Sound after. All those stuff, you know, that were produced in big studios. But after a while, you know, we were all done because it's always very difficult. to see someone every day, day after day. After a while, you need to do your way. So I went in Amsterdam for, I think, three years. Three years, yeah. Three years, and at the end, I remember I did a party at the June. In Amsterdam, you know, there is the ADE. So sometimes, because I was there, I was seeing, you know, some DJs, some French friends. And in Amsterdam, if I do remember, Jules, DJ Jules, told me, oh, man, do you have this raw EP? And like the huge amount of my records. were in my dad's basement, you know. So I couldn't, and I was like, yeah, maybe I have some, but I just, I can't reach those records for the moment. It was like, yeah, because, you know, it's cool. Really, I didn't understand. Because this were my first row, you know, and my first step, let's say, first step. And then, you know, I did a party at the June, still living in Amsterdam. If I do recall, Loco Dice was at the table, Jules, a few other French DJs. But again, you know, Jules told me, yeah, you know, actually, it would be cool if I could reissue those early Pongy. And really, and I was like, man, why do you keep? And he was like, yeah, because, I mean, we are playing those beats lately. And I see Loco Dice that says, yes, we are playing it, you know. I mean, those are super cool beats. And it's like a bottle of wine. You have certain wine, they need time to, you know, to grow. So as soon as I moved back to Paris four years ago. I get a call. Hello, this is Dan Genassia. I was like, yeah, Dan, how are you? He was like, do you own the right of underwater? I was like, yes, of course I do. We're going to start a new label called Apollonia. And we would like to reissue underwater. as the first release. I was a bit shocked, honestly. I was like, yeah, but why? What are you going to put on the B side? Underwater. I was like, you want to put underwater on the A side and the B side. Yes, exactly. I was like, you have to explain to me. And it was like, it's very simple. We used to play this track so much at the Zebr, you know, the party that they had in Paris a long time ago. We love that track. It's a classic for us. So I want to have it on A side and B side because it's going to be played big time. And I was like, "Okay, man, if you think so, if you say so, okay, let's do it." And this is how the project restart. So that was the first Pongy release. In years? Because you've stopped producing under this moniker, actually. No, I didn't start. Actually, I didn't start to produce with this moniker. The very first release that I did was under Cheesy D. With a track called Take the Cash and Run. With a sample of Serone. It was in 96. But after, I did a few stuff, sometimes with no name. have been point g because it was beats like the bno beats for example you don't have any name but it's much more pointy stuff but from 98 2014 yeah there's no pointy records because As soon as I get back to Paris and slowly start concepting music-wise the idea of Africanism and then following on the Faya Combo era and everything, it was DJ Gregory. And also because when I was playing in the club, it was DJ Gregory. It wasn't Pongy. So Pongy was completely far. Very far. For me, it was my youth, you know, when I was a kid and slowly starting to learn how to make music. And how would you compare the two, DJ Gregory and Point G? It's very simple. Point G, we talk about rough stuff. Basic would be the word. Basic stuff, rough, swingy. loopy, but basic stuff. DJ Gregory, much more musical, much more a mix of genre, you know, like for example, you take a track like Solaris, there is kind of an epic feeling with a disco beat. but you don't... I like sometimes like the Prasay, the Cruzin, or even everybody always told me, ah, Gregory is doing the percussion, the percussion, but it's not about the percussion. It's just that if you take a track like Hell, for example, for me, according to me, it's much more like a movie soundtrack, like that says something, and Hell means she. So I was talking about... a girl it's much more an idea the percussion behind is just a rhythm to tell something but with I wanted to have just this balayaric tropical feeling to feel like a wet feeling with a lot of layers actually it's above a lot of layers it's layers and layers and put some layers and some synths and you take it off and you put some new ones and then you change everything. It's about taking time and having hopefully something that could last a little bit. But it's difficult, honestly, it's difficult because, I mean, you know. You spend a lot of time producing L, actually. L is the one, actually, it's my favorite track. And I worked three years on it. Three years. So what's the reason it's your favorite track? Because, you know, there is certain track that you do, there's something that goes... above you. It's not you anymore. It's something that goes above. I did start L. It was very with percussion and deep. But then for a year, it was a disco track. I had a lot of sessions with musicians. dope ones and then it went to something like very housey and then back to a certain kind of afro feel but but too much sessions too much musician too much lines and also I didn't want it to have like a musician performance you know because even back then at a certain point 2003 people and we get started to get a bit tired of the really super dope musical line, you know, because House was very basic at the beginning. Then, you know, you had a lot of, not then, because it took some years, more musicality, you know, but too much musicality. So then it became like almost like a lounge. feeling you know and it was a bit annoying so i wanted to have much more something that was not about uh i didn't want it to hear the the musician you know i wanted to have a spirit a feeling this is why actually i mean the the bass player did some lines you you die honestly it was a six strings uh bass uh and at the very end i just looked uh two notes, boo-boo-boo, you know, because I didn't want it to have a... I wanted to have something else. And were you still, without releasing it, but producing Pongy material at the time, or you were focusing on the DJ Gregory sound? I know, we are talking about 2002, 2003, 2001, so no Pongy stuff, no? Even for, like, recreation time? In the studio? Oh, no. I mean, being in the studio is a recreation. You know, as soon as you start to work too much, it's becoming, for me, it's becoming very often boring or too aseptized, clean formatted, you know, boring. So, no, of course, the idea is always to... to have something that has soul. And so after Underwater got reissued on Apollonia, you started producing new beats, pointy beats, actually. The thing is, the record gets reissued. I see the people, some names, new names, big names, that support the record. Are you surprised? A little bit. I was a little bit surprised but I was happy. Actually Frank Roger on Realtone, he did ask me if I had some unrelease. So the door was open. I gave him an unrelease of Chicken Koma with like a reggae bass. And on the B side, something that was, I don't know what to think about it. Something that I did in New York, actually, never released, called Confusion, that I mixed. down at home with Rob Rive who was the engineer of François Kévorquion and other guys and with a vocal with the voice of the wife of John Sheffan, Émilie. I gave him this and I felt, okay, now there's maybe an idea behind it. So maybe I should start a new label, a Point G Records label. I would do vinyl only. And the idea was maybe to getting back in the clubs, maybe not with the DJing, maybe with a live aspect. But as I'm a very simple guy oriented and very much concerned, even if it's raw now that I have a bit of experience, very much concerned about the sound, I wanted to make a live that would be a mix of blending stems and samples of the tracks. So this is the idea that I had. So get back to work. We've, of course, the new, you know, I mean, the way we are making music now, so much more, I took back my MPC-3000 because in 2000, I sold the SP-1200, unfortunately. And I bought an MPC-3000, which is very good too, but it's a different, you know, different groove. And this is how I did start the very first Pongy records and start to work on this idea of live mixing stems and samples with a lot of faders. And that's it. Basic. Once again, basic. The thing is, the first release, there is the track called Indian. Come and dim. And once again, I see that Indian and dim get seriously played. And I see the booking, you know, the people calling so many, you know, for almost four years that were, you know, constantly played. like a roller coaster and now here we are with the release end of May of this new compilation with some new stuff tell me about the live performance because you said you were producing these tracks to be played for live actually yeah and I actually is it a new thing like in terms of process for you when you did that i honestly i love it i love it because you know i've been playing with vinyl for so long and then we we used to mix the cd and the vinyl but this idea of having a lot of faders where you have the kick of this track the hi-hat of this one the bass and the music from another one and and all the sudden it's a constant flu of music that that you know goes up and down Yeah, I kind of like it. And it took me a little while, but and also there is a lot of energy. And because I'm an old schooler, I like energy, you know. I'm not saying to be hard and nuts, you know, but I like the energy. I like the people, you know, to sweat and to, I like this feeling of going on, you know. So what's your life setup? What are you using? As I told you, I use the controllers with long faders, not short ones. Because, how do you say, the length... When the length is too short, you're not able to manipulate the levels. I like the idea of the levels. Even something that could be in the back, but for a long time. And there is the computer and because as I told you, you know, very concerned about the sound, there is the MiTech converter that I use, which is something that normally you put in a studio, but I take it in the clubs. You didn't want to do like an analog live set? No, because if I do, it wouldn't make any sense because the music is not, the music is very sample oriented. So how would you do that? Bringing some MPCs, but then the sound would be unmixed. So then the vibe wouldn't be the same. It would be raw. Yeah, but it would be raw, but not the nice raw. I like when it's raw, but I like when you have a very nice low end. So I'd rather play the kick like that. And that's funny that you say that, but it's another discussion because next year, there's maybe an idea with modular and everything. But this is something else. But no, for this one, it's about stems and samples. It's interesting what you're saying about the project, the upcoming project you're thinking of about doing modular stuff. So you're still looking for new ideas? I know, all the time. I know, but there's a lot of stuff going on. So what is going on besides the point G stuff? Have you stopped doing like DJ Gregory stuff or are you still producing some melodic, rich texture tracks? I'm going to tell you. The thing is, the problem, besides the fact that after those four years, now we have this conversation. There's a new Pongy series that is starting in June called Pongy and the 300 which is going to be 300 limited vinyl, nice ones, so there's going to be two in June that normally I would issue on digital maybe two or three months after but the vinyl will be 300. So there's going to be two releases in June after the compilation. But then, you know, the problem is that I see that I start to put a bit more music in the Pongy stuff. Maybe this is not the best idea, you know. So maybe the best idea would be to... slowly restart Gregory on the side, you know, this would be two different projects and to have this, you know, musicality that I have inside also, you know, that has to be expressed. What about your other monikers, for instance, because you did some... There is Prasay also that I love. Prasay, I love this moniker. But Prasay could be this modular thing. Way darker, more between slightly industrial and a bit chaotic. Do you have other monikers we've never heard of? Yes. Tell us. about it no i can't no i can't no there is some monikers that i took certain years because you know you have you have to pay the rent but uh no i can't okay so we won't we won't know about your secret monikers but what about collaboration because i know there's a lot of people that are coming to this studio to work with you not only this studio I mean even oh tiens for example since the 90s what can I say when I had the SP-1200 sometimes because I did you know tracks for the Source Lab compilation and I did Phantom also you know back then for the French Touch with Virgin and sometimes I got called to make beats for a bit more, not mainstream, but more, yeah, kind of mainstream, trip-hop-ish, vocal-ish project. And I used to come with my SP-1200 and I used to, for example, in the studio in Paris, in 2001 I think 2002 maybe I did almost all the drum programming for the and Julien did the mixing for the A Chaz album always you know yeah in the studio also you know some friends come and And we, you know, we check what we can do. Sometimes they need a bit of keyboard. They need a bit of drum. They need just an advice. But myself too, you know, because it's always interesting to have the opinion of people that you do appreciate. So who are the people who are coming to the studio these days? To the studio, two years ago, we used to hang a lot with Lazaros, Siler came a lot, a lot of people come. And you're close to this new generation of house producers, because the Parisian scene is quite... Yeah, very much. And it's very, for a guy like me, it's very impressive because it goes very fast because this is now what's going on, you know, with the technology and with everything. I mean, maybe I shouldn't say it, but I come from the days with no cellular phone. So if you missed a rendezvous, you were fucked, you know? So now it's going very, very fast. And I'm always amazed to see how much, how fast the music is changing. What's cool in January, it's not that cool in August after, you know. And it's changing and it's evolving and it's pretty disturbing in a way. Are there some like a producer you are like following these days? Like buying all the records, new releases? Buying all the records? No, but I follow a lot of people. I mean, I follow Mandar, I follow Flaber, I follow Popcorn Records, I follow... what Soy is doing. I follow Jules. Actually, I'm going to do something on bass culture. I'm finishing an EP for bass culture that maybe September, October. A lot of... ambiant and techy guys I love the project Sergi Redza I saw them live man it's a serious thing And are you still seeing people like Bob Sinclair, who you spent a lot of time in studio back in the days? Yeah, back in the... We met because Chris was the owner of Yellow Production with Alain, oh, DJ Yellow. And so way before Bob Sinclair, of course, because actually we met. He wasn't making any house music. He was making trip-hop. They were 3 pop DJs, hip hop 3 pop DJs. And we met right after Sunshine People. He was very curious to understand how I did that track. And because I was very close with Alain, we clicked and slowly he did start the project and worked also with Daft Punk for the Jimmy album and i was i was there in this whole you know process and after actually um i hooked him up in new york with a with a vocal in a tommy's studio to record something and when i had my studio in paris before that when i went back from new york to paris we needed to make some acoustic stuff and everything it took a long time so it took seven eight months and so i went for seven eight months in his studio and helped him a little bit he was working on a on Champs-Élysées, I think. Did a lot of drums and stuff like that. And this is when I did start to make some beats a bit more French, tropical-oriented. And I came up with Block Party and Tourment d'Amour. And this is how we did start the Africanism project. And after I did, which was also Les Enfants du Bled. The first day we... entered the studio in Paris when the construction, the building was finished just to test the the cabin, the room, you know, the recording room. Julien was hitting a lot of percussion and screaming and and, you know, moving some bottles, anything, you know, just to see the sound and to record some stuff. And we did Les Enfants du Bled in two hours the same day. This was pretty much also a big track. With another mood, with another story. But, well, this is something else anyway. But so are you still seeing people like Julien Jabre? Yes, of course. Chris is living in L.A. So, and I mean, you know, throughout the years, you know, the way splits a little bit. But, you know, once in a while we send mail, we have a coffee, you know. And, you know, once again, most of those DJs now, they're not in front of the So speaking of Chris, Bob St. Clair, how do you, you were very close and you worked together, but now you like took different paths. How do you look back at your careers respectively? You know, I would say people who know won't tell. And people who tell don't know. What I'm trying to say is you are who you are. So at a certain moment when you get older, you have an idea of what you want that is very clear. So it's not even about the music that you do. You have some people, they are entrepreneurs. They want to build, they want to have a huge career. They decide what they want in life. Other ones, they are more contemplative, they search something else. According to me, he reached exactly what he wanted to have. clearly and I reached more or less exactly what I wanted to have, what I wanted to be, I would say, I would even say. So then what's next for you as a... Point G, DJ Gregory or... I mean, you know, lucky me, I always have a lot of projects in mind. And then you have to make it. You have to make it up. So now there is, you know, this compilation, the Point G experience. There is right after the Point G and the 300, the limited vinyl. And now I start to... There's other stuff. I did a remix for Josh Wink. There's going to be the thing for Bass Culture. I'm working on something for One. You know, a lot of stuff like that. But as I told you earlier, now, after four years of Pongy, I'm going to keep on. And I'm going to... Which I do already. to be honest with you, work on something, maybe not with the name DJ Gregory, maybe, maybe, maybe not, but something that will be more musical. And it's pretty difficult because... because I don't want to make something cheesy. So easy to make something cheesy, man. So many cheesy stuff in the overground and in the underground. Because you are not trying to make something for a wider audience that your music is not cheesy. Thank you. Bye.
