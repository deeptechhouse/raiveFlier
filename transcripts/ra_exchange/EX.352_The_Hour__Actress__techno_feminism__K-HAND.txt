You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour! This! This! This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. The Hour is RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. On today's show, I'll be driving around... London with actress in the passenger seat as he tells us about the role that radio has played in his life both as an artist and a music fan. And Martha Pazienti-Caden will be exploring the term techno-feminism by meeting the individuals who are contributing to the progression of equality on the dance floor including Umfang from Diswoman, Sibyl and Jay from Siren, Mama Snake from A Piran Crew and more. But first, it's Behind the Track, our regular feature in which artists tell us the story behind tracks they wrote that went on to be classics. In a profile feature last year, Matt Unicombe said of Kay Hand, if you aren't familiar with her, your favorite DJ probably is. He was making the point that the Detroit artist has made many incredible house and techno tracks in her long career, but she perhaps hasn't got the recognition that she deserves. One of those tracks is the untitled B1 from the Project Fire. which was released back in 1997. It's one of those devastatingly simple house tracks that might make you remember why you fell in love with the genre in the first place. *Bass Aimee by The Beatles plays* You do This was done in the late 90s. It was great. I mean, I was, you know, doing what I'm doing today. I was traveling. I had made this record, this particular one. It's kind of weird because I remember when I made the record, everything's going good. You know, like it's going to. day and when I made the record I pressed up you know all these copies and we had this trip going to London with uh Underground Resistance and a few other people artists from Detroit and I remember taking at least like a hundred copies with me and I'm like I'm gonna hand these out I'm gonna hand these out nobody really knew what this record was you know it's really no titles on it I'm saying I'm just gonna try to Try it this way. It's always sold from the beginning of the press all the way to today. I'm still selling. I have to ship some records today. I'm still getting feedback. You know, the Black Madonna, Mike Huckabee, just loads of... Loads of DJs and people and fans and getting a lot of responses back. I heard Detroit Swindle guys about a month ago and they were saying, wow, I was just one year old when this record came out. And they were saying how really good it was and that it sounded fresh to them. It sounded new. So, you know, everything appears to be as, quote unquote, Nina Kravis was a, you know, a lot of the tracks that came out in the 90s. pretty much is the same sound today it's nothing old about it it's just that we know technically that the 90s was you know 20 25 years ago but the most music in the 90s sound like it's fresh it was done last week or yesterday because it's the same rolling 909 drum machines or the 808 it's you know the Infamous Roland. Um, beat one, that is the Michelle DiGiullo sample. This is, you know, this is my style at the time in the 90s. You know, this is my style or my sound that I wanted, and I felt it sounded good with her voice. So, you know, one little snippet, boom. All the tracks were done here in Detroit. I was living on Van Dyke right near Belle Isle here in Detroit. So, you know, a lot of all of my tracks are made here in Detroit in my catalog. At the time I was associated more with techno artists like Underground Resistance, Jeff Mills, but there was a few house friends of course and DJs. I would just give them a record and they didn't really, then it's like nobody was really paying attention. You know what I mean? It seemed, it appeared that way. It was just like, here's my new record, here's my new record. And with no information being on it, nobody knew what it was. They had to play it in order to hear what it was. And so as time went on, people started catching on. Well, let me check out this, let me check out that. And they started catching on. And especially Nina Kravis, she pointed me out and came here. two years ago and met me, then now people are like, oh, let me check out Kayhan. Nina Kravis is checking her out. Let me check her out. And so, although it's more on a techno reign, experimental reign, I guess it just determines who discovers you that makes a difference on how people really will pay attention to an artist. A few weeks back, a colleague and I drove over to Hackney Wick in East London and picked up Darren. Cunningham, the artist who you'll know as Actress. The idea was to discuss the important role that radio has played in his work and some of his favourite stations. So we figured, what better environment to talk to him in than driving around London? If he'll excuse the pun, the subject became a vehicle for Cunningham to muse on the various aspects of his creative life as he flicked through the vast sea of stations that make up the FM dial in London. Cunningham released his latest album, Acid, last month, and it was further confirmation of his status as one of electronic music's most consistently brilliant artists. Is that about the volume you get at home? Yeah. So that was us attempting to listen to City Lock. I actually switched it on this morning and the presenter was giving a thought for the day. He said something along the lines of without courage you can't practice any other virtue. Is that kind of reflective of the tone of the station generally? Yeah, actually it is. And it's almost a blessing when you... and pick it up, to be honest with you. I tend to hit it at very poignant moments. For a pirate to still do those sorts of thoughts for the day is quite penetrating. So does it feel as though the station's quite closely tied with the community it kind of serves, would you say? Yeah, I mean, just the name of the station says it all, really. It's locked into the city. It tells you what's going on. It's a frequency. It's a different sort of frequency. It's not certain people might want you to listen to or hear, but that's what... those type of radio stations are there for. Do you have any personal theories on... why there is such an appetite for radio in London. There's always been a sort of pirate mentality about radio because you couldn't get the music on the nationwide paid and subscribed radio stations. And the best music actually was never being covered by... by those stations. So there had to be, you know, a sort of vacuum was created and it needed to be filled. And so you've got all these pirates who risked themselves to give the music to the people. And I think that is always, that is certainly a fabric of... sort of UK culture our culture has been built a lot by radio and by pirate radio but also it's it's It's sort of nourished nationwide radio because then you have stations like BBC essentially creating platforms like One Extra and then you see obviously Rinse FM sort of going a little bit further and making... what they do more like completely legit and whatever you're crossing frequencies all the time and you're always going to pick up there's always a conversation that I'm picking up like whether it's on LBC or something like that you can quickly get a feel for the the mood of the country through radio We're going through the Blackwall Tunnel now so it's probably impossible to get this one. Let's see if we get anything out the other side. Chicago. I mean, in the case of what that tune just came up as well, like, I'm not a massive fan of that particular tune, I must be honest with you. I do like some Chicago tunes, but it'll probably come, you know, when I switch it on and it comes on, it might be at a point where I've been listening to, like, loads of, like, classical music or something like that. OK. and the song will come up and I'll go, oh, they're playing Chicago again. And it'll just be like, as a trigger, it'll just be like, maybe I'll just change it up and listen to a bit of Chicago or something like that. So just once I come out of the studio, my brain's just somewhere else. And this, again, will just sort of bring me straight back to... straight back to the real world and actually re-engage and change my, change my, change the way that my mind is sort of. floating out there I guess. Would you do that with any other forms of like mainstream media or entertainment like do you have a telly do you watch TV for example? Well my studio isn't in my house anymore so I don't have so whereas when I was in my house there was more distractions now I don't have a TV so. My day is much more focused on watching, making music. It's funny, I was watching something with some documentary that Pet Shop Boys were doing. And they did an interview with Jacques Leconte because he was doing some sort of production with them. And apparently he has like... They were laughing because he has the television on full blast whilst he's making tunes. And he's like, they've never met anybody who can do that. And he's just like, yeah, yeah, I just can't. I just can't because I feel like it gives me some sort of order. So it's like... The breakfast show is on. I know that it's breakfast show. And once they start getting into lunchtime, I know that it's time for lunch because there's certain programs on. And so he's like, he's able to split his mind completely and work in that way. Whereas TV for me is much more like... I've been listening to this bass line on repeat for about three hours. Maybe I should go and watch some TV for 20 minutes or something like that. And on TV, usually I'll just go straight to Film 4 or TV. and watch some black and white films they've got on at that time, probably like a James Cagney gangster film and get really into that. So you're still kind of connecting with it on... at least a certain intellectual level. Yeah. It's sort of, you know, appreciating another art form. I'm constantly working though because I did a record called Grey Over Blue and the only way that came about was I'd already been working on a piano part and... And it was one of those moments where I was like, all right, OK, I've been working on this piano part for quite a while, I'm going to watch some TV. And they were showing this really obscure western on TCM. Luckily, in the UK, if you've got Sky, you can sort of, like, do... sort of... what do they call it? Well, you can pause your TV, basically. and rewind and there was this particular moment this cowboy walks into the saloon and somebody's playing this really sombre piano piano part on it And I was like, that could quite work. So I go upstairs, get my recording kit, get set up, sample it, take it back into the studio and then start overlaying it over the... this different piano piece that I'd worked into it. And it kind of came together and worked. But what it was adding was it was adding this sort of like even more lo-fi aesthetic from this sort of really early sort of, I don't know, 30s cowboy film to mixing it in with the sort of lo-fi. what it was that I was doing and sort of that is how my work comes about a lot of the times to be honest with you. Let's pick up Magic. So that's 105.4. More of the songs you love. Now with even more 80s and 90s. This is Magic Drive Time with Richard Allenson. Magic's actually among the top ten most listened to stations in the UK. Okay. But I'd read that your kind of relationship with it is, sort of goes beyond music almost. You'd mentioned that there was a kind of a production element to it that you sort of admired. Maybe if you didn't like directly, you know, tune in for the music. Yeah, it's... it's like anything else I think any profession really you kind of I need to keep my ear in and I need to sort of when I'm away from the studio stay in a certain zone and keep my ears in a certain sort of keep my ears busy sometimes not busy at all and so like pure silence and just listen to just driving and and the ambience of driving but mostly when I'm making whilst mostly whilst I'm actually making and and recording um I find it important to particularly with other grand stations to sort of keep one foot in the real world So I keep quite rooted in that sense. But also just to maintain that focus of listening to production and just continuing that learning, really, learning about sound and how it's put together. What's your relationship relationship with pop music been like historically would you say you're an appreciator of it yeah always like um i think everyone like i grew up with top of the pops And so it was a thing, do you know what I mean? Pop music. It was an accessible platform. My earliest memories, like sort of post-punk, when punk was coming towards an end really and it was starting to get really sort of quite commercial. So you were seeing a lot of like coloured mohawks on the streets and things. And so I must have been about... six at this time and this is when I started to really um could feel the energy of this creativity and this music and it started coming through with like The synth-pop era and the music that was coming down from Sheffield and out of Manchester, humanly, Eurythmics. Were you able to connect what you were seeing on the streets, the people and the fashion and this sort of thing, with what you were seeing on the streets? television yeah it was really close up actually what you were seeing on the box and what you were seeing on the streets was really close there's no internet you know what i mean so the it was a completely completely different ambience the noise was that sort of background noise that is really part of our culture today just didn't exist. We had three stations to choose from and so like our choices were limited and so yeah because of that you was you I definitely felt much closer to the music but you also felt the sort of there was an invisibility about it as well do you know what i mean so all you were seeing was the technology you didn't necessarily know how it was made or who was doing what or it's just like all you had to go on was the shots of it through the top of the pubs or something like this that's why yeah that's why the aesthetics of then are so strong for people today and and immediately a go-to because they were like the starting blocks if you like of popular music that was being bought and invested in by a youthful generation. So you're obviously getting ready to release the album at this point. And kind of as we touched on, when you're in the writing process, you're in kind of an insular headspace, let's say. You know, you're kind of a... very, very closely inhabiting your own thoughts and sort of, you know, shaping things and figuring things out. How do you find the switch of gears when it comes time to kind of have the conversations with the outside world and sort of, you know, present your project to the world? Is that like ever jarring or, you know, do you, or do you just see it as kind of part and parcel of the same thing? A bit of both. because it's highly likely that I've moved on to something else already. It can be a bit jarring because also my memory is like, it's a fading memory for sure. I try to think of things and I'm just like, you told me this about two seconds ago, right? To be honest with you, I've just completely forgotten what you just said because my mind's just thinking about the music. there that is kind of figuring something out that I left already in the studio and that when I get back to the studio I want to have had it figured out so that I can get to work on it again there's that sort of compulsion that I have all the time back to the studio so it's almost like at least a portion of your brain is always in the studio always yeah I mean if you sort of did have to you know characterize the album in broad strokes like what would you say at this exact moment in time i would say it's a it's a it's a refreshed palette it's like an update really hence chrome you know i think i think my music has been described as sort of gray gray tone in the past and i think that the the sort of the logical progression from a grayness is a sort of and a clearing of that palette and a refreshing of that palette is more of a sort of refined version of that greyness and to me that was like in a way so that's how I started moving towards that sort of aesthetic as an idea and you know much more working with synthesis as well whereas I work with synthesis on previous albums a lot of it was built out of shards of sounds like really quite uncharacteristic sounds, sounds which don't have that much timbre and so therefore in terms of you know naturally the sound would be quite lo-fi and quite dead in a way, whereas now because I'm more working with pure tone synthesis and but then re-synthesizing in the way that I would work with samples usually it's coming out a slightly different way. Every time I tune into Lightning at the moment, Teddy Riley's kind of emerging back on the airwaves. Okay, so we're talking about like a mid to late 90s kind of tip? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Should we try and find Flex as the final station? It's on 99.7. Yeah, sometimes I'll just be in this mood. You know, I just want to sit back and just be like... Such a London kind of mad space. Yeah, yeah, do you know what I mean? Yeah, like MCs and, you know, bringing it, you know, it just gets you straight into it and you're just like, yeah. And that's also quite important for me as well because I don't go out as much as I used to. What sort of relationship do you think your music has to the club at this point? I mean, you know, to take the new record, for example, there are certainly tracks on there that, you know, I can imagine DJs playing, but I would also imagine that, you know, these type of situations were quite far from your mind when you were writing them. I've never ever made music for DJs, ever. And I've never ever made music to work functionally on the dance floor. If it happens, it's usually by chance or by, you know, I don't really believe in coincidence, but it's just happened or I've been in a mind state where I've urged it to be that way. In no case since I've been making music have I ever aimed to make music that is compatible for DJs. It's music that's compatible for my listening, firstly. And then after that, it's just a question of whether it's in the landscape of electronic music, whether I think it's applicable or... worthy, I guess. You said earlier you actually have trouble picking up the station, but in some ways that imperfection kind of is agreeable to you. Yeah, the music that I... find really interesting and is music where it's obscured where you can't it's not quite clear view it's kind of fighting against the sort of it's just trying to sort of break out a little bit you know what I mean And for me, you have to listen a bit closer just to hear what's going on underneath. And I know what the production sounds like in its clear form. I'm just interested in how it's being weathered by the low fineness of the frequency and all these sort of things. And would you say that's kind of a guiding principle in what you do in your own music? I'd say it's a guiding principle in terms of the type of art that I like. I'm not a massive fan of hyper-real, realist art, but I am a fan of art... like that's slightly defocused or slightly dirty or grainy. or is literally just quite... It's just quite distressed in some way. But you can see the beauty coming through it. Do you know what I mean? These are the things that... These are the type of things that I like. That's how I like to present my music mostly as well. But then there's different forms of that, like the way that something's distressed doesn't need to be so, like, so obvious. It can be done in a few different ways to sort of filter the levels of that sort of... This is something that's pleasing on the ear almost, rather than like, you know, people think about distress and distortion. They're thinking a lot of the time about quite aggressive gestures. Yeah. It's kind of talking about something that's almost the inverse of that. It's about filling the space as well. Some people, as a mechanism in music, some people fill the space in different ways. Some people like to fill the space with, like, echo, reverb. Some people like to fill that space with ciphers of noise, you know, and I'm much more in the... sort of dry sound-ish, but with a sort of slightly, with elements, with some elements of noise filling that space. Would you say that the way you approach making music inherently generates imperfections? Is there something about the way you've set yourself up or the way that you like to work that sort of contains these happy accidents or these rough-around-the-edges moments? Yeah, the thing is I just don't see them as necessarily as imperfections as such because there's nothing that I can see that is... perfect other than the other than sort of the way that nature has been put together in a way yeah so like the there's a certain level of prejudice where I'm like well just because something is clear infidelity doesn't to me does not make it perfect yeah They're not synonyms. Yeah, but I do see what it is you're saying. And yeah, but it's an aesthetic choice. The new Actress album features in our recent roundup of April's Best Music, which I suggest you check out if you want to catch up on all of the great music that's come out over the past few weeks. Next, our producer Martha takes a look into the ideas behind a movement that's recently been gathering online attention, techno-feminism. There's been some great coverage of the rising amount of femme collectives making waves in the techno world and some not so great, straight up bizarre wave riding and marketing initiatives that have come along with it. I spent some time talking to the inspirational individuals who are contributing to the progression of equality on the dance floor. My journey starts online following a hashtag and general Twitter buzz phrase that's been with me for a long time. I noticed a few people posting this up in their Twitter bio, a space where Twitter encourages us to tell the world about ourselves. You only get 160 characters to communicate what you're all about. So I figured that those that do put techno-feminism up there have a strong connection to the phrase and wear it kind of like a badge. I tracked down a few of these users to find out if that's the case. I'm Ursula Xanadu. I first encountered the term techno-feminism because of advertising for Mufang's party. I placed it in my Twitter bio because it acts as a shorthand for what I want to do and what I care about, which is making real space for women and femmes within electronic music. Technofeminism operates as a guiding principle for me. My name's Amisha. I'm actually a math student, but I've always been into electronic music. I'd only recently seen the term technofeminism tossed about. I'm still kind of curious myself as to whether there's some kind of coherent philosophy behind it. I don't know, or whether that's a sort of ongoing thing. I like this concept as a sort of... as a counter to this sort of mantra that's quite patronizing of like, oh, you know, you've got to play something for the ladies. I'm Reena and I've put techno-feminism in my Twitter bio. After I saw it on a Discwoman merch and I was like, "Oh, that's it." Like that's really concisely summarizes what I want in music right now. It's two things that are really important to me. It's two things that really enrich my life, which is like techno and feminism. So I guess in that sense, it makes sense for me to be like, "Oh, what should I put in my bio? Techno feminism." But it goes beyond that for me. What I really want to see in dance music right now is women being able to go out, either to go behind a deck or on the dance floor just dancing, where, you know, they can do so without being groped, harassed, talked down to. mansplained what BPM or RCA cables are and really bridging that sense of community where we really just respect music and each other's passions for it. So straight away the phrase techno-feminism is linked to the mighty Disc Woman Collective and to co-founder Umfang. I met with Umfang while she was over in London to play a show and to announce her new album. I showed her the clips you just heard. It's cool to hear that people engage with that term. I don't know. I'm just fascinated to listen to what people take that as and hear different people's interpretation. I think that's really special. My friend Signe in New York also, every time I see her, she has a new way of explaining to me why techno-feminism is really an important term. So what is your relationship to that phrase? Technofeminism came from a tweet that my friend retweeted and I googled it and not much comes up. There's just a book called Technofeminism but it's not actually like a word or anything or a term that's been used for much else. So when Disc Woman started I became more outward about my politics I guess surrounding booking women. And. Although I had been throwing a party booking women for a few years, it didn't really have a name or an identity. So I named it Technofeminism shortly after we started Disc Woman just because I kind of felt embarrassed about being open about booking women and being political in that way. And I didn't want to admit to myself or anyone else that... like women had it harder or something like that. I just wanted to do it kind of quietly and have the musicians make the statement on their own. But I found that that wasn't really helping make quick change and it wasn't really empowering everyone that didn't have like maybe the personality to like be that hard ass about it. So now we're just more out about it. And people connect with that actually a lot. And it's I don't know, I think it's just it's kind of cheeky to me. Like it's kind of silly in a way. But it's also really to the point that especially the techno world being so whitewashed and male-dominated, especially in Europe, it's just a good thing to remind people of the problems within what it is now. I'm quite interested in this book because, like you say, it does come up when you search. And it's a sociology book, which... was published in 2004, and it was actually about women's relationship to technology rather than techno, but I kind of like how it's been given this new take in relation to techno music. Yeah, totally. I think it's relevant in a lot of ways. Women in technical fields have experienced similar troubles. So tonight is all about Find Me in the Dark and Disc Women, the party at Corsica. It's so good to see Disc Women reaching across oceans. It's amazing. I can't believe it. Tell me a bit about your involvement with Disc Women. and the other amazing women that are on board. Me, Frankie, and Christine found a Disc Woman sort of by accident. And yeah, it's just kind of built and built and built until we got like a big... branded deal that gave us enough money to like become a business and then uh I don't know we're just trying to like see where it goes and stay relevant why did you feel like forming Discwoman like what was the climate around that time that made you it was not intentional it wasn't like we had a plan to make a crew or anything like that it was just that uh we knew a lot of great women doing great things and we wanted to feature that i think as we've progressed we've sort of internalized more like what that there was a problem but i think it really did start from a positive place of just featuring people that we were really excited about and now that the conversation is more out in the open of just like under-representation. Now we're kind of way more awake to how much of a problem it was and how much that conversation needed to be brought out into the open publicly. And now we're more engaged with the troublesome aspects of bookings and pay equality and stuff like that. I was wondering if you felt any kind of energy coming into electronic music at the moment, like maybe a political energy of any kind. Yeah, I mean, it's hard to say if I'm just more attuned to it now that this woman is so engaged in politics, I guess. Not that any of us weren't before, but now that's just where all of our heads are. with it and it's more of an outward discussion. So I think like a lot of people have felt this way for a long time but it maybe just wasn't such a public discussion. And also the discussion of whitewashing within techno music is out in the open now. And now there's a conscious effort to recognize and be more respectful to the founders of this music that aren't necessarily seeing the same profit as a lot of the younger people. And just that history is significant. Thank you. Hiding the history of black and brown folks is such a common problem. And the more we can sort of vocalize, like, this came from black intellectuals and this is an important thing to acknowledge. It's really significant to me, you know, and I don't want that to be hidden. On the other side of the city, I arranged to link up with Sybil and Jay of London-based collective Siren. We sat down... outside by the canal in haggison so be prepared to hear some wildlife Hi, I'm Sybil. I'm Jay. And we're in the collective Siren. We put on queer parties in London. We host a radio show. We publish a zine. We publish zines. We collect loads of content from female writers, which is super exciting. Our aim is to try and make dance floors and lineups more diverse for women and non-binary and genderqueer identified people. Our most recent event was a collaboration we did with Chapter 10 at Block. Our event was called Chapter Femme. The aim was to put on an event celebrating queer femme culture. and we had Kay Hand play from Detroit, we had Debonair playing from London. The event was hosted by Victoria Synn and at the start of the event we had some film stars. screenings of Queer Erotica. The crowd was amazing. Definitely the sunrise whilst Kay Hand was playing, like four till six was a really special moment. So yeah, all girls to the front, which is also a very big thing at our party. And you both DJ as well? Yeah, we DJ as well. A lot of people like to say we're a DJ collective. I think we're more a collective that also happens to have a lot of DJs. We do do stuff as DJs, but... We're trying to make it clear that that is separate from what Siren is necessarily. We're doing some radio workshops at the moment with NTS, whereby we're going to have each month a new NTS host does a sort of masterclass, and we get in 10 to 12 girls and non-binary people to come and learn from that host, get the basics of how to do radio, basics of how the equipment works. And they've gone really, really well so far. Where do you think you first heard this phrase, techno-feminism? Because that's what Umfang calls her night. I thought it was a good name for her night and the work that they do in New York. I just mainly saw it on Twitter and Twitter bios. Loads of people who like following Siren would have that in their bio. What's your impression of that phrase? I guess it encapsulates quite a lot of ideas that people are feeling at the moment and trying to put power in the music industry back into women's hands, creating a kind of movement. I think it's also about building a community. of women who like obviously enjoy music. Well in the UK you guys are kind of at the forefront of this way of thinking how have you seen the conversation move on since you popped up? We just started this as a group of women originally just put on a club night which booked women and non-binary artists as headliners and that was it and it's just There's been a lot of attention thrown on us and a lot of hype around this subject. I think, you know, on the one hand, it's great when women are owning the phrase techno-feminism, but then when it kind of gets sold back to them as a trendy thing, the dynamic changes. For us, it's always important for things to be grassroots, to be DIY. Like, if we can do something ourselves, we will. And we're quite wary of, like, people putting this... attention on us it's been quite sudden but I think mainly the thing that got us doing this was like just all the articles about where all the women DJs and all of this and no one was doing anything it was just like loads of clickbait and like popular like oh feminism and music and uh you know we just all got together and put on a party and then kept doing it and like Yet again, people have picked it up a lot with press, but I think just like... I've definitely seen a lot more other collectives doing similar things to us, which is really inspiring. A lot of people I've met as well have been learning to DJ where they wouldn't have before and feeling more confident, and it's something we've always encouraged. It's people coming to our parties, making sure they come and say hello to us and just pushing people to do it and not be afraid. We try and always push the conversation forward from just, as you said, just like the basics of... why aren't there any women DJs? Well, there are women DJs and if you look you'll see that there are women artists. It shouldn't just be this one conversation about gender, we need to also talk about race, about ableism, homophobia, transphobia, all of these things which permeate the scene and are not so trendy to talk about necessarily. I mean, they are in certain ways and there's a lot of interest in activism at the moment. but a lot of it is very surface level and we always try and say that what we're doing is not that revolutionary or difficult. It's pretty simple, just support your women non-binary artists, especially artists of colour and artists who are from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. It's not that hard. The only other thing I was going to mention is the consequences of when a big artist takes part in the... conversation like I saw those tweets from Jackmaster and how much of a stir they caused and I was wondering what you guys were feeling at the time of those. What that reflected really strongly was how all the press was so eager to pick this up because you know it's it's a dream crossover for them it's hype artist hype topic and it doesn't actually change anything them writing about Jackmaster. tweeting about this that doesn't really affect anything I mean like on one hand it's great because he's probably reaching the demographic of people that go to the kind of parties where you'll encounter harassment unfortunately there's a lot of chat about the echo chamber kind of effect at the moment as well though and it's easy for us to operate in this bubble where we feel like change is happening but then you go to spaces where Jack Master might be playing and feel absolutely no change happening so in that sense like Joe says it is good that I guess he's reaching a wider demographic with those tweets but it's always so easy to be like oh wow this man thought of this instead of just listening to the women who've been saying this for a very long time. So we've met members of two strong groups pushing equality on the house and techno dance floor, out in the clubs and on the ground. Time to look at a virtual collective bringing together female identified individuals across the globe to share a passion for electronic music online. Hey, this is Foxwork here, repping Sister. History of Sister started around September 2015 by Talks. Yeah, she just started it to have a space online for women that do this shit. Within a few days, it was maybe 100, 200 people, which was dope. It just was a Facebook group, and we were all talking in it and just interacting. That was the beginning of the community. They were looking for someone else to take over. And Ghazal reached out to me to ask if I would. Just since, you know, I guess they realized that, like, maybe it would be smart to have a woman of color running a, you know, an international intersectional feminist movement. And I'd been really active. since day two of its existence anyway. So yeah, I said yes. Probably by the time March rolled around, we were at maybe five, six, 700 people with sister underlying it. There's this social justice thing underneath it, just creating more spaces for women to play out and get paid. travel, you know, that these are all long-term things that being a dude in a certain echelon of the nightlife world will get you quicker than for a woman. So I really just want to remedy that. Could you describe what goes down within the Facebook group? Everyone's just always cheering each other on. It's really great. It's a genuinely friendly place to be. which nightlife in this world isn't always. And I think people really appreciate that and I've worked really hard to kind of set that tone. But the actual group itself, so many compelling conversations. We talk about real shit, just like real things that we go through. In the industry, real examples of things, real people, real situations. People are always in there asking for advice, whether it's about some aspect of production or of DJing. These are things that nightlife in this industry don't create a space for us to talk about. Not all the reasons we're gathered in the group are positive, you know? There's definitely a lot of space for free expression. So, Coral, in your opinion, how can dance music contribute to the progression of equality? Pretty much like, how is any of this shit helping? Just for one, music and celebration is something that's inherent to humanity. That's always going to be important and occupy an important... part of our lives. I think dance music has historically been a site of a lot of change and of a lot of resistance. It's been a site that people of color and queer people, marginalized communities, it's been... Dance music has been really important for us. I think of the club as like a place that has the potential to seed revolution and to be a container for the kind of ideas and sentiments and dialogues that do lead to social change. In Berlin, Salt & Sass is a space facilitating conversations on a similar wave. I'm Kat Young from Salt & Sass. I'm Christine Kakari from Salt & Sass. I'm Alisa Stolman from Salt & Sass. There were two ideas behind starting Salt & Sass in 2015. So the first is that I've worked in music for about 10 years and I kept meeting all these amazing women who were running so much of the industry behind the scenes and I wanted to give them a platform to share their stories and expertise with a wider audience. And the second reason is that when I first moved to Berlin, I actually interned at RA. And I met loads of music people through being invited to office parties and going to clubs with colleagues. And I wanted to create a space where women could come along and meet each other and these music people. needing an invite or feeling weird about approaching people in clubs to talk about work so the talks are open to anyone who registers for a ticket. Christine was the journalist for the second Salton Sass with Susan Langan and Elisa was a guest at the third event and are both writers that I admire so I really wanted to work with both of them on this. The main vision for Salton Sass was always just to kind of make a space for people to come to and like meet each other and one of the things I love most about it is the fact that I get to meet lots of really interesting people, get to hear lots of really interesting stories about parts of the industry I maybe only have like a passing knowledge of. or that people have been able to get jobs through coming to Salt and Sass, and that's feedback I've had before as well, that just by meeting people they were able to get some more work, which is really cool. When you look at the beginnings of electronic music, whether it's places like the Paradise Garage or the Belleville Three in Detroit or even in Berlin in the 90s. kind of Thatcherite Britain, the rave era that grew out of that. These were people whose experience was so removed from any opportunities to be politically or socially or economically engaged and self-determined. So they created spaces for themselves where they could exist. And I don't think that that was necessarily political. I just think it was a matter of necessity. I have an issue with the reliance on nostalgia that exists within dance music and electronic music. I think activism that is limited to the electronic music industry plays a vanishingly trivial role in any wider left movement. I think the first main issue as to why feminism and dance music and initiatives for gender equality and dance music are ineffectual and trivial in the large scale of things is that there's no organization. So we're still all atomized individuals or small groups. working in pursuit of our own self-interest. But we're not challenging systemic inequality or the causes of it. So the main goals of this movement, if that's what you could call it, are to either increase visibility for women in the industry and to book more women on lineups at clubs and festivals. But both of those are superficial changes that make... So any progress in the electronic music industry that does not also address the wider system is ultimately trivial. And I know this all comes off really harsh and I... don't mean to diminish the positive effects of booking more women on lineups or empowering women to put themselves out there, to use technology to make or play women or to provide a space where women and queer people can feel safer than they usually do in public so that they can hopefully make valuable connections with others like them or feel better about themselves and who they are. I think that's really valuable. But it's like how cold medicines only suppress the uncomfortable symptoms of your cold, but they don't actually heal the cold itself. There's another collective I'm keen to meet with for this piece. Copenhagen's Opira and crew are fast becoming notorious for their extended back-to-back-to-back DJ sets, odysseys through techno of all textures. And they just happen to all be girls. My name is Sarah, also go by the name of Mama Snake. I'm a part of a pyrone crew and then I run a label called Ectotherm with my friend Courtesy. We're in Lobster Records in London Fields. Would you tell me about the kind of landscape in Copenhagen right now? What sort of climate does the techno house scene exist in? It's really good. It's, I think, the past two years, so many new things have emerged. I think it's really, like, flourishing with new labels and new party series and off-venue raves. I can highly recommend going there if you're into, like, experiencing new cities. Would you talk me through a Pirate Crew? Tell me about... the other members, how you formed and even how you chose the name. We formed to have a crew. We wanted to put on club nights and then we quickly kind of also got booked to DJ as the crew for other parties. And actually that also comes into how we chose the name. We actually got a booking but we didn't have a name so we had like a super short deadline. And then we chose a pyrone because we thought it looked nice and it means no boundaries or And tell me about who's in the gang. and Solid Blake and Smokey. Emma, who's Solid Blake, she produces music. Just announced her first solo release, which is super exciting. And then Smokey, Simone, she's like our visual aesthetic in the crew. And then we obviously all love music and enjoy DJing. Well, that helps. Yeah. Have you heard this phrase, techno-feminism? Yes, I have. What is your impression of it? What would it mean to you? I think it's such an interesting term because it means so many different things to different people. I mean, it could be based around technology or it can be based around techno music or electronic music. My interpretation of it is kind of both. I really like this book. I think we actually talked a bit about earlier this Judy Weichmann. This thing about how technology... can be gendered. I think as a DJ you kind of see it when like me and Emma actually talked a bit about it. Like, you can go into a DJ booth and it's not really fitting for a woman because, like, it might be, like, the decks are too high up or, like, you can't really reach some parts of the equipment you're going to use. I've spent whole sets on my tiptoes. It's actually a workout. It's something that you might not necessarily process at the time. It feels like a small detail, but... We risk putting off new DJs if you think, oh, I physically don't fit into this space. This space is not designed to accommodate someone like me in any way. Yeah, exactly. And it's so easy to work around, I guess. Like you could just maybe have some boxes in the club you can put up that would be nice to stand on. But I totally get it. Like if especially if you're new and you're already nervous or like. And then you go into a booth where you feel like you're not welcome, kind of. I think it's all revolved around expectations. I don't think the technology itself is necessarily gendered. but maybe the people who made it expect for it to be used by males and not females. And you kind of see that within the spectrum. I don't think it's like you think a woman wouldn't be able to push buttons on like a... CD player or a mixer, but there are some expectations surrounding it that I think are quite interesting to look deeper into, which I think this book really discusses. I think it's important to mention that and just say this is the way it has been set up, but... That doesn't mean that you're not wanted here. Yeah. It's been set up like that until now, but people are here to change that. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Let's have some final thoughts from those I've spoken with. Here's Umfang. Music as protest is significant. Music as a getaway is significant when it's so hard to even physically just relax in any space where you feel like... semi-protected. I think while we can sort of make a momentary safe place for even an hour that's significant. I think it's been so nice to see this whole focus on safer spaces. And actually, like, forcing clubs to promote this, it makes a big statement just for people going out, because it's about going out and having fun. And still, I don't know, educate someone who hasn't necessarily thought of that is a good thing. I think it's, like, the smaller things that are really working. Like, yesterday at Corsica, you see these signs. I don't think they were there the first time I played, with, like, hey. Of course it can promote safer spaces. If something happens to you, you can always tell the bouncers. It doesn't necessarily work every time, but just the fact that someone actually is concerned with it, I think is quite important. There's a club in Copenhagen who recently fired a bouncer. because he didn't act on someone wanting him to help in being harassed. I think it's good to see that there are actually consequences, not that I want to go about and get people fired, but the fact that if someone can't understand this, then they can't be part of club culture. Looking to Techno's future, what practical ways can each of us affect change? Here's Carl from Sista. If you go out to shows, make sure you go support women and maybe even befriend more women or people that are not like you. That alone, I think, is a practical way. Just the dance music can change and become a stronger force for social change in a real way just by collapsing the differences and constructed inequality between people. And that alone, I think, organically changes culture. My name is Serena. I DJ as Peach. Dance music should try and maybe lead by example and go to schools and educate younger people that are impressionable the importance of equality and gender equality. Let's lead by example and how we carry ourselves in our music genre. and basically just updating this narrative that we already have in place and acknowledging instead of undervaluing, underestimating, and undermining. Money is power in a way in the system that we live in, and you can choose to empower people with money and resources and giving. people space if you want to support someone that is you know being underrepresented within their scene for whatever reason it's like if you have the power to book them and amplify what they're doing in any way give them space that's powerful and the same goes for you know like acknowledging the legends and like booking people that you respect from an older time and not just supporting new people that have sort of like co-opted these ideas. We have this analogy of the hedgehogs where we say in a garden, you know, if you want the hedgehogs to come, you have to have the right environment. and if one thing isn't right, they're not going to come out. So if you want to actually support these people in your community, then you have to make an effort from the ground up. I'd also like to mention we really put an emphasis on trying to end harassment in clubs and the practical things people can do on this is if you see somebody and they look like they're uncomfortable. just be on hand in case they need some support. It's an endemic problem and a lot of women don't go clubbing in certain spaces because of it. A lot of places in London, like, we'd never go to because you just will get harassed and no one will take you seriously. And not just sexual harassment, but, you know, also racist abuse or transphobic abuse or all sorts of other abuse that people might get. Okay, that's it for this show. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the hour this month and thank you for listening. We'll be back in a few weeks with another blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides.
