Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Morgan Geist is one half of famed New York City duo Metro Area, the group behind R.A.'s number one track of the past decade, Mora. Lately, though, he's been directing his energies towards his new Storm Queen project. collaboration with vocalist Damon C. Scott. Their past two singles have also clocked Top 50 finishes in our year-end polls in 2010 and 2011. We last talked to Geist around his solo album in 2008, so when he stopped by Berlin late last year, we thought it best to catch up with him for the exchange. As ever, we found him self-deprecating, talkative, and refreshingly honest about the music business. I have to say I'm totally disappointed in this room because I considered I don't know. I was thinking it would be... You know the war room in war games? Sure. We're in the RA offices, by the way. Okay, yeah. I always thought the RA offices would be like that. But instead of the globe on the screens, it would just be like Ableton. At 120, like all of these. All these Ableton screens. This is just a... This is a very normal looking office. With a really embarrassing fan in the corner. It's like neon green. Oh yeah, look fresh? Oh no, cool fresh. Alright, well anyway, that's neither here nor there. No, I mean, like, you know, put it in its place. It's much less imposing. So you thought that R.A. was going to be this sort of nerve center for electronic music. Exactly, just Ableton on huge screens, and you'd be in sort of like this black Stormtrooper outfit. I wouldn't answer questions. You'd just extract them. Why do you? Like some voice would synthesize my answers. I wouldn't have to speak. Why would you have such a conception of our operation? I don't know. The logo is very futuristic. I think that's where I'm getting all of this from. It's all from the logo. Yeah. Fair enough. No, this is, you know, there's lots of... We're all people. Yeah, no. We're just trying to make our way in the world. That's good. So you said you can edit this, right? Yeah, of course. Even though that's going to be... But it's funny that you... The war room is going to be... be the most important thing i say it's interesting though that you have this conception of ra because we both were from ohio i didn't actually have a major you're from ohio yeah i grew up i'm not from ohio you went to school yeah yeah i went to school where did you grow up uh cincinnati oh right yeah nice i i'm just trying not to say the call letters I mean, that's like, that's my most, that's my biggest experience with Cincinnati because I haven't actually spent time there. So it was just growing up with the sitcom. One of the things you said about your time in Ohio at Oberlin is that there was no scene there whatsoever. You had to go to Chicago and Detroit for everything. Well, I mean, it's not entirely accurate. If you know, I got my start in Ohio. because Dan Curtin had a label, or he still has the label, Metamorphic, and that's who put out my first sort of proper, I mean, it wasn't really dance music, I guess, looking back, but dance music stuff. How'd you get in touch with him? I used to be... a reader of a magazine called Street Sounds. I think it was called Street Sound, which was Street Sounds or Street Sound, but this was this dance music magazine. It's strange. I have just memories of buying this one magazine. I used to deliver. I was like a delivery guy. I used to deliver candy as one of my jobs. This is how I paid for my first ADAT, which is like this low-tech now. Low-tech. digital recording device that I did all my first records on and that a lot of like really bad 90s rock was recorded on like a lot of people blame ADATs as like why the 90s sounded so bad. It was like this very early digital recording thing where you recorded to videotape but I mean, it was really cool. I mean, I loved it when I got it. I'll never diss the ADAT. But the point is, I was delivering candy all summer between college semesters all over the tri-state area, New Jersey, New York, even going up to Massachusetts. I would drive, like, just constantly all week, busting my ass. I had this job that... Delivering candy? What did you say? Well, it was... I mean, I could describe it. It wasn't actually boxes that you would deliver to like this is really not a good dance it's not really a dance music topic but it's sort of ridiculous yeah yeah no there's just these boxes where you it was like the honor system so there'd be a little like can and you put money in and you took your candy so I would be going to these like uh garages and stuff where it was like fairly tough big guys, big mechanics and stuff. And I'd go there and be like, yeah, you didn't pay. You need to pay me $17.50 now. So it was a pleasant job. You know, the skinny guy walking in and trying to get money from these huge dudes. But where was it? Oh, so on one of these trips, I was just like taking a lunch break, ran in somewhere. They had street sound. I opened it up and I remember just reading it at lunch and coming across Metamorphic, seeing this guy was from Kent, Ohio, which was close by. And reading a bit about his music, I left him a message because those were the days where you just put your phone number as a contact. He was in Japan. I think I called his mom's house or something. And I don't say that in a disparaging way because that environ was my mom's house for years. Anyone with old records of mine could go visit my mom and say hi, bring her a little something. And anyway, I never thought I'd hear from Dan because like months went by and then randomly he called me back like two or three months later. And we met up and I gave him a tape and he put it out. You hadn't even heard the music yet. You just read it. No, no, no. I just read about him and then when I visited him he gave me some records. I kind of don't want to I don't know how cool it is to just talk about my, you know, reveal someone's personal life but I remember just like Dan was like, it was sort of inspirational because he was just a very normal guy. I think that's certainly what you need, though. When you start electronic music, you need to know that someone that is in the industry is normal. Yeah, I mean... Oh, I can do it, too. I mean, not boring normal. Just like he wasn't standoffish. He wasn't uptight. He wasn't concerned with being overly cool, at least to me. I mean, he was encouraging, you know. Plus, he also had a 909, an 808, and a 303, and a ton of amazing records in his apartment. And yeah, it's funny. The main thing I'm not saying is I walked in. in and he was watching Star Trek with his girlfriend, which is like, in dance music, I don't think that's really a mark of shame. If anything, that's like, you know, it's like OG. Yeah, exactly. It's like OG. It's like, you know, like, you know, when I talked to Mad Mike for the first time, all he talked about was Star Trek. So, yeah, so it was great to get my start with him. He was generous with all of the information, which I think labels should always be, you know, shared information. I don't mean generous like sharing your artists or poaching or, you know, like, you know, I just mean in terms of, you know, back then it really felt like labels against distributors. And that sort of carries on a bit until today. But of course, there's no checks and balances now. you know you'd get paid what you're told you sold and that's it you don't know what you sold but um i like the whole information sharing thing and dan was very generous that way and all my first the first environ records came out through him and his distribution company and i met you know through deep distribution, I met Derek May and, you know, people I didn't even know who these guys were. You said there's no checks and balances anymore. Yeah. When did that change? I don't mean if you're selling physical records, but I'm saying for digital. Who the fuck knows if iTunes or fucking Beatport or whoever is, you know, you sold 20 units of this, you sold 150 of this. How the fuck do you check? How do you check that? So that's what I mean, no checks and balances. As opposed to, well, I UPSed 150 records to you. You just paid me for 90, so we need to talk. There's nothing like that anymore. Although, of course... benefits, you know, you can just upload your music. If you're that kind of person, you can upload it without mastering it. You could do whatever, finish a track and be selling it. the same night if you want, which is great. It's just, you know. It's not something you do, though. Well, it's not something I do because I like to master the records and, you know, I mean, have someone else master the records. That's what I mean. If I had a mastering engineer on call, I would definitely sell my stuff the same night. I mean, it's cool how instantaneous it is, but I don't like how you kind of don't know what's going on behind the curtain. You just upload. stuff and then who knows what happens what did Oberlin teach you what did you get out of Oberlin what did Oberlin teach me that's an amazing question that I have so many grumpy answers for You know, in many ways, I got out of Oberlin the same thing I got out of high school, which was, you know, there's different ideas of cool. You know what I mean? Like, I went back to Oberlin. maybe a few years ago with Kelly Poehler, the student union or whatever invited us back to play. And it was like a really fun show and people were really supportive. And I was thinking, wow, when I was there, no one would have done this. You know, when I was there. I felt really isolated with the stuff that I liked. And I also didn't know what I liked when I got there. When I got to Oberlin, I was still really into industrially kind of new wave stuff from high school, industrial stuff and new beat from high school. And also really getting into Indian music. like film soundtracks, like the kind of the worst kind of fast food Indian music you could listen to. It wasn't like Indian classical music or anything. Just because it sounded like surf music, like, you know, spring reverbs and all these like twangs and boings and sounds. effects and things and just you know you'd buy them on these two dollar cassettes and it just sounded like you know it's i mean it was awesome because it sounded like what you buy plugins to do today like it sounded really lo-fi and distorted and weird and right And beautiful too, like the melodies were great. And thank God I can't speak Hindi, so I didn't know how corny the lyrics were. This was all like film music. But my first year at Oberlin, I was listening to like severed heads and Indian music. That's like all I was listening to all the time. The thing with Oberlin was, you know, if you weren't talking about hip hop or like an 80s kind of retro night. There was very little going on. And maybe a little bit of, like, funk soul stuff. But there wasn't really, like, a dance music thing. There definitely wasn't techno going, like, techno stuff. There wasn't really... There were, like, two people doing, like, house stuff besides me. I mean, or interested in it, deeply interested. in it and a way to gauge this was going to the radio station and seeing what shows there were one was this woman uh who sadly is not with us anymore her she was shaquanda girl or princess tam tam it was this woman carmen who played like a lot of vocal house and she lived she was like from overland basically she lived in lorraine which is the county that over and she lived in Lorraine. I think that was the name of the town. And she would sort of do this, like, she also did, I think, like, kind of, I don't know if it was, like, gender studies and, like, but she was definitely this, like, strong, you know, feminist black woman playing, like, house and sort of obsessed with, like... not obsessed with, interested I should say, deeply interested in like the whole diva thing, you know. So a bit political as well. She was really nice and I would often play after her and she'd stick around, you know. She's the kind of person that might play a Dajé record and then I'd come around and play like a relief record, you know. It was like very... similar sort of like just missing each other it was like worlds away really you know when you'd listen to our shows but and then there were a couple other people doing sort of like what was called progressive house then but I remember that sort of just it sort of equals trance to me nowadays like I mean you listen to it next to Timo I mean whatever I forgot his name. Tiesto. Tiesto, thank you. Yeah, you listen to it next to Tiesto and it sounds like Deep House now. But back then it sounded really commercial and kind of cheesy to me. And that was it. And then a couple guys at the bookstore who sold records. Jim Haynes and Todd Hutlock, who Todd Hutlock, you may know. He wrote for Alternative Press. I don't know what he's doing now. But those guys really, like, thank God for them. They turned me on to some great stuff. Jim especially. I remember Jim playing me, like, we'd get some of DBX's records and, like, the IntelliNet boxes. And he sort of... played it and I was like I like I don't get this like it's cool but like what is cool about this and he's like I don't know you just like there's like this little whine in the background you hardly hear it and it gets louder and softer and like as basic as that was I didn't know that was okay to like you know I was like there's no song structure it's just like three sounds But sort of as soon as I saw someone saying that's okay to like, I had someone say, like, this is what's cool about this. I instantly got it, and then I was like, I mean, I learned to mix with early DBX records, Silicon Ghetto, and all that stuff. Just to give some context, Oberlin, for those who may not be aware, is sort of like... A lot of musicians. No, it's a conservatory. Okay. But the thing is... It's very rock-orientated, though. No, no, no. The conservatory is classical jazz. Okay. I mean, you know, really classical, but then a strong jazz program, vocal majors, things like this. And I went to Oberlin because they have this conservatory, but I didn't go to the conservatory. I can't even read music. musical illiterate. How did you get there then? I went to the college. I went to the college. And it was very hard to take classes in the conservatory if you were in the college. So I was always having my friends sneak me in. I mean, my first record, you know, I had to wait a month so some friends could like schedule time in the studio so I could sneak in there and do like a reverse edit. you know, have a kick drum go backwards. I mean, it was hard to do this stuff back then. And, you know, I always derived great satisfaction from the fact that all the, I feel like the most interesting music came out of the college. You know, it's like... you know, you had these classical musicians and you even had like these electronic music people like, um, at Oberlin, like the whole electronic music course, which I was always struggling to take courses, classes. And it was impossible if you weren't an electronic music major, I was just an English major. Um, You know, I liked that all this sort of memorable stuff that wasn't classical or jazz came out of the college. Bitch Magnet, Tortoise. John McIntyre, I think, was an electronic music major and dropped out. And also, gosh, ton of gear from there. Like Oberlin was buying this new digital shit and John got like Bukla or like, you know, like really amazing stuff. You know, forward thinking guy who knew to grab this old stuff or buy this old stuff while they were getting in this new, you know, cutting edge shit that would be worth, you know, $100 in five years. I don't know who else came out of there. Trans Am. I mean, people I'm not really that interested in, but the point is it was kind of cool. I thought that we came out of the college. Sure. And I wasn't connected to any of it. I had my synthesizers and drum machines in my dorm room and was just making music on my own. And then, as you said before, going to Cleveland or Detroit or Chicago. Were there a lot of trips then? to those places? Yeah, I mean, not an inordinate amount of them because, you know, I was in school and I'm also not, like, I wanted to hear the music and stuff, but, you know, I didn't really party in that sort of rave sense. Like, you know, I don't do drugs. I've never done drugs. I don't even drink that much. So sometimes it got tiring. I mean, I remember going to early Plastic Man stuff, like we went to the Packard plant. And, you know, you just drive all night through the snow. That's exhausting. Then you get there and it's just deafening, deafening music. So, so loud. Black room with all this stuff, you know, plastic everywhere and like a strobe light and a space heater and like a million kids on drugs. And, you know, I remember going with my girlfriend and, you know, we sort of were doing this smile at each other, like, you know, kind of like we're supposed to like this, you know, but it was really amazing. We got into it, but it was like sensory overload. I mean, I know that's sort of the point sometimes, but it would sometimes just get fatiguing if you're sober, you know. So, you know, I think once we started being able to go to like finding out more about the music, like, you know, drive to Detroit or go to like Royal Oak, go to some little party with like, you know, Eddie Fulks and Derek May and Juan Atkins, like spinning in like a sports bar or something like that. I mean, like, I remember that. I remember that well, like little tiny things like that were really fun. We're going to Chicago to shop at Gramophone. Stuff like that was fun. And then in Columbus, there was a big scene as well. What was going on in Columbus? It was a huge scene. Tatantan Duvante? Tatantan Duvante, a friend of mine and someone I collaborated with early on. We were both on Metamorphic. That's how we met. But God, I don't want to forget names here. But I mean, like Charles Noel, Ed Luna, the whole elemental group. Todd signs. Yeah, Todd signs. A lot of people down there. And it's funny. They had a really nice scene. I always was a little... I liked the people individually, but I always felt liberated that I wasn't connected to it because there's that sort of positive pressure, you know what I mean? Like sometimes you have a group of friends and someone's like, listen to this, and everyone's like, yeah. I'm very critical, and I'm glad I wasn't obliged if I heard something bad to sort of be like, yeah, keep going. They were all really supportive of each other, which was very nice. It's probably needed. also definitely no I mean it was a double-edged thing for me like I envied that and they were always so so so nice you know and they have a really strong bond to this day I mean I saw those guys and at DMF recently it's just crazy you know I've I don't see them often but we've known each other a long time at this point And anyway, it was really nice. But then selfishly, I sort of, I always like being on my own. Like I'm not great in groups. You know, I... I work on, I mean, musical groups, but probably socially as well. Like I like, you know, few people around. I was never like really into the whole community thing. I was always kind of, you know, a loner, which is a euphemism for loser. It seems funny that you would say this though, because obviously you're probably best known for working in a group. You mean metro area? Yeah. But it's not a group. It's two people. I'm fine with that. But I just mean sort of like a scene. Maybe I should say that. When did you meet Darshan? I met Darshan at the end of college. Like probably 95. maybe 96. We started talking over the internet. This is really early on. And then found out from the same place. And also we were like both into slower stuff and disco and started hanging out. I mean, we have different memories of how we met. You moved back. Yeah. Yeah. I moved to, well, I moved to New Jersey. I moved. like back to my mom's, I had my studio there. Then I like moved out of there, but kept my studio because I had no money to get like a place where I could have my music and a living situation. But there wasn't much going on scene wise in your mind or that you were a part of? No, that I was a part of. Part of, I mean, geez, in high school, I missed amazing stuff because of my ignorance. You know, I mean, my father was working in Patterson. I mean, I mean, I would have been like, you know, nine years old. But I mean, my dad was working on the corner from where like T. Scott was playing. And my father and mother are Pattersonians. Patterson's just a silk. It's called Silk City. It's like a manufacturing town. Jersey that's quite quite rough now maybe getting a little better but yeah but anyway a lot was going on there a lot was going on in Newark I mean I went to the pipeline when I was underaged which was sort of a industrial club mm-hmm I had no friends to go with I went alone the day I got my driver's license and was really intimidated, you know, because it was weird. I mean, I'm a suburban kid and I'd go there and a lot of people on drugs and, you know, dress strangely, you know, I had my, you know, you weren't dressed like an industrial kid. No, I mean, I kind of was, but not, you know. I mean, I'm kind of a, you know, I had the haircut or whatever, but I, and you know, maybe a skinny puppy shirt or some wax tracks shirt, KMFDM shirt or something. But, uh, But I wasn't, you know, these were, this was like people with pierced faces when everyone didn't have pierced faces. You know, it was like slightly intimidating. Plus I was, you know, I was like a good kid. So I was freaked out about sneaking out and going to an underage club. Like this was an adventure for me. It wasn't normal. And it's hard to do without friends. You know, I mean, it's like. I mean, maybe it's easy for other people. For me, I was nervous. So I went to that, but thinking I could have gone over by the Holland Tunnel and gone to this fucking... Zanzibar instead of going to this shitty industrial club. But, you know, I never would have gotten in Zanzibar. I don't think I would have ever gotten in there. Yeah, of course. You know, and I would have been probably really freaked out going in there. But I have friends my age, like my very good friend Sasha was going clubbing and my girlfriends in high school were going clubbing. Like my first really long-term girlfriend used to go to MK and Elle's. Red Zone, you know, even like the tunnel and stuff like this, which like seemed cheesy back then, but people talk about it sort of, you know, there's a lot of reverence now for this kind of stuff. It seemed cheesy at the time to you. Definitely cheesy. And I used to get, I mean, I stayed out of dance music for so long because I used to. And it used to kind of piss me off. My girlfriend would go in there and she'd be... I remember she'd be wearing a tiny miniskirt and I'd just be like, some simian creature, some dumbass bouncer. is going to let you in because your ass is hanging out. And, you know, that's the only reason you're getting in, you know, because you're a cute girl. And, you know, it's like, I was just, I just kind of had this, I was, I missed the whole point where I was just like, you're better than this. You're going to, you know, you're going to go and wait in the cold to be judged by some guy who, you know, just thinks you I was so cynical about it. So because of my attitude, I probably missed some amazing DJing. She was probably going to listen to Pal Joey and stuff like that. Was there any DJs that sort of struck you as, wow, I'm... I'm amazed at what they're doing and how they're doing it. People that you looked up to. You mentioned Plastic Girl. I used to go to the Limelight. I don't know if that was when... Again, it's sort of an embarrassing thing to admit. The Ritz, the Limelight, these clubs I used to go to, it was mostly industrial stuff. Or not industrial, like wax tracks music, sort of this industrial dance. And then every once in a while, you'd accidentally see someone legendary and think they were boring. Like I saw suicide in the 80s. And of course, I always say, oh, I saw suicide. I don't talk about the fact that I was there to see Meat Beat Manifesto or something like that. So suicide just happened to be there. And I was probably like, this isn't as good as Depeche Mode or whatever. Again, totally missing the point. I think the DJs at these clubs used to impress me and I didn't know what they were doing. Yeah, I remember being at the limelight and just straining to hear what was going on because often it would be, maybe it was like Denard or one of these New York DJs playing. Denard Henry, maybe Jeff Mills. I don't know who was playing at the time. you know, it was just before the show and you'd sort of just. It was kind of like when people were just hanging around waiting for a band to come on or they'd play between bands and then after bands. But I'd usually go on concert nights. So I don't know who was actually playing. And the DJ wasn't the focus. It was like people would kind of dance waiting for the next act to come on. Was it always production then for you that was the appeal? Or was it always what's the record playing as opposed to who's playing it when you went to a club? Oh yeah, it was never who's playing them. And it still isn't. I mean, if it's a who, it's just because you're like, this guy or girl has great taste in music. I mean, I don't care who's actually playing it. What's the friend of mine? I like them and I want to hang out or something, but I mean, you know, uh, although it's of course nice to hear, you know, if Harvey breaks a record, it's nicer to hear him play it or introduces you, not breaks you, introduces you to a record. I think it would be nice. hear him play it than someone who you know just sort of you know downloaded his whole set list from a blog and then is playing it you know just out of respect to a dj who took a risk and and played something first you know sure sure um tell me about you and darshan sort of actually starting to make music was it immediate that you got together after you We're talking on the internet. No, we just talked about music a lot and we met up and went record shopping. And I was going to say, the different memory I have is I could have sworn I initially, this was how I met quite a few people. If I was sending off a record somewhere, I wouldn't want to send my master off. So I'd want to dub one dat to the other. And dats for the listeners who don't know what they are. you know, digital audio tapes and, you know, you'd have to dub it just like any other tape. And I only had one dad. I couldn't afford two and I'd have to find someone who had another one. So I feel like that's me. almost like the we were friends then and talking but that's I think I wanted to meet up because of that or something and we just ended up going record shopping and then playing each other records and like really a lot of overlap there. I mean, I feel like I've told this story a lot, but I mean, you know, we'd have the same artists on, on different labels. Like I'd have the techno, uh, you know, Ron Trent and he'd have the house Ron Trent. I mean, of course it's the same music, but I mean, I'd know it from altered, you know, I'd know Ron Trent from altered States and he'd know him from a prescription record or something like that. So would you say that he's more housey? Well, I mean, that's like what I think of in my head when I think of our early meetings. But then Darshan's early records were really techno-y. He did stuff on Sub Freak and some other smaller labels. And then he and his partner had something on Strictly Rhythm, actually, that... That's sort of not, I think people don't always realize that because it was under a different name. They were putting out one record a week. Yeah, yeah. Well, no, no, it wasn't even, I think it was a compilation or something like that. But yeah. Hey, man, even a record a week, I would love to be able to be like, yeah, it was on Strictly Rhythm. For sure. Yeah. For sure. So, yeah, we used to just, I think he was, yeah, maybe more house oriented. I always liked weirder stuff. And Dar, you know, Dar was a dancer. He'd go out dancing a lot. And so I think that mattered. To him, you know, being able to dance to stuff for us, the weirdness mattered to me. So when you guys made a track, he would test it in a way if it made him dance. No, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, we just, no, we saw eye to eye. Because Darshan liked it. weird you know darshan like when i say weird i just mean whatever like darshan likes not knowing how sounds are made also and you hear them and there's mystery in the music and i like dancing also i mean dar happens to be much better at it if anyone's seen us djing together and moving around at all but yeah i mean um there's a lot of overlap i mean it was a really you know the friendship is very easy and natural i mean And I think we look for similar things in music, even if our tastes per record sort of diverge sometimes. Or when we DJ together, we DJ slightly differently. What was when you were getting together and sort of making music early on? What was the moment at which you thought, yeah, we have something here? this arrangement's gonna work it was the it was the influence like we were both interested in disco and boogie and and also liked these slower new records you know like we we probably met when sort of did sample like filter house and like henry street or not whatever i don't know like dj sneak and like these french you know like bob sinclair and like mid-90s stuff where people started sampling Disco and filtering stuff. And we were really interested in hearing the original records. And then like Dar, you know, Dar knew some radio shows like in New York. I mean like, you know, stuff on Kiss and sort of old school shows that he would turn me on to. And I think also we were talking on the phone once and he, you know, we'd play stuff over the phone, which was really funny. I don't know if people do that anymore, but, and he sort of did this little like, like some little like modulated D train sounding thing. He's like, yeah, I want to kind of mess around with this stuff. And I was like, oh, that's, that's great. You know? And that's when I think I was like, I got. I'll work with this guy. We're going to be on the same page. And he was working with someone else at the time. I always felt like I was kind of a little Yoko there because I wanted to work with Darshan and not necessarily this other guy who was a nice guy but whose tastes were really in a different place than ours. So that was it. We started working. Like, you know, Dar would take the bus down to where I was living in New Jersey. You know, we were at our parents' house early on. It was right after school. So I'd go to his mom's house and, like, you know, we'd have synthesizers in the living room. I'd always get my... my head on this lamp that was like, I mean, it was like these ridiculous, you know, sort of improvised setups wherever our parents could tolerate it. And, you know, it was like just a year or two. Darshan moved to New York pretty quickly after college. But that's when we did our first stuff. You had a studio eventually on Murray. That was Darshan. Okay. Yeah, and that's where we used to work. It was right underneath Sonic Youth's studio. Sonic Youth has an album called Murray Street, I think. Yeah. And it was under there. And yeah, like quite close to... Did you ever meet them? I don't know. I saw like, I'd see Jim O'Rourke in the elevator a lot. And maybe I saw one of the Sonic Youth people. I never saw like Kim Gordon or. Could you hear them? Definitely. I mean, it was really loud. I mean, it was an old building we were in, so it blocked a lot of sound. And then Darshan's place, it was a studio. So there was a room built within a room. And I used to sleep on top of the studio. I had a day job in New York, and we'd work. And then, I mean, I remember climbing up on top of this studio and there was like two feet between the top of the studio room and this real ceiling. You couldn't get up. It was pitch black in the place because there was a studio in front. There were no windows. You never knew what time it was if you couldn't see a clock or your watch. So yeah, we'd work until four in the morning. I'd go upstairs. I'd hear Darshan messing around. I'd smell some weed and he'd be hacking on the computer or doing whatever he was doing. And then I'd wake up a few hours later and get on the subway and go to work in Chelsea and take the bus home to New Jersey at night. I mean, it was brutal. It was fun, but I slept so little back then. I was always either at DARS or on a bus going to New Jersey. These were the first 12 inches. Yeah, the first Metro Area things, yeah. Most of it, up to the album. We're still working at Darshan's place for the album. I'd work at home, he'd work there. We'd put our efforts together, usually at his place, because he had a bit of a nicer mixer than I had. and, you know, a proper, like sort of a proper room, um, little nicer gear. And also I got, I hope the guy's not listening to this, but we used to, you know, there was sort of a more high end, like a commercial studio in front where the guy was not making his own music. He'd have clients there. And we would always go up there. I mean, all the microphones on the metro area were always snuck out in the middle of the night from this guy's studio. And like really expensive microphones where we'd be like, you know, probably stuff that we shouldn't have plugged in or, you know, attached to a mixer with phantom power. Thank God nothing ever broke because we didn't know what we were doing. we just sort of pick a bunch of mics and be like, oh, this sounds right. And sometimes we'd probably have some $8,000 mic that sounded wrong just because we had it plugged in wrong. So it was really like seat of the pants stuff at the beginning. You were getting those mics because you were recording strings? Well, we would just record everything. I mean, we just wanted a live sound. Like, you know, we both grew up, we really have very similar paths with learning about electronic music. So, you know, we were really, you know, sequencer kids. And, you know, just being able to record without the expense of tape, you know. We couldn't afford reel-to-reel machines or anything like that. So when we could actually record to our max, you know, when digital audio was just starting, we just went crazy with it. Because finally, you know, all we want hand claps, we could clap into a mic, you know. You know, it used to be really hard to get sort of a disco or boogie sounding drum track. Now, I think, you know, it's quite easy. I mean, you could buy, like, refills for Reason and stuff that's, like, does this stuff for you. But then it was quite hard because you'd have to sort of, like, I don't know, like, program your drum machine to sound kind of live and it would never sound right. it would still be on its little grid. It would just sound like it was broken because you'd be like taking things off of the right beat, moving them over a little to sort of make them sound human and they would never sound human. They would just sound wrong. So yeah, we were recording everything. Strings, yes. Often we'd record strings at Juilliard because Kelly Poehler, who was doing our strings, was a teacher and student there at the time. So we would go up if we needed a few string players and set up in a room, again, with some stupid, you know, like an SM57 positioned, like a mic positioned completely wrong with these amazing string players, you know, because we just didn't know what we were doing. And we'd record strings up there. Yeah, percussion and everything else and claps and soda cans and whatever we're using, we'd always record at DARS just with these borrowed mics. Where can we hear soda cans on the metro area? I mean, probably like, I just, there's that little tab on. On soda cans when you open them. I think we used to call them, like in elementary school, they were called like fuck tags or something like that. But they were like, you know, we would just put a, we'd close mic that and it would be a little springy sound. And like we wouldn't know what, there's some African instrument that does this like pitched sound. We didn't know how to do that. so we would like fill a bowl with water and like hit it with a key and move the bowl around and spilling water by his sampler and stuff like that because we couldn't like we didn't have the right mic cable to bring the mic across the room like all sorts of I think every I mean I think everyone did stuff like that then you know like if you were especially rock bands and people who used microphones and amps and like actual, you know, you weren't just like working in a box or working with synthesizers. You, everyone experiments like that and has fun. It's something you miss, I think by learning only with Ableton or something like that. But, um, obviously the benefits totally outweigh. Being able to do everything on a laptop is pretty amazing. Are you still recording stuff? I mean, like on the Storm Queen record? No, I mean, I'm recording the hardest thing, which is getting good vocals. And especially with my limited equipment, I still don't own a nice mic. I have, you know, okay preamps and stuff. but I still kind of don't know what I'm doing with, you know, it's just moving a mic around and moving the person around. And, you know, my vocalist for Storm Queen, Damon. He's used to sing on the subway and he's loud, you know, and he moves around and stuff. So, you know, there's a lot of editing afterwards, you know, because like all the takes sound different, you know, like not because he's inexperienced. He just, he gets into it and he's not one of these like studio session singers who's just going to know to just sit there. not move and you know be on axis and you know like singing properly into a microphone he's used to singing loud over the noise of a train or singing on the street or whatever you know it's like which is pretty pretty impressive to me was Jeremy quite different when he yeah Jeremy knows I mean Jeremy is an electronic music guy So he knows his way around the studio. Probably better than I do because he actually worked in commercial studios in London. Or maybe not London, somewhere in the UK. Why did you choose him as your vocalist for your solo album? For my album? I just like Junior Boys a lot and We Got Along Well. So it's pretty much as simple as that. And also I wanted to do kind of this electronic music album. I mean electronic music, like, you know, I was listening, you know, like more influenced by like whatever logic system. like the YMO projects and sort of like, you know, these early, you know, like German electronic stuff and like, you know, body love and these Klaus Schulz, you know, soundtracks. So I kind of wanted to do something less dancey and more like in that new wave, like when electronic, you know, like sort of like the early 80s when people were sort of doing high-tech sounding records still with like analog equipment, analog synths, sorry, and like early sequencers and things like this. I wanted to kind of do something like that. And Jeremy was into that stuff too, so I knew he would like kind of understand how to sing around it, even though what we did sounds nothing like it. And ultimately I'm not, I'm actually not, I don't love that record that we did. It was like, doing a record when you don't want to do music is just the worst idea in the world. I was really sick of music then. And I just, I think I was trying to force my way through it. Because I'm like, I'm going to die and I will have completed one album in my lifetime. And that's just sad considering I'm supposed to be someone who does music for his livelihood. Why are you so sick of music? I mean, it wasn't a great time personally. So I wasn't super... enjoying the rest of my life. And I think that, that definitely carries over. I'm not one, like, I don't know if everyone's affected equally. Like, you know, there's all these incredible albums that came out of. people's lives falling apart. I don't know if I'm one of those people. I don't think I am. I think, you know, maybe lyrics you can write well if you're having trouble because you're more just maudlin, if that's the kind of lyric you want to write. But for making the actual music, you know, if you don't feel like getting out of bed each day, it's really hard to go and edit, you know, 40 fucking tracks of vocals or whatever. So it was really like a lot of it was like I was just trying to go and, you know, like so much of that, so much of that album was just like. doing the workmanlike part of producing. You know, editing stuff, not looking for an emotional response, just sort of like getting things together in the song. Like it's hard to explain without just sort of... Really bashing the whole thing, but it's like, you know, it was like going to a day job and you know out of an assembly line You know just like oh slide this sound bite here. I'll time the drums today I'll do this, you know, this. It just wasn't super inspired, you know. I'm always self-conscious about my music when I'm finished with it. But that one played out sort of exactly as I feared, which was, you know, years later, I don't really want to listen to it. Are there things that you do listen to? No, I don't listen to anything, but sometimes I want to. not true i had fun listening to the storm queen because i like listening to ade you know And also if I make a song that I like, I like listening to it. But not for usually a couple of years have to pass because anyone who does music knows, especially for production, I mean, you just get so sick of it. You know, like remixers or people who have commercial studios, whatever, like, you know, you go home and you have this like earworm, you know, you have this like this audio loop and you have this loop in your head. that you can't get out because you've been editing one measure all day or whatever. So I'm usually miserable with stuff by the end. And then, you know, if it sort of disappears and I forget about it, then I can revisit it. Would you say you're too much of a perfectionist? That's like such a weird question to ask a perfectionist. So you are a perfectionist. Yeah. You would identify yourself as one. Well, I mean, I don't like that word. Like I would just say complete. like a perfectionism implies that when you're done it's perfect and it's not that i mean often perfectionism or this compulsion to make things perfect just ruins the music completely you know so now i've tried to manage that and try and leave enough in there i mean electronic music's a great thing to do if you're if you're compulsive uh you know it's like great anal retentive activity. You know, let me, let me get, let me put everything on this grid and all this. So a lot of, I mean, metro area was a lot of undoing that, you know? And I mean, Darshan and I often talk about that obsession with, you know, like sort of believing in the sequence or believing in the grid when the truth is that stuff lies and you have to use your ears. That's why Funkadelic grooves much better than anything made, you know, or almost anything made with a machine or whatever, you know. So, and then also not trusting in like humanized functions and like where people write programs to be like, this will make it sound funky or this will make it sound loose. Cause that stuff sucks balls. Also, you need to use your gut and, you know, use your ears, use your body's response. I mean, it sounds pretentious, but it's true. Like we get tense when something sounds wrong, you know? So it's getting it to that point where you relax and you're like, this is right. And that, you know, if you're in the compulsive perfectionist mode, you don't relax until everything's in order. When you're making good music, you relax when you know it sounds right. And it's taken me, you know, 25 years to know how to, I still don't know how to do that consistently, but. You know when you've made a song that's going to work. You're just like, you relax in a weird way. So like, as I've gotten better at that, I think my music's gotten a bit better. Storm Queen stuff, I'm getting more just like, yeah, and it's also dance music. I mean, it's hard to do when I was trying to do YMO-y, you know, type stuff. where a lot of it's textural and you're going for interesting textures, but you're not necessarily like thinking of people dancing or whatever. You know, house music is sort of, you know. I don't know. I mean, I've managed to make it very difficult for myself, but it's still ultimately, you know, like, is this going to make people move? Is there emotional content in it? I was hanging out with Dan Bell recently, and he said something like, we're just talking about music, and he said something like, you know, when it comes down to it, I mean, Dan's a pretty humble... I think, humble down to earth guy. And he was just like, you know, it comes down to it. What we do is really not hard. Like, it's really not hard to make a techno or house track. And I was like, yes, it is. He was like, no, it's really not. And I was like, yeah, it really is. And it was funny coming from him, too, because I know he's pretty crazy with that stuff. I mean, like... Yeah, for a guy have like three sounds in them and to get that right, you know, he has, I mean, he has dots and dots and dots apparently of stuff that he just never put out. But, but I don't know, I try and keep his words in my head too, you know, because it isn't that hard. You know, we're not doing, you know, classical music with, you know, these different modes and, you know, complex harmonies and, you know. It's pretty straightforward. But the one thing that he's very good at and the one thing that Metrorail was really known for was how absolutely stripped down to the bone that stuff was, but at the same time had exactly the right amount of elements. And I wonder how hard it is for you to... Are you constantly taking things away? Yeah, yeah. Oh, making it so easy. It's the taking away that takes all the time. Oh, I could make a track in an afternoon. It's just then refining it that takes six months. So how long does... the last storm queen record take to record and then how long did it take to well recording is just well it's a few days with ade i mean like you know it's also syncing up with ade i mean that's almost more more difficult but he's a vocalist too so and he's a working vocalist so if he comes over and he's been screaming on the train you know, or he had a, or he, you know, did something the day before or he has a cold or he's been smoking a lot or, you know, I mean, the voice is a fragile instrument and I'm not a singer. So, or, or when I sing, it's just to do sketches, you know, it's, it's not for the final product. So, you know, that takes a while cause you have to work with the person's, you know. voice. Then the rest of it, I don't know. I mean, it was a year between records. It was. But I, you know, I don't think if you, you know, I always think of it as like, if you could go in and sort of do. some equation where you're like started out with this in the morning eight hours later it's this let me look at the net difference you know let me look at the actual difference between the two versions like i could work all day and then the actual difference will be a hi-hat or something like that But you have to go through it. You have to do all the wrong things. And there's no reason to make it hard for yourself if you get it right from the outset. I just usually don't. And I like to let the music stew. That's also really important because you completely lose your objectivity if you work on something for eight hours. even with remixes, there'll be a deadline and I might finish by the deadline, but I'll say I need more time because I need the music to sit for a week or even just a weekend, a few days. The time is really important. And that's also something you can't fake, I don't think. people who pump stuff out and there some people are really good at that but you know i i think almost universally something unless it's like the ramones or something where it's just like this urgent live performance you want to get down but i think with studio music it always takes it always benefits from walking away from it and then coming back to it later after you've forgotten it a little bit how long did you walk away from last record From Storm Queen? From the last Storm Queen record? Oh, just every week I would leave it. My studio is far away from home too. Sometimes I'd have to do label stuff. I wouldn't go to the studio for a few days. I wasn't working every day. And then I'm working on other Storm Queen stuff the whole time. So I'd like to go around and do different tracks. I'm working on six or seven tracks at the same time. And I keep throwing tracks away. I have tons of tracks I Is there an album then? I'd like to do an album. I mean, I don't know. Do albums exist anymore? Like, I don't know if people really care anymore, but I'd like to do one if only to have an excuse to do something, you know, sort of like a little more involved, like maybe do a little live PA thing or a little live show or something like that. I mean... It took you a year to put out another 12-inch... What were you doing? Just working. Yeah? I just work slowly. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I work, but I work slowly. Yeah. And, you know, then you go on tour and, you know, you're tired after and, you know, you have other obligations and, you know, I run the label and... I don't say that like in a... Man, where's the record? I just, I find it interesting in like music reviews all the time. People say things like, oh, you know, he doesn't put out much, but all of its quality and he's back in the lab, you know, type of thing. And I think to myself, well, actually, you know, he went on tour. Yeah. He had to do label work. Yeah, exactly. It's not like you're constantly. Yeah, and The Lab is like a crappy studio in Queens. Not that you're not working hard, but it's a little bit overblown. It's a lot of listening. Yeah? Yeah, I mean, to the song over and over, trying to get things right. And also just like this, and also like being ruthless, you know, if something starts grating on me or it didn't feel right, I'll just take it out even if it took a month to do. I mean, I had a whole, I had so many versions. And actually, this is the first time I kept my, I'll do like a little MP3 demo and take it home and like listen on headphones on the subway back to my house. And I actually was thinking of... do it like i don't like just like i know you're supposed to do this as an artist now like you know you put stuff on your facebook page or your website where it's like here's a video of us doing this and you know like here here we are we're recording here today or whatever and as a fan it's kind of fun sometimes to see people you know artists i like doing that but i think it takes some of the mystery away and like it's just i mean you know i think the band fan relationship isn't always bad. Like, I don't think you should know every fucking thing about someone. You know, I remember going to see Depeche Mode in 1985 or something. And they were this like crazy and like weird, like, you know, I would just listen to these metal clanging sounds. It was like this mysterious thing. And then I saw them and I was like, oh, they're a bunch of fucking rockers. You know, like, you know, like, I mean, I still really like them. But it was just like, oh, the dude's posturing, you know, Dave Gaughan is like. spinning around taking his shirt off and you know the other dudes are you know lip syncing or whatever they were doing and it was kind of crushing because I was like wow this was this far away you have to realize I was a suburban kid I mean a Depeche Mode is not going to sound sophisticated to someone who grew up in New York or or even just in Europe where it was like just pop music. You know, I mean, in New Jersey, that was like cutting edge alternative stuff in the suburbs, you know. So, you know, it was this really cool band to me. And then I saw them, it was like. you know so sorry I'm really off on a tangent here my initial point was I'm not a huge fan of sharing every little bit of what you do but you almost thought about it with this one it was just I have all these demos and it just changes so much you know it you can hear the song and the first demo from you know a year ago the whole songs there There's all these little changes. And I mean, it's almost like good for me to listen to because I'm just like, wow, what an idiot I am. Like, it really didn't change that much. Why the fuck did I take so long? You know, but you just hear it sort of, you know, expanding, contracting, the colors changing, you know, oh, I'm using this placeholder baseline and now I use the real synthesizer. It's like boring stuff, but sort of, I thought it it all together, a measure from each section. I remember the only time I ever went to your studio in Brooklyn, you had like a your screen or something like that it was your computer i don't even remember this you were just like yeah i'm uh just give me two minutes i'm just finishing up this thing that only i care about and then like no one else is gonna notice except for myself and that moment i was like well we have a perfectionist compulsive guy. But it's true though. Yeah, because I mean, and you know, as much as it's funny, you have to be at peace with your own song. You know, so even if no one's going to appreciate it, if you're going to hear something that bugs you every time it plays, it's going to be kind of a miserable rest of your life. You know, it's like, you know, it's like if your whole discography, there's stuff that bugs you through it because he You know that so you have to pay attention to that on the other hand usually you forget You know I am Darshan I used to obsess over stuff and we always call it being too like not like this is some amazing expression we coined but we'd always be like we're too zoom in right now all you could hear was um you know hum in something and you're just like oh jesus this wrecking the whole song and then we're like oh let's work on something else and a month later we'd be like what was it you know you can't even remember what was bothering you because it just doesn't doesn't matter it's some tiny thing yeah this is a super nerdy are there accidents in any of your records or do you let those things happen? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's like the, that's always the best part. It's like the accidents, but, um, Yeah. Like that's the, the, the skill in music making is just no, it's like knowing when to take advantage of something, knowing when to say this is done and also knowing when to say, Oh, that wasn't what was supposed to happen. Let's redo it versus that's wasn't, wasn't what was supposed to happen. And it's much better, you know, it's like, right. And it's, I mean, it's like, that's really, I mean, that's like such a basic skill. I mean, you do that even in life, you know? Oh, I went, you know, I, oh, I wasn't supposed to turn on this street. No, this is actually a quicker route or whatever. I mean, it's like the simplest concept, but in music, it's just doing it kind of, it's doing it right. You know what I mean? Yeah. You know, sometimes you hear people like, oh yeah, we, we did this. And like, you can hear the sound like an amateur and you're you know this sounds like crap so it's just knowing when it's good and when it's not that's that's i think what you learn you know um the last question i wanted to ask you and i think it's it's the one that you get probably the most often new metro area material yeah i don't know what to say because we haven't been working on metro area and I mean, I'm content to let Metro Area be, I think. I mean, I always... I mean, since the album, I've maintained that we shouldn't have even done the three records after it. It should have been... four records in an album um part of that's you know i think it's less us uh we had a lot more that we wanted to explore but it was just like we worked too slowly and it kind of bit us in the ass because other people explored stuff we wanted to explore or there were records that you know we would have sounded similar to or or maybe it sounded similar to us was my false modesty there but uh you know the the um you know there was sort of no reason to do it you know like who did you hear that came up that did stuff that you're like Yeah, we wanted to do that when they did it first. Do you remember anyone in particular? No. It was more the other way. I mean, it was more just like, oh, like there's a lot of records that sound like kind of disco boogie records now. But we never, I mean, we often, I mean, I don't know. I have to remember I'm not just sitting here talking to you. this is you know this will reflect like badly on me but I mean I don't like a lot of music and we'd hear a lot of stuff where the palette would be the same but we're never like damn that's great you know it was just more like you know there's a shitload of records that are using sort of you know this genre these genres as a springboard or you know, people with the same influences, uh, influences as us. Um, uh, and, you know, we were just basically copying shit. You know, it's not like we're doing anything original. We, we, you know, we, we liked, you know, old boogie records. We liked techno records. We like new wave and just combined it all and took the elements we liked. Um, you know, we were totally copying stuff like, uh, uh, and not even copying sometimes, just taking. I mean, we'd never take musical phrases, but, you know, we took drum sounds from records, you know, hi-hats from something or kick drum from something. Mura, right? Took. Mura. Yeah. Mura took a drum loop. you know a kick and clap sound and a little break from a stars on 45 record but i felt no guilt about that because it was taking it from a record that ripped off you know it was like a rip off of funky town that we ripped off you know like um Yeah. And, you know, I think I just sampled that because I was like, I'll use this as sort of a metronome. You know, I'll just quickly put a beat in my computer or in my sampler rather. Yeah, we use samplers back then. And I just used it and I was like, I'll just keep it. It sounds pretty good. You know. But yeah, I just see no real reason to keep doing Metro Area. We started doing like... We have a bunch of songs that we worked on because we're both into sort of this... I always say new wave, but kind of like... I don't know. I think people have different... For some people, new wave is actually like really cool, kind of obscure stuff. you know like just new wave stuff from you know the early 80s and uh like danceable rnb and danceable new wave stuff that we that we used to like So our new stuff was much more quirky in a way. Or not quirky. I can't come up with the right adjective. But it was sort of like maybe more of a Devo influence without the silliness, but this kind of sound. We did a bunch of records with these, a bunch of songs with this. And they were cool ideas, but then I was just kind of like, you know, it should just be another project. Because there's going to be a few people that are like, oh, cool. cool like it's a new sound for this group name and then most people are just gonna be like this fucking sucks you know i want mura again or whatever
