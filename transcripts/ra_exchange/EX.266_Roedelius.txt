Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Hans Joachim Rodelius. It's hard to properly introduce him, because his life has intersected with a staggering amount of history, both musical and otherwise. He was a founding member of Cluster and Harmonia, two of the most important and influential groups to emerge from Germany in the 20th century. But the path that led him there is as thrilling as the sounds themselves. You'll hear about it all shortly from the man himself, as told to the German music journalist Florian Sievers recently at our office in Berlin. The interview comes in advance of this month's Lifelines Festival here in Berlin, which this year will delve into Rodelius' life and work. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. Rodelius, next up on The Exchange. you What do you associate with being back in Berlin? What do I associate? How do you feel being back in Berlin? I always feel very, very, very well when I'm here because I love it, still love it. Even so, I'm here just accidentally. So whenever I'm here, I feel home, of course. It's your birthplace. It's my birthplace, yes. And I have a big relationship because my career started here in 60s, 70s. 78 so they are strong threat to Berlin. You even started your somehow your or you even had your first contact to the arts in a way in Berlin when you have when you were a child actor at the age of four. Yeah but I wasn't aware that I was connected to the art I just would My parents wanted me to play these roles in some films because my father was a dentist and some of his patients, they worked for the Ufa. So one of the guys who came to him, he saw me and said, oh, I would like to have this guy play in a film. So it started when I was three. In 1938 was the first film I played in. You even experienced the war in Berlin and you've been evacuated to the countryside in 1943, is that right? In 1943 we were evacuated to the east, to East Prussia. There we stayed for about one year and then we had to flee because the Russians approached. And we went to the former Sudetenau until the end of the war. and then we had to walk from Czechoslovakia to near Berlin, and then we stayed there for some years in a little village called Aldeban. There I went to school, and then we moved to the Erzgebirge, I don't know how to explain it in English, in the south of East Germany. And then I went to school again and then they took me into the army. The Eastern guys took me into the army. I had to go. And I stayed in the army one year. Then I fled away, deserted. That was after the uprising of 1953, right? When did I flee? For 54, I fled. And my family called me back. We just fled. I didn't swear a note, nor I signed something. I just was a soldier. And then I went back because my family said, you can come back, they don't do anything, any harm to you. And I came back and they put me into jail. And after the jail, two years jail, I had the possibility to study physiotherapy and nursery and I was guided after dying. And then one day the Stasi called me in the Normandie Strasse and immediately picked my stuff and went away because it was still open Berlin at night 60. And after then... my new life started here in West Berlin. So you resettled to West Berlin immediately, one year before they set up the war and nobody could leave? Yeah, one year before. So how was West Berlin in the 60s when you came here? For me it was, of course, something very... exhausting because they didn't accept my stats exam, my examiner, so I had to do several different jobs to survive. Very funny jobs. I was a detective and I was a... Worker in the fruit, in Fruchthof. Many, many things. I was a butler. And then finally I became, could work as a monsieur. Some people where I worked as a monsieur, they got me as a personal monsieur. So I had very famous acquaintances with many famous people, with Wolfgang Neuss, for example. with the publisher of Henry Miller. I got to know Henry Miller here when I gave massages to this woman and people from the film industry. But I also did different jobs. I was a butler for fabricant of wool, of pullover. and drove him in the holidays to Corsica and then I stayed in Corsica because I loved Corsica so Corsica is my second homeland. And since '63 I'm more or less every year in Corsica. I have many friends there, musicians. They come to the Lifelines program as well. But when I asked this question about the West Berlin in the 60s, I was thinking of more of the cultural scene. Also the political scene, but the cultural scene. So how did you, with all these jobs, how did you come in contact with the music scene? with what would later become your career now. One of my patients was a pianist and she was also very much into the West Berlin culture. She was a girlfriend of Schilly, of this guy who was a lawyer of the Rote Armee Fraktion. And who was later the Minister for the Interior of Germany. And she got me to know the living theatre, a performance of a living theatre, Frankenstein. And when I got to know this, I became curious how art would be, how I could involve myself into art. And then step by step I did it. I got to know people. freelance artists like I was afterwards. So they started with some collaborations, street music, some collectives, and at the end, human beings who was at the end. running the Zodiac Club. You co-founded this club, Zodiac, in 67, I think? 68. 68? It was Konrad Schnitzer and Boris Schaak, Elke Lixfeld and some others. And it was a club that ran for about one and a half year. Then it was closed by the city. Then we went to Africa. The whole group went to Africa and split in Casablanca on the parking space. Human being was split there. Then I went back to Berlin and at the end of Berlin, at the end of 69, I found that the Schnitzler cluster was K. And it was Möbius, the three of us. And we went on tour for one and a half year. And then Schnitzler left the group and Möbius and I, we... changed the first letter into cluster And then we were on the road for about 40 years. Yeah, but before we come to all this, I would like to go back to the Zodiac Club, or Zodiac maybe if you pronounce it in German. Because that had only a very brief period of existence, one and a half years, you just said. But it was so influential that people still talk about it, that people like me still know about it today. Can you describe a bit what kind of place was that? It was the first free arts lab in Berlin at the time. It was about the same period like the factory in New York and the arts lab in London. It was in the same quality, free, organized by people who really liked to get what they wanted to do. And it was just two open rooms. One was to socialize, sitting around, talking to each other, drinking beer. whatever. And another room was in black where all these happenings started. There was not only music. There was theater, there was acting, there were exhibitions. Every day there was happening some different sort of event. And it was very busy, it was always crowded, and human being was... it was the home of human being. So we became aware of what we did in the Zodiac whilst playing in Coran Publico. And there is one product from '68 that's just called... human being life at the Zodiac 1968. I don't know whether it's really well known. I don't think it's well known. I found it, but I have seen it, but I don't have it. It's available. It came out in America, in Toledo. by a label called Nepenthe. And what kind of, your first band or music project, Human Being, what kind of music was that? Because I've read you've said that it was musical actionism, with primal screams. Yeah, it was every day in a different amount of people doing it. The nucleus was for five people. We were always in the game. Then others came to us and have been involved. Sometimes we were nine people or something. I don't know. I think we were seven people when we did this record. As you've just said, the Zodiac Club was also the birthplace of your first project. Do you pronounce it German? Kluster? Kluster, yeah. So how did you meet Dieter Möbius and Konrad Schnitzler? He was guest there and he run the club as well as we did, but it was not as well known as the Zodiac. It was called Abismar Sayed. and they played just music from records, so it was not live music. So he was interested in what we did in the Zodiac and he came and joined us there as a guest. But he wasn't a musician himself at the time, he was a cook in a restaurant. And Schnitzler met him and thought that he would be a good musician and he invited him to play in our group Cluster, which was just an idea. And one day Möbius said, yes, I try. And he came and so Cluster was born. for 40 years, yes. I mean, different, with different letters. Yeah, you recorded two albums with this first incarnation. of Cluster. And funnily enough in Düsseldorf. How did that come on? The Schwann label? When we found the Cluster we decided after this 12 hour concert in the Gallery Hamburg. It was our second concert with Möbius. to tour wherever possible. So we went out of Berlin and landed first in Düsseldorf and there we played in little clubs and the cantor came listening to us and he said, please play a concert for me in the studio. I think your music somehow fits into my idea of new church music. Strange idea for the kind of music we did at the time. But it worked, really worked well. So we met, we went to Gudolf and we got to know about Conny Planck, who was sound engineer there. We played for about... four hours constantly what we ever did and the counter took some of the stuff out and put some text into it yeah it was very radical idea because the the music is not really i mean the first cluster music was really harsh it was very experimental yeah no it still was experimental but Somehow it fits to the text, but just one side of the LP is text and one side is music. Yeah, and as you've just said, in Godorf, which is part of Cologne, you've met Conny Planck for the first time, which I think was a Renos studio where you recorded. So he became a very special person. Yeah, he became later on. Afterwards, we toured, Möbius and I, we toured, and then we went to stay for a while in Hamburg, where Konrad invited us to live with him in his community, where he lived with Udo Lindenberg and these famous guys at that time. So he was our sponsor. He could live in his flat and he feeded us because we never had money. He produced us the first records in the Star Studio, Cluster 1 and Cluster 2. And then we followed him into his new studio in Cologne and there we produced other... records I don't know which, a lot altogether. And he toured with us as well when we were live on the road. So he was like a third band member, you even mentioned him as a band member. He was in fact the third member of Kloster. He did such a lot of artistic input into what we did with him at the time. Also to my first solo record "Durch die Wüste". So he kind of became famous together with you. I mean while working with you he also became a very famous producer. Oh he was already famous. Or was he already famous? He was already because he worked with Marlene Dietrich, he worked with Jörg Ellington and he worked with the Ultravox and all these guys and Divo. So he was quite famous by himself already. I see, I see. And then we went with Eno to him in his studio and did two records in his studio with Eno. So it was a long, very fruitful period. If I understood it right, when you have left Berlin at the end of the 60s to go on this very long tour, you kind of never came back to Berlin. No. We left Berlin in 69, we came back in 2007. So, yeah, why did you not come back? We were on tour. It just happened that we were invited to stay there. And to stay there, Möbius and I first were invited to stay in the north of Germany, in Schleswig-Holstein. And there we were invited to play at the first open-air festival in Germany on the Isle of Fremont, where we got to know... Jimi Hendrix and Sly and the Family Stone and Alexis Corner and all these guys. This drummer with red hair. I forgot. Too many people in my head. Too many people. Not... Anyway, famous guys in the field of rock and pop music. And then this guy who invited us to stay in his farm, we had the idea to create a community in the middle of Germany, in Forst, and invited us to come with him there and to stay with him there and to work there in this beautiful, most beautiful island. Kwasi Island beside a river with beautiful old trees and fields and meadows. And there we stayed and Michael Rotter came to us and we founded Harmonia. So we lived there for about seven years. Then my wife and I, we left for Austria because one of the nuclear plants up rivers was for years. broken and they didn't tell. I didn't know. People died, many, many children died of leukemia, but they didn't tell. So many people died and we just got our first child and we said, oh God, we have to leave here because... just get rid of the danger so we left first this beautiful place yeah yeah so it was kind of a beautiful place but with the danger that you couldn't see yeah it's like with the attack yeah radiation it was a beautiful place with a danger we couldn't see interesting okay but we come back to you leaving first before first i would like to talk about forced a bit um So you found this place because this guy from this festival took you there? Yeah. Okay, I always wondered how did you... We were invited because it was this big place with three houses, totally abandoned. We had to renovate them by our own costs. and a big ranch and just a big space. We dared to do it because it was a lot of work, really. For two years I renovated the house. We lived just our flat in that house, in Möbius and Rotter as well. And it was beautiful work. Anyway, we had to do everything with our hands. We had to get back to the roots, go into the forest, cut wood, make a garden, renovate. He has water pipes. Yeah, water pipes. Toilet, because it was just a plumes closet. So it was a very, very beautiful situation. Was it a home for you after being homeless for 40 years? For me, it was the first time in my life since 1943 when I had to leave Berlin to settle down and to come to get the feet on the earth. Because I was always traveling, always on the road. So for me and my wife it was really beauty in itself, a living utopia. I see, I see. Did you feel as part of the hippie movement? It was, it was. Did you have long hair? Yeah, I had my long hair. I still had my long hair. I had long hair when I was a monsieur as well. So I guess it must have been really beautiful. So how did you meet your wife there? Because I imagined it's these three houses in the woods. I know Weserbergland is a very beautiful area, but there's not too many people there. So how did you meet? We met before because she was working as a freelance artist as well. She had her own. We met in art places, in festivals, in experiments. There was one in Frankfurt, there was a festival. She was an artist at the festival in Frankfurt. She had to leave the house because we were so loud. I see. Horribly loud. So you went there together. And that was the first meeting. We saw each other. And then afterwards we always met in different places in Basel. in Düsseldorf, in Kraljana, in Hamburg. And we saw each other and she knew that I will be her husband. She knew it already when we met. I didn't know. Nice. And then one day she came to France with her boyfriend and decided to stay. She was sent by my former girlfriend. from Hamburg to get me to Hamburg because my former girlfriend didn't want me to be away from her. I see. But I didn't want to live in a big city because Forst was so beautiful. So she sent her to tell me that I had to come back to Hamburg. to be with her, but she decided to stay there with me. The plan did not work. Fortunately. Fortunately for you, yes. It was not our decision. No, it was destiny, I guess. So, as you said, you really felt that it was the first time that you got your feet on the ground. And I think you can really hear, I can really hear that in the music you produced back then. It was so happy and beautiful. I was so happy. Harmonic. It was so happy. And every night I sat in the studio and played on this untuned piano. Or I did some of my stuff. All my self-portraits, most of the material was done in force, besides the work with classes. in Harmonia. So I was all the time, I mean, I worked over 24 hours a day in the woods, garden, gardening, taking care of her and our first baby, our first child came to birth and it was a beautiful birth. She came, we had a big chimney and my wife did a house birth. And of course, this was heaven. She dared to do it at home. Nobody wanted it. The hospital said, you have to get to the hospital. You have to have a doctor while it's birthing. And she said, no, I want my child at home in front of the fireplace with music of my husband. Beautiful. Very beautiful. And what did the other band members say when you kind of became a family there? It was nice. It was okay. We agreed, of course. They didn't. I think Möbius married afterwards. some years afterwards. Michael is still unmarried, I think. So yeah, before we come to your leaving Forst, what you just talked a bit about, as you just said, Michael Rotter came to Forst. Yeah, Michael came one day and I think we had met in between somewhere on concerts and festivals. He came one day with the idea of Klaus Dinger to form a supergroup called Europe. Well, fortunately it didn't work out. Harmonia worked out. But also only for three years because Cluster, Möbius and I, we didn't want to rehearse every day the same things. We were really somehow a little bit like fachidioten, wie heißt das? We were fixed on our program. to rehearse. That was our aim. We don't rehearse, we play out of the moment and we see what's coming out and to elaborate what's... It worked well. But Harmonia for three years existed and at the end when Harmonia already was, when we already split, Brian came. and we revitalized Harmonia with one product. It was very nice. The funny thing is that Harmonia and Eno 76 is a product that fits. totally too cluscent, you know. It's the same sort of approach to music. Everybody has one track, no overdub, nothing. You just played it, did it. It was beautiful. Brian said he was there 11 days. At the end he said, I was here living like in a bubble. Lab in the bubble is a different word because normally he wanted to produce and to elaborate his way of working. With us, he had the chance to... just make music out of his belly, not only of his mind. Yeah, which was always your approach to making music. So yeah, Brian Inu came there. How did you meet him in the first place? We met him before. When we were in Hamburg, we went to his concert with Rockton Music where he played this very nice... additions to Roxy Music to Brian Farrier. And he invited him. We met him afterwards and said, Brian, oh no, excuse me. He came on a promotion tour for his... First solo album, Another Green World, to a concert of ours, brought by a journalist, a concert of harmonia in the Hamburger Fabrik. and just jumped into the game. There was a keyboard empty, we didn't play, and he came and played with us, and it worked really well. So you played at this club, Fabrik in Hamburg, and this guy entered the stage, did you know who he was? No, we knew him. Okay, you knew him. Of course. That was not like a strange comment. Of course, we were proud that he came in. and just came into the game just by accident. And then because it went so well, we said to him, "Please come to our force community, and let's try to do something else." And he said, yes, I will. And two years later, he appeared for 11 days. And that was what I'm telling you. So he was in Germany because he worked with David Bowie in Berlin at the time? He was in, when he came to our place, he just came from Berlin working on Law and Heroes. and on his way to Switzerland to finish the works on Lone Heroes. And David always every day called, Come, Brian, you have an agreement with me in Lausanne? Come on, finish our works. But he loved to stay with us. He really liked it. Our daughter, he took our daughter night and... He babysitted her? It was such a nice, that was really nice meeting with him before he went to be so famous like he is today. And it's funny because this song by this river on his album Before and After Science, that means that this song relates to the Weser. I think it relates to the session. Okay, that's very beautiful. It's beautiful, yeah. Meanwhile, there are hundreds of cover versions. And you also recorded your first solo album in Forst before you left. Is that true? My first solo album? Durch die Wüste? No, I did it with Connie in Connie's studio. Ah, okay, sorry. We did it in 76 and it came out in 78. Two years it needed to get to the public. And as you just said, then you decided to leave because your first child was born and you were afraid of the radiation of this nuclear bomb. So then you moved to Baden near Vienna? I just moved directly to Baden to a little village called Blumau where she was born. I see. And at least it was not as beautiful like in Forst, especially not for her because she was born there and she had a hard life as a child. But it was green. And our second and our third child, they came to us there. So at least when they were born, their first feeling was green, not gray, like beton. So that's where you still live, right? No, we live not in Blumenau. Now we live in Bayern. Now we live in Baden. It needed a little bit before we could move to Baden. And since 2000, 90, 95, we live in Baden now. Different places now for 10 years in one place. And you have mentioned earlier in our conversation that your approach to making music has always been rather intuitive with concepts and all this. So you never learned making music in school, right? You just did it by yourself. So can I say that you're only influencers also yourself? What kind of external influences did you have when you started making music? In the Bible it's said that your name is known before you are born and all what you have to do in your life, it's already decided. So I think I'm really walking in the steps. footsteps of Mayank Estos. They were teachers, preachers, cantors, church, connected to the church and to education. And I found out that's the thing, the way I have to go after some... years of not really knowing why do I music. But because I was a physiotherapist, I'm a physiotherapist and masseur as well, I think it's the same thing. I'm doing great in music now. I give massages to the people's ears. But I guess since you've just said you had long hair when you already worked as a masseur in Berlin. I guess you also listened to some of the music that was around then, like Jimi Hendrix and psychedelic rock. My first connection to modern music was when I was monsieur in Paris. My girlfriend gave me to listen to Yanis Xenakis and Pierre Henry. It was moving something in my head. And that was the first input of trying to do something else besides massage. And in Berlin, one of my patients was a pianist. She made me... I got to know about this theater group, this American theater group, Living Theater, from Julian Beck and Judith Molina. And I met all these people, all these guys. And in 68, when I was in Corsica working, I went to Avignon. where the Living Theatre was performing Paradise Now, which was a very, very famous piece at the time. And we were part of the whole action. We looked at... them when they worked for it and we were there when they played it and there my decision to become a musician was really fixed at the time. Did you listen to, when you became very active with Cluster, did you listen to bands like Kraftwerk and Neu? Kraftwerk I never liked very much because I don't like constructed music. It's not my thing. Neue was much more vibrant, much more interesting for me as well, but in general it was music like Habs, Hush and the Color of Coats was in the beginning, then the band. Jimi Hendrix, John Van Cleef, Frank Zappa, all these guys. I listened a lot to them because Möbius was a friend of pop music and rock music at the time. I got to know about this music as well a lot, but we never had the aim to copy something. We just had to do what we had to do. But I was thinking of the other bands from Germany that maybe were around at the same time, like Amund Dühl and Ken on Embryo, Popol Vuh. Do you know these? The most influential was Ken. because we also know the people and Holger Zschugler played on some of his records so Ken was more closer to our hearts than any other. Florian Frick from Popol Vuh as well and who else? There were some we really liked. from the German scene. Not Amon Duel so much. Ambrio. Ambrio in the beginning. Did you play concerts together? We played sometimes on festivals together. But I had the... And is it also true that you had some contact to Florian Schneider's sister Claudia? You were friends with her? That was a girl who sent me... Oh, that was the girl from Hamburg. Yeah, that was the girl from Hamburg. I see. Florian Schneider's sister Claudia. I see. She's still not happy about that she got to be my wife. But in general, what was later summarized as Krautrock, as the British called it later on, it was not a real scene back then. There were bands around that had similar approaches, but it was not that everybody knew each other. I always hate this quote, Krautrock, what does it mean? It's not for a cluster at all. Possibly for some of Harmonia's work. But that could work. And also, I guess, because you're 10 years older than some of the others of the scene. I was always the oldest, yeah. You had a different approach, I guess. I had a different approach from my curriculum, anyway. And from my past. What did it make with you that you lived through the war and also with regards to the political positions in this scene that you have experienced? I have experienced. I had to go to the Hitlerjugend to do this and I remember, I still remember because I'm writing my autobiography and I'm wondering how I remember. The very young ones. And that I had to demonstrate at Walter Ulbricht's. That was hell. So you were first member of the youth organization of the Hitler Youth, which were called PIMS. And then I had to go to the army. And so I was really burned, a burned child when I got to be able to get to Berlin, to West Berlin. But from what I understand, there were different approaches and different bands at the same time in Germany back then? But from what I've understood, I always thought that it was also motivated by the war in so far that they wanted to start something new to do something else than their parents' generation. To start again. There was this expression, our zero, where we start new. We want to restart and find what is German culture after. The Nazis. Not by purpose, because my father wasn't a Nazi at all. He could, because he was in the First World War, he was on the Red Cross and he had to collect the victims on the battlefields. And he inhaled Zemfgas, blue, as a gift. And so his lungs were broken. And so he was not allowed to go to the war, so he didn't have to shoot. I'm very happy for him. And what did I want? You didn't have to go into opposition to your father. No. there was no reason to construct something against or as a new kind of art because of Hitler. Not for me. It just happened because I went into the footsteps of my ancestors. That was what I had to do, I think. And was it maybe an idea to do something else than Anglo-American blues-based music? I guess not for you as well, because you listen to some of them. Cross, Disturbed, Smash and Young. Yes, you listen to that, right? I love them. Beautiful. Because that's what some people write about crowd rock today or what is summarized as crowd rock, that they wanted to do something else than blues-based music. No, no, no. We just had to learn. We wanted to be musicians and we wanted to do it in the practical way because otherwise there were no chance to do it because we didn't study it. Möbius was a graphic designer, I was a healer, a masseur, a physiotherapist, and I think Brian was a graphic designer before as well. They went to an art school, many of them went before they went to be a musician to an art school. Just, it was... I had to go this way. But the liner notes of the first Kluster album with Kay, they write about... That's Schnitzler. Okay, because he wrote about the destruction and dissolution of traditional musical perceptions. That is something that is very conceptual. Kluster, yeah, yeah. Kluster was... the idea of Conrad. And Conrad was a pupil of Joseph Beuys. And so that was his concept. And we just were his slaves. We had to do it. I see. In a way, he was such a strong guy. full of energy to do it, just to do it. And of course it was influential, very much influential. We couldn't follow his concept because we were not intellectuals. We wanted to do it. It was, for us, the most important thing to do it. and then to see what's coming out. And you see, Schnitzler left the group anyway. Schnitzler left the Zodiac before. He never stayed in one project. And he never stayed with Edgar Forrester and Klaus Schulze as well. Intent to dream, yes. So he wanted, he was a very, very... special person until his end. But what you've done later, your solo work as well as Clusterwood C is by many people regarded today as a forerunner of ambient music and different types of electronic music. And I found it interesting that whereas most electronic music is urban music, it's technology, it's industrial and all this, your music always seemed very pastoralist. It's really nature music, right? Is that also, I guess, because of your starting in Forst and all this? It became more and more somehow. organic music. Organic music. You can put it in your garden. Yeah, I guess that's why it's very tonal and harmonic and all this. It's floating. That's our aim, to live a harmonic life without doing too much harm to the earth, using too much of the energy. taking care of our children, taking care of education, taking care of culture. We run our own festival, the two of us, for about 12 years now. So it's all about... Health. It's all about health. You do this festival in Lund, am Seljen? More or less. It's one beautiful part of Lower Austria, a glacial lake, with water you can drink when you swim. That's very seldom coming from a glacier. And you've always worked rather intuitive and the music came from within. It's funny, it's interesting that you also did, on the same time you did many, you worked in collaborations with many people. How did that come? I mean, I would imagine if you would like let the music flow from your inside, why do you prefer or why do you like to work with somebody else as a counterpart? Good question. I don't know. I love the people I'm working with. It's all about friendship and love. And if all these guys with whom I'm working at the moment, it's about seven people now. It's Laird Cole, it's Stefan Schneider, it's my group Tempo Strande, just four people. Christopher Chaplin, Christoph Müller, Leon Moraglia, all these guys are friends. And we share the same concept, we share the same values, and that's the main thing, it's the base on which we can work. And it's very challenging to work with these guys because they are different, they have a different approach to music. Some of them have studied music and they do put something into the life, most about live music. They do something, they put something into the live music, which is always challenging. Yeah, I guess they're very different. Stefan Schneider used to be a member of Turoko Chorot. And then you've got Lloyd Cole, of course. Then you've got Christoph Müller from Gotan Project. and Charlie Chaplin's San Christopher, and then you've got also On and Block as you work as Cluster. But did you stop that project? There's Cluster with Q as well, which is the third incarnation of... It was a third incarnation of Schnitz. I mean, it's all about Schnitz's concept. It was his concept, and it was a very, very successful concept for us because we could develop ourselves. We could find out about... in which way we could work to feed our aims and visions. And so it's always a cluster with Q is the same thing. It's dedicated to Schnittweiser idea. It's just to stay on that. way working from the belly not from there I mean of course with our heads but to create music out of the moment which different gear what's available in the moment and with different people and now it's on in book and I mean met Cluster with Q. Already five records. And one must not forget that you're also writing poems and project stories. So you're still doing that? It's somehow the same amount of work in text like music. It's 232 records with my name on it. Incredible. Very impressive. And all in between. And I've often read that you're not listening to any contemporary music. to avoid that. Is that still the case? You're not listening to contemporary music like current music. I have no time to it. Or do you not want to because it might influence... I'm just listening to it when I'm on the audio radio sometimes. And more and more to classical music. More and more. Why is that? Because with 80 years my brain is full of... of clichés. It's all, for me, for my ears, most of contemporary music is quite on the same level of ingredient, form. So I always sing, oh, I heard this, I know this, I know this, I know this. I don't know the name from the people who teach this, but I know the type of music. And for me it's boring to listen to always the same clichés. So I stopped to listen. Classical music, I didn't listen a lot, so for me classical music is sort of a... How do you say that? A relax with classical music. But I don't listen very often, even in the autoradio. No, it's not necessary. But I guess it might also influence, when you would listen to too much contemporary music, might it also influence your... musical stream that comes out of you, that intuitive stream? Possibly, if I would really carefully listen to it, of course, I would say, oh, it's a good piece of music. What shall I do after listening to it? No, no. Possibly, yeah. Okay. When I listen to the newest music with Christoph Müller, which is very well elaborated stuff, then I think, oh, you are part of it. I didn't do much. I'm delivering melody and background, but the construction, the structure of the pieces are most... It's Christoph, so I'm part of it. I wouldn't be able to do that. I just have to... I'm happy that I be part of it, but I wouldn't be able to do it at all. And I don't want to do it. It's not my aim. ♪ ♪ Thank you. Thank you. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ of different ways. I'm on tape.
