Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. When I say that Amsterdam DJ Dimitri was there from the very beginning, that's not an exaggeration. His legendary residency at Roxy began in 1988, and it's often cited as one of the main reasons the clubbing culture in the Netherlands is so strong. Spinning techno, house, and everything in between, his reputation stems from his uncanny ability to not only mix complicated rhythms, but melodies as well. Production-wise, Dimitri teamed up early on with Eric Newhon to create Twisted Techno as Alice D in Wonderland, but DJing has always been his priority. Until recently, that is. Returning from retirement in 2010, Dimitri is now equally devoted to both disciplines. We caught up with Dimitri in Amsterdam earlier this year to talk about The Roxy, how the scene has changed over the years, and what he got up to. during his brief retirement. You retired as a DJ at some point and you came back recently. Yes, I did. Why? Well, let me begin with why did I stop. I stopped because I was out of inspiration. I've been flying all over the world to play at parties. I just didn't like the music anymore that much. It was a lack of motivation and inspiration. And I just needed to do something completely else, completely different. And I started working on a farm with disabled children or young people, working in the nature, in the fields, just to empty my head and to think what I wanted to do. This is one of these... turning points in your life, but most people have it at a certain age. So for me it was around five years ago that I decided to just stop and see what I was going to do. I didn't know if I was going back to the music. I didn't know anything. And after working for two years there in nature, I knew that music is my love. And I had to come back and play the music for people again and make music also. So I did. Two years ago, I came back again. I'm full of inspiration. I love it again. I love the music. And I play all over, so it's going really well. That's interesting, you know, losing inspiration. It must be a strange feeling. Did it take a while between you losing inspiration and you quitting? It was more like work instead of having fun playing the music. you know, as it used to be. So when you feel that, I think it's time to realize that maybe you have to stop for a while or forever, I don't know. And now it doesn't feel like work anymore. No, no, no, definitely not. You're playing at Trow and you're doing a regular residency there. Yes. Was that one of the reasons or one of the first things that you did when you came back, getting a regular residency somewhere? Yeah, it was actually my first comeback night. The kickoff was in Trouw. And I decided to do a solo set, six-hour set, which I always did in the early days in the Roxy, in the club here in Amsterdam, and another club, Richter. I also played like six hour sets and that's actually I think when I'm at my best because then I can build the story myself, you know, start slowly and go to some high level points, high energy and going back again and this is what I like most. So I came to Trou two years ago for my comeback party. with a solo set, and I still do. Like once in three months, I play the solo set. What is the club landscape of Amsterdam right now in your mind? I mean, you mentioned Trouw. There's obviously a lot of other great clubs in the city. Yes, there is. to name a few, Air, Studio 80. They're really good clubs, really good programming also. I think Trou is actually the best with the programming. They really do a good job getting all new, interesting producers over to do a live show. And I think Amsterdam is in a lift again, you know, up again. For those who haven't been to Trou, could you sort of describe it, set the scene? What is it like? Well, there's two floors. At one floor, there's one part that's a restaurant. and it's open till 12 or something and at 11 the club opens. It's on the other side of the stairs. It looks a bit like a loft. It looks a bit like it could have been in Berlin. It's a very underground looking place. It used to be a paper factory, right? Yes, a newspaper factory, that's right. So it's all concrete and a very good sound system. And then there's a floor downstairs. There's a smaller room. And they have like a smaller or less known artist over there. other kind of stuff I actually don't know what they do there but but there are two different sound systems and the main floor the main room is is really really nice yeah I like it a lot the thing I find fascinating about it is it does have that restaurant and there's no real barrier except those stairs yes you just sort of can have dinner and just walk right over into this dance floor. It's just a really interesting layout. Yeah, that's what a lot of people do, yeah. So let's go back. You're basically, everyone I've heard, anytime I ask someone from Amsterdam, you know, who's the godfather of the scene, you're the name that inevitably comes up. You mentioned that you began at Richter? Yes, a club called Richter and Roxy. It was actually both in the same weekend. at my first night there, yeah. What was the club scene like at that time? Was there much of a club scene? Were those the only two clubs that you even wanted to play at, at the time? No, well, I liked them the best, yeah, that's right. But the scene at that time was excellent, I thought. This is late 80s, mid 80s? This is late 80s, like 88. And the people in Roxy who built it, it was an old cinema. And the artist who made it a club is a very highly respected, well-known artist called Peter Giele. He passed away. 13 years ago and together with him and the DJs at that time and the creative people who helped to build it the way it was was a unique group of people at the right time at the right place with the right people it was magical really people came from all over the world to go to Roxy to the club why was it the right time? It was the beginning of the house music. Like the very beginning. I remember the first nights there. People really didn't understand the house music that good. So it was also with the music that was popular at that time. I'm talking about 87. Something like that. It was the rare grooves, you know. Like the old Jim. So really, when you played a house block, a few tracks in a row, you had to make it up with the people to play another James Brown again after that. So that was hard. But when the first people came back from Ibiza at, I think, summer 88, it turned around. And all of a sudden, there was a click with the house music. And you could play house music all night long, which I always wanted to. Obviously people from, you know, everyone knows the origin story in the UK. But were there a lot of Dutch people going to Ibiza as well and coming back and saying... Yeah, yeah, especially in the Amsterdam scene. Quite a large gay scene. It was a mixture of gay people and... straight people and it was very interesting. People were freaks at that time, the way they dressed, you know. Also there was, you know, at that time it was more laid back and people just partied on a Tuesday night. or a Wednesday night, it was different, you know? And at that time, I would say that Amsterdam is a bit like the Berlin of the late 80s was Amsterdam, really. People came from all over the world. Yeah, I was right in the middle of it. And I was the one who picked up the Detroit techno, the very beginning of it. and invited Derek May and people like that, Carl Craig, when he was quite a young guy, actually. Kevin Saunders and all those guys, Juan Atkins. And it was very special. For them, it was the first time they came to Europe, except for England. They also went to England. And I made this really good connection with them. And Derek even lived here for a couple of months because he really liked it a lot. And, yeah, we had something very special going on here. Why did Derek like it so much? Did he ever tell you that he was just like, what was it about the city at that time? Derek just loved the girls, you know. And he liked the Dutch girls a lot. And that's one of the reasons. And also because the music he played was very popular here. It still is. Tell me about that first time. I mean, you mentioned sort of you had to play some James Brown, you know, to get people back on the floor sometimes. But, I mean, I'm just curious as to why Amsterdam has become such a... So popular it seems like a really interesting Stronghold of the stuff. Yeah Personally, it's because I think it's very interesting music. It's intelligent. It has its melodic It has no energy And the sound of it it was so special And yeah, at that time, people voted me for, that was like early 90s, voted me number one DJ in Holland for three years in a row. And yeah, so a lot of people came to the Roxy also because they wanted to hear me play. Also some other DJs that were really popular. But I really made this point with what I call the high-tech soul movement. And this was also the name of the night, high-tech soul movement. And it is this balance between... techno and soul and energy and melody. You mentioned it was a converted cinema, the Roxy. Yes. What else can you sort of say about it for those who weren't there? Again, like you were describing Trow, what was it actually like, the club itself? It's right at the canal in the middle of the center. And it's a very beautiful old theater. And this artist I mentioned before, Peter Giele, he did a really good job making it look the way it looked. real freaky with all these big penises above the bar and crazy stuff you know and for that time it was it was great you know now it's maybe like all penises you know but at that time it was something new you know and and there's the ecstasy was new and you know everything was new the drugs the freedom and so this all this together with that music made it like very special here you know at that time were they changing the art as well quite a bit in the club yes they they had these themes very special themes like they they make like once a month they had this whole uh crew of uh them that make the the decoration you know really great uh uh how do you say it's a professional people And they turned it into like, how do you say it in English? With this pinball game, you know? Yeah, pinball machine. Yeah, yeah. And this huge pinball machine. The whole Roxy was a pinball machine, you know? Like with these balls. going through all these rails all over the place. We had the Love Ball AIDS benefit parties with Boy George and, well, you name it. I don't know, it was the show that made it so special also, you know? I also had my, like, the pressure cooker. That's a night that I did, which was a night that the Roxy was like a pressure cooker. And we had this, how do you say it, on top of Pratchett cooker? The lid. Yeah, that was with all the lights underneath it. And it came down slowly. And so I started playing slow music in the beginning, you know. And the lights were like blue and cold. And the air conditioner was not on. Or the air conditioner was on, I mean. So it was like chilly. And slowly, when the night progressed, the thing went down. And at the end of the night, it was like... And you could touch the red lights, the air-co off, you know, steaming hot with a lot of smoke. And we just pretended like we were in a pressure cooker. These were very special events. I can imagine. So they gave you the people who own the place free reign to bring in people all the time, like Derek May and Carl Craig and these types of guys. Yeah. It must have been a really awesome situation where they trusted you to know who to book. Yeah, well, the trust came with the years, of course. When I first started DJing there, I was 19, I think, 20. And, you know, I had to, like, after a few years, like, I'm talking about 91. This is in 1990 also, when Derek May and these people came. I build quite a lot of trust with the people. So they knew it was all right what I was choosing for, you know. Did it take quite a while for you to kind of... get comfortable playing you said it was one of your first gigs right well i'm djing since 1984 so i played in big clubs outside amsterdam um this was in the north of holland it was the only very big club it was called here from jericho and um it was the only big club around so so everybody came there people from like people who like hip-hop new wavers at that time, new wavers of course, they were all in that same club and I had to all entertain them or make them have a good night. So this was really a good lesson for me how to interact with the people. Besides make your own thing, your own point with your music and your style. Also, it's a form of entertaining. You want this energy of the dance floor going on, of course. So that was a very good lesson for me. And Roxy came in 88 for me, 87. How did you come up with the high-tech soul concept? I made music together with my partner Eric Nouan. and it was very rare music for that time with a lot of computer programmed drums very funky with a lot of Detroit influences like the sounds and very original melodies and we called it Best Records which stands for BE Beautiful Soul Techno And well, High Tech Soul Movement was the next step to be born as a club night. When did you start making music? You were DJing for quite a while before. Yeah. Before the house, I did not make music. But I started making music in 1990, I think it is. Why did you decide to do that? Was it just a logical progression? No, not really, because in my heart, I'm really a DJ. I love that direct reaction from the audience. And with making music, you have to sit in the studio, which I also like. And the reaction comes later. But this is the great thing about DJing. And this friend of mine, Eric Nguyen, he was more like a musician. So he always came to the nights that I played at. He did the lights also. He wanted to make music. And together we were a perfect combination. When you first went into the studio, did you know sort of what you wanted to do? Or were you just kind of fooling around? At first, yeah, we were like... young and looking for boundaries. And, you know, the studio, it was more like we had a workstation, you know, Roland's W60 workstation with the floppy disks. And, you know, there were no laptops at that time, of course. So we bought this thing and we... We just put it into my house and we just started it. And this friend of mine, Eric, he's very bright with all this computer stuff and programming. So he did this programming and there was too less memory for the music that we made. So we had to buy another one. It was very simple at the beginning. We were making sounds like... I used to live in an area here in the Red Light District. And there was this little shop that has these instruments from all over the world. So we made this appointment with Inboot that we could borrow some of these instruments just to make tones and to record it with a microphone. And then we had very original sounds. How did you know what workstation to buy at first? I mean, who were you talking to? Actually, it was Eric's decision to choose the Roland. I really don't have no clue why it was the Roland. Probably there were not many other. I don't know. Were there people that you went to, though, and talked to, you know, give me advice? How did you make that? No, we all did it all by ourselves, yeah. Also, the music that I played, I had no examples of DJs, like, I want to do it like that or something, you know? I get inspiration from people playing certain kind of tracks, you know? or build-ups or anything. But I created it myself, the Heideck Soul Movement sound at that time. Tell me about your first track that you finished. The first track was called So Lonely. Why was it called So Lonely? Because I was very rare with the music that I played. I was really the only one who played that kind of stuff. But the second track, which became quite a well-known track, It was called LSD in Wonderland with a time problem. And this was crazy. I read in this review in an English magazine, I don't know, like Mixmag or something, like if you want to go apeshit, buy that track. And it was crazy shit. And even when I played it in the night, I really had to find a way to bring it in because it was so different. that it was good to have a few of these tracks after a while because then I could do like a few tracks in a row, you know? Let's go back to So Lonely. Yeah. did you feel lonely in terms of you know people not a lot of people doing what you were doing dj wise or was it well uh in a way i was lonely because uh you know being being like uh in spotlight was never my intention you know it was i just loved the music when i started djing like in the early 80s um you had to be a little bit crazy you know it was like you work behind the bar or you you oh he plays the music you know and and i had to wipe the dance floor at the end you know and help to clean the place it was very different and uh now when you want to become a dj you know you can be a star you know And for me, it was never my intention. So all of a sudden I was there. A DJ was a popular man all of a sudden, you know. And I was in spotlight. And I still have like a... I still think it's... For me, it's hard to do this interview, for example. I don't know what it is, but I just love that music and I want to play that. And all of a sudden, so that's why it was so long in a way. When did it change? When did you go from... DJs in general go from cleaning up the floor at the end of the night to becoming, you know, these people up on a podium. The change started, of course, when I came to Amsterdam because before that... I played it somewhere in the country up north. And that was different, of course, because here in Amsterdam, you didn't have to clean the dance floor afterwards. So, yeah, then slowly in these early house music years, DJing became very popular. Why did you move to Amsterdam to pursue a career as a DJ? Was that the reason that you came to the... I worked in a record store called Atalos and it was import music from the US and UK and from Italy at that time. And I always loved that music, like funk before and disco and also electronic stuff like Depeche Mode, of course. And for me house music was my love, my big love. The first from Chicago with the Chicago tracks, I loved it, you know? Just the drive. So I worked here in this record store and they sold these tracks and I was the one who was specialized in that stuff and the other people did the other kind of dance music. And this is where I met Eddie de Clercq. He was like the first DJ who came with the Roxy. He started it as the main DJ as it was called at that time. So I asked him as a young kid that I really would like to play at Roxy if it was possible. So I made this cassette tape. What did you put on it? I remember Sandy noticed me. I had this promo. I went to New York and I got this promo for Sandy noticed me. You know the track? Yeah. And so I remember that one was on it because Eddie called me after hearing the tape, like, what is that track? You know, he really liked it. But I also mixed in like salsa tracks, you know, from like... South American Latin stuff. So I also did this combination of different styles in the house music, as I learned before in the other club. You touched on it before. I mean, it does seem like nightlife here is very special in Europe. There's such a strong scene. Why do you think that this city in particular is such a big place for dance music? To be honest, I think... This was the 90s I'm talking about, that Amsterdam was really, like everything was possible here, you know. They didn't, with the licenses, there were a lot of like illegal parties, you know, and the police didn't do much about it. And it was just going on. And then there came this new mayor and he wanted to change Amsterdam from a backpack city to a... suit and tie Paris kind of city or something, you know, which doesn't work, of course, because this is not Paris. When did that happen? That started, I think, something like late 90s. It started to get a little bit more, I don't know the word in English, but we call it trutig. It's like, I don't know, not with a lot of balls. You know, just slow down, you know, not too much this or no, but not too many parties. So it was a more difficult time. And I think it's opening up now also because of the nightmare that we have now also helps to improve the nightlife. A nightmare. Tell me about this role. I mean, there's not a lot of cities who have someone who's in charge of talking to the authorities. No. Well, it started. They started bringing out a nightmare. because there was not so much attention or almost not at all or no understanding actually from the mayor and the people around him who were ruling the city, you know. They didn't know much about it. So a nightmare can give... good advice about what to do to have a good nightlife. He helps out. For instance, now we have this tryout coming up to have no closing times again. So right now clubs close at 5 a.m.? They still do, yes. And they're going to try in a certain amount of clubs to have no closing time. Yes, that's right. For, I think, half a year. I don't know exactly when it starts. I think this year or maybe from the beginning of next year. I don't know. But I think this is a good step forward. And that's the work of a nightmare who has close contact. with the mayor. Why is it better to have clubs with no closing time? That's a good question. For me, five is okay, you know. But I know when I play the solo nights or I play a late set till five and it stops and people are, the club is still full, you know, and they want to go on. Then it's like stupid. Why can't we go on, you know? who is there to tell me if I have to stop dancing. That's a bit silly, I think. Especially for a well-known city like Amsterdam. It's more like a village kind of stuff. So I think it's good if you can decide when to stop. I don't like clubs that go on until the last person crawls out. That's not good either. But five is early. Tell me a little bit more about Eric. You recorded with... him you ran a record label with him you're in a record store with him as well yes that's right who is Eric and how did you meet him Eric is half French of Dutch and I met him in the village that we both lived in in Bergen in a little bit up north like 30 minutes drive out of Amsterdam He was there in a European school. It's a school for kids with parents who travel a lot in Europe. I played at this party in the school there. This was a drive-in show that we had. And that's where I met him. We became very good friends. He lived with me for a while also. He came with me to the nights that I played at. And we started making music together. You know, obviously you have your own style. What did he bring to the table when you were making music? What was his, was he certain passionate about certain different things? Well, he's a very highly intelligent person, Eric. He even skipped a class in university for mathematics. The rhythms were like math for him. He made these formulas that really worked how to analyze funky drummer or anything. And he programmed it. in the very beginning of the computer music. And that was a very strong point of him. And also making up very good melodies. He's very good at it. I'm not very good at making music. That's not really my specialty. I was thinking, he's making the beats and the melodies. What were you doing? I was the inspiration, actually. And I was also the one who... who made the arrangement and the edits, you know, and the sounds and which way we're going. You know, I was the guy who was steering the ship. Yes, that's right. Why did you decide to own a record store? Obviously there were record stores in Amsterdam at the time and ones that you had worked at previously, right? Yes, that's right. But the one that we started, me, Eric, Nohan, Peter and me was specialized in house music only or dance music. I started it because we were a great team, the three of us. I was not the one who came up with the idea to start a record store, to be clear. That was Peter, he really wanted to do that, a friend of ours. So we helped him build up and automatically we were like three owners of the place. I helped him with buying the tracks, the good stuff. So did Eric actually. Eric was also the main producer on the label, making music for Outland Records and Spiritual Records. This was actually around the corner here, Outland Records. but um i also like maybe uh i think maybe five years later four years later um i decided to get out of the record store because uh i didn't have much time i was flying all really all over the the world to play at parties and i didn't have much time to uh to get involved in the music and i saw that the style of music that was were releasing was not really my cup of tea anymore. So I didn't really feel like one with them again anymore. So I decided to stop and so did Eric. Early on you had done a couple of compilations though. Yeah. For the label. What was the first one that you did? The very first one was called Static Tricks. Okay. and I still love that one actually. It was quite unique because at that time when you read the reviews in the MixMac and DJMac they were like saying that this is really original and we don't have to record with the tapes anymore but you can buy a Mix CD you know. it was new and um yeah about it it's really made with love you you can still hear that the the the choice of music the way of mixing what were you putting on there for instance um um the black dog very first album uh scoops of colombia none of the yeah that one Very rare underground stuff I put on this mixtape, or this mix compilation. And also Yvette's Pumpy, the Mayday was called at the time, remix. You mentioned also the way that you mixed it was interesting. And I'm curious, were there certain DJs that you learned to mix from in the beginning or watched and sort of said, wow, he's or she's amazing? That came a little bit later when I heard Derek May mix. I was really inspired by his energy. And the way he brings out the bass and turns on the treble completely. That energy was enormous and that's what I was inspired by. But the mixes itself, the way I mix melodies, especially at that time. And rhythms, it became like a little new story inside the mix, you know. And this was something I really did myself. I was not inspired by anyone. Tell me about how DJing has changed over the years for you. I mean, obviously, your style is putting a lot of different genres together. But at a certain point... I feel like a lot of people became very, very focused in what they play. Some people only play techno. Some people only play house. Did you find that change as well? I mean, that, you know, you started going down a certain path after a while. For myself, I think it's... I still see the way I bring music, I see it the same way as I did 20 years ago, with this variation of... I like contrast. building up and going up and then go up, go to something very gentle and softly, soft and very quiet, you know, make these ups and downs real strong. I like that a lot. But I also like... hearing DJs who are really into a certain style you know but it's just not my the way I do it you know but uh but I also enjoy that but and it's also of course when I play it like a festival or a techno party like away awakenings it's huge in Holland it's the Amazon arm and then I play more techno oriented stuff you know And when I play at the beach party when it's beautiful weather and people are dancing in the sand, I play different music. So of course that also varies about where you are. It changes. Tell me about some of the music that you made around the late 90s and the turn of the century. Were you making a lot of music or was it just DJing? No, at that time I did not. Well, I made it. few tracks but not I was not really in the studio at that time for quite a long time actually which was not so good for me for my name because at that time it was starting that's DJs had to produce also you know but before it was like a when you're a DJ You don't have to produce music, you know, but now it's very important to have productions to let your... how do you say it? To bring your name out there, you know? So for a while I did not make music, which was not good for me playing abroad because new generations came and they didn't know me because you only hear me when I play at a certain place, but they don't know me from a beat port or anything. When did you realize that that shift had happened? It took a long time. Actually, when I came back after the sabbatical... Two years ago I made this connection with Planet E records from Detroit, Carl's label, and since then I release stuff on Planet E. Not too much, it could have been more, and I'm working on it. There's quite a few tracks coming very soon. But this is very good for me because... There were Planet E parties that I was also invited to play at. And I really enjoyed that. It must have been quite strange to realize that this new generation of people were coming up and you had been in the business for years and all these people were like, who is this Dimitri? Yeah, that's right. Except for the organizations because a lot of people, they still know me because they're a little bit older also. But then again, it's hard to book me then because these young people who are coming to the party, they didn't know me and I'm working on it. Tell me about sort of, was there a moment that you realized that, you know, people... were not remembering you or realizing who you were was there a particular thing that happened no not not really it was just that um it was also for me there was this time that i didn't like to travel that much anymore i became father i just a little baby and i wanted to be more around you know in near amsterdam or in holland at least So I had plenty and still have plenty parties to play at in Holland. And I don't have to travel that much. This was for those years when I didn't work abroad that much. It was all right for me at that time, you know. But now I'm ready to play abroad again also. I really want to. It's because your kid's a little bit older. Yeah, she's 15 now. Okay. And now you actually want to get out of the house. Now you actually want to leave the house. No, that's not true. Now it's different. Yes, that's right. Also, well, one of my dreams, I might tell. is to do the solo nights that I have here. I would really like to do a once in three months or something solo night in a good club in Berlin, in London, and maybe Barcelona, and maybe a club in America. That would be ideal for me. Not too much travel. But to really bring it out there, what is in me, you know, with the music, with a six-hour set, that would be ideal for me. When you made the decision to stop DJing, you went to a farm to help kids. How did you get involved with that? Maybe it's because I always felt attracted to nature and to live in the nature. Yeah, it sounds a bit... DJs in clubs all the time. Yeah, that's crazy. But I mean, this is also a contrast. When I go home, I don't live in the city. I go to a very quiet place. When I go to the madness, I play the music. I love that too, but I love to go back to that. at silence again but when I for instance when I was I'm a bit crazy with this but when I drove to a gig somewhere in the country or wherever it was and then I saw this this beautiful farms and these people that were going to bed early which I also really like because I'm not really a night guy actually but But I'll manage. But then I thought, well, look, this guy is like, you know, working in nature and not this pressure of bringing the night, making the night. success and I also enjoyed that so much but I was just thinking about it and now came like five years ago was the time that I felt like I need to do something else and that's going to be it you know just be in nature and feel the seasons feel the weather and it worked for me it worked really well you were helping kids right yeah How did you find out about that? place and why you know why was that such a passion for you to to do that specifically um well i like um i always have liked working with those people i did before in a in a very small uh how can you say um well there was this club uh no that's not a club it's like a a little place for people in the village that go there to do a course. They learn to speak English. and you also had these disabled children who loved playing the drums. And so I helped them with this rhythm sessions, you know. I really enjoy working with these people, so this was a good combination for me. And I was not like a professional guy who knows how to work with people who have more mental problems. But the people, I just guided them in the field work. Let's put it that way. When you left DJing, What was the last record that you played? LSD in one line? Yeah. What was the first record you played when you came back? Hey, the first. Okay, that's a good question because I started playing before the club was even open, so I don't know if that counts. Let's see what was the first. I think it was a classical, a very experimental classical piano part made by this composer, a Dutch composer, a very old guy, but it's a living legend. It's like very trancy. Very special piano music that goes on and on and on, very trancy. And it goes on for like, I think, one hour and a half or even two hours. I didn't play it that long. But I think that was the first track that people heard, actually. You did some classical-inspired things throughout the years, right? I did a remix of that same track that I was talking about. Okay. Canto Ostinato is the name of it. So you've gotten quite a bit better with production over the years. That's definitely right, yeah. You know, when you're sitting down to make a record, are you... Do you come with something in mind or do you just fool around for a while? see what happens, see what comes out? I think I'll do the second one. I just start, you know, freaking with something and then something starts to be born, you know, and then you build and you build and you have this whole track. What have you been making recently? What has been... coming out the most? I'm very excited about this track called Detroit Summer. Summer because it is summer now in Detroit because it's very influenced in the sounds of Detroit. And I did it all by myself and I'm actually really happy with it.
