Approach and identify. Approach and identify. Approach and identify. Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Since crossing the bridge from Windsor to Detroit as a bespectacled, self-described nerd, Richie Horton has become a barometer for the development of techno and DJing itself. Like so many synths, it was initially inspired by the Detroit sound and DIY approach, leading him and John Aquaviva to found Plus 8 Records in 1990. The label and Horton's own productions and parties quickly sent ripples throughout the developing techno community, both at home and abroad. But he truly found his voice as an artist shortly after with the Plastic Man alias, which became one of the defining projects in techno history. By this time an unlikely star, Horton was also innovating DJing by incorporating effects and extra machines into his sets. His input helped shape the industry standard zone DJ mixer and the track to be used in the performance software, both of which became standard-issue tools for DJs worldwide. As the years progressed, he also spearheaded the shift towards so-called minimal techno, and later helped consolidate the emerging model of DJ as entrepreneur. But as he says in this interview with Christine Kikari, even as a thoroughly canonised artist with three decades of experience, He's still the same nerd at heart. He wants nothing more than to push the envelope. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Richie Horton is up next. Approach and identify. OK, Richie, so at the moment you're kind of nearing the end of a flurry of activity around your Close project, the tour that you've been undertaking for the last couple of years. I want to talk about Close in more detail, but I'd love to know what have been your takeaways about this particular tour? Have there been any? Well, yeah. Well, close. When you ask me anything about close, the word challenging comes up. Right. Because, you know, the show is technically challenging and there's eight or depends nine or even 10 people on tour to make the show a reality, you know, from technical lighting. We have Florian. just making sure all the cameras are set up. And quite often I take the night off before, even if it's a Friday, to be there for all the sound checks and just make sure the show is amazing. So it's quite a lot of stress. But these are like most of my projects, you know, like Plastic Man Live or Contact. It's usually on the edge of being possible. And that stress and anticipation and exploration is part of what makes it fun for me on the good days. So what's a take-home for Close is, yeah, I think I just said exploration. And in a way, Close has been... like an experiment on how to do a large-scale DJ techno show. But at the same time, when I really think about it, it's also been a way for me to carve out time in my touring schedule. to play with equipment and nearly kind of do some production and be in the studio, even though I'm not in my studio. It's the thing that I miss the most, is just sitting in the studio and nerding out and geeking out with my equipment. I just don't have that time like I used to. And of course, I could just take three, four months off and do it. But I also love traveling. I love touring. I love the excitement and energy of being on stage. So I've tried to somehow bring those two worlds together. So what I'm getting at is... In the near future, I would love to be back more in the studio and close. It's kind of in me getting my chops going again and learning all these little modules and playing with them on stage. to hopefully give me more momentum when I get into the studio and it's not just a cold start. That's really interesting to me that you frame it that way. And even the way that the show is staged, it's very exposing in a way, that that is what would give you the confidence to go into the studio. not the other way around. Yeah, well, I don't know if it's about confidence. I just think it's about time management and looking at the reality of my situation and, like I said, how much I love touring. and finding a way to bring them again together. Usually I'm at my best in the studio when I'm isolated and introverted and that kind of plastic man pseudo name or the other side of my Gemini self comes out of me. To get into that headspace and to feel comfortable and confident in the studio. you need to be a master of the machines. When you're 17, 18, 19, 20 and you don't have any responsibilities and you're not touring the world and you're doing one or two DJ gigs on the weekend, then you're the master of all that because all my time then was just by myself in my studio. So really, my time by myself in my studio right now is on stage at Close and the rehearsals we have. And even the last week of Apple stores and what we did in Berlin last night, these 15, 20-minute, 30-minute show demonstration, it's just me geeking out with the machines and people watching. And that, at the heart, is what... close it's about and I think that for me is at the heart of what DJing and why I got into this whole thing. You know I used to just be the geek in the corner playing cool records and once in a while someone came to the booth and said hey that's great but most of the time people were on the dance floor there was a strobe light nobody saw or cared who was playing and so I felt very comfortable. being that geek. Now I'm a geek on a bigger stage. Even the word close, I don't know if I'm reading too much into it, but just this idea of like proximity and transparency. Do you think that this is something where you're wanting to reach back into something from the past or is this like a new mode? I think it's, Both. I think DJing is about being close to the moment that you're in with everybody, being close to the people, watching them. And, you know, a great performance is a give and take. It's a conversation. So you start by sending out your sonic message. And then you kind of give and take and, okay, are they liking this? Do they like it? Okay, they don't like it. Well, I'm going to make them like it. Or, you know, this has been too strong for a while. Let's change it. But, you know, so there is a sensitivity to great performances and great DJing. sensitivity is another idea of close. So trying to still hold on to that or even grasp back onto it more as I become more popular, as the stages of techno events have got bigger and further away from the crowd is definitely... very important to me. The closest I ever got to standing up and pressing play and just having a playlist was when I did Plastic Man Live. And we made so many crazy technologies to enable me to perform that show and be spontaneous. But it's still, the show took over and it lost a bit of the spontaneity that I love in what I do. even though I was very happy with those shows. So that was probably the turning point. It's like, okay, how can I continue playing on these big stages and deliver a great experience? Because on that level, for me personally, it goes beyond just what's coming out of the speakers. 5,000-10,000 people, maybe only half of them are getting actually good sound in the best situation. So it's always been very clear in my head that there needs to be something more. So it was really how do I escape the pitfalls of plastic band? How can I get up there and just play? How can I feel close to the people? and bring it on that level. I also feel like I read or heard something that you said recently with regards to Close that one of the inspirations was watching, I guess, more of a traditional band type dynamic of people with acoustic instruments, etc. Is that correct? Yeah, you know, I was actually... I was at Coachella going around and quite often something bugs me and my action is a kind of a, it's a reaction against that. I remember even in the early, like, why Plastic Man was born was that I loved Acid House. And then I tried to do my own intense Acid House under the name Fuse, F-U, Substance Abuse. And then Acid House for me then started to get really hard and abrasive and obnoxious. And that drove me to try to make a atmospheric Acid House album, which basically became Sheet One. So it's always been that. Someone goes left, I go right. So at Coachella, the organizers had started to split DJs and put many of them in this tent called Yuma, I think. Beautiful tent, basically a dark room, basically a club on a festival. And I was like, okay, on one level, I like it. That's where club culture came from. But I was also disappointed that that was, I felt like we were pushed into a corner, that that was only what we could be. And I think we can be all of it. So after spending some time there, I watched other bands. just like okay why why aren't we out there and and and if so you know what actually if people are out there what are they doing from from a DJ perspective or standpoint and most of them weren't actually working that well or weren't giving anything that creative. It was more about a torso standing behind a table, pumping their fist and with some flashing visuals behind. And, you know, it's like there's got to be more. You've got to be able to do something better than that. And then watching bands like I'm not I was never a guitar player or a drummer. But I was thinking back and thinking when I went to see Nitzareb, you know, like I must have been 15 or 16. I had no idea about music, but their concert and they were hitting these tins and there was this physicality and there was this connection between these people doing something and what I was hearing. I didn't understand it, but my mind put it together and it just made it so exciting. And I was like, so how? can we do that when you know we're using little laptops and little keyboards and little knobs which are you know two inches can we you know i say we because you know i have a great great team that i always collaborate with internally and sharing ideas i can't how can can we make that happen in the world of djs Do you think there's a limit to what you can do? I know that with a lot of your projects you're kind of actively pushing at the borders of those limits but... At what point does it become like a square peg in a round hole type situation? I think that's the exploration I'm on a bit right now. When you get into doing a concert, which is about one person on stage, what can you do to make it engaging and authentic? And honestly, I think we've kind of boiled it down to the bare essentials. I'm able to get on stage and I'm not saying everybody calls it entertaining or thinks it's engaging just to watch me move left and right and touch things. But with cameras following me and my movements, I don't have to worry about doing something to connect with the audience. I feel that... The connection is there by them seeing me do in my natural habitat. It's like I'm in a zoo, you know? It's like, just give me some bananas and they're comfortable. It's terrible. It's not a very environmentally, politically correct thing to say. But it's like, put me in my natural habitat. Allow me to do what I love to do and what I think I'm good at and watch and build a show out of that. I want to talk a little bit about the presence of cameras and how it plays into the close show. And everyday life. Very true. And in everyday life as well. Okay, it sounds like you consider it to be something that's almost like interactive or that the audience and you are part of the same process. They can see what you can see and whatnot. Did you at all worry about kind of, I don't know, I guess like demystifying certain aspects of what it is that you do? Yeah, you know. I definitely do. I think about, am I giving up too much? I believe that the most important piece of the puzzle in any performance is the human being, no matter what technology or instrument they're interfacing with. So if I was just a sum of the records I play, I wouldn't be up there. Or if it was really that easy, I don't think I would want to be involved in this scene. And actually, I think... It is easier to play than ever before. Some people, once there was beat matching, said it had gone too far. But I'm a product of technology allowing me to be creative in ways I never thought possible. I can't play the keyboard. I can't sit here and play you a tune. But somehow with instruments and things, I can make some pretty cool stuff. So I've always thought about that, you know, how that allowed me to be who I am. And I would love to inspire other kids out there to follow that path. So with technologies like radar, allowing everybody to see what I play, when I play it, giving master classes, shortly I want to release all the different iterations of my modular setup on modular grid. It's not the craziest modular setup. There's much more people doing crazier, crazier things than me. But this is my little network and what works for me. And I'm really, you know, I'm interested in that personal instrument that I've created. You know, it's... I'm quite confident that even if, well, I'm releasing pretty much everything. Like, you know, people can plug in all the same things, download the same records. you know, get the same plugins. And yeah, maybe they sound a little bit like me, but it's not going to be me. And, you know, when I started, what were my first records like? My first records were DX100 and 909s and 808s. The 909 was there because I loved Kevin Sonnison. The DX100 was there because I loved Derek May. And my records were a bit of a fuse of those. And then slowly I kept, you know, making... and I slowly developed from imitation and found my own personal style. And that took time and energy and dedication. And so, put it out there and I'm sure that someone, somewhere, is going to take that and twist it and then do something extraordinary. Have you always been that open to the process of inspiration or just being that transparent? I mean, we're talking about a really long arc of your career. No, man, I was such an introverted nerd that I had trouble probably talking to people back in the day. But if I was into something and you got me started, I usually wouldn't shut up. So I think I've definitely become more open. The other thing that's important for me is... I never thought I would get on stage. I never wanted to get on stage. Like, I was a huge Prince fan, but Prince was on this pedestal, you know, Michael Jackson. I had posters on my wall. Like, it was something unattainable, and I loved exactly where it needed to be. But when I met Derek and Jeff and Kevin and all those guys, it was, okay, they were one step above. above the 15-year-old geek from Windsor, but I could sit and talk to them. They came down. to the DJ booth and Kevin Song was like, hey, here's the new inner city test pressing. There's only two of these. You want to try it out tonight? Like, how cool was that? You know? And so that, for me, is in the, that's part of the lifeblood of this culture, in a way, this DIY culture, this open culture of music and sharing. that is spread out around the world now and has become so huge that we have become on these pedestals and a little bit like the artists we never thought we would be. And I want to be transparent. I want to inspire. I want to have connections to my peers. fans and the next generation and try to keep it in this beautiful little bubble where it is possible for like a kid to dream and use technology and do something you know incredible you know i don't know i don't know anything about other genres because i was going to say like i don't want it to be like like hip-hop or rock music, but I'm sure there's the same kind of feeling to people in there, but I just don't... This is not pop music. It's huge now. It's not as underground as it used to be, but it's still a little beautiful microcosm, and the more we can keep it in our own little world, the longer this special bubble will continue. You just said that this is not pop music, but there have certainly been these kind of moments or these spikes where certain types of electronic music have crossed over to some degree to mainstream music, I guess most recently a few years ago. Has that had any impact on you as somebody who is like very recognisable, very well known? Did that kind of start nipping at your heels a little bit? Yeah, but, you know, there's always been spikes of when our culture has, you know, bridged into popular culture and said, hey, here we are. And then popular culture goes, wow, that's cool. And then after a couple of weeks or months, you're like, oh, what's next? And, you know, I remember in the early 90s getting recognized on the street for the first time in London. I think it was after the Mixmac cover and I was really uncomfortable. And so I kind of grew into that skin to... you know, be okay to deal with people who like what I do. And I'm cool with that. And that's part of the explosion. But the point I was going to make was, I know I'm not dissing anyone here, but... I remember when Moby's, you know, Go, with kind of a Twin Peaky vibe, went from a super weird underground anthem and broke out. And look at Moby now. And so then, you know, I remember Sasha and Digweed, like the first trance guys. who also, Deep Dish, these guys went and actually left our culture and were at the Grammy Awards for remixes and then also came back and continued to support our culture, or their culture. So there's always been these moments throughout my career. I think it's, let's look at it for the good side. If that introduces people to electronic music and some of them find their way into something deeper or more, whatever we call underground, you know, and they become true electronic music supporters, we should welcome them. I remember a couple of years ago, it was really crazy, like five, six years ago, maybe seven, with the whole EDM explosion and bubble. Are we all one because we're all electronic music? It depends on how you look at it. Do you subdivide it? No, we're techno. They're house. They're commercial. They're cheesy. they're like what what what is all this like so like i don't find i don't like all edm you know you find people making different music than you do but it's still electronically produced And 30 years later, it's touching more people than ever. I think that's pretty damn incredible. It's like, look at Joel, like Deadmau5. His music is completely different than mine. I feel an affinity to him because he's a local Canadian who's forging his own way, doing an incredible Cube version 3. He's sitting there programming this shit to make crazy stuff happen. He just lives it, you know? And that's like, we live electronic music. We live electronic culture. And if it comes out a little bit fluffier this way or more colorful that way, it's still cool that we're all doing this stuff. Speaking of dead mouse, I believe that you... released an EP of his, is that right? Yeah, we had his first test pilot on Plus 8. Around the time we did a back-to-back at South by Southwest, which was crazy. It was just us on stage, like kind of triangle, looking at each other. I had my effects, and I think he had a little module thing. And it was kind of during that peak of... the EDM explosion. Yeah, I think half of his fans were like, who the hell is this Richie Haunton geek? And half of my fans were like, what the hell are you doing? But we had a blast. It was really spontaneous and challenging because we're playing different things and finding a balance in between. But in the end, we destroyed the crowd. It was really, really straight techno. You're never going to make all the right decisions, and some things aren't going to work. But I like experimenting, living on the edge. a little bit, you know, as much as I can, getting up with new technologies, programming new things, and hearing new records. It's music, it's technology, it's all the things, futurism, all these things kind of intertwine what drives me along and keeps me... It keeps me coming back for more. I wrote something about you years ago. I wrote a piece about you, and I think I described you in that as a future fetishist. Yeah, yeah. Do you think that's a fair characterization? Yeah, you know, I'm traveling all the time. It's just nonstop. I've always been like that since a kid. I think everyone knows my story, moving away, traveling, emigrating, my dad, technology, music. When I first heard those, when I heard Derek May's records, it was just like, it just sounded like they were from tomorrow. And when I saw Jeff play, or even heard him just on the radio, I was just like, what the hell is going on? That idea of like, what the hell is happening right now? Or what the hell is that music? I love that moment. And I think it's harder to make me feel that right now with the music that comes out. Like there's great music, there's great techno records. But because we have 30 years of history of what techno is, I think it is increasingly difficult to break out of the definition that we've made for ourselves, which is okay. I think it's a great definition. It's an incredible genre. So where I find more futurism in my everyday life is doing these projects like Close and performing and improvising and putting myself in a situation where you're like, okay, now it's actually, I can't walk out of this room now or this stage. It's like, press start and go for it. I mean, you mentioned that you're not necessarily the kind of guitar-driven music kind of guy. Have you ever considered applying the things that you've learned or applying this kind of like... quest for more knowledge and more experimentation to other styles of music or other styles of instruments? Not really. I think there's already so much more to explore in my realm and so much more for me to learn in my equipment. how to perform better, how to be more prepared but more spontaneous. I don't know, maybe it's an egoistic thing now, but I got into this because I loved sitting in my basement programming on my bulletin board system when I was 12 or 13 and communicating with people around the world. So I liked interacting, but I also liked to have some kind of... space or distance or I like to be in control of it because I was running the you know people called my bulletin board system and it's you know and I could like make it look and say whatever I wanted so I love just being with with the equipment and and unleashing and and hopefully making something which like if you're in the studio or you're playing like when you got it and you've got the groove and you You know it, you know, and if you can do that and there's people in front of you and they get it too, you know, wow. Does it happen as frequently for you now as when you were in your basement, that kind of getting it, that flow feeling? You know what, that's really, you know, I have my good gigs and I have more. definitely have more good gigs or great gigs than bad gigs, in my opinion, you know. But there's always those moments where you're like, oh, man, what's going on here? Is it me? I can't find the records that are, like, making me super excited. It's always moments where you're unsure and trying to find that, trying to get it to click in. And that sometimes... just within the space of a gig. And sometimes that's over a tour. And sometimes you play too little and you don't have time to get into all the tracks or get into your groove. Sometimes you play too less. Like I would actually say close is too less. Like we have, you know, I'm doing my regular DJing, I guess, whatever that is. And then every week or every three, four weeks, then it's... like okay we've got a closed show and then you know you take the day off before you set everything up you do sound check and you're like okay what was what was i feeling what was working last time not to do the same but like once you you know what was that rhythm what you know and that's you know i think going back to that original question of some of the things like challenges or things i've learned from close like that's um it's hard to jump back from two different saddles. Because even though they are based upon what I do as a DJ, they're two different beasts. I mean, you're in a position in terms of, you know, you've been doing this for a long time, you're very well established. And, you know, you mentioned that you're working with a team, but ultimately you're the boss, right? Yeah. So you could presumably space it out a bit, take a bit of time off. Yeah. Recharge the batteries. Well, you know, you're not the first person to ask or say that. Yeah, but records are coming out all the time. There's so many events. It's very important to take time off. I always take minimum a month away, maybe two months off of gigs. I always have a couple of weeks where I detox also outside of that. But there's just an energy and immediacy that I feel in being part of the whole scene and being part of electronic music. You take a couple of months off, which is absolutely incredible. I love it. But if you really want to do that, you really need to take time off. You need to actually let the music go. And then coming back into it, it's difficult. Which records did you miss? Oh, this is amazing. Oh, actually, everyone's been playing it for the last three months. Damn, that would have been, I could have dropped that. And then it's like, okay, well. there's been an update for this software and that and and and like my my setup is my setup like It's me updating, it's me checking everything and listening to all the records. So it's nearly, especially these days with so many gigs and the intensity of the whole scene, it's nearly easier to stay on it rather than jump off. Right, so the FOMO is real. All my friends say, Rich, just slow down. You don't need to. to do this many gigs you don't but like but i like it so when you're in that kind of switch off detox mode are you are you actually able to chill out or are you yeah you know like well i have to I'm pretty good at chilling out and turning off things and then getting into a book. When I take my main break, we disappear to kind of the same place nearly every year, so we don't have to think about where we're going. I kind of just slip into a totally different frame of mind, and I'm kite surfing. I love swimming. I try to do that the whole year. So there's things which, even though it doesn't sound like there's much of that, there's enough of it that allows me to still be here because you cannot sustain like this 24-7. for nearly 30 years. You've got to find that moment where you step back and then you forget about it a bit and then you come back and you're like, okay, this is why I love it. And like, oh, who's that? And what's going on? And have that appetite or energy or even hunger. But I think that's also built into our scene. Or maybe not. I don't know. I'm part of the... No, I'm not the first generation. The whole Detroit gang and people before them paved the way. But I'm kind of near the beginning of when this really broke onto another level. It's really like, what are we supposed to do after 30 years of techno? Not saying, do we go to another? How do we actually get older into the scene? Is that a conversation that you have with your peers or that original Detroit crew you've been talking about? Some people have. Different responsibilities and families and lots of things change. And you have to navigate life as you're having a creative life. and a life that takes you away from your family and friends. I think it's, yeah, you have to think about that. I just follow the role model of Mick Jagger and Roger Federer. Oh, okay. That was out of left field. I think the main thing I'm trying to say is the intensity and pace of electronic music is what I love about it. But you do have to find a way to balance so you can enjoy it and actually maintain at that level. So you can sustain yourself. I don't want to feel... like crushed by it yeah and there's there is for sure there's moments there's up and downs where you're like fuck man this is like this is well this is this is tough or you're tired or this and that i booked too many gigs so you know i wish i had more time off but in general you know it's um if i have a couple nights off you know and and and and i have some good sleep i go for a swim go get my trainer to kick me in the butt and get my mind off everything, have a green tea, and I'm ready to rock again. Just what you were saying about ageing through electronic music or through techno. is perhaps some of the other offshoots and projects that you've been involved in. So you have your record labels, you've got something like Close, for example, you have your line of sake. Are these in some kind of way intentional, like, I don't want to say like a retirement plan, but like something to... I think that's a fair question. I think you do, or I have, got interested in other things, sake, more in art projects, and spent more time in some of those things along the way. But I don't think there's no retirement plan. Everything I'm involved in, all of the above things, are things that I find incredibly engaging and inspiring. But it's good for me to be able to have something else and move around, not as a backup plan, but more as a... hey, let's do a bit of this over here and percolate the live show or percolate some gigs, slow down on that for a bit, and then come back with renewed energy or inspiration or ideas. I needed to do Plastic Man to understand what I didn't want to do with that, but then it needed some time to actually figure out what that was until Close came up. Yeah, it's more like just balancing inspiration and so that, you know, I want to be doing all of this in some capacity basically until I die. This is what I do. Like, there was no backup plan. Yeah. You know, that would be, I wouldn't want to waste time on figuring, you know, a backup plan because then I couldn't do what I love. Yeah. I want to ask you about how you're feeling today because today... Like right today. Today, today, today. Because I think just an hour ago, the AV album portion of Close was released. Like, how do you feel on days like today where you're like, I'm putting something out in the world. Let's see, let's take people's temperature on it. Like how, what's your mindset? That's a very good question. Well, I woke up and I wasn't very happy because I wasn't sure that we had a good... post for Instagram that really captured the energy of the movie in a small, you know, the film of the experience of the release in a small capsule to kind of get people excited about it. So I got up and... I loaded Adobe Premiere and I made a new clip and that's what we posted. So that's a typical kind of thing that would happen on release day for me. We were working on this for a year and a half. I'm very relieved to have the AV version out. But as some people know, and some people don't, there's another component of this release, which was also honestly supposed to come out today, and didn't because of technical issues. of us probably trying to do too much in too short of a time and trying to create something that is very, it's pushing the technology. So I'm a bit disappointed that we couldn't drop that today. So that's what I've got to work on right after this. I don't know if that's the answer to that. I would imagine, though, that somebody who's working in multimedia and things that are very, you know, very much created around, like, complicated digital frameworks that... that sense of, um, I don't know, being let down by the technology or having to work around things, not working out. Like, is that, that, that part of it, you know, that's part of like, yeah, being involved in, in, in, in technology for the shows and now protect, it's so technologically, um, complicated also for releases these days. Even if you're just doing, um, uh, You know, it's incredible how digital distribution has now connected us to the world. And I'm a sole believer that that's part of the reason why our scene is so huge. People can get the music now. But compared to the simplicity of making a track and putting on a record. and sending it through to some, you know, eight different distributors, all in the same format, actually is, it was pretty simple. And, but now different DSPs, different platforms need different this, different that. And, you know, maybe this is just me driving myself crazy, but. The aesthetics of how things or releases on projects are delivered, how they look, how they sound, how they feel, they need to be cohesive, you know, down to, you know, the sound of the hi-hats to the point size of the font. And those change on every different platform. So, you know, I've always, you know, when we started Plus8, John Acquaviva and I, you know... We were releasing it, we were getting it pressed, we were taking the records to UPS. I was making the album designs and labels. It was just like, it was our own little creative incubator. And that's how it still is, and I love it like that. But it does make it challenging sometimes. But when you bring a release out and it's all dialed in, like what we've released today, Close Combined, I'm super excited. It's killer. I dreamed of, since the DE9 days, of taking different shows and putting them together and taking people through a trip from one country or city to another. That was 10 years ago I started thinking about it. And it's there. It's out. So in a, I don't know, is it fair to say that in a sense, everything you're doing is some kind of continuation of like the D9 project? I think when I first had my first main real gig at the shelter in Detroit, even then I had a little delay unit. So that's been part of me and manipulating records. It's always been my definition of DJing. has been not the normal definition or traditional definition since the beginning. And that definitely is something I've been exploring since then through DE9 and is very much at the heart of Close. But going beyond just audio and bringing... Because I spend so much time thinking about... the idea of a show and, and how, you know, how to do that on a stage and, and having the capacity with all these little cameras and then having recording all that, and then having the creative opportunity to kind of stitch all that back together was also a challenge and, and re rewarding, you know, and, um, and ever since I was a kid, I, I, I like to be different, or at least think I was different. I don't know if I am, but, you know, so being able to do a project that you think, okay, I don't know if there's really anything like this, that's cool. You know, like, I don't know, like, that's just, that's the little kid in... inside of me and also the what's i think important for for for this release uh is that you know it's been made for for for mobile which really interests me of you know how we're consuming you know media these days how everything is available the release is free it's just it's out there and and how people can then Once the app comes, interact with it more and get closer. And kind of experiment. My whole career is whether people get it all. I think if you kind of map it out, I'm sure there's a couple of left or right paths that ended in disaster. You can say that for anybody. But I think there's a cohesion. I think it makes sense. One thing leads to another. And usually by the time something is released, I'm already thinking of what that is leading to, you know, or trying to. That doesn't always, you know, but. That's electronic music. That's technology. That's like who knows where the future leads us, but if we can all grab onto the things that we are creating and steer them in the right direction, something wonderful can come out at the end. I liked that at the beginning of the A.V. album that your likeness or your avatar is very much like calling back. to, you know, Dex Effects and 909 era, shaved head. thick-rimmed glasses, Ritchie Horton. And I kind of like, I feel like you can kind of carbon date your career based on your style, hairstyle. Yeah, yeah, I think you're right. How you present yourself. Like what was the reason behind looking back fondly at... late 90s, Richie? Yeah, well, I think that it's definitely so many people looking back at the late 90s because many of them weren't born then and right now, DJs and fans coming up and audience. So I think it's a fascination of where this music came from. I'm not so fascinated with it because I was very lucky to be there. But, you know, when I was working on this, I found an old interview with me, a lecture that I'd done, which was really around, I think, DE9, closer to the edit. And it was exactly when Ableton came out. So I was talking about that and how it may change DJing and where I thought I was going. And yeah, some of those things resonated with me and some of those ideas have come to fruition in how I perform and some things I'm still searching for or pushing forward. So I thought it was interesting to bring that. back and let us, me and the people watching the film or the experience to, you know, hear some of those thoughts and think about where our scene has come from, and especially from DJing perspective and what we're trying to do. do with technology and where we might be going and um and and also just kind of mark what what i believe about you know what i'm trying to do with with with my direction you know you you asked about inspiration and transparency there's lots of different definitions of djing and and you know i have a specific view on that based upon you know how I was brought up with DJing from a long time ago, and I want to explore that. I want to invite other people to explore or be open to just seeing where this goes. It wasn't the turntables. It wasn't just the music. It was the technology. It was about putting things together and creating something that... music that never existed before. It's an idea of futurism. It's about the moment altogether. All those things are in there somewhere. I want to see this next generation who are coming in who are super excited and inspired and giving me a ton of inspiration seeing people play records that I can't hear anymore for the first time and actually like wow that's cool again it's amazing like we're 30 years into our culture, and it's just going stronger than ever. And I feel if at one moment our culture did get close to becoming pop music, it's kind of... you know, retracted a bit. And the DIY aesthetics and sensitivity, I think, is really being felt by old and young now. And I think that's part of the allure of what electronic music has become. So we're talking about this kind of 30-year period. in which electronic music has been a big part of our lives, people in the scene, I suppose. This idea of looking to somebody like you as it's like a canon of work or like the Horton era or the Horton sound or something like that. You know, you're somebody that people can study and emulate and cast a critical eye over. Do you think that's like somehow oppositional to like DIY? Like, I don't know. How does it feel to you to be like an entity to be examined in that way? Well, yeah. That, that, That's just how it is. I think that goes to the idea that there was no rules or that much history in this music when it starts. So every day we step into a new day and a new legacy of what this music is or has become. So I don't know if I can answer that correctly. I think for me, I just want to work on my own ideas and incubate them with a great... and hopefully mostly internal team and in a kind of independent structure and work with like-minded people from around the world, young and old, and who have shared values and aspirations and dreams. and move forward. That's what I want to do. I want to keep moving forward. If people are coming in and want to discover 90s records for the first time, that's amazing. If people want to come in and start DJing in a more traditional sense or anything that has been part of this culture from the beginning to now... That's incredible. But for me, I just want to move forward and keep doing... I don't mean doing the same things I've always... Well, I do. Just keep doing what I've been doing. I think everything builds onto itself. And I always thought I had a lower attention span. So I feel if I'm engaged and excited by something, then somebody else is going to feel that energy. And what do we do? doing you know we're basically sending energy out whether i make a release like this or i stand on stage or i do a lecture it's just positive energy um you mentioned uh having a delay unit with your kind of initial setup and i feel like i should uh shoehorn in a question for the the nerd nerds The kind of Horton delay is like a real, it's a hallmark, it's a signature. I don't so much want to talk about the nuts and bolts and the hows. What is it about the delay? Like what does it offer you? Where does it take you? What does it open up for you like musically? I think DJing and making music is about dynamics. It's about bringing. people up and down and building and releasing tension. And the delay unit, early days was a DP4 and now for a long time it's been the Lexicon. It just allows me to have more control over that type of energy and anticipation. It's as simple as that. I'm glad that you were prepared for that question. No, that's the first time I ever got asked that question. So, you know, I love my delay. Clearly. I guess as a wrap-up question, I'm really interested in your approach to the projects that you're involved in and perhaps also your work ethic. To what degree is what you're doing work, like labour? To what degree is it love, passion? I don't know. I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you compartmentalize it, if you do at all. No, I don't compartmentalize it. This lifestyle, techno, you don't punch in and punch out. I don't actually see. When I meet people like that, oh yeah, okay, I'm going to do this, then I'm going to do that. And if I do this... for the next five, six years, or I'm going to retire in eight years. This does not compute. I don't know what those type of thoughts are. When I was a kid in high school, I used to work in theater. Not even that. When you're a kid, you get into something, and you're like... you know you love it you want to own it you just like you don't even want to sleep you know because you just want to do that thing that new hobby or that new craft or learn that and I was always like that and I went from one thing to another to another and then when I found electronic music it was a thing that just grabbed me and And I'll just do what it takes to do what I'm trying to make or what I'm trying to investigate. So is it work? Is it vacation? I can't answer this question. What would... Okay, so there's a final, final question. What do you think that young Richie would make? of Richie now. Oh, yeah, well, I think we're, what would I say? I think it would be very, very surprised. at how I'm able to get on stage and do what I do in front of so many people. I remember coming to Berlin for the first time and playing May Day. And at that time, May Day Festival was massive. And it was like, I remember... standing on stage and playing Carl Craig, Bug in the Bass Bin. So maybe this was actually 93, 94, 95. Maybe not the first one. And people were just like, what is this guy playing? And I was just like, I just don't know if these big parties are for me. I would come off and beat myself up. Really like... okay, you know, do I not play that record? Or like, it was one of my favorite records of all time. But I really had to learn how to... feel comfortable and confident in that type of situation. And so I wasn't then. So Ritchie Horton of then to Ritchie Horton today, I think would be pretty surprised or amazed. And I don't think Ritchie Horton of then, I don't know if he would be capable of. jumping into the scene that we have now with it at the velocity and all the all the extra stuff that come with it like the social media and this and that i was too introverted i don't i don't know if if if i would have i would take this path again now if i was him
