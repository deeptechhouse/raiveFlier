Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week on The Exchange, we return to the iFilm Museum in Amsterdam for another talk from RA's conference program held during the week of this year's Deck Mantle Festival. This time around we have a live version of our Art of DJing feature series, which offers us a chance to take a closer look at the craft. We were joined by Eleanor Colombi and John Talabot, two DJs with distinct voices who would both play sets at the festival later that weekend. With moderation from Ray Philp, We hear of the joys of playing records at the wrong speed and making your own edits, as well as getting a sense for their respective approaches for finding music and playing back-to-back. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The Art of DJing exchange is up next. So I have two DJs with me. We're going to talk about the art of DJing. I'd like you to please give a hand for Elena Colombi and John Talabot. I guess the first thing I wanted to know about was just maybe any routines you guys have or have developed before you play, maybe like an hour before you play or something. I don't have actually a lot of techniques or routines before my gigs. I just want to make sure to make it on time. First and then like usually when I make plans or when I try to imagine how the gig is gonna be or turn It never happens. So it's all different. Yeah, so I stopped making plans and when you stop making plans things get sometimes more exciting and You're unexpected. So there was a point that unexpected things i think it's better when you do this every weekend so it get you don't have provisions or you don't have expectations about it and it gets funnier and sometimes weather. Does that just come from the familiar like that kind of comfort with just acting on impulse and just going with the flow does that just come from the familiarity of the situation or is it more about just how you are as a person? I think I think it's a mixture of both no it's like a combination of like survival. having to be able to adapt to many unexpected situations and personality too because I don't do routines either. I can't possibly. Even if I try, I just fail really badly. Also, I think we both play in clubs and festivals. Everything is super tight. You have a driver at this time. You need to meet these people at this time. You have a plane at this time. So everything is really tight. So the more loosey it gets, the geek, the better. Sometimes even like you play festivals, sometimes you don't meet anyone, only the driver and someone hosting you in front of. 2,000 people. And you'd leave straight after? Yes. and then you leave us right after so I think you need to build your own kind of excitement for the gig at some point because you are in the plane in the hotel and then so you need something like to and not preparing things sometimes it's that part like oh shit I don't know what to play oh shit I don't know what to do let's see how it goes and I think like not because like ultimately like no matter how you could be prepared like you're turning up more often than not in front of a lot of people you never met like you have never been in a club or you don't know about the specific vibe of a place you couldn't know because you've never been there and you just turn up and something clicks and it just suddenly feels right and that's that's it yeah i mean to the point that you mentioned earlier about um just maybe having like a very regimented route to the gig, like having a driver, having the hotel, et cetera, et cetera. I guess, yeah, it must be like, it must feel freeing to just have this one section of the night where like you're. there's no plan, there's no schedule, you're just doing it. For me it is because actually there was a point that I was playing a lot and I was trying to prepare more things to be in the safe part of playing. It's like, ah, let's make a scheme of what I'm going to start and then I start being bored of myself. So it's like, no, this doesn't work. It's way more work. You need to think more about where you're going to play. You need to be there maybe and just take way more risk or whatever. But at the end... sometimes it's good, sometimes it's better, sometimes it's amazing and sometimes it's bad. But when it's good or amazing, it's an incredible sensation. More than when you have everything like, I'm going to play this and this and this and this, or you make your own scheme. I think this opens up to what I find particularly interesting about different visions that DJ can have with the crowd. There's people who'd really like to... not only prepare, but repeat certain transitions, or they have their own tracks that become almost related to the artist itself. And I find it fascinating, but I could never be that person. I think there's two completely different worlds where you turn up to... certain gigs and you almost expect a gig type of thing where you go and see your, you know, favorite band or something and you expect at certain point to hear such and such song. And then there's other styles I would get or, you know, other... personalities you know where it's completely the opposite like I don't know what I play until I'm actually there and people don't and then that becomes like more of a unique experience for me like that's definitely my kind of route you know. And I guess like that impromptu like sense of like just going with flow and doing it as you see it. kind of yeah it must feel more exciting because like if you're if you're if you're like i guess if you're a dj and you're you have like certain safe transitions in your head that are kind of like escape patches or like, you know, crutches. Maybe it leads to you making safer choices during the course of a gig. I don't think there's like a better or worse, you know, position to be in. It's just like a different approach to, you know, gigging and playing and maybe life too. I don't know. I don't... I don't think I would feel good with myself if I repeated myself. I would be bored, like you were saying. I need to be the first one to be excited. And that means that sometimes it's true, you do end up taking risks that maybe the crowd doesn't get quite straight away. But some other times it does work. And when it does, it's magic. It's incredible. Something about your biography, Elena, that caught my eye was... It describes your parents as having this sort of, giving you this free-spirited, unconventional upbringing. I wondered if you could elaborate on that. Okay, it's a thing I think I've been fighting with for a long time. Up until my teenage year, I was only... I was always like the only one being, you know, especially in Italy, with a vegetarian upbringing, with a non-religious upbringing, the only one spending Christmas is not with the family, but like, I don't know, meditation centers in India. And I remember just going like, fuck, you know, I'd really want to be like everyone else. And, you know, exchanging presents. And why do I always have to be the odd one in the entire school? And then eventually I was like, hold on a I'm actually way more open than other people to just being by myself and being open to experience things, being a bit more curious. I don't know. I never really saw it as an advantage point with the music side. I still don't see it that way. But I think generally as a life, I don't know, approach or point of view, I'm definitely more proud of it now. Especially because I'm never in the same place for more than a certain amount of time. It kind of helps. So I guess you were rebelling against... rebelling that you're trying to you get to that stage where you're conformed to fit in you know like there's a normal there's a usual pattern when you have like really strict parents you end up being the you know the one being and I think my parents were the them you know and then as a reaction also like I didn't have maybe too much to rebel against but at the same time that made me really I don't know understanding also towards whoever didn't have this sort of upbringing. Like, I think it's just about, yeah, being open and understanding each other and thinking that no matter how different we are, we can all be at the same level, you know? Sure. Yuri, on the, my understanding of sort of your upbringing is it was maybe a bit more settled. I mean, you've lived in Barcelona for most of your life. Is that correct? Totally. probably went on holiday like everyone else but Barcelona was like very much like your kind of your zone your you know where you where you were no actually I had like quite a boring life uh when I was a kid I only like my parents got divorced and then there was a lot of mess in between. But just my life was, I was going to the schools and then at like high school and things get funnier when I start going out actually. And I start meeting people that they were not part of my. group of friends and I started to understand things and get into music that it was not the music that my friends from school was listening and I got in contact with many different people that maybe in another life I wouldn't and that made me change a lot the way I understood things and the way I was getting into relationships. with people and so it's true that music changed somehow the way I approached to the world I have a question about Barcelona actually I remember being there for like a long holiday around maybe 2006 or something and I was shocked by like the amount of after parties that were happening in there like legal one in like venues and clubs and stuff Are you... Legal ones? Yeah. Or at least I thought they were legal. Oops. Okay, no. No, not legal ones for sure. Maybe well organized, but not legal ones. Professional illegal parties. Professional illegal. I remember liking that a lot because it was already gone in Italy. There was some in Poblenou, like quite big actually going on. But at some point, all of them... I remember seeing Villa Lobos actually playing in a tiny, tiny room and just going, is this Villa Lobos? They're playing in front of 80 people? My favourite one was a fridge. It was called a fridge. And it was inside a meat fridge that it was... There was no ventilation and it was crazy. You were playing inside a fridge. It's like, this is not the safest place to put like 80 people after like 12 hours of raving, but no one died. You have to dance. At one point they... Yes. At one point... See, very well organized. You have to dance like really hard in a blanket. At one point they stopped doing it. I don't know why. Who knows? So now that we've established your sort of respective upbringings, I'm sort of wondering about how you feel that's shaped your relationship to music. I don't know. Again, I don't think there's like... I mean, there is a connection with music, of course, but then at the same time, it's like, for example, he was saying that the upbringing wasn't really how it started being connected with music. And I think to a certain extent, that's what happened to me too. Like, there was always a lot of music in, you know, being played. at home, you know, from my parents and stuff and a lot of music when I was traveling. But I don't think the music I listened to back then or the music that I was surrounded by necessarily gave me a sort of direction. I think it's when you, I think it's you make a conscious decision at some point of, you know, what you want. to listen to? No? Up until a certain age it's more like, oh, what's happening around you and you somehow taking in and no? Yeah. I mean, for me it was, my parents, my mother especially never got music at home, not too much, but my dad is a blues collector and we've been always listening to these blues records in the car and like blues is... So sad, always. You know, it was like, wow. That's the whole point. Yeah, holidays and blues. I don't know, it was sometimes a bit bizarre. And then when I started going out, I started meeting people that were playing music. And at that point, I didn't know where to get that music. So when I was going to the clubs, it was like, where I can, what is this music? Where do you buy it? Where do you? I mean, who let you know which tracks or whatever? And then I started, like, this was the curious part for me of that world. Like, I didn't know where to get that music, and that was the exciting part. I started discovering that there were places that were selling records of techno. I was like, wow. But everything got a sense going in a club and listening to music to really high volume. That was the connection with everything, with the physical and emotional experience. So that really trapped me and I started looking. but never had older brothers that they showed me music like, oh yeah, listen to this Joy Division record. No, never. Never had any friend like, you know, they were into death metal. So I don't know. Blues and death metal. Anyone showed me an electronic record until I went to a club and I started meeting people that... I never met before. And that was quite liberating for me. How old were you when that happened? 17. Right. Yeah. So you didn't have the kind of older brother figure to kind of lean on because there's a lot of times when that's just kind of how you get music that's outside your sphere. did not having that person with you just make you hungrier to find stuff or was it like just you know no but it gets it gets weird for me I started I knew before Aphex Twin the new order you know and and then you you do this crazy going backwards to know certain things because you didn't have contact before you know so it's maybe that can make it even more beautiful because like i think when you have no preconception whatsoever about the music that you come across that's when you're more hungry you know about it and you're like wow this is amazing you don't have the judgment that someone else would be like whoa you didn't know about this loser you know yeah but i hate that it's like can people stop like judging other people we all come from a different background we all have different I think even sharing music sometimes gets really like oh you didn't know this you don't know this label it's like you don't know this label let me tell you about it you know there's completely different approaches to because ultimately there's so much stuff out there anyway that yeah you mean a lot of you miss so much every day you know you can be informed at the turn of for every record release so there is always something to discover that's an interesting point i was going to get to a little bit later but let's let's let's dive into it now um you know as you're kind of searching for music what's what's the play how do you like approach if you if you have like a day set aside say where hey i'm just gonna like check some new music out what's how do you do that? Whoa. How long have we got? It can start in various ways. Sometimes it's someone approaching you about their own music, maybe. Or it could be the other way around. For me, the only common denominator is that at some point there's always some sort of connection with other people. Whether it's via email or via social media. after like we had something similar too like after you play before after someone and you're like why i remember this particular track that you know stayed with me and that That's how you just start talking. It doesn't mean that you necessarily become like best friends or you talk all the time, but that creates a new connection. And then this can evolve into like, I'm someone who likes to browse a lot online at the moment, but that's also because it's related to how much you tend to travel at some point. like really late night kind of like browsing before or after a gig I get really excited and then I don't even remember how I got from A to Z because there's so many you know interactions in between but at some point there's always some sort of human experience or human connection and there's no rule really I buy from everything and anything you know And if I can't find it, then I would just get stuck on it for a few months until I find it, you know? Do you have a ratio in how you buy music? It's really messy. There are times where I'll just go on Discogs and go through a label to check out what that label's about, but other times it's just chaos. just like going through mixes. But I find even that like, maybe like I start with that kind of idea and then five minutes later I find myself focusing on one of the artists of the label and then there's like a new sub-label that maybe doesn't exist anymore and then like trying to reach out to this person and you're like, okay, how do I find you? And I had... several occasions where I do end up emailing this info at blah blah blah dot com and then maybe one year later the person replies and I'm like yeah it was me I'm not really doing music anymore sorry you know How do you feel about that whole question, Yuri? I spend a lot of time in Discos Paradiso in Barcelona and every week I go there because they are my friends and I just go there and listen to records they receive and then it's a mix between internet and... YouTube and just hyperlinking somehow with stuff or maybe a record of an artist that I like and then brings you to another record and now internet is like quite interesting to find links of things that you never thought they were connected you know or artists that say oh this guy was doing this like five different bands that you end up liking and then somehow what I miss sometimes from the digital is this like natural connection sometimes it's like it's it's because of the likes of people that they bring you to somehow like like a lot of stuff youtube recommends you stuff that other people liked so you end sometimes in the like so now like a lot of times you go in the same certain yeah in the center this is something that i really never got into like I think sometimes maybe I should. You're talking about the YouTube algorithm, right? When you just let them play and they go. I normally just check something out on YouTube quite quickly and then I just delete it and move on to my own research. I don't know why. It's just the way I do it. And I have the same thing with Spotify. I just signed up and then I ended up... Spotify is a mystery for me because, as you said, I look a lot through labels. For me, labels are the curators. of things that I like and Spotify you can and iTunes you can look by label so for me it's like useless like I don't I never got into the artist thing of oh yeah no I go through the label and I check some and some releases in that label are super bad and then others are amazing like who was the person they did this? It was the same people like doing the, doing like the releases thing or like they changed maybe like the A&R and then this guy starts signing amazing things and then he left or you don't know, but like for me, like don't, not having like a searching engine by labels, it's like a big problem in Spotify and iTunes, for example. Sure. I wanted to dig further into the musical, I guess, taste aspect. of things there you did a lecture for rbma yuri in like 2011 maybe and you were talking about this dark angelo track called diagram oh yeah 11 yeah uh what was interesting about that is so dark um dark angelo or like this italian idm noise techno group like they're really good um but like they have this the one track that you kind of highlighted was like this um kind of some of their stuff is like really like rowdy and like hard but like this is quite a pretty track because I had this kind of like really nice melody and it was a bit like I had this like kind of sad vibe going on and I it was interesting to me that like of all the tracks you could pick from their catalogue which is like otherwise you know it's pretty it can be pretty brutal occasionally you pick like this quite nice melodic thing and it kind of suggested to me that that was like that kind of summed up like your musical preference it's stuff that has like a tinge of darkness to it but it's quite melodic and uplifting that track especially is like that was the it was Natura it was the Italian label like the one I can't remember I can't remember either but like that track I like it because it brings me some memories of of like a night that I remember they closed one night with that track and then that track has been always related to me to that moment and I can't separated so I'm really attached to it and especially the way it's produced the way like the the the melody gets in and out of tune all time with the chorus and I think in terms of production is quite interesting I still today I don't know how they did it like I don't know what was the way they produced it or they were playing the notes and recorded separately or they did it at the same time. I don't know. Sometimes there are tracks that clicks your ear because you don't know how they did it. Like still today, you don't know how they recorded or you don't know which technique they used. And this is also interesting for me. in terms of some tracks. I like some of them because I don't know how they did it and that's interesting. Is that sense of mystery important for you as well when you just sort of check out a piece of music and you can't quite figure it out? I think the way I get stuck with a track is more abstract than that. There's definitely some sort of like... The memory of something that has happened obviously plays a big role, but then if it's something fresh that I listen to, I can't quite explain what it is, but I do get particularly attached to certain tracks and that then becomes like a new spider web into many other different directions and things. I can't explain or picture why I do get attached to tracks because if you look at them, they're all really different. If you listen to them, they're all very different. So there's different reasons, there's different feelings connected to it. It also depends on your mood at the moment when you're searching, right? It's like what you've got in mind, what you're looking for. Were there particular records or experiences that kind of like helped you get into DJing? For me it wasn't a record, it was a mixed CD of this guy, I don't know if he still plays, it was like this really underground guy from Brescia, which is a city near where I'm from in Italy, and I think he was playing these after parties that I've never managed to go to. And I might still have this CD somewhere. And he just played like some banging electro with really fast transitions. And I just really liked it. And I thought... I wanted to play that way. So I got myself two turntables, two belt turntables and tried to mix on those. And the result was a bit of a disaster. But, you know, I kept on going secretly without really telling anyone I wanted to do it. This was like maybe a couple of years before I moved from Italy to London. And you moved to London in 2008? 2008, yeah. And then I moved to London, still took my time to like go out. as much as I could, check out nights. And then I was like, okay, I'm ready to put on a night. I know what's missing and I think I can, you know, fill that gap. So you were like kind of scoping the scene basically. I was just having fun, but let's say at the same time I was kind of like starting the scene. Studying. What about you, Yuri? What kind of got you into DJing and whatnot? I was going to clubs and I was like, I don't know, I remember the DJ being in a corner and no one was paying attention to it. I was like, where's the music coming from? It's like, oh, it's this guy in the corner. I was like, okay, I'm going to check it. And then it was like records and a mixer with eight channels. What is he doing there? I was playing the music from there. I was like, wow, this is amazing. And then, I don't know, I got older friends and they were all playing records and stuff and I started like, it was really like for fun. And it was the way I was discovering music. It was through them and through the way they were playing and the music. they would like it so my first years in electronic music were super influenced by this group of people from Barcelona that I owe them like a lot of my the stuff I know today and the way I moved through music genres and stuff that was into it. And I remember, for example, like I was going to clubs and it was one night, it was Dave Holmes, David Holmes. And the next day it was the Reflex people. And the next day it was like DJ Assault playing like. 145 bpm he still do the same mixes though i've seen him recently and he still does the same mixes like music sounds better music sounds better with you but yeah it was yeah it was like wow like um there was like people was going out without kind of having expectations of the night and they didn't know what to expect of every music. I remember one night David Holmes was playing and everyone was like "ooh" in front of him like "ooh go away, let the resident play techno, ooh go" and the guy was like "yes". He was somehow enjoying that moment. I was like, wow, I really like this. He was somehow enjoying the way people were like, ooh, go home. Like, wow, it must be not so easy to be there, playing what you like and having people like, go out, go out. And somehow I got like, yeah, I liked it. You want to be that person. Not that one at that exact moment. But no, what I'm missing a bit today is like people goes with a lot of preconceived ideas to a club night. That's very true. Yeah. It's a bit too much. Yeah. And before it was like, who's playing today? I don't know what he's playing. I don't even know like what music to expect. And it was craziness because sometimes you were leaving the club super angry. It's like, oh, the music, I hate it today. But sometimes it was magic and you discover a lot of things in that night or a new artist. So I like these things that, I mean, you can never be good to everyone. There is always someone going to leave the venue. Unhappy. Unhappy. And you need to know that it's going to happen. And it's normal that it happens. You can't be everywhere or for everyone in one night. Sometimes the majority of people likes it and sometimes the majority dislike it. But knowing this, it's way more relieving at some point. You feel relieved knowing that some people will leave and they will hate you that night. because you were not playing what they listened in a podcast five years ago. Yeah, I mean, that kind of sags into another thing I was thinking about. Given what you've said, to what degree are you playing to the crowd? Because obviously you're aware that... Never play to the crowd. Never. you're sort of aware that not all of them are going to be happy with what you've played or how you've done. So what's the play there? I think you have to maintain a bit of respect. You can't turn up in a festival where maybe everyone else in the line-up is playing Happy House and you just turn up and play Sad House. super set house or you know anything like extremely like against it or you know you do like a one hour noise set or whatever you know it's like but at the same time I think the whole point is that you are doing what feels right for you you need to cut You need to feel the reaction of the people in front of you too, but ultimately you need to do your thing. If that, in that specific moment, feels like taking a new risky turn, I'm way more respectful of people who take the risk and take a new turn rather than try and please the crowd. I also think there's, especially in Britain, but I've never seen anywhere else, I don't know if it exists, there is this... different side of clubbing where people expect to not only to play what pleases them but to the point where they come and do requests so you know I've never really seen anywhere else and I still do not understand it because from where I'm from you used to go clubbing not even knowing what the DJ was not even caring about that you would come back home and remember some particular tunes that the DJ played and they start talking about it with friends and then that would lead to someone like share some tapes and the complete like clubbing experience was more about the memory of it where luckily even though like not in places where I play I did experience like maybe like pubs or you know in England where people turn up to such and such DJ and just go like you want to play this and they show you the phone link or you know It's my birthday and it's like, stay home and listen to your playlist. Why are you out clubbing? But no, I never get it. I actually want to ask you, why is this happening? I don't know. I'm not an authority on UK requests. What do they ask for you? I mean, I guess there's maybe not such a thing as a typical request, but has a request ever been good? No, I think I've been lucky enough not to have... No, you've got something to say. I remember once I was in Lithuania in this club, Opium in Vilnius, and I was playing like slow. And then a girl came to me, like, please, can you play slower? Yeah, sure. How many BPMs do you need to play? It's the first time in my life they told me, can you play slower? That's quite a particular club. I loved it. I was like, yeah, I'm going to go slower, for sure. Yeah, like it's never ever asked me. That's a secret quest. That's a pretty sick request, yeah. Usually it's the other way around. Can you please lower it? Yeah, sure. I was talking to this... I was having a chat with someone from Ransom, not recently, this guy, and he told me that he got a request in Corsica Studios for someone to play a Britney Spears birthday song. He had to actually stop the music in Corsica Studios. I mean, can you imagine? It's like, I don't know the comparison here. What would it be? But it's kind of like a serious club where, you know, you get... Did he play it? I was like, just stop the music and play this birthday song. And people were having apparently enough fun that he thought it was funny too and he didn't mind. But I would go nuts. I would just go like, go home. Why did you pay the ticket to come and see me? It doesn't make any sense. Right? We drink a lot. True. That's another subject. That's probably the only ready-made excuse I have to explain that. I want to talk about back-to-backs. But that request was sick. Can you just raise the word? Is this enough? I was really afraid because the girl was, I saw her like from the end of the room, from the bar coming to me. I was like, oh shit. there we go and then I saw crawling through the stage and like yes there we go like and I was like wow can you play slower for sure easy did she seem happy after you did it not so much that's also the problem I don't think they never get happy yeah it's like it could lead to something more dangerous you always want more yeah yeah Never satisfied. Back to backs. I love them. Great. Do you love them, Yuri? Depends. It's like a thing when you do it too often, you hate them. And when you don't do them too often, it's funny. But it depends with who. Funny? Yeah, it depends with who. You need to find the good partner. What makes a good partner? someone that plays what you don't really expect to and that makes it way funnier although for people sometimes can be really crazy and they they can they sometimes they can follow it what i like from i mean i like djs that they can play different genres and they can be eclectic but they always trace a line that you can follow. I mean, playing whatever, playing whatever you want and any track from any genre is quite easy. You can play an Afro track and then later a techno track. But doing something that people can follow and it's related somehow and it brings you to this and this and this, it's what I find more difficult to do. Like when there is this kind of connected thing. And this story is sometimes hard to make and sometimes you don't manage to find a way to do it. But a good partner is someone that can build a story with you together. in the club set and sometimes it happens and sometimes not and you know you know that like back to backs is like a 50% chances it's going to be good I also think like potentially like a broken story with a back to back can can make up can ultimately make a better story because you're just like okay what's happening now you know it's like I don't I don't necessarily believe in like, oh, happy, successful, linear, boring, not boring things, but you know, when things are too nice, there's no stimuli, you know, and I think. What I like the most about Back to Back is exactly that. It's the opposite. It's like not knowing what's going to happen in the next 10 minutes. Five even. And the fact that whatever the other person plays stimulates you and you're like, I've got something for this or I don't. Fuck, what do I do? That's what I really like. Like when the track... The track when someone played before you, it's a challenge for the next track of yours. And I think you have to be very respectful, no matter if you know each other from before or you don't, or if you like each other's taste. I think turning up and playing with a complete stranger, also for me, is super exciting. You have to get to know each other by playing together. And find a place that you are comfortable both of... Yeah, and maybe I've been lucky also, but I think most of the time at the end of the set I got this new energy and this new vibe of someone that I didn't know before. The problem for me is that nowadays a lot of festivals that they don't have too much slots or whatever, they try to bring... back-to-backs to have more people in the lineup. Just that is the excuse. And this is like a wrong... - Yeah, it's like you need to put back-to-backs when you're excited to have someone playing for a reason, but not to have more lineup in your festival, you know? Like to sell more tickets, to have more names. Because actually some of them are like, "Can you do a back-to-back with this guy, like, one hour and a half?" It's like, "No." It's just like, "Why?" Like, this is seven tracks each. I feel bad. you know i can't do anything with seven tracks in an hour and a half like it doesn't have any and it must you know the appeal of a back-to-back might depend on like your mixing style as well because if you're if you're mixing long tracks and blending them a lot then you're I guess you have less time to do what you're doing yeah less exciting yeah definitely faster transitions make more of a thing yeah if you're like DJ Stingray or someone on the other hand it's like yeah fine yeah I'm so down for this constantly on that thing So we kind of touched on the idea of what makes a not so good back-to-back. What does it feel like when you're either not bonding with that person or just something doesn't feel right? I haven't had that so far. I had it sometimes. I mean, sometimes you are playing with... Sometimes even when we do a lot of stuff with... with Astala Bouman and we played together and sometimes like for sure you and Axel Bouman right yeah Axel is gonna play a track that I don't like and I'm gonna play a track that Axel doesn't like and I I can totally see, but we have a rule. Never, you can never take it out. It's like, this is the rule. Like the rule is like, you need to survive with that. You need to, you need to work with that. Even if you hate it, even if you just, it's the worst track you ever heard. You need to work. That's a bit harsh. Yeah, you need to work on that. I think to a certain extent, this is what I meant with, you know, respectful. I mean, like not turning up and have, it's all about not having an ego at all. And just like. soak in whatever truck is coming in and just try and do something with it you know I find it almost like easier to escape a bad moment when you're playing back to back with someone else than when you're trying to escape a bad moment that you created yourself because then you're really like okay I did this okay Does playing it back to back always involve, I mean I think I know the answer to this question, but does it always involve a form of compromise? Yes, but in the best possible way I find because again like you have really no idea what kind of direction you're taking and like we just said like if there's something played it doesn't quite feel right for you that's also another challenge and making you know turning into what you want it to be is like yes you know this is cool again what are you gonna do for me like when especially it's When I do back-to-backs with someone that I know, sometimes I like to speak about music with the person before because that gives me a bit of background also. I'd like to do that after you see him. Only after you're like, wow, what was that tune that you played halfway through? And then you become like this really long email exchange. But with Axl it's easy because we more or less work as an act so everything is more clear. I mean I don't do so many back-to-backs with people that I never played before because as I told you sometimes I feel it's just an excuse to have more people in the lineup just to have more names in the bill and just not for the reason of excitement of having a back-to-back. So it's not worth it to do it. I was listening to a back-to-back that you did, Eleanor, with Interstellar Funk. I think it was like another Dick Mantle event. And I was kind of like about an hour in, I heard this track that I kind of recognised from like my... misspent university youth huh yeah yeah yeah what is that what is that and it was like a slowed down version of uh the vitalik track yes laroque great track by the way uh whether fast or slow but like um i learned that that's something that you do now and then like where you just like slow like um mess with the tempo of the track so you might play it on 33 or 45 I think because I'm very stubborn about not missing out on tracks that I want to play. Okay, more specifically, let's say you pack your records. You have to decide a little bit, you know, in which direction you're going to go, but also how slow or fast you want to be, unless you want to have five record bags with you. And I don't like that. I like to have complete freedom. I like to be able to change idea while I'm playing and because of that I often have two different tempos of the same track or I try to keep them right in the middle so that I know that I can go really one way or the other. So that's it. When did you start developing this thing? Good question. I don't know. I think it just came naturally. I think, okay, I think it's not me necessarily coming with the idea or I'm going to mess up with the tempo. It's more like the music that I come across and I want to play range from really different tempos. And instead of deciding to stick to just a certain, you know... to divide it into slow or faster and decide that for a specific set I'm going to do one or the other, I just find ways to mix them together all the time. I don't like to have something left out just because it's a little bit too fast or too slow, so I have to find shortcuts to be able to play both. And sometimes this means that you just have to play some... completely beatless thing at some point in the set or some acapella or whatever but more often than not I like to still have the the the ability you know to mix it through and I think yeah that's it Are there similar techniques that you have, Yuri, or things that enable you to have more choice as to what to play? Because you obviously play the tempos you play are slightly slower, so maybe you have things that you might make an edit of something, for example, or you might... do as Eleanor does and slow something down. Is that something that occurs to you a lot? Yeah, I do. quite a lot like slowing and edits and stuff for for playing um sometimes even being quite unrespectful actually somebody's like oh shit i hope no one recognized this because it's so unrespectful to do it change the tempo and you change the intro and add stuff and a hi-hat and this is like oh please this is totally i think that's the one thing like the only feedback slightly negative feedback I got back from people especially with really slow new track that I like but they're kind of too slow for me to be able to play it with you know a slow Vitalik track or whatever it's like that's the only moment where they're like oh I heard you play my track thank you wow it was so fast and I'm like You have to create two versions, I'm sorry. Because even when you rip records, okay, this is another technique potentially. You rip a record and you decide whether you want to play it on 45 or 33, plus 8 or minus 8. But there's still a gap in between. Like, for example, recently I found myself buying quite a lot of old Italian... and Proto Techno from like the early 90s. And the original tempo is so fast that even a 33, not even plus eight, minus eight, it's still too fast. So I have to repeat that way and then do it digitally to get it to a tempo that is just about okay for me to play it out. And they sound amazing, to be honest. I still do it. I still like it. I don't think it's necessarily going like just lowing down. It's about finding what's the right, you know. But also not only for the tempo for me, it's just like some tracks played at 33, they completely change the sound. It's like another track. It's like, wow. It is another track. Like the melodies have more space and it's more, the percussions are way more dynamic. And then suddenly it's like, wow, this track, I would never like. pay attention in this normal but slow it is amazing it's like a perfect two one also thing that I like a lot about this kind of slightly more like old track that you can slow down or you know potentially mess around with the tempo if it's normally they're like super cheap records and they were once yeah and I'm so against this bubble of spending loads of money because one record becomes trendy and I really hate it. I mean, Discogs is great for culture because I think it just opens your eyes to whatever you want to learn. But on the flip side, it's creating this really unfair... market I think towards artists and label I'm very torn about it and I find myself talking about it with with people a lot they're like maybe mentioned this one particular record I'm like yeah that's cool I bought it when it came out and then you just look it up on discos and like going for 70 pounds and it's like this is really unfair it shouldn't be that way or 100 or whatever you know What do you think? I don't know. I don't care too much about prices, but if there is a record that I want to buy and it's expensive, sometimes I pay it, but sometimes I don't. I mean, I don't buy records for the price. But if something you really want ends up being expensive... But if there is something that I really want or I like, I can pay some prices. And yeah, I mean, if it's a nice record and also I'm in love... with the formats and stuff so sometimes it's records that they press like 300 in the 79 so like how is everyone gonna have it or whatever yeah sure like and do you not try to get in touch with the artist or when you have the possibility i do i prefer to go that way and try i would rather basically try that once and i got the wrong person and they tried to rip me out So yeah, it was like, it was a bit strange, but no, no, not at all. Thank you. you
