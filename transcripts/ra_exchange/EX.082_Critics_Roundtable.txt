you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. For our second Critics' Roundtable, we're coming to you from the offices of Man Made Mastering in Berlin, Germany. I'm joined today by freelance writers Philip Sherburn, Jordan Rothlein, and RA news editor Will Lynch. We'll be tackling three topics. First up, we'll be talking to Lutz of Berlin's Club Commission to get the lowdown on what his organization does in the recent tax bill. That was levied on the city's clubs and its potential impact next we'll go across the pond to America because given that all of us here are Americans we wanted to spend a little bit of time talking about the country's change in attitude toward electronic music over the past few years. I imagine Skrillex will be mentioned, so beware. Lastly, we'll go in-depth on the mastering process with Mike and Tim from Man Made Mastering and Christoph from Dubplates and Mastering. So sit back, enjoy the grumpiness. Lutz, why don't you just tell us the beginning, what does your organization, the Club Commission, do? What is its purpose? The Club Commission was founded in 2000 and it is supposed to be the representative organization for the club owners and event managers of Berlin. Right now we have 120 members and doing lobbyism, we're doing courses. We are doing PR campaigns for dying clubs and we also try to enforce politics in doing the right things and one of our major goals was reached by having a music board which is you know starting to be developed this year. Who will be on the music board? I mean, is that within the city of Berlin, you mean, or within your organization there's a music board? Well, it's comparable to the media board, a film board, which is also connected to the Senate directly. But the music board should be an instrument. instrument to have more influence for the music scene in politics. Why do you think that kind of organization is necessary in Berlin? Well, because... In the film branch, we see that they have very much influence in daily decisions. And if you want to have a film made in the city center, it's pretty easy. shortcuts to the politics to decision makers and for the musicians and for the people who work with music in the city it's always like fighting for everything. So in an ideal world would a club come to you that wanted to start and say club commission help me? open up this club, like help me figure out the paperwork and who I need to talk to. It's not very easy to open up a club in the city. Either you do it illegally or you have to do a lot of paperwork. And we have lawyers, you know, who do this job since 10 years. many things which can save you a lot of money afterwards and can be done in front. So our organization is mostly to have a good frame for the people, not really to influence what they're doing and to tell them what they have to do. I mean, they are mostly artists and they do better than... do better now than we do what to do but yeah the city changes it's getting more expensive spaces are not as available as they used to be and so I think we have to all save resources and so there's also many we have like a part of our organization is called club consult and there are two people who are just trying to be like a know-how builder, not to do things twice or many times wrong, and to know who to talk to, to know which experts have to be, you know, talk to if you want to open up a club. problems with noise, all these things. Energy saving is a big topic. I mean, it's getting more and more expensive and a trissor. This is one of the big parts of the costs every month. And so if we can figure out how to save money there, they can concentrate on their music part. So I think there are many things. Just more dark rooms than you save on all those light bulbs. Yeah. Well, this is more... an issue for the club owners to decide what to do inside of the clubs. Jordan is someone who doesn't live in Berlin. From the outside looking in, I imagine it must be strange. It is. We have, I'm from New York, and we have this perception in New York that here in Berlin, it's just sort of, it's very easy to have a club. There aren't really all that many rules. It's very difficult to have a club in New York. There are a lot of very old rules that are on the books that limit what can happen in nightlife. you And so it's very interesting for me to hear that it sounds like a lot of those problems sort of exist here as well, that there's the need to have an organization that represents the club owners. Yeah, I think also my understanding too is that in Berlin, with the amount of, you know, with the impact that clubs have on the city, you know, how important it is. important they are to the city's culture and also how much money they bring into the city, many people feel like it should be easier for the clubs than it is, or they should be sort of given... better treatment than they get considering how much of a contribution they make to the atmosphere of the city. What are the main struggles that a club comes to you guys with? What are they saying? Centrification. Really? Yeah, it's a big problem because the changes of the city are much more faster than probably New York is happening. There are so many examples from clubs who had to move in the last years, not because they had economic problems, not really. It's more like new neighbors, people who are not really interested in alternative offers. Many problems are because the people don't really know what's happening. They don't really know what impact this scene has for the whole city. And so I think our organization is a very good transporter of information. I just had a meeting with young people from our CDU, it's like the conservative party. I mean, it's very interesting to talk to them because some of them have never been to a club and they're like, a disco is the same as a club and a pub crawl and it's all one thing. So what we are trying to say is not, okay, there's the cultural part for sure, but there is the economic part of the club scene is not very... I mean, we have about 8 to 10,000 people working in the scene. That's okay. That's good. But, you know, that's not really very high income people. I mean, it is not important. We are talking about 300 million, which money is made in one year. That's okay. But the really interesting part is how other branches are influenced by this scene. And this is the thing we have to tell the people. I mean, there is the tourism. There is the whole marketing branch, which is like all the ads and everything is based on something which other people created. Also, city development. I mean, Berlin, the feeling of Berlin is made by these people. And they're not about maximizing their income. They're about having a good life, but doing their things. And yeah, tell this to the Chamber of Commerce. Or tell this to politicians and give them arguments why they should save and support these guys. You mentioned the way that some nightclubs are being forced out of their locations by gentrification. But at the same time, I know that there's a... faction of the, let's say, the radical left that blames kind of the easy jet set and blames club tourism for some of the gentrification issues in Berlin right now. I know on one of my walks in my neighborhood, there's a graffiti that says Tourist and Fiston, which I always have to laugh at. And on my own block, there was graffiti that says Tourist, go home. Also, but I mean, how do you respond to that, that all of these people flying over from Spain and France and Italy and the UK and kind of staying in their hostels in Kreuzberg and that they're pushing out longtime residents or that they're altering the neighborhoods somehow? I think it's great. I think it's the best thing what Berlin could happen. If you know Berlin 20 years ago, it was like a little town with not very international and now we're, you know, many languages. as many cultural people coming together. It's like a real big... The city, I think, has a big profit, not only by money, by all the things happening here. And as long as we have the right tourists here, that's fine. I mean, if you go to clubs and you don't really see, by looking at the people, that they are tourists, that's okay. But, you know, I'm not really happy about pub crawls and beer bikes and all these things, which are also coming with Tourism. Sure. And we also don't want to have... It must be hard to tell the difference, though. Yeah, it is very hard. You see someone staggering out of a nightclub. It's the exact same thing as a beer. I have nice presentations. Yeah, but you're right. It's really hard to tell people and they have to believe you. I mean, I'm doing lobbyism, but still I have to understand both sides and trying to get them together. And this is, I think, the part which... an organization like the Club Commission can do, which one single club owner not really can. I guess maybe another part of my question would be, because it seems like from my perspective, and I'm a foreigner and my German is not great, so I could have it all wrong, but it seems to me like a lot of the gentrification that's happening in Berlin right now. is a result of government policies like the privatization of buildings and of apartments. And that's what's pushing people out. And from my perspective, it seems like more pressure put on the city government to stop doing things like privatizing and selling off these buildings could help the situation. So I guess I just wondered. Can you imagine a scenario in which the club commission were actually lobbying government on issues more about gentrification than directly related to necessarily like the ins and outs of running a club? At what point is your sort of responsibility to the city? Does it hit that? We're right into this discussion. We had a meeting last week where we had the two guys from Berghain. We had Stoffel from the Watergate. We had Ben de Biel. We had Joe from Ritterputz. We had Dimitri Hegemann. We're all sitting together and we're discussing about these goals. And there are people who are saying, on the one hand, we have to be more radical, more powerful, and don't ever work with the Senate. And there are people like me who are trying to say that we have reached a lot of goals right now by talking to the people. explaining and everything. And yeah, I think it should be also discussed in this whole thing, talking about the gentrification process and the new government is trying to do things like that that's what i read or heard um but i think what we have to do is um um you know do like an interest group or work together with other people like in one part of town. You go to Neukölln and talk to the musicians, talk to the music people, but also talk to the little Dönermann and to other people right around the club to get more sensible about what the people are doing here. and try to get the clubs safe for the next 10 or 15 years, not just for two or three years, that will slow down this whole gentrification process in these cities. That kind of leads me to something I wanted to ask, which is talking to Berlin club owners and promoters and stuff like that, something I feel that everyone had kind of a different opinion on was... whether or not Berlin's unique club culture is genuinely at risk. Whether the reason Berlin's club scene is famous, that special personality could just be gone. 10 years down the line as a result of gentrification. Some people think that's true, some don't. So some don't? Okay, I'm sure... You've not met anyone. No, the city is changing, the city is getting richer. It's still very poor, that's why we're selling a lot of our houses and grounds. So it's not very easy, you know. This is a poor city and now other people say we have to stop this and don't sell everything and slow down. Well, I think the war, the fight with the investors coming to the city is mostly made not on the streets. It's somewhere up here. People have decided. to do. And we have to influence these people up there. I think investor, you know, he's coming with money, he wants to buy houses, and he will sell it for the best price. And he doesn't really care if this is a music house, or is this a hotel, or something else. He probably wants to sell it for the best money. And I think what we can do is, you know, it's little steps. We're not talking about the big thing. We're talking about... talking, talking, talking. And right now we want to focus on Neukölln, which because we think the gentrification process is, you know, turning right into Neukölln. And we don't want to do the same mistakes people made in Branslow back. And so right now I want to talk to Pushkovsky. And now we have the music board. So it's an official issue. So he's also willing, hopefully, to talk with us, do panels there, and get lawyers into processes where the city development is discussing right now. And a good example is the Berghain because these guys were in the gremiums, in these working workshops, whatever, where the O2 arena was sitting in, where the metro market, all these guys. And they were sitting right next to them and they were discussing and having a plan and want to... build up this um burkheim and um if they didn't do this they wouldn't be successful and so i think the right thing is to to do this more professionally go into these um decisions um rounds and um and make your point there one of the things I recently read was that there was a tax bill that was levied towards certain clubs because of how they termed what a DJ was doing, whether it was a live performance or a DJ. Are you dealing with that in any way? Are you talking to clubs? We went to the Senate because of this. Okay. So where does that stand right now? And what impact do you think that could have down the road? Okay, well, the process started in 2005. One of the highest court, Bundesfinanzgericht, decided that the May Day event is not a party, it's a concert. And this was like a new decision because to that point, DJing was not a concert. DJing was party. The decision was, and the problem is that only concerts have the 7% tax. And many clubs started, based on this decision, to pay just 7%. entrance fee and it's only on the entrance and we are not talking about the beverage incomes And in the first couple of years, many of the finance offices didn't have a problem with that. There are five or six clubs, which I know, who have bills which said it's okay to do the 7% thing. As many and more clubs did this, the finance office probably thought, okay, we have to check this again. And Cookies was one of the clubs who had a court decision on this and they are right now at court. And these clubs are liable for back taxes as well, right? My understanding was that it was retroactive so that they owe like three or four years worth of... excess taxes now sure that's the problem and um so we went to the so there was one very known club uh who went a year ago to the tax office or to the senate and uh and they were They just went to the tax office and they talked to them and they didn't really have a chance and nobody really talked to them and took it serious. And so the media campaign started because some of the media... heard about this problem and the club commission did lobbyists and went to the finance senate, right? The highest people to talk to about this thing. And we had a big meeting with lawyers and also one club owner was there and we're talking to them. And so what we offered was like have criterias to differ between a disco party, mottos, whatever event and concerts with DJs or really DJs and not just play music from the radio. And, yeah, this is right now the thing that they accepted, that we can, you know, deliver some criterias. And right now we are discussing about these things. So we have meetings and hopefully we find a... a solution before waiting for the court decision because this can be a good or bad impact on the club scene because if the decision is against the club all the other clubs will have problems but I think One more sentence. We have one good thing about this. The Senate of Finance signalized that we probably don't have to pay all the taxes back. So they said they know about the scene and they also read newspapers and they really cut out the newspapers. And they said, okay, we are informed and we know that the politics is... very interested to save the clubs and not to do something wrong here because they also know that this is not really easy. They wait for a code decision because they really don't know. They send people into clubs to checklists if this is a concert or not. Yeah, I read that, that they'd send... people into the nightclubs and they were like they said well it it what was it that it couldn't be a concert because there were people too many people talking at the bar and they weren't facing the stage so therefore it couldn't be a concert and it shouldn't be it shouldn't be charged at seven percent it is very interesting because yeah i mean um what is the main reason why people go to a club is it because it's the berghain or the or the Watergate or is it because DJ X or Epson is playing there? And so we argue for sure that there is a lineup and nobody goes to a club when there's not the right music and so on and so on. But they ask, where's the poster? Where's, there's no media coverage. And so this is, maybe some of the criteria is that you have to document it, you know, really for, because, and you have to do it now because in five years you will have a problem, you know, to show them, yeah, it's. correct to have 7%. So now these clubs are just going to use Resident Advisor even more to promote their events. That's for sure a good idea. I think this whole issue is really interesting because it brings to the fore kind of an interesting question about club culture in general, which is why are people really going? Is it to see a specific DJ perform or is it to party at a club? And, you know, as music critics, people working for Resident Advisor, Clearly, we would say we're there to see a performer. But like Philip said, when the Finanzam checked it out, they found half the people there don't even know who's playing. So it's kind of a hard truth about the culture in general, which is it isn't so clearly, it's not a concert. It's somewhere in the middle. But if you're talking to someone that works in that kind of office, this is going to be a hard sell. looking at the scene of the Dantzler of Berghain and saying, you know, this is a cultural event. But if you compare it to the classic, it's the same thing. I mean, you go to the opera, you go to the Berlin Ensemble, wherever. Sometimes you go somewhere because you notice this quality there, you know, but you don't really exactly know who's playing tonight. Yeah, but still, this is also a good point. I mean, you have to find arguments and you have to tell this to people. And if the club scene is just, you know, having a big confrontation, it's probably not... changing things. That's probably also one of the good things we could change in the last years, that we get more in the ear of the politics and decision makers. Apparently, America loves dance music now, which I find slightly strange. Having moved to Germany a couple of years ago and around that time, it was still laughable, I guess, that someone like David Guietta would be headlining at Coachella or something like that. Philip, you've written quite a bit about this stuff in America, and you wrote a cover story for Spin, which I guess would be another laughable thing in my mind, that they'd be having someone on the cover. I guess I wouldn't have known the name Skrillex at that time, but it seems like quite a sea change. Yeah, and I think... I mean, it's a sea change that's happened really quickly. I mean, I should also sort of, that my caveat is I also, you know, left the United States for Europe, I guess, back in 2005. So all of this has happened, obviously, while I've been gone. And so my, my perspective on what's happening in the United States may be a little bit skewed. But just as an example of how fast this thing, whatever it is, has happened. I mean, when I did the Skrillex piece for Spin, I mean, that began as just my editor, Charles Aaron, saying, geez, we really need a piece on dance music. You know, this is getting really big and we need a piece on dance music and we're going to be doing this sort of special issue and it's going to be a cover and you go to Electric Daisy Carnival and find out what's going on. And it was being there and meeting Skrillex and seeing kind of the command that he had over, you know, the audience, over the fans. I mean, just all of that. I mean, I came back from that saying. Charles Skrillex is the cover. There's kind of no other option. But I mean, that was something that happened in the course of days, not even months, I think. I mean, I wonder how much Guillermo's pop music production work had to do with it or had to do with anything. My suspicion is not that much because I feel like it's so different and it's not like, you know, that what he, the beats he was producing for rappers has much to do with. dead mouse. No, and even, I mean, like his big song was I've Got a Feelin', right? I mean, that's at least the one that for me seemed to be like, okay, this is Getta breaking out in a big way. And I mean, that's a pop song, plain and simple. I mean, there's really, it has a 4-4 beat, but that's the only thing that makes it dance music. I think one of the things that's very confusing right now is this defining what it is that we're talking about because there's a lot of people claiming the mantle of dance music or EDM, which is maybe something we can also talk about. I mean, but you know, you've got Paris Hilton jumping on the bandwagon. I mean, there's all these people coming out of the woodwork, but, but the question is still like, what is it exactly? I mean, I guess at its most basic form, it's, it's a person on stage playing. well, not records, but CDJs or a laptop and playing, you know, programmed music but in its studio form like what getta does is now is no different than what he's been doing for pop people forever i think for me one of the big differences between um electronic music in the u.s and electronic music here in europe is um club culture um which when i see skrillex or dead mouse or footage of something like like electric daisy carnival or ultra music festival. To me, that looks like a concert. Um, you even occasionally see people crowd surfing and stuff like that. Um, which I think is very different from a situation where it's a nightclub. Um, there's no pause, but DJs and everything. And, um, the sets are very long way that like, uh, you know, at REM or U2 going on concert tours throughout the United States in these big amphitheaters. It's just the same thing, different. Yeah. And I think, I think that the reason that, um, or one of the reasons that people in the United States kind of had trouble understanding electronic music over the years, um, was because they, uh, the majority of Americans, um, the idea of going to a nightclub. club wasn't interesting to them or it was difficult to market. So that part still isn't there. I mean, you certainly look at the stuff that was marketed in the first like electronica boom. And I know that, you know, one of the reasons that Prodigy broke through is because here's this guy who had a shaved head and crazy hair. They're on a stage. Yeah, they have a rock band presence. I think that's the only reason that Firestarter was ever this hit on MTV. And I remember seeing during, it was weird, I remember seeing on MTV Music Awards, they cut to footage of Prodigy playing, maybe supposedly live at that same moment somewhere else. And it is a concert. with Keith Flint, is that his name? Just running around the stage like a front man, but then there's this huge stage and nothing else. And then this one guy with this rack of gear, but the stage looks pretty empty. You could see that this was kind of an awkward fit. Prodigy wasn't a band. like to take a step back here though because I mean I think we're saying the same we're sort of repeating the same narrative that's been repeated a lot of times about you know what Americans want out of their concert or nightclub going experience and that's all true but I mean we're all from the states we've all been going out going clubbing Most of us, I'm sure, have been to Miami. It's not like club culture doesn't exist there and hasn't existed. I mean, what I think is really interesting right now is how everything seems to be kind of in flux. And to me, the big example of that is Ultra Music Festival happening in Miami in a couple weeks. Now, obviously, Miami's had a huge sort of sea change over the last couple of years because it used to be Winter Music Conference. There was sort of a week of parties that went around that. And then was it last year there was this big break? Winter Music Conference changed their dates. Ultra Music basically won with, you know, they had the later weekend. There was this Miami Music Week program around it. And this year, you look at the Ultra Music Fest lineup, and I mean, it's a big commercial festival. It's very much like Electric Daisy or something like that. I mean, your headliners are indeed David Guetta, Tiesto, Carl Cox, Skrillex, Afrojack, kind of all the people you'd expect. But this year they've also brought in a lot of what we would call kind of the underground and certainly the R.A. market. I mean, you've got Damian Lazarus. You've got Jamie Jones, Seth Troxler, Maya Jane Coles, Art Department, Lee Foss. And to me, that's a big shift because it always used to be Ultra was this kind of cheesy. kiddie rave with a lot of kids on drugs and you kind of knew you wanted to avoid that and instead you would be going to Sunday school for degenerates which was like cool music with a lot of kids on drugs or whatever, you know, but this year, and you know, in the crosstown parties, but this year, ultra has made a big play to become the focal point. And I just I wondered what you guys think about that. What does this mean? Yeah, you know, as someone who I guess I'm the only one here who still lives in the States. I, I don't know that that that is necessarily playing to like a specific demand. Like everybody knows who Damien Lazarus is now. Because really, if I... He was really tiny on the flyer. Yeah, I mean, if I sat down and spoke with my friends in New York, I'm really in the minority of people that I know and that I'm good friends with who are involved in this scene and who know about this scene. I wonder, you know, maybe the thought by the promoters is like, this is this very popular thing in Europe. Maybe people are a little more receptive to electronic music suddenly. Maybe they would be receptive to this. I think at least the way I perceive it is that here are these promoters who are booking a lot of these artists and seeing, are people, could this be the next thing? Yeah. That we're going to have. And, you know, we'll put them on day three, see what happens. But it's also Sunday. That's Sunday school for degenerates. Well, Sunday school isn't happening. They announced it wasn't happening. And then... They announced it was happening a few weeks later. Not very long after, it turns out all those same artists that would have played Sunday School, they're at Ultra. And the other interesting thing is Ultra was already sold out when they added all these artists. So getting Damian Lazarus, Seth Troxler, stuff like that, that's not a way to get different people in the door. I think the only explanation is that it's kind of like what Todd said, kind of see how people react to it. See if these artists could be marketable in the same way that the other artists at Ultra Music Festival are. I think that's actually just a great business move on their part. Sell the festival out and then just throw a lot of different underground in quotes. type things and see, okay, flying lotus, huh? Like, yeah, that's what people went ape for. It's just frustrating to me, I guess, or worrying to me is probably the better word, that with the festivals kind of taking over or becoming a bigger concern in the States that... It's going to become a situation where certain artists are only going to come over for a festival and then they might play a sideshow somewhere else. Or they might not because of exclusivity contracts. And then you're never going to get to see blah, blah, blah in an intimate setting. Well, I think what Will was saying earlier about... this club culture that you guys have over here that we don't necessarily have as much in the States. I mean, there just aren't. necessarily like a lot of venues that could support that sort of small show. I know in New York, there seems to be a definite gap between the really, really big rooms. And then you have the really, really small rooms. And then there's this sort of this mid kind of five, 600 person club that just doesn't exist, that would maybe be the perfect place for more of a club night. from somebody who might normally come over for the festival. I just don't know that at the moment we have the infrastructure to have something like that. I think the thing, the real strength of Berlin and London and cities you talk about is not necessarily the clubs you think about. it's a lot of these mid-sized clubs that are really good because that is the infrastructure that supports a club scene that's really healthy. And they have them throughout Europe as well. I mean, you know, you hear about DJs playing towns in Spain you've never heard of. you know and it's like wow you know and this is and this is how these continental djs at least are making their their living you know because they you can't play um you know name your big fit you can't play fabric every weekend right but you can play some weird place in girona that that nobody else has ever heard of i mean it's it's a viable infrastructure and it's not super far away unlike the states you know the flight shares alone in the states would kill any and then you have of course visa is for certain artists as well, which I've talked to promoters in the past and they say are an issue. Well, that's $2,000 and six months planning into the process, which is not really the way that dance music works right now. Yeah, Philip, in the piece that went up on Spin right after the Grammys, I was kind of fascinated by this, I guess not parallel, but the way you framed it, which was as the Grammys took place, these people watching Skrillex and Deadmau5 kind of could never imagine the existence of Berghain. And I guess to me, the interesting thing is as an American that moved to Berlin, basically because of the music scene, my friends at home that maybe Deadmau5 is their only example of electronic music. I can tell that sometimes they're like, so really like electronic music is your thing? And I know that like they have no clue what. the music sounds like, what the atmosphere is like at, you know, the kind of events that I go to because their only reference point is something much more kind of, you know, crass and everything. When I did the Grammys recap for Spin for the website, I was very cognizant of, I didn't want to come off like a snob and say that... Just because I like Berghain better or just because I like Marcel Dettman better doesn't mean that that's a better or more authentic or more real experience than going to see Chucky in Vegas. It's funny you use words like authentic and real, though, because it seemed like a lot of your argument was that here's the spectacle that is not authentic and not real. I think a different question. I'm not trying to say that the music of the mainstream EDM is inauthentic or not real. What really, and I've spent a lot of time thinking about this actually since I did the piece because I don't really feel like I necessarily nailed it. the argument and I've kind of been mulling it over and I've been trying to understand what pisses me off so much about that Grammy spectacle. Granted, like I don't really care for spectacle. I'm just not into like dancers on stage lip syncing. For me, there's just no reason to do that. And the Grammys thing. It just seems so irrelevant. I take offense. I'm getting all upset. I'm getting all... For Clem. For Clem. Exactly. I take offense when dance music is presented... in a way that doesn't reflect kind of the reality behind it. And what I'm talking about is David Guetta pantomiming like he's DJing when he's not actually DJing. You know, he's got his headphones like he's queuing up, but there's only one track. And I realized that it's an awards show. And I mean, there was somebody kind of wrote a response online and they were like, what do you expect? It's the Grammys. I know it's the Gramm other things you could do to make it better. I mean, if we're just focusing on the personality of these people, then let's just interview them or something. I don't know. But something that's kind of – somebody responded, somebody with a blog named Diary of Musical Thoughts. And he said that – and he had, I thought, a pretty good point. He said that the scene inhabited by Skrillex, David Guetta, et al. is far more inclusive and accessible than our scene. He says one of the reasons they're so huge is because they're happy to slot themselves into the music industry's regular marketing model. where anyone can invest the time and money into buying their music, going to their shows, and watching their videos on the internet. The number of people who try to get in every weekend at Berghain is far higher than the number of people that can admit. Most people don't get into Berghain, and they go home and download the experience later on, which is very true, but I think... What I'm kind of grappling with is this idea of accessibility on a consumer level versus accessibility... on a participatory level. And I may be going way far afield here. It's something I've been trying to kind of crystallize. But I feel like the narrative that we're getting from the Gettys and the Swedish House Mafias is this kind of presto, instant music. this kind of fantasy of push a button and a party appears. And I think that's actually really sending the wrong message to people that might actually want to make music or DJ or be involved on a level that isn't just buying your wristband and buying your VIP access and paying $10 for a beer or whatever. And what brought this to mind again was there's a new video from Fetty LeGrand. and two other people whose names I can't find right now. Fetty Legrand, Denise Koyu, and Johan Vettels. And the song is called Turn It. And the video is basically like... Denise Koyu and Johan Vettels are like meeting up to go take a new track to Fede LeGrand and they're going to mix it down and then they're going to take it to the club. And so basically the video sort of follows this USB stick as it leaves the first producer's computer and then he like goes to somebody's stylish apartment and he plugs it into somebody else's laptop. And they do a little thing and they listen to it and then they go to Fetty LeGrand's studio and they plug the USB stick in. And every time the track seems to just get kind of magically better. And then they go to the club and they give it its premiere and it's pumping. And then all of a sudden there's like a flash in there at like the big festival and it sounds amazing. And there's a big drop and everything. And then at the very end, and I always have. having this this thought i was like man i mean it's just so like automatic it's this parody of work of you know they're just standing there like all they do is once they kind of turn a knob you know and it's like that's that's all that it takes and at the very end the track finishes and there's a red button and it says easy and they hit it and this voice goes that was easy And I don't know, maybe I'm just really conservative and cantankerous and I'm like an old man that has too much like Protestant work ethic. But I feel like that's sending the wrong message to be like. It certainly plays into the whole, like every bad stereotype of electronic music. Yeah, I mean, it makes us look bad. It was like, that's not real music. That's, you know, you can do that on your computer. It's totally easy. Just pushing buttons. Come on, guys. Give us something to work with. Well, it reminds me, there was some like joke online of like, this narrative of this girl being trying to figure out what's wrong with her boyfriend and he was just despondent and isn't talking to her and she assumes he wants to break up with her or something and then finally says what's in his head and it's I just can't get this snare to sound right. It's a joke on how the way production really works is just sweating over details just going to hell and back with a track or a remix or something. Or a snare. Or a snare. Or a single snare sound, yeah. Just going back to what you were saying about your Grammy article, I really liked what you said about participatory, like that being able to participate in this music in a very different way is something that's lost in that kind of spectacle. Because I know like as an American, why would I get into this music that at the time wasn't necessarily happening in America? And a lot of it for me was that I felt very cut off from the artists and from the experience of seeing live music. It was something where there was somebody on stage who was doing something and then you clap and then you wait for them to tune their guitars again. They play another song and you're supposed to clap. And this sort of club culture we talk about in the music that's there, there is this idea that it's sort of reciprocal between the DJ and between the crowd. And I think that... if there is something like sort of vaguely sinister there, it is that showing someone like David Guetta and someone like Skrillex just sort of standing up on stage going like this doesn't really do justice to the full experience of the music. And I think that maybe it kind of ends up changing the stereotype. The one thing though, and I go back. on my give us something to work with here. You do have to give credit no matter how much you hate them to these guys because if you look into his history was OG Paris right there with Daft Punk guys toiling away in a small nightclub. Skrillex gets up on a stage in the Grammys. Wasn't on the telecast but... knew it was being recorded and ended up on YouTube, shouts out Croydon. Like, that is kind of amazing. And it's, they... do what they can in certain ways to pay their respects. I think Geta and Skrillex are very different types of artists and they have different and I think they have a slightly different fan base. I mean, it's an odd moment where they are in some ways like the twin poles of this mainstream EDM thing. They're the two people you're probably most likely to think of at this point. I mean, like talking about sort of respecting these people, even if their music sort of, I don't know, when I hear a Skrillex tune, there's just, I sort of clench up a little bit. It's just not what I'm interested in as far as dubstep goes. But, you know, knowing what America is like for somebody to be able to get on stage in like Arkansas or in Nebraska, middle America. with a laptop and sell it out and get people to love the experience and to do this like every night. I'm just, I'm endlessly impressed with it. And I think that it really does speak to the amount of work that someone like Skrillex is putting into this music. Well, just the fact that the term dubstep is part of normal vocabulary in the United States, not just among music nerds, is pretty interesting. It's sort of beautiful. You wouldn't have seen it coming. As much as I might disagree with the idea of that being dubstep, or the fact remains that dubstep isn't something I would have seen getting exported to the US. It's an interesting turn of events for sure. So, I mean, the ultimate question, and it's the stupid question, it's almost the irrelevant question, is this a good thing or a bad thing? It makes me think of, I forget where I first heard this, but someone saying that all these kids in the U.S. liking all this music, no matter how lowbrow it might seem to someone that considers himself like a house techno connoisseur or something. the fact remains that everyone listens to really shitty music at some point. And if you're really into it, your tastes become more and more refined. And so with the number of kids that like this stuff, if 5% of them end up sticking with electronic music, then this could be a sort of breeding ground for kids in the future. 1% of 100,000 people at the Electric Daisy Carnival. go further. That's a thousand more people. I think the mathematics of it, at least in my mind, it can only be a good thing. Our scene is small enough that a thousand people actually makes a difference. If a thousand people all went out and bought the same... record, you know, that would be like probably double the sales or more that, that. Yeah. And a scene where most records sell less than a thousand copies, you know, those are some pretty enormous numbers. I'm Tim Xavier from Man Made Mastering. Hi, I'm Mike Rinser from Man Made Mastering. Yeah, I'm Christo from Dupletz and Mastering. I don't know anything about mastering, but Jordan, who's a freelance writer for RAs, is doing a music technology master's in New York. And I imagine being in a place like this is pretty inspiring. It's incredibly cool. All this machinery. Probably, you know, I think for a lot of people talking about mastering, it's this sort of black box for most people, even a lot of music people, recorded music people. They're not exactly sure what it is. They know that... it's part of the process maybe they know it's the last part of the recording process or the or the the the recorded music process they know that it's something you're supposed to do but like what actually happens in this room i think a lot of people are aware of and i wonder if maybe the best way to approach what is mastering for the lay person isn't so much the the processes that are going on in here but what is the end result what's the difference between a mix and a master in terms of sound so i think um our job as a mastering engineer combines like more different things in one piece what you call mastering. One is like to have like a technical knowledge about the release medium you're working for whether it's vinyl. or it's digital sales or it's CDs. Then it's also about like in a way sound design, you know, make the sound nice. And then it's also to ensure the playability and to balance tracks out. Like for example, if you're doing, working on an album, then you balance the tracks out from the first to the second. and so on to the last one. So you have to have like a musical, to follow the musical scenery. Synchronicity, like everything's consistent. I mean, I think for the layman, you know, we try to educate all of our clients as much as we can. I mean, we don't have tons of time during the day, et cetera, et cetera. But the bottom line is that we're preparing and treating the music and correcting the music so it can be served to the masses. can pretty much assume that if you shop online for music, no matter where you shop, that 99% of, well, I'd say like 95% of all the music you're buying has been properly mastered. Therefore, it's ready for the masses. You know, it's playability. It has something to do with loudness as well. You know, this is where the loudness war comes into play. But to go back to that, strictly technical speaking, it's mastering. is the production of some medium that then can be duplicated. So that would be the master lecker in record production. That would be a CD master, either an audio CD or a DDP file. And after that, nothing more is done to the sound. Then it goes into the duplication. especially in Germany or maybe in Europe, more in Germany, for a very long time, I mean, until the advent of electronic dance music, independent labels and stuff like that, the process was limited to this technical aspect. And only with these developments the studios like we are now appeared, who do the mastering and the technical process in one go, which has a lot of advantages, because, as Tim said, a track with very sharp high end. will sound worse on the inside and better on the outside of the record. About 33 RPM, yeah. And so if you know, okay, this track is going to be on the inside of the record, you will treat it differently when you cut it. So if you would just give it to someone else who just masters them. then in this stage there would be another step to be taken. And so you do it in one go and can really optimize the material. Which is also another part of our job, is also to work with people and also to train people, because sometimes it seems like nowadays, as we have all these digital distribution possibilities, A lot of the old knowledge, which is coming back a little bit, so people are producing more vinyl again and stuff like that. So also to train people about the knowledge of what Christoph said, so the track with the more high energy, put it on the outside diameter, the other one on the inside diameter. And so it's always... also the communication with clients always. That's a knowledge that got lost back in the day. Every studio engineer and every producer who was then recording and assembling an album knew about this. And so they would choose the tracks accordingly. The love songs. The love songs, the ballads at the end. And that got lost. Also, maybe like 30 years ago or so, nearly all of the music that went public was produced in a professional studio by professional engineers. Now you have people who just buy a laptop and get some software. and just start doing it, which is good in a way, yeah? But of course, then you have lots of flawed recordings, yeah? And that's something I wanted to ask about too. You know, these days it's so easy for somebody to make music. They can do it in their bedroom. Something that is like music. Right. Sure. Something that's like proper recording. I think easy is maybe the wrong term because it's not easier like back in the days. It's just cheaper. You're obviously getting probably more mixes these days from bedroom producers. Does that make your job more difficult? No, not at all. Not for me anyway. I don't know. Mike's not shaking his head. No, I'm not. It makes it more difficult because you have to work more. If you get a very well-recorded audio, then you don't have to repair it. You just sweeten it. But if it's flawed, then you have to sort of repair it. You have to do a lot of stuff so it just doesn't sound shit, but you can sort of enjoy it. and on the other hand the improvement is more obvious so it's more impressive maybe for the layman to hear the original and the mastered as it would be with a record where you just do very little things However, I have heard producers who say produce in Ableton only and internally. I've heard producers who actually have an abundance of talent get a great mix out of Ableton and bounce their tune and send it to us and have it sound great. So really, it's not necessarily about the tool these days. It's not always about the tool. the most expensive sound card and the most expensive laptop and etc etc really at the end of the day it's about the man not the machine exactly it always comes down to the ear no matter what you do no matter whether you master or inexperienced yeah who just recently started producing who have no former training who just have like a basic equipment they produce something that really sounds good and then there's other people who maybe already released like 50 or 100 records. They have a big expensive studio and it sounds crap. Because they just... Something doesn't translate from the ears to the brain. The information is not processed properly or whatever. Well, I think for the inexperienced producer, talking about working with something like Ableton, there are so many options there, right? And you see the compressor up there and the list and you think, oh, well... everybody has compression. I should probably put a compressor on this, you know, and then you drop a compressor on it and maybe on every track. And, uh, I mean, that's gotta be awful for you guys. There's tons of plugin being released every day and tons of magazines like, uh, with articles about compress your stuff, master your stuff. And with mastering, it always comes down to, um, you somehow. need like a objective surrounding, like objective room, objective sound system. And the objective person, sort of. Yes. Who isn't too much involved. I mean, like... the one who produced it may have been listening to the same track over and over again hundreds of times and what you said about this Ableton or other there are more workstations and all these possibilities I think that's a problem what I like to say is it's too much sound design but no sound yeah it's sometimes I remember the times when I'm coming from making music back in the beginning of the 90s, end of the 90s. And at that time, we had like an 808 and a synthesizer and a mixing desk. And so it was super easy to figure out how patterns work and use your one synthesizer and squeeze the knobs. And now with all these DAWs, which are like tons of possibilities in each direction, not only in writing music, also in like mixing music, producing music, and all that. And you've got to understand all these little parts of it. You were talking a little bit earlier about... preparing music for kind of a particular context or a particular medium. Now, we're all dance music writers. People listening to this are probably interested in dance music. How do you prepare music for the club? Crank up the volume. Yes. Because the music really, the sensitivity of the ear changes with volume. So something which might sound sweet or nice at a moderate volume might really sound piercing if it's really loud. And so if you know this stuff is going to be played mainly in clubs at high volume, you... may treat it differently than if you have some home listening music. I mean, basically, you treat everything so it sounds good and it should sound good at every volume, in every surrounding, on every set of speakers, ideally, yeah? But in the real world, there's certain... Yeah, areas where you go more into this direction because you know that's the main purpose of the track. So nobody, there are certain techno tracks you know nobody will ever listen to them at home. That just, yeah, because I mean they're just made for the club, like trucks that are like tools or so, yeah. So you really make it good for the club, for high volume. Do you do, a musician comes to you and they're going to be releasing on vinyl and beat port, you know, or vinyl and digital both. Do you do separate masters then for each of those? Basically, the process is simple. Like the client sends us the music, hopefully with negative six dBs of headroom. So there's some room for us to work with. That doesn't necessarily mean they don't have to. have to use compression, and you can use some compression moderately. However, we master the music, we treat it, record it back, and finalize it, and the master track. go back to the client. The client then approves the tunes. And once the tunes are approved, then we use those masters to cut the lacquer. However, there are certain tweaks and changes and things that must be done in the process of transferring the music from digital to master lacquer. As we spoke about 33 RPM, you know. Too many times we get a B1 and a B2 that share a side, and we lay it out, and we're like, okay, well, the B2 tune has much more high-frequency energy, and if we have the opportunity, we'll call the client and say, we don't care whose remix it is, can we switch them? Because the record's just going to sound better with the more minimalistic, low-energy in the high-frequency. on the B2, you know? But, you know, it's funny because sometimes we do get clients who come through and they're like, we just want digital mastering, when really it's like we're still using the analog gear for... your digital masters, you know? So the digital file that you buy on beat port is warm. You know, it's not this just cold, internal, active, um, actively compressed and EQ'd, um, like sausage, you know, like, like Tim said, um, basically you, um, treat the music. So it sounds good. And if it sounds good, With limitations it's suitable for any medium. And what you then do is, like he said, you do the technical adjustments necessary to achieve a good cut. There might be some stuff that's really extreme where you don't want to lose any of extreme sounds that you know wouldn't go on vinyl. and it's supposed to be released in both rearms, then you would maybe... do really two masters yeah but 95% is like Tim said also people know there are more and more records being sold but the production runs of each records get lower and lower so there's a real pressure on the budget and so people I mean back in the day When I started, people were even like underground labels, they were selling 3,000, 5,000, 12 inches. Those same labels, if they're still in business, now they sell like 500 or 300. So, I mean, it's logical. You just don't have the budget to, for example, pay for two separate master rings. But back then, you only needed a test pressing. You didn't need to check the files and approve. Yeah, we didn't even. We didn't have a computer back then. So now we all record, we master each track and then record it back and then we assemble them for the cuts, for the running order and stuff. Back then you had DATs and you were just forward and cueing back and forth and like twiddling the knobs. And then when there were like two tracks on one side, you had to think which cue setting would go for that, which could go for both, which had to be changed. And then in the two seconds between the two tracks, you were like switching 12 buttons and turning eight knobs or something like that. Yeah, some you would just, like, if the hi-hat comes in after 64 bars, you leave it alone and start with the bass, and then before the hi-hat starts, you do something back then. I think there's a lot of B2s in the mid-90s. Which have been treated unfairly. Yeah, totally. All those B2s. There's even a culture of DJs that say, oh, yeah. I'm only into the B-side tracks. It's like, oh, you're into the track that didn't get all the treatment. But I gave it all the same treatment. I mean, you just worked on it. And the range of possibilities was limited, as you can imagine. But I wouldn't say the masters were worse. And the advantage was it was much quicker. You mentioned things that wouldn't work on vinyl. I mean, I know I've heard of this before, but what are certain things that just can't be done on vinyl or won't translate or will send the needle flying? Like maybe... Autophase bass, for example. What does that mean? It means like stereo information in low frequencies where you have like, I don't know, for example, a low end percussion or something like that. where one speaker, the information is louder than the other one, which is like, be then out of phase because one side is louder than the other side. So you got to roll off bass then in the difference channel, so make the bass mono. And why is that? I mean, what happens? Will the needle fall out of the groove? No, the lateral and vertical. The cutter head will lift up because the... cutter head is like you can see like as like an electromagnetic driver which drives which drives a stylus and you have two sides left and right and there is this two two coils and they work against each other you know and when you have like out of phase information then they work like that And the groove gets shallow and deep. And up to a certain amount you can cut out of phase. But from a certain point, it's like Mike said, the stylus will leave the surface. The groove will even be interrupted or it will be so shallow that you can't play it back safely. It has to do with the amplitude also because in the low frequencies you have the highest amplitude. all over the frequency spectrum. Then there's high frequency information, especially when the transients are really like square waves or when it's really steep. and beyond a certain level and frequency, I mean you can cut it, we can always cut much more than you would be able to play back, but then you get the, like it sends the needle flying, it gets accelerated so much, it goes out of the groove, all the information is distorted, because the stylus just can't track back these steep and... curvature and will make some noise on it just can't but also it depends on the stylist that's the problem I mean one of my greatest concerns or I mean what I sometimes makes me a bit sad is you have a good sounding recording you make a test cut then you play it back with the super shitty autophone pickups really the worst DJ pickups ever built in this planet and it sounds horrible yeah And then you have to adjust the sound to make it sound good on the auto phone because like 90% of the DJs are using them without knowing why. What would you recommend that we reinvest in? What's the stylus that we should be buying? If you want to keep low budget, then yes, Shure M44 or you get the Stanton 890, stuff like that. Sounds much better. I just want to reiterate. what you guys are saying about groove depth and cutting stereo. Basically, when a client says, okay, why can't you cut stereo bass? I explain to them that the lateral excursion is the amplitude, the loudness, and the stereo information is vertical. So they're proportional to each other. So when you cut a lot of stereo energy at a loud volume, the groove is not only modulating left to right, it's also... up and down so imagine driving a Porsche super fast through the hills of San Francisco when you hit those hilltops you're gonna fly it's same thing with a needle so that the stylus tip is gonna actually like one micron thick but it's gonna it's gonna launch and you know we don't see this because it's happening on such a small level however On playback, it plays back either as just really wonky or distorted. So we usually make everything below, I don't know, for us sometimes 200 hertz. If you have a hi-fi, like a home listening record, and you can suppose people who listen to this kind of music, they have a decent hi-fi pickup, not a DJ pickup, and they have a well-adjusted record player. even if it's just a Technics, which is a good deck, and then you would leave more of the stereo information. Also the other thing is, apart from the problems, physical problems with records, even if you have like a digital file and somebody plays in a club from Traktor, depending on how the speakers are positioned in the room and the measurements of the room, you might have cancellation of frequencies. So if you have lots of stereo bass, you might end up with no bass at all in the club. Yeah, plus a lot of big club sound systems are mono anyway. And then it also comes down to how the human ear works, because below 500 Hz, so that's the theory behind it, is below 500 Hz. I protest that. There's no directivity for the human ear. You cannot tell the direction where the sound is coming from. and you only can tell, okay, left is a little bit louder than right. I know Christopher's a little bit against that argument. It's just because he loves bass. Yeah, I love bass, and I think I can hear it. I think you love bass more than we do, which is... Typical, if you, like, have a monorail subwoofer and then the satellite speakers, and then there's the crossover frequency, and if you play a sweep, frequency sweep from, like, say, one... kilohertz down to 50 at the crossover point if the sub is not centered but somewhere which people say you can put it wherever you want and that's what you often see yeah you have the satellites in the stereo position and the subwoofer somewhere And you can really hear how it goes to the direction of the subwoofer. Where the subwoofer is actually sitting in the room. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've had that before. So much about not hearing the direction. I guess we've evolved a bit as humans, maybe. Yeah. Unless you have dog's ears that I don't know. You're only in the lower range. Okay. Not in the upper range. One of you mentioned earlier, this is switching gears a little bit, the loudness wars, which for people who are not aware, it's this sort of syndrome of making music tracks louder and louder. and louder at the expense of the dynamic range. of the track, which is where a lot of the musicality is in a record. We know this from pop music. You can hear it. How do the Loudness Wars sort of play into cutting dance records? Is it also rampant? You know, we have friends in this industry who, you know, everybody's got their engineer. I mean, here we are, we're having a roundtable discussion with my partner Grinzer Kristoff from Dubplates. We're dinosaurs so we all share the same pain you know and I'm gonna say safely say that I think we try to educate through whatever means necessary to our clients that you know Having a nice, fat, loud recording is great, but when your bass drum is round and you zoom into the waveform and then you want us to make it square, it ain't cool. There's just no need for it, especially if you're DJing in Traktor, for instance, or... Serato. Well, I don't know Serato so well these days, but Traktor definitely has a built-in limiter, and it has a built-in volume correction. So when you import your tunes into Traktor, and they're blisteringly loud and compressed, and you load that tune into a deck, the volume level will go, it will attenuate and actually drop, so it matches the other tunes. So it gets compressed a further time again. Yeah, it's terrible. And that's the problem, and I interrupt you because that's an important point we might otherwise lose. Lots of people, when they send the stuff to the mastering studio, it's already compressed like hell. Sometimes. Nowadays, I reject it. this straightly. I say, okay, please send me a rough mix that has got some dynamics on it, or I can offer you, if you don't have the possibility, to do a straight transfer, but I won't master it, because even if I just want to know out something in the hi-hats or something where really not the energy not the amplitude is I lose like three four five whatever DB of loudness by just doing that so to make up for that I would have to compress again on an already compressed waveform and this is just You never get a good result with this. And the problem is also that peaks cannot be recreated. Once peaks are lost, they are lost forever. You can't do anything. I mean, if you're interested in dance music, hip-hop, electronic music, music for clubs, then we talk about... compressed music. Sure, this music has to be compressed, but it's also always a way of how you compress shit and how you make shit loud. Cutting off peaks is just not the resolution all the time. The amount of compression and the method of compression. That's it. I like to say, I've had people come up to me in bars and clubs and say, when I'm choosing a mastering engineer, how do I choose a mastering engineer? Is it totally... based on objectivity and pure style and preference. And it's not. I mean, I think as engineers, there are 50% standards we have to follow that are like the laws of physics that we can't surpass. We can't go over. And then maybe the other 50% is... preference and experience, you know, and how we feel. How you feel today or tomorrow. To be honest, if I master one track today and you give me the same track in two weeks, I might master it differently. I mean, I'm a human, yeah? And... It's what Tim said, it's the objectivity and you see the song as a whole. As a producer you might really concentrate too much on certain details and when as a mastering engineer you hear the track and you hear the whole track. Of course you are interested and you hear all the details and the sounds, but you're not going like, oh, this cowbell is like fucking great or so. Because he's put this weird tweak on it or whatever. More cowbell. You think, does it work within the song? And if you might then, through your treatment, affect some of the tiny elements. Because we all had this situation. You work on something and you improve the whole track a lot. And then the artist says: "Yeah, but this one triangle or bell, it just doesn't sound precisely as it did before." You say: "Okay, but we can try to go back and keep it, that it sounds exactly like on your recording." But then the track as a whole wouldn't sound that good. So that's the thing, you see the big picture and it's the experience. Of course it's the technical means that you have a better acoustic. in the room than most people have in their production studios. You have better speakers. And you're willing to make compromises, which is our job. It's a lot about making compromises. And producers, it's always hard to make a compromise. Okay, if I do that, then this or that happens, and I don't like this, but I don't also like that.
