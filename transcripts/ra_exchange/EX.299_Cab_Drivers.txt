♪♪ ♪♪ Thank you. you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange with cab drivers. Daniel Paul and Jens Augustovsky have been releasing swinging, functional house records for two decades. The Berliners' hardware jams are perfect DJ tools, but their music carries that certain something which has given much of their material a truly timeless quality. They've been running their label, Cabinet, for 20 years now, and in conversation with Matt Unicombe, they describe the process and history behind their quest for the perfect loop. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with cab drivers is up next. Thank you. Well, I heard that the cab drivers, like, the name wasn't intentional. I heard on this Savan interview that you did, Daniel, he asked you, where does the name come from? And it didn't actually mean, like, taxi driver. No, me, actually, I didn't know that it means a taxi driver at this time. The story is just the short version of cab is cabinet, or the other way around. The short version of cabinet is cab. And we are driving the label Cabinet and so we thought okay let's make a short thing and Cab Drivers. It's like driving a business so we are driving Cabinet Records so Cab Drivers. It's also pretty driving house music. Sure. So it fits. Yeah. So it seems like you guys are releasing more the last couple of years? Yeah, yeah, we are still active. So what inspired, like, last year you put out three things. Or at least three. Three is cab drivers, including the reissue. Even more, I think, here and there, a lot of some little tracks, for example. Remixes, maybe. So we remix a lot and we get a lot of remix requests. Yes, last year, I can't remember how many records. we released so exactly but maybe it was four or something or five as cab drivers so three years or four years ago we no it's five or six years ago we met again so we had a production break so Everybody of us was doing his own thing. And then we met together and was trying to produce together. And the first production... We fell in love and we decided to do it on a regular way, so once per week. And since that time, we meet once per week. to one track minimum per week. So that's why we have a lot of tracks. And then the day came, what to do with all those tracks. And yeah, so we decided to to release it again. Then we were thinking about AKA or the name of the project we can use. So maybe you know that we have a lot of project names in the past. Yeah, Zenit fitted the best to use cab drivers again. And that's why we have cab drivers on the road again, sitting in their own cab. So how long were you not making music together for? Actually, I think it started in 92, actually, where we met in the end of 91. at the civil service. We both decided to make a civil service, not going to the army. And I think at that time Jens Sky was more the DJ and I already started producing with Atari and a little bit synthesizer stuff. And in 92 we was... just thinking well you have good influences I have my own way of thinking and making music so I know a little bit how to make music so let's meet in the studio and let's find out what we can do So we did one session, two sessions, and we found out that we have a good chemistry to build up a track. So we started little and just recorded little tracks, which was never released. It was just trying errors and stuff. And then we slowly built our studio. bought machines, synthesizers, learned about more the MIDI thing, how to record, blah, blah, blah. And so I think it was then 93 where we released the first track. And 95 we started Cabinet Records together. True story. So what was it like making house in Berlin back then? Well, in the beginning, he was a bit more influenced from techno, like guys from Tannit. We was going out at Tresor. I mean, and other clubs like Planet. And we was quite young. I mean, 22, around about this. And of course, we were young and we, you know, wanted to express ourselves and wanted to dance. And so we was getting a lot of influences from club to club scene. And it was more... a mixture of breakbeats, techno, house, but rave and it's what we took in the studio with us, so the inspirations. And later when we started the Melting Point record store, we had friends like DJ Mitch or Armin, they had more the... the housey influence on us, I think. And we started to produce a bit more slower and a bit more nice, not too crazy, you know. And yeah, influences, man. They came from everywhere. So what kind of DJs were playing this slower stuff back then? Was it popular? Because you hear so much about this fast techno work in Trezor being what just seems like that was the dominant thing back then. But you know what? But slow means not slow in the number of BPMs or something. Slow means it's more a feeling, so an expression. So don't be hard, be more... soft and soulful and and housey so if you if you listen to our music back in the days so this is not slow so we are we was still on i don't know 128 or 126 beats per minute so it's not slowing that kind But I guess it's slow compared to the techno that was coming out then. Yeah, BPM-wise. Yeah, but the circles that we are was moving around. It never wasn't so representing a fast way or fast kind of techno. So it was always about... the strengths and we had a phase where we were listening to Woody McBride, you know DJ ESP on his imprint Communique or Drop Bass Network so of course there were a lot of fast records in in terms of BPMs, but there also were powerful, slower records with dark TB-303s and heavy pumping bass. We never felt in love with only one kind of music. So we have phases all the time. So especially right now we are in an analog phase. So we are producing analog in the studio also and we have a favorite number of BPMs. And we like to sound the way we sound these days. But I don't know, maybe next month we put the sampler on and sample some house divas or something. But Berlin DJs who influenced us a lot was DJ Mitch from Melting Point, who's running it. today, and Armin was our partner too. And there was Kreton, for example, who's a Greek guy who's still living in Berlin. influences from? From Klee or from Rock. Rock was, especially for me, he was my first hero. I saw him at UFO in Schöneberg and I was totally flashed. He was playing together, I think, with Tarnit and they totally kicked me. And this was short after the wall came down. And the first time I was going to a club was UFO. And it hit me from the back. And it never left me. And from then, there were a lot of influences. So what was it like going to UFO for the first time? What kind of sounds were they playing? It was 1990 or something. It was punchy, ravey signal sound. It was heavy 909. And I can't remember exactly what. track or what tunes I was listening to but I remember the feeling and the atmosphere. Fog inside. stroboscopic lights and a huge sound system and everybody was on fire so I couldn't stand it for 30 seconds. Do any clubs these days come close to replicating that feeling? I don't know how much you still go out. I think the music changed a bit since then. Like we said, it was a bit more the experimental phase of a lot of producers. And it also came with the technology of making music. I mean, with new synthesizers. new possibilities these days hard to say really i mean we play a lot in the moment but we don't go out that much and maybe the closest thing is trezor still downstairs, I mean in the Trezor, not Globus Club. So heavy stroboscope, heavy fog, loud sound system. But I think the music went a little bit more minimal these days. Back in the days you could hear things like Dominator. from R&S records and mixed with LFO tracks, you know, it was more wide-ranged. Yeah, music which became icons. Today, as Daniel says, very often we have the impression that DJs which are playing at the same club where we play... playing beat tracks only and then the next beat track. And there are not much harmonies, not much melodies. So it's sometimes... Emotions. Yeah, yeah. This is what we talk about a lot. Where are the harmonies? Where are the feelings inside a track? Often we have the feeling we are at a beat track party. It's a funny thing. There's a lot of really cool rhythmic music, but so much of it is missing melody. They are good. They work. Exactly. They shake your body and I mean, without any drug you go there and when you listen to it, you get bored after a half hour. I mean, you can dance to it like a half hour and then after a while you think something is missing. And if it could be a message, a sound, a melody, a pad, whatever, and rapper, I don't really care. But sometimes I miss a bit the entertainment, you know. Well, that's the thing about you guys. Your music is often really loopy and rhythmic, but there's always some melody or something happening on top, which isn't actually that common. in this kind of stripped back house? Maybe, yeah. I don't know. Is it good or bad for you? Oh, it's good. Yeah, it's good. It's good. But it's, yeah, it's a very like distinctive sound, I think. Like when you think of the DJs like who play this kind of stuff. Yeah. A lot of the other stuff they play is just pure like rhythm tracks. Yeah. With some weird, you can always tell when they're playing a cab driver's track Of course we love beats and we wouldn't do this kind of music if you wouldn't love beat tracks, but we... I don't know why it is, but... If we work together, we have a special atmosphere maybe in the studio and we are always searching for that special sound or a sweet spot you can freeze and stretch over maybe five or six minutes. four minutes and of course we we laugh if our tracks are pumpy and leads you to the floor to the dance floor so that's why some of our names or the name of our tracks um are playing with that. Our new release, which came out yesterday, has the name Ground Service. So in a special meaning, you can say our record is a service for the dance floor, the ground, so to fill it maybe. So it would be nice if it works like that. I think we'd just like to layer. to answer your question it's um it's good to have a base for track i mean a simple base like a groove you described it the best in your last review for playroom you said there's there's always something you can choose what you can follow with your mind but there's other stuff going on so it's something for your hips and your mind you can choose the more let's say functional thing on the track from us or a more let's say spiritual or cosmic or whatever thing and I kind of like that yeah It entertains you in different ways for your feet, your hips and your ears. So how is the mood when you're producing together? Because I think most, if not all of your tracks are very happy sounding. It depends. I mean, when we go in the studio, we have always influences. I mean, from the family, from politics, from whatever. affects you somehow when you go in a studio? Yeah, when your life is not too bad. So the music can be happy, as you say, but happy. I never, so I think if I listen to music, to my music so maybe I'm allowed to say that it makes me happy so but I don't have the feeling that our music is happy in a way like without of any meanings and just Like if you're going on a green carpet with flowers or something. But it's good if the music makes, especially Daniel and me, at first happy. And if other people like our music also and they're happy. We are happy again. And has it always been like that? Like when you were younger? Well, you made this techno thing. It's the Cora? What's the... Caro. Caro. Yeah. Caro is a symbol from a card game. You know, the famous card game where you have the heart and the cross. I don't know. We just choose that because we found it somehow interesting. And there's not a special meaning behind that. So we have another project name called Princess. And we are boys, you know. I mean, when we go in the studio, even back in the days, we had influences from records, from stuff we heard in the record shop, where we were there, let's say, eight or six hours a day, and you hear a lot of records. And when you finish with your work... Then you go in the studio and think, okay, I need to eat something. And then what about all these influences we had from the day? So, and is it raining outside? It's, how was the mood in general? What, or do I like the sound from the new synthesizer we have since a couple of days? just bought today, that makes you, you know, I think we're looking for emotions. And it can be happy, it can be dark, it can be... a beat track and it can be something in the middle i don't know it's um influences come from everywhere even from back in the days like daniel dixon the stick man and moody man of course and even plastic man had a little influence and daniel bell and lfo a lot and we took that sometimes with with us in the studio and somehow we were still experiencing with our studio trying to sound like this or that and after a while we thought okay now we understand how other people produce but let's try our own cabinet sound let's say which has its own thing. Colour. Let's say colour. It has its own colour. What were the reactions to it back when you started it in 1995? Were many DJs playing it? Yes. So we had some releases before we had this own label. But with Cabinet Records, the first releases we did with Acme in Toronto, so the boys from Stickmin. And with them, we had a press and distribution deal. So this helped us a lot to get visibility. And so at the beginning, we had very, very good response. It's not the most important thing, but it's good to see how good something works. We had good sales. That's why we went any further. Today we hear very often that a lot of DJs, even young DJs, have our records in their bags. as, please understand me right, as a secret weapon. So even the old records from the early days. So it's more like we see these days how good things worked the past days. You can see the Discogs prices, like it's a hyped sound now somehow. It's this jacking, I don't know, it's this timeless kind of house sound. Like any DJ could play it. And it's going to sound fat and punchy. It's really nice to see that and that the records are still working, let's say. And taking you on a journey. Just hitting you in the hips. But you know, when we started the label, then back in the days, there was no internet. It was slowly starting. We just had the fax number on our records. That was it. And so we... got a little bit back from DJs. There was no Facebook who was, you know, you were seeing a hype of a track or something. So we just did our music, kept on going, releasing stuff and heard a little story here and there. But I have to say, there was a really impressive moment for me when we were in Toronto in 1996. We were taking a car and making a little tour from Toronto to Detroit, Chicago and back. And we arrived in Chicago and was a bit lost because we couldn't find a hotel. But we find someone who helped us. Coleman, I think was his name. Yes. And gramophone records. And he was saying, hey, guys, don't worry, you can stay at my couch for one night and maybe you find a hotel tomorrow. And he was kind of. He was working at Gramophone, right? And knowing the scene. And he said, hey, guys, what about going to Shelter? This was the big club in Chicago. I think it still is. So we went there and felt a bit like, ooh, okay, wow, it feels a bit like Berlin. But just tried to have fun. And we were dancing. We started dancing and in the moment I think the second track the DJ played was one of the tracks we just released. And this was like, wow. You could see all the people around us was dancing, a lot of black people. And it was like, wow, what a magic moment. You know, you go in a foreign city. Can you say that? Yeah. And you start dancing and the DJ is playing your music and what it affects. I mean, to you and the people around you. And this was a magic moment for me. me going on with making music because this is one of the best moments you can have, I think, as a musician. Like, it was a surprise, you know, and came in the right moment. It was like, wow. Thanks. So what other house music were you listening to? Were you into like what Playhouse and this Frankfurt crew was doing? Because I think that there's some similarities there with you guys. Yeah, I mean, we never met them. Yeah, was it popular in Berlin? Yes. Like Frankfurt, Playhouse. So we were listening to a lot of music. As Daniel told at the beginning, beginning so we had an own record shop we opened Melting Point Records at 1994 so one year before we founded Cabinet Records and yeah we listened the whole day to new music of course there was music from from Playhouse and and other labels but it was clear very very fast I think that we loved most records from Chicago, from Detroit and this is what especially me or maybe Daniel also I think so influenced a lot so every relief record which came fresh with the UPS man Or Balance, Prescription, Moody Man, Underground Resistance. There was so much good music back in the days. I kind of miss that a bit in the moment. I mean, there's good stuff coming. Beat tracks. But maybe it's, yeah, there could be more, I think. What does that music have, like this relief sound? Emotions. Yeah, and special moments. So, and it's... Also, for me, it's a rhythmic thing. So I like if the beats are shuffled. or if there is a little bit of flavour of Latin. And these Chicago guys played a lot with these ingredients. Shuffled beats, shuffled fat beats, some organic sounds, harmonics. Do you think it has to do with the equipment people use now? Ableton is a good program if you know how to work with it. But for me it makes things a bit too easy to work with making beats when we come back to the point with the beats. So I think everyone can do it, understanding the program in maybe one hour. But then you should dig a bit more deeper and find interesting sounds or using samples, whatever. And back in the days, people were producing with the MPC, loading or sampling disco records, whatever. dubbing it or building a strange atmosphere and jamming crazy things. Yeah, I think so. It has something to do with how you make music, even the clean sound from Ableton you can have. But it has this good and strange side for me. I miss a bit the hum, the magic in the program. It seems like music back then was somehow a bit more random. Like the beat would be going along, there'd be some crazy break and like someone yelling or... I don't know, it just seems... Like a random product. Yeah. It's kind of, yeah, maybe. So if we do music these days, as we told before, we go in the studio and work with the real machines. And we are jamming around. And then we will maybe after three hours or two or four, it depends, we will have... if we are lucky, well we have a sweet spot. So, and we try to freeze it and stretch it. I mean we work for over 20 years now together and if we jam together so we watch each other and twinkle with the eye and, um, Daniel or me, I, we know what to do. So go to the break or, um, playing the harmony. We, um, have, um, trained while jamming before. So, and it's not that random, but we try to keep the magic of a jam. So if you prearrange everything like you can do with Ableton for... every millisecond of a track, then maybe it's losing its magic, a track is losing its magic. Because this prearranging and this mathematical arranging of a track can kill. The wave, the emotion of a track, it's still a good track maybe. And it's working and pumpy and it sounds good and has all it needs. But it's like reading between the lines if you read a good book or a text. So you can't read between the lines anymore because everything is planned. And somehow... You can feel it, or we do feeling it. And that's why we try to jam, because we feel there is kind of magic while jamming, and we try to keep it. I think back in the days it was a bit more limited to the sounds and production-wise. I mean, you can make a really good track with just an MPC or the EMU SP-12, I mean, the drum machine, this little sampler, which is Theo Parrish using a lot. And when you are limited a bit to what you can do, you concentrate more on the sounds and trying to make that little thing perfect. And I think these days, with the millions of possibilities you have in Ableton, you can get lost and losing the magic moment, I think. But you have to trust yourself. you should stand when you make music dance music you should try to dance to it if it's not working then it's not working and um you should put yourself in a in a in a mood in the mood where you think okay i like to dance now so please um make me dance ableton Four years ago, we were sitting in front of Ableton and sharing the mouse between the two of us while we were sitting. And we have tracks with 10 or 12. So because we were pre-productioning and pre-planning everything, every little millisecond. So, ah, here. at minute one so maybe we can have a little reverb for five milliseconds sounds awesome yes it did but the result was a nice track but it wasn't grabbing our souls anymore so now as daniel told we are dancing in the studio so And we are standing at the machines programming. I think that's kind of old school way too. I mean, putting a machine in front of you and start jamming. And if you produce and have a really good moment, then keep that. Making a track, keeping it looping or whatever, make it five minutes long or whatever. So as long as it works, it works. That's, I think, how the producers like from relief or... how they just did it. It's definitely not as common now as it used to be. I'm not sure. I think a lot of people are doing it. Oh, really? Yeah. But a lot of people are using Ableton and a lot of people are using Bose. So we are not against Ableton. So this is not a manifest against Ableton or a manifest for jamming live. It's about the atmosphere you have while you're producing a dance track. So if we produce atmospheric, chill-out music, we can sit and share the mouse between us. But if we want to have that special dance feeling, so we have to dance and we have to squeeze the knobs and push the buttons and program some breaks. trying some chords and stop and try again and start again. And I think today everybody can choose the way he wants to produce music. So it's not a manifest against Ableton or for producing only with machines. It's about the mood and special atmosphere. And of course, the power which is coming out from the machines, it's different. So if you use... original, let me say, TR-909 instead of plug-in at Ableton, which is totally compressed, which is very clean, there's no crinkle and noise and no hum. It makes a difference in the sum of a track. So all this little hum and crackle and... and noise, these little noises, it makes a sound like we love it. So warm, dynamic, organic, moving. How does your live set work? Is someone on beats and someone's using synths or...? That's somehow open. I mean, we can do both the same. We built it together. We brought always ideas. If we both was happy with it, we'd both understand the idea, what we can do live. So that's totally free. I mean, we both jam. Like in the studio where we work the machines, we both know what they can do or cannot do. So just say you've made a nice loop that you're really happy with. Yeah. What's the process? Like what happens in between discovering this nice loop and then ending up with a finished track? Well, then we, I think we DJs and we like it somehow DJ friendly. So when we produce a track, so we mostly start with beats because it's easy to mix with another record. So we start there and trying to lead to the sweet spot. And while we did the jam or the way to the... perfect loop we was having a little thing here and there and we always stored it like put an effect right in the moment here live on an analog mixer when someone of us is saying okay wow that was a good moment please keep that for the jam and so we collecting ideas and for the perfect loop without destroying it, you know, the idea. And when we start recording for the final jam, then we start with the beat, trying to build up the track, lead to the speed spot and around it we play around with the possibilities, with effects. extra sounds and modulations of the synthesizers. So if we are, after some hours, if we are happy with what we have, so then we recognize all the little tricks we had while we were jamming and train it kinda so how was it one hour ago can you can if we record now can you do you know how to push the button or squeeze the knob or open the filter or add some effect or something and then so everybody going through all the last three four hours and recall it and then we extend the beats so that we program maybe on the 909 we program an opening pattern a break pattern a main pattern pattern without be without heads or claps or something like this so that we have some varies or varieties of everything so and then we play with the possibilities and and sometimes that creates mistakes But sometimes these mistakes are making the track. We worked this way when we started in 94, when we... When we found out that you can sync machines, having one master and everything is in slave, like all other machines. And there was no other way. There was no DAW program like Cubase or like Ableton. Like today, there was no total recall thing. So when we were going in the studio, we knew we had to finish it today. So we put in the machines, put them in sync, started making loops, beats, buildings, buildups, adding sounds, having Cubase, also in Slave, who was shooting MIDI loops. There we learned how to build a track. Some years ago, two or three years ago, we remembered how we did that back in the days. Being limited with the technology, but having good sounds. We know they work well, like the 909, the 101, the 303. We were wondering if it could work well these days. So we bought the machines back. and still had some of the old equipment, mostly we had, and was going to the studio and saying, okay, let's do it like 20 years ago or 15 years ago. And we were really surprised how much fun it made and how much magic it can create. To be honest, there are also... jams where we think hmm shit this was um maybe this was too loud because when we jam we're recording just the stereosome no extra parts so and it can be heaven or hell and but you mostly notice at least in the next day so when you listen again to the jam and think wow perfect and uh but yeah like i said there was also moments where we thought there's why we didn't hear that the bassline was too loud or the kick too loud or the hi-hats too sharp too sharp whatever sometimes you can rescue it but but the good thing is we record 25 or 30 minutes So that we have three versions all on the same level and then we can edit parts, maybe cut something out, cut something in. or paste something in so that we have enough material. It's probably pretty hard to explain, but what does a loop need to be a good loop? That's a good question, yeah. It's a feeling, I guess. It's a feeling. It needs the right swing. It has to swing inside you. So there are thousands, millions of loops outside, and most of them are... boring because they are technical they are straight four to the clock and there's no swing no feeling no notes between it's hard to explain so this swing is so important isn't it this groove yeah yeah so much dance music these days just doesn't have it it's just this uniform yeah I mean, we not always use the swing. Sometimes the track works better when it's really straight and the ghost notes in between make the groove. But a swing, yeah, we love that, I think. On some drum machines, the swing is named human shuffle. So maybe this is the secret behind. So if a band, a real band, is playing drums or a drummer is playing drums, so he never is... that accurate like a drum machine could be. It makes it natural. It makes it... Daniel, how to explain? Alive. It makes more alive. When you hear a track, you can sometimes hear every single thing and then you understand what's doing it, but it doesn't really hit you. And when you have a groove which feels natural and you don't answer the question, why is it like that? and you're just taking it and saying, "Okay, wow, I love that." I think that's the moment we are looking for in the studio, just building a groove. And a bass line for me is very important. The bass line makes the bass somehow. - It's half of the rhythm. - Yeah. That's what we are looking for. And really good flow, like it could be a four bar or eight bar loop. It doesn't really matter, but it has to take you, you know, it has to, without... telling you any question. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
