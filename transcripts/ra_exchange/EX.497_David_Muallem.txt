Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. This week on The Exchange, Carlos Hawthorne sits down with David Mualim, the German DJ behind Munich's premier club, Blitz. A DJ since age 14, Mualim says running clubs was never something he aspired to. But he later found himself as the creative director of another prized Munich club, Bob Biermann, before coming up with the vision for Blitz, which transformed a long-disused part of the city's Deutsche Museum into one of Europe's most hyped clubs. In conversation, we hear of the thousands of little details one has to consider when developing the idea for a club, the importance of giving structure to your vision, and how to ride the ebb and flow of anxiety and satisfaction that faces even the most successful club operation. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net. And follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with David Mualim is up next. Thanks for dropping by, David. Thanks for the invite. Nice to see you. What brings you to Berlin? I've been playing yesterday. I'm at Berghain Garden and I have friends here so that's why I'm hanging out longer. Nice. You played the garden before? No, it was the first time actually. Oh nice. How did you like it? I loved it. It was a really great vibe. It's a special setting. I actually love playing outside. And it's a super dope vibe. It's super relaxed. You somehow don't feel so much pressure. Usually I play Panorama Bar upstairs and the pressure level at Panorama Bar is way higher. And it was super sunny and the crowd is the best, obviously. And you were playing the first set, right? I played the first set from 12 to 4. You don't usually play? Yeah. Nice. Especially in the first hour. Some, I don't know, pop music I played. Oh, nice. Stuff from the new BBO album. Oh, cool. It was really, really nice. Lovely. I mean, how far back does your relationship with Berghain go? Really long, actually, because I went there as a dancer for a long time. I played a gig at Berlin around 15 years ago. At a place called 103, I think that was the name. I think it doesn't exist anymore. It was next to Watergate. And I played with the Optimo guys. And then afterwards they said, hey, there's this new place. Panorama Bar opened, like reopened. There's a new space. Let's go there. I was like, okay. And I never went to the old Ostgut. So I didn't know it. I mean, I heard about it, but I was never there. And then I said, let's go there. And then I went to Panorama. But Berghain wasn't open back then because the first three months it was just upstairs. And I went in this room and I was like, okay, this is like insane. It's the best space. So for me, this is where the relationship with the space started rather than the people because like I went to the space like dancing all the time for 10 years. And then I got to know the people working there and I become friends and like I'm playing there for like five years or so. So even the space. back then felt very special immediately yeah immediately immediately i went to like like eight or nine in the morning and the space was rampacked and everybody was dancing like crazy and it's like the energy was so like up there and yeah i remember i was there with a friend i was going with him to to to party there all the time actually back then And I was looking at him and I was like, the day will come I will play that. And he was like laughing. He was like, you idiot. And 10 years later, it happened. It was a good feeling. Nice. You obviously were creative director of Bob Beeman, a club in Munich, and now you run Blitz alongside four other people. Is that right? It's four other people, yeah. Yeah, right. I mean, I wonder just if Berghain or any other clubs kind of directly inspired your work at both those clubs. Yeah, 100%. I think like obviously everything that you experience inspires you in some way. And I've been going out to nightclubs for like over 20. five years now and so everything I experienced in this time has inspired me in some way and you learn things and there are things you like and things you don't like so much and obviously like there are some clubs out there who do things really well or like they don't where you feel that this is the way to do things and this inspires you for sure so I wouldn't say that there was like a kind of blueprint of setting something up Because I think copying is not a solution, but setting up your own thing, your own vibe, but still learning from what others did. But that also dates back to clubs that didn't even exist. Not didn't even exist, but don't exist anymore. Right, right. Yeah, last week news arrived that Bob Beeman is closing down. Yeah, I heard that too. How do you react to that news? Actually, there was not a big reaction. I saw the Facebook post and I just commented on it actually. I said, thank you, Bob Beeman, because I had a good time there. but I left over three years ago and I did my own thing. So I usually don't try to look back so much, but I try to look into the future. And I had a good time there and I learned a lot and I managed to move some things forward, I feel. And that's about it. So I moved on, but I had a good time. Was it, because I read that during your time at Bob Beeman, you were always looking for spaces. So you had this idea in your head that you would one day like to run your own club. I mean, is that something that's been with you only since then or for a long, long time? It developed during that time. I was never actually so much into running nightclubs. Because, I mean, I was always connected to nightlife and clubbing because I was DJing all my life, basically. Not all my life, but since I'm 15. Okay, wow. And... But I never had this idea of setting up a nightclub. But there was like, actually a friend of mine I grew up with opened a club in Berlin in 2002. His name is Oskar. And he opened a weekend club back then. This was the first time I was like had some... insights into what it takes to open a club, the thoughts that I put into it. And I kind of realized that there's a lot of like creative parts to it or like some decisions that are really important in terms of it's like I realized it's not so easy. There are a lot of things you have to think about. But I still didn't have a plan to open a club. That was like not my thing. I always said that so many times actually when people ask me so. I always had this image in my head when I was younger of like club owners of these like rich guys counting money in some dark back room taking lots of cocaine and like... people you were like trying to catch at six in the morning after after you finished your set because back then you got your money in cash after you said and like giving you life lessons and you were just tired and you're like can i please go home just give me my money i want to go home so this is always the image i had in my head so i definitely didn't want to be a nightclub guy And like this Bob Beamon thing came by kind of like accident because I was like in Munich and I had to stay in Munich. But during Bob Beamon, to get back to your question in a concrete way, because Bob Beamon was like taking off in a way I never expected to be. I was moving back to Munich. I was living in New York before. And I came back to Munich and I was trying to sort out my visa for the States. And then my stepdad got diagnosed with lung cancer. So I decided to stay a couple of months to support the family and my mom. And I stayed for two years. and help the family and like all my plans at the time for my life, like completely switched around because I was kind of lost, you know, I was like just in Munich, not just in Munich, but like I didn't work, I didn't, was straight after university and I didn't think about career, I was just thinking about supporting my family and then he died two years later. And I was like, okay, I need to travel. And so I traveled in Central America for like three months. And I came back and actually my plan was to go back to the States. Then the guys who owned Bob Beeman approached me. They were like, we're building a club. We're like, we want to do a club. Can you do the club? And I was like, it's an interesting thing. And I was super like kind of like because it was a really weird setup because the guys who were running the club actually had no clue about club culture and stuff like that. So that's why they approached. But at the end, like they had they were in a position to make decisions in the end. So I said, OK, when it comes to our creative decisions. If I have the last word, we can talk about it. And that's how I got into Bob Beeman. So this whole running clubs or setting up clubs came really by accident. I never thought about it before. But then I realized while I was running Bob Beeman that I'm really bad at compromising. especially when it comes to creative decisions. It's like most of the time when I work at things, not most of the time, but I do stuff I really believe in and it moves me in some way and gives me goosebumps. And once you have this feeling inside, you can't let go. It's hard. And then I actually, when I started Bob Beam and I was like, okay, if this has gone wrong. if this like this is just an experiment I will leave the space after three months I would just say no one will remember I ever worked with with with this club and then it was like taking off in a way I never expected before and then I realized okay like actually what you do like people kind of like what you do they like they like the club they like the concept so And then friends were like, you should do your own space. Like, you should, like, why do you work for other people? You should do your own space. And this is the moment when I, now I close the circle to your question. And this is when I started thinking, hey, maybe if all these people, because I'm actually a very insecure person, like I'm super in doubt with myself, questioning myself all the time, overthinking things. I'm a miserable person actually, hating myself. And then I was like, okay, if so many people tell you that, maybe you should, if everyone else believes in you, why don't you believe in yourself? And this is the moment I started to look for other locations in Munich. That's an interesting story, man. You mentioned just before we started the conversation that you walked into the Berlin office where we are and you said, oh, you know, you can find spaces like this in Berlin. So I guess it's harder in Munich to find these kind of spaces. I mean, what was that process like? It's way harder to find spaces. There's just no, the city has a lack of space. general living space there's not enough apartments and there's like it's actually there's huge amounts of office spaces that are free that are like unoccupied and the city is pretty expensive And especially like everything that's empty is like being like totally destroyed and like luxury apartments are being built. So there's just not a lot of free space to set up things that are maybe off luxury apartments or like for cultural projects and stuff like that. So it's really not easy to find space there. But I have to say there's like this inner circle in Munich. We have this like road called Mittlerer Ring, which is like a city highway. And basically everything that's inside the inner circle is like considered like downtown Munich. And basically everything that happens in nightlife is within the circle. and it used to be totally different when I was younger and out there was this like really famous club in Munich called Ultraschall and it was at the old airport and like there were con like also there was like a concert space there And when we were kids, we were always going there. There was one guy who was 18 who had a driving license taking us out there. But it was like going out at night and traveling, taking distances was totally normal. And now in Munich, it's the thing. Everything has to be in the city center. Everything is close by. And of course, there the spaces are really rare to find, really hard to find. It was really hard for me. Because that was basically the hardest thing for me to look for spaces because I didn't know what to do. Because these spaces, you don't go to an agent and say, hey, can you, like a real estate agent, can you look for a space? It doesn't work like that. So I was like approaching, I started by approaching friends who are in gastronomy, who run like restaurants, who run clubs, who run long bars. And I was like, maybe if you get something offered for space, because like when you're in the game, people offer you something. So I was like. Approaching all the people I knew in nightlife, if you get, like, an offer for a space and you don't like the space, tell me about it. I might take it. And I actually got, like, this, like, everyone said, like, yeah, but, you know, if we get something offered, why should we give it to you? And I was, like, okay, but if you don't like it, just tell me you didn't like it. Maybe I like it, you know? I don't know then there's competition because you're gonna open a space and like so I didn't get anywhere and then I didn't get to see a single single single location and then my friend I grew up with and he's into real estate But total different side of things. He's like into like big like corporate industry, whatever, high-end financial business. And I was like, you into real estate, maybe you hear something about it. And he was like, okay, I'm going to help you and never heard from him again. So I was kind of lost, but I was doing this festival, like not kind of festival, but like a festival party crossover at Bob Beamon once a year called Smile. I did it for five years. And after five years, we thought about like making it bigger and going to different off location and not doing it at the club. So I hooked up with this guy who's like. kind of an agent whatever not a real agent but he's like just this guy freelancing and looking for locations location scout basically looking for locations that like temporary stuff I was asking him like let's find something for the festival so he showed me a couple of locations in the city and like but this was for smile festival so I wasn't thinking about the club And then actually he showed me a location in Munich, a huge warehouse next to the central train station, bomb location, really off the hook, super industrial, like two warehouses next to each other with a like courtyard, like open air courtyard, like also huge. And I was like, okay, what the fuck? This is like the craziest space I've ever seen. So he's like, yeah, there's one downer that's like 18 months only. So I was like, fuck, fuck, fuck. I was like, okay, let's do it. I don't give a fuck. And I always had this idea in mind with this crazy sound system and everything. So it didn't make sense economically at all. But I was like, okay, let's do it. And then there was like the day we were about to sign the contract, I got this call and I was like, this thing is off. And I was like, okay, we were about to sign the contract today. And they were like, no, it's off because it's not our fault. It was at the very beginning or at the peak of this whole refugee thing in Germany and Europe. So the city of Munich took the location to make it a refugee camp. So we couldn't even be sad or mad about it because in this case, you know, it's not like some big corporate company takes it to build some offices there. It was like, okay, it's for refugees. So we couldn't even be sad or mad about it. We're just like, okay, that's a good cause. Let's do this. We can't change it anyway. And then because of this deal, we met another guy who was a partner of this location scout. And he was feeling really sorry and was like, okay, but maybe I can help you with another location, something. Then actually a couple of weeks later, my friend and one of my partners, Sandra. who runs Blitz restaurant mainly, is she lives like next to Deutsche Museum. I actually don't live far away either. And she was like, that's empty. That space is empty for like eight, nine years. It's like a huge building. And it's like there was an IMAX cinema there. And I was like, okay, don't have time for this. the crap and she was like yeah we can ask and i was like come on it's like i don't know it's one of the most prestigious buildings in the city Obviously, it's empty for eight years, but there's no chance we can ever do something in there. And this is how we got the location, actually. It's funny, the roundabout routes that lead you to the final thing. This is most of the time when things happen, they just happen. So the club is underneath the museum, is that right? It's not underneath the museum. The museum is actually a very large building. I think it's definitely not the biggest building in the world. But someone told me it's one of the biggest buildings in the world. It's actually tremendously huge because it goes over, there's a river in Munich, the Isar, and there's an island on that river. But the island is really huge. It's between three bridges, actually. So like just imagine bridges on a river in a city. It's not like every 10 meters. It's like there's like, I don't know, like half a kilometer, like even more in between two bridges. And the whole building of Deutsche Museum goes also, it's on the whole island. So it's also in between three bridges, which is like really, really, really, really huge. And the building where we're at is just a final tiny little part, end part at one bridge. And this was also the part that was empty for eight years because the museum is still operating. It's still open and it's still on the other side. And it's ground floor. It's not underneath. It's all ground floor. Oh, okay. Well, nice. Okay, so you found the space. How do you then connect with the other kind of founding members? Actually, I know most of them for quite a long time. Like Sandra, I know for a really, really long time, the longest actually, because I think she was working. There was a club in Munich called Mandarin Lounge. It was actually my first club residency on a Thursday. It was a really small house club. And I think she was working at the bar. And I was going out clubbing like really early on with like 13 or 14. And it's always funny because I always tell her like that I remember her from that time and she doesn't remember me at all. And she's a bit older than me. And I was like, yeah, you were that cool older girl. And I was that stupid young guy you didn't talk to. But I remember her from back then. And the others I met when I moved back to Munich. And they were running like this kind of like a dance bar, bar, club in between thing. So I was looking for partners. And Brane, who I run the club with, was actually here at the same position at the place in Munich I had at Bob Beeman, like kind of a creative director. It was called Die Registratur. which was a really dope club. And when I moved back to Munich, I met him at a party and we talked about music and I instantly fell in love with him. And he started to book me at this club and support me. And it was actually funny because the first time we met at Registratur, we were sitting at this after hour, talking and talking and talking for ages. And we both remember back then that we both said that they will come, we'll open a club together. Just like after our talk, blah, blah. It actually did happen. They were running a place in Munich called Kong. A little also like... I'd say dance bar more than nightclub, but also like it's something in between, you know, little small club. They were also looking for something to do a new project. And so I started talking to them. Hey, I might. at one point leave Bob Beam and I want to do my own thing, maybe we could work together. Maybe that's a good combination because like, I'm not a gastronomy guy at all. You know, I always, I think it's really important to know what you're good at, but it's way more important to know what you're not good at. And I'm also, there's some things I might even be good at, but I'm not interested in doing it because it's like. I'm like super not a gastronomy guy, if I'm really honest. I really don't care about the gin tonic, where it comes from, how it gets to the bar, where it gets ordered, how you calculate it. But the idea was always to partner it with a restaurant? Not for me 100%. Like I wanted to do a nightclub, but like with this team, the idea to do it with a restaurant was from the beginning because Sander was in there and Sander's mainly into running restaurants. And I think it can be, it's not necessarily a good combination, but I really like Trouw in Amsterdam and I really like the restaurant and I really like the way they did it and how the synergy in between restaurant and the club. I think restaurants and clubs can be a good combination. But you need to be really careful about it, you know, because like a restaurant can also create a super different vibe. So like I think hotels is just might be the worst spaces for doing nightclub set because it like ends up being posh somehow. Sure. Always like just the fact that it's at a hotel. Well, it's like, you know, there's different criteria, you know. For a restaurant, you want things to look nice and you want nice cutlery and glasses and you want the food to look a certain way. But a nightclub... kind of don't want the same things it's like different I agree I mean it's interesting yeah I remember I first went to trial and saw that and I just thought it was mad because in the UK you would never you would never pair a restaurant with a club like just seems like such a like a bizarre combination that's the thing it is it is it can be bizarre and odd so do you really have to be careful because Because you end up like, that's exactly what you said, you know, like things have to look nice and to like, it could kill the vibe of the other space. But Sander was part of the team and like we were looking for spaces that we were always looking for something that could incorporate a restaurant as well. And in terms of the club, I mean, what was your vision? What was the concept? How did it all come together? Oh, that's a hard question. Because like, I think it's always like when people ask you about like, your vision or like the ideas you have, it's like in my own head, it's not so it's not, it's very abstract, you know, it's not so concrete. So I'd say that... I guess it starts when you see the space. It starts when you see the space. But when it comes to a club, I think there's so much more than space, what you have to do. It's one thing. first of all you need to like be sure about what vibe i think vibe and that's the very abstract thing how do you create a vibe what's the vibe you want to have at your space what's the feeling you want to get out of it and this is something i developed over 25 years in nightlife because i went to spaces and i felt uncomfortable and i went to other spaces and i felt really comfortable And I went to spaces and I was dancing my ass off like crazy. And I went to spaces and I didn't dance at all. So this is like all these things came together. And I was thinking about, okay, what do you need to, how do you create a situation or setting that enables the feelings you like or you want to get out of it when you go out partying? I remember I knew the space and there were parties there like 10 years ago or so, but just off parties. I went into the space the first time with Sandra and two of my other partners and I went out like two minutes later. I was like, that's not good for a club. We can't do a club here. It's impossible. I was like, okay, it's done. Next. Next location. It's actually, have you seen a picture of the building? It's this huge building and there's a ground floor. And the entire ground floor was the lobby for the IMAX cinema. And then there's the first floor. Actually, back in the days, this was a very famous concert hall in Munich. There were people like really big bands like Rolling Stones and stuff playing there. and jimi hendrix and stuff on the first floor but the first we could like it was like basically pretty clear from day one that We can't use the first floor because to make it work, to get all the licenses, the money you have to put in because of static reasons and stuff. So it was like a huge amount of money, I think like 25 million or 30 million, just to not like without put anything in it, just to make it work, be able to get the license to use the space. So it was just ground floor only. So the ground floor was kind of the lobby for the cinema. And it's like this huge room full of pillars. Like every three meters, every four meters, there was like this huge pillar. And I was like, I like open spaces, you know, this looks like a labyrinth in here. It's like it's impossible to create a club in here. It's like it's not going to happen. And actually my partners, I was like, I'm pretty emotional and pretty like strict and like upfront, you know, it's like when I feel something, you know, I went in, I wasn't like, maybe, I don't know. I have to think about it. I was like, that's not going to happen. I leave, you know, I don't have time for this. They were like, okay, I don't know. And then actually one of my partners, G-Show, took me aside and David, you have to think about it like Tetris. Think about these rooms. Build rooms inside these rooms in between the pillars, like Tetris bricks. You need to build in between. And I'm a huge fan of Tetris. I played it like crazy. I actually still play it, not so much as I used to. And it made click. And it took like two seconds. I was in there, okay. I was walking around and I was like... Tetris? Wow. I was like, okay, this is one dance floor, this is the other dance floor, this is the bar, this is that. And it all made sense. And I was telling my partners, I was like, listen, maybe we can do this here and that here. And they were like, oh, so yeah, that's a great idea. And this is how I kind of realized what to do with the room. But in the first moment, it didn't click. And then it did. And then in terms of creating this vibe, I mean, what are the things that you need to get right? I think, first of all, you need to define the vibe that's important to you. Because club or nightclub is something that's like a general term. There's so many different clubs. I'm always thinking, obviously, we talk about music clubs. I think the most important thing is that at a nightclub, what happens? There's people going there, listening to music, coming together. I think the best vibe establishes when you set the best framework for this to happen. So people get together, feel comfortable. That's the most important thing, I think. feel free to feel that there's a space where they can do whatever they want with the right crowd I mean there's some things you can't control but there's a lot you can I've actually it's also a funny story I was like I found it so hard to put this into words like when talking to my partners and so I was because I was always And not all of them are so much into like club music or club culture like I am or Brane, my other partner. But I was like, okay, I have to make them understand what I'm about, you know, what's the idea. So I wrote this like, I called it manifesto back then, but it was actually like a university essay, like a 35-page written document about the guidelines of setting up a nightclub. And so, and I actually approached the same way I approached like a thesis, like a bachelor thesis in university. And it was like doing like all my bullet points with the ideas and then putting them into order. And then every night I was sitting down doing one chapter, trying to explain to them how to create this vibe. Basically, that's what it was about. And I think I just said there's so many things you can't control somehow, but I think some things you can't control, like doing bottle service. It definitely defines people by their economic power, by their monetary power. And this divides. It's just a fact, you know. So it's a very simple thing. Put bottle service there, you divide people. No bottle service, everybody's the same, you unite people. So still, this doesn't give you a guarantee that the vibe will be great, but there's like these hundreds and thousands actually of little, little, little things. I think you should think about when thinking about the vibe and also some technical stuff, sound, light, drinks. There was a chapter in this essay, for example, about energy levels. You know, I think energy levels in clubs are really important because you have different spaces, like areas in a club, and the energy level is super different. And if you think about the energy level... you want to have at a space sometimes like different energy levels and competition to each other, like a dance floor, when there's a bar right next to the dance floor, like some places have these like bars like next to the DJ booth or next to the dance floor, but the bar has like... It triggers different things for people at clubs, I think. It triggers like having a drink, hanging out, talking. It doesn't trigger dancing, so it's a different energy level. So try to separate these energy levels. It shouldn't be in competition. It's amazing to have a bar and amazing to talk. You need this in a club. all these spaces have like their unique setting the energy level can for each specific setting can be way higher yeah this is all these like little things i've wrote about in this essay i think no one ever read it like my partner brane always says when he gets asked about it he did like two interviews where he said like oh yeah no one read it only I read it and I'm 100% it's a lie. I'm 100% sure he stated so many times he read it, but I don't believe him. I think I'm the only one who ever read this. So in a way, it was just a way for you to get your thoughts down on paper, literally. It was just for myself. And to be able to communicate better to your partners exactly the little things that you needed. I think, yeah, it was just, first of all, it was like, I'm kind of like, as I said before, I'm overthinking and I have like really fast, like hyperactive style, like super can't sleep at night and my brain is going. all the time so it was really the only way for me to structure my thoughts and to because like it was like I realized okay there's this project coming up and it's really getting serious so you have this idea in mind and the only way to make it work in the right way is to structure your ideas and then you can take care of everything step by step this was basically and to be like really to remind myself of what this whole project is about of what I want to do because a lot in a lot of thoughts were like This was not... Actually, in the end, it was easy, but it wasn't so easy in the beginning. Because I think especially... Not especially with clubs, but when you do a business venture, most of the time, numbers make the call. Sure. But... That's the devil, basically. That's like when you make your decisions by numbers, you know, it can't be good. Like you need to have a great idea and then hope that the numbers will turn out right. For me, that's the only way. But to explain that to someone, this was also one of the reasons to write this down because like a lot of, I wrote a lot about that, hey, put like all economic ideas aside. Just focus on the idea and then maybe in the long run it will work out in some way. That's a difficult pitch to give to people whose primary interest might just be financial. Yeah, it is difficult, but I'm really crazy at convincing. the snake car from Jungle Book, you know, like if I'm really, if I believe in something, I can convince other people to go down that road with me. And musically, where did it fit into the Munich scene at the time? Was there a gap? Was there something you felt that you weren't hearing? Or was it just kind of more of... of what you liked and what you loved. I think there's like such a big history with nightclubs and electronic music in Munich that I'm not sure if there was a huge gap. There was when Bob Beeman opened, there was a gap because there was like no house club. And Bob Beeman was like actually a designated house club, like straight up. There was like, I didn't, we didn't do so much techno in there, like really rare examples. So I'm not so sure if we filled a gap, if there was something missing before. It's hard to say because I don't actually follow so much the other clubs. I didn't follow them in terms of like, what are you doing? Maybe this is missing in the city. like but this accounts to for whatever i do like i just need an idea in my head to know what i want to do and then i don't care about what if someone else is doing the same or whatever So I did, it's hard for me to answer the question in terms of like, I'm not sure if there was a gap, but I had a clear idea. I wanted a nightclub that is like really kind of like, of course, it's like electronic music, dance music, but pretty broad within. Like that there's like all kinds of like, like basically. Everything that interests me and the people who are working at the space, you know. So it's not just house and techno? It's mainly house and techno. I mean, I think we're like, I think there should be much more stuff happening, like off stuff, apart from like the regular. to the floor house house and techno stuff but it's way harder to promote actually sure than i thought when we opened the club i think i thought it would be way easier well i guess having artists for example like ski mask and zenka brothers as residents you know i guess they're house and techno artists but they do especially ski mask you know he does a lot of other stuff his set you can hear all sorts jungle footwork anything really so yeah i guess it's about having those residents that kind of represent a broader broader range oh that's definitely important to the residents and then the people we invite but yeah and how was the reaction from the from the public kind of was it busy straight away did it take a while did it people excited it was it was like Busy straight away for the first two months or so. But we opened right before summer. Like we had great parties from day one, but it was kind of like up and down. We had some parties where it was like rampacked. And then the day after there was like literally like not a lot of people there. Like maybe 100 people, 120 people. So like kind of empty. But I did back then, I did like kind of a lot of mistakes and I had to rethink a lot of things. Also coming like from a space like Bob Beamon was like a 250 capacity living room club, basically like Robert Johnson. And to readjust my thinking to like, I had this idea of the vibe and everything and all energy levels and all this bullshit. I had this all set up in my mind. But then something starts, you know, and you're like, realize, ah, doesn't work that way, you know. So there was a lot of adjusting as you went. A lot of adjusting and a lot of like lessons learned. It's like I don't want to give the picture that it was like bad in the beginning because it wasn't. It was like you could instantly after the first weekend, we looked at each other and was like, okay, this club is insane. Like it's crazy. It's like there's two floors and like I can't remember two floor club in Munich for like, I don't know, 20 years. the sizes and anything and all these rooms you can experience different things and but yeah it was these ups and downs and in the first one and a half years it's like and then we had like did all the construction thing we did like building this club was like we went over budget Basically, it was the first, like, actually real bigger project I did because, like, before I was, like, at Bobbeman, I was just, like, wasn't even employed. I was basically all my life just a DJ, you know. I never did anything else but DJing. So I'm not so much into, like, running companies and these corporate things. It's not so much my world and I'm not so good at it. all my partners were like yeah and even like like my brother was saying that to me you stupid idiot you know you're always over budget that's the rule and I was like I don't know I don't know how this happened we went over budget okay and so we still had to pay like loads of money from that construction time so in the first one and a half years there was some moments where it was like I really couldn't sleep at night I was like okay if this fucks up, you're fucked, you know, you gotta go to some island, you know, you never come back, you know. But it was like, it was a strange feeling because like the reputation or like the feedback we got from day one was like really intense, you know, like everybody like came and was like, okay, this is an insane club and then we got like all this good like. press about it and then like everybody wanted to play there and so it was like a success but we had like a lot of problems so you were relying on the club doing well to to earn enough money so you could then pay off these exactly yeah yeah while running the club yeah exactly that's yeah it's very stressful I was awake for basically one and a half years because I couldn't sleep smoking four packs of cigarettes at night. But it's like having a young child. Yeah. It's like having a baby. It's like, and I have a young child too, actually. She's six now. Wow. Okay. No. Yeah. And then it started like, but I think this is like, I read this, like there's this book by Mel Cheran called My Life in the Paradise Garage. And it's actually, I never knew it. I mean, the Paradise Garage is maybe one of the most famous nightclubs in the history of club culture. There's this chapter where he explains about the opening night of Paradise Garage. And the opening night of Paradise Garage was a huge flop, like a huge, crazy flop. I read this chapter like half a year after we opened and we had this like thing with our opening night. It was kind of a flop too. It was super packed. It was rampant, but it was like we had some like the whole, we had like a shitstorm on social media actually after the opening night. And what happened? We basically. We didn't do so much advertisement for the club. I mean, obviously we talked to people and people knew that there's a club coming and stuff like that. But I was like, okay, let's not do any interviews. Let's just skip it. Let's focus on the club. We don't do anything. We just open. And when we knew what the opening date is going to be, all we did is one Facebook post stating opening night will be the 21st of April 2017. And then I had this idea in mind, actually, because of Oskar, the guy who opened Weekend Club in Berlin. I once went to, I don't think, I don't remember if it was the weekend opening party or the first anniversary, but it was a night with free drinks. And it was a crazy party, obviously. I mean, that's the easiest trick. You know, you give free drinks to people and they're happy. And I was like, let's, and opening nights of spaces are always the worst because it's so stiff and it's no vibes, you know, and it's like, and then you invite also a lot of people who actually are not the people who gonna. tear down the walls at this club. It's like, it's friends you know for 25 years who are not into clubbing anymore. And these are the ones sipping champagne at some bar. And I was like, I hate this. This is not the right image for a nightclub. It's shit if the opening night is like this. So I was like, okay, let's just make a party that's open to everyone. You know, no guest list, no bullshit, no... superficial posh i don't know let's leave all this bullshit aside let's just open doors everybody can come there's no guest list and free drinks but not we are 100% sure to not announce the free drinks because this is the worst thing to do just for the people that are coming they go to the bar they're like one vodka tonic and they're like okay here 10 euros no you don't have to pay it's a good feeling for opening night right All night. All night for everyone. All night. Oh, wow. And when I presented these ideas to my partners, they were like, oh, you're insane, you're insane, insane. I was like, as I said, I'm pretty convincing. And if I believe in something, so like that's the way to do an opening. So, but this story shows that sometimes you're also damn wrong because like, and then this Facebook post when we announced. the opening we said there's no guest list and this is what we do we just open we didn't announce a lineup nothing we were thinking about doing opening the restaurant at a different date but then we're like okay it's one project let's open restaurant and club at the same time so we had this restaurant opening next door planned for like 7 p.m. or something and the club was due to open at midnight and then we had this like restaurant opening before which like it was only by invite you know it was like our parents were there and lots of friends we know for ages and obviously we had some so many people asking about guest list for the party after And we said, we can't do it. We announced no guest list, but some of them were really close friends, but not close enough to be on the restaurant opening. So we were like, okay, how do we do this? And then I realized, fuck, I put us in this situation. It all looked so easy, but it's not so easy anymore. How do you do it? So I was like, okay, let's just, these people who we can't say no to, let's try and get them into the restaurant party before. And then at 12, we opened also the clubs because the restaurant opening was not so big. Let's get these 30, 40 people like a bit later to the restaurant and then it all mixes up in the club. So, I mean, I kind of knew that this will be happening for the city, but I never, ever in my wildest dreams expected this to be that big. there's so much attention on this now, on this. And then the restaurant opened, the vibe at the restaurant opening was like really nice and really laid back. And I was super nervous. And there were so many friends there. And then already at like 9 p.m., like people were coming up to me. It was like, there's loads of people in front of the club. And I'm like, yeah, but we open at midnight. And they were like, there's fuck. fucking loads of people. And I was like, yeah, okay, it's a huge queue, you know, that's nice when you open this, like when you do a party and people come and you're happy about it. And like, so I was smiling, like getting drunk. And like half an hour later, there was like, like my partner coming. I was like, David, there's fucking, there's lots of people in front of the door. And like, I think by 1130 or so, there were like, I think 4,000 people. Wow. Which is way too much. Yeah. And so and these 4000 people, because they came so early, saw people going into the restaurant entrance. These people, you know, we kind of tricked around to get them into the other party because I was like, OK, we have to stick to the no guest list thing. And I told so many people I know, really, there's no joke, there's no guest list. So and they went mad about it, you know, like, but we know each other for so long. And I was like, listen, it's the opening night. You have a lot of time to go to this club all the time. But this is like I was dreaming about a no guest list party. And so I have to say no. And then the people outside were like, I think the vibe got really bad, you know, because they had to queue for so long and the doors didn't open. We said like, because they were there from nine in the evening and we were supposed to open at midnight. And even before we opened the club at midnight. The police came and because like it's a bridge in front of the entrance and there's like trains going over the bridge and it's like a four lane or four lanes or even five lane, five lane street, like a huge street with like lots of cars passing by. And the people were everywhere on the streets. So they blocked the streets so cars couldn't pass by, the trains couldn't pass by. So the fire department came, like there was like lots of police and they were telling us, okay, we have to like control the situation. I was just like in glasses, we're flying around. So they told us, okay, because when the people are in front of the door, the people inside, if there's an emergency or fire, won't be able to go outside anymore. So we can't let anyone in. So before we opened the doors, the police told us, you can't open doors. And we were inside with these 250 or 300 people from the restaurant opening. having the best time and all the people who wanted to party with us were like outside and yeah and then i started i was supposed to play the opening set of the club and i started playing and actually seth roxler was supposed to play after me i started playing the first record and i think yeah after like 10 minutes like my partner borah brannik came in and was like, I don't know, we have an emergency. It's outside the police, blah, blah, blah. And I was like, fuck you. How can you say that? I just started playing a record. You know, you killed my set. How can you tell me that right now? You know, as a partner, you should leave me alone with all bad things now. I need to play music. And then I played the second track. And then I was like, okay, Seth, I can It's like, it's too much bad vibes in my head right now. And I was like going mental, you know, it's like all this good vibes from the early evening turned into like a horror movie, really. And then it took us like two hours until we were allowed to let people in. And yeah. And then we got a shitstorm the day after about faking the guest list thing that we just faked it, that we did the free drinks for like just catching people. And I was like, we just, it was like a crazy story because I just had to. I think I just had the best intentions in mind. People were talking about it as if we were the devils, you know? Yeah. I mean, that must have been incredibly hard to start off like that. Yeah. But this, yeah. And then half a year later, to close our circle again of the story, I read this book again. which I read a couple of years earlier. And there's this chapter about the opening night of Paradise Garage. And I called Brane in the middle of the night, I think at five in the morning. And it's like, he didn't answer. And I called him again and called him again. And he's like... And I was actually smoked a joint before, so I was really into it and like, oh, yeah, it's a story. It's crazy. It's like it's resembling. It's the same story. It's the same story. And I woke him up and I was like, you've got to read this now. You've got to read this. Like I was reading it to him. It's like, that's crazy. And then I was like, we still have a chance. so yeah and at the end it actually took like one and a half years to kind of until the vibe really settled in the way I wanted so So the way the club is now, does it feel like a kind of complete representation of your original vision kind of thing? In terms of space? In terms of like crowd, space, vibe? Everything, the whole club experience. It doesn't. But I think reality never lives up to the ideal. And it shouldn't, actually. It shouldn't. It's good that way. Like I always try to set my goals like really, really high, even if it's like it's really hard sometimes for people that work with me because it's sometimes it's so unrealistic that they're like, OK, David, we can't work with you. It's too crazy. But then I have the feeling that like having these ideas that are sometimes so like the level is so high. that you're like, it's so unrealistic that we will ever get to this point. In reality, you will get a bit closer to that point. And even if it's just a little, little, tiny little bit, it will get you closer to that point than if you wouldn't work that way. And just sometimes these tiny little bits are the ones that count, you know. One thing I wanted to ask about, because... We were talking about Berghain and, you know, it's very representative of Berlin. There's very permissive attitudes towards sex and drugs and partying and kind of freedom. And when I think of Munich, I think of kind of the opposite in many ways. Conservative city, rich, clean. How do you make a great nightclub work in an environment like that? And is it as permissive in that sense? I mean, the club is as permissive in... I think we are as permissive as Berlin, I'd say. We as people running the club in our ideal world, but obviously the legal situation in Munich is way different than in Berlin. So you can't be as permissive in some ways, but... So what kind of ways? I think you just, I mean, the thing is, like, let's start with Munich, because I think that's how you started the question. Munich is like... Munich is very different to Berlin, I think. But let me start in another way. We never, or I never wanted to be Berlin in the first place. And I think no other city is. And I think every city and every nightclub scene, whatever, has this really different, special vibe. And I think the mistake a lot of people do is that they start with Berlin. I mean, obviously, it's maybe the best city in the world for clubbing because regulations are way easier than in other places. It's way easier to run things. You can open clubs for like seven days in a row. So in terms of drug policies, the city is way more open. So to get an idea of Munich, yes, Munich is way more conservative and it's super clean and everything what you just said is super correct. But still Munich is like Bavaria is super, super, super conservative, like hardcore conservative. And Munich is kind of a liberal island in Bavaria. Still 100% way more conservative than Berlin. But then there's like really lots of people in Munich who don't like this so much. So they work on like projects doing things differently. So when you do things in Munich, I exaggerate a bit. At least I have this feeling sometimes when you do something, it still feels a bit like counterculture and not mainstream because you have an ideal, you have a vision, you don't like conservatism so much. I'm not so conservative, I'd say, rather liberal. So you have the feeling that you move things into a new direction and show people there's another way. I know in particular you run this monthly queer fetish party, Cruise. I mean, was that in itself something that you wouldn't normally find in Munich? Something that feels kind of different, aggressive or particularly progressive? I think now they're... of other parties that are also like this for example Herrensauna or like I think they stopped now but they did the night at Rote Sonne but I think the huge difference there is that Herrensauna is a party from Berlin that got exported to Munich and cruises a Munich party it's just my family running a party basically And I think when we started Cruise, it was something new in the city, for sure. I mean, it was something that wasn't there before. But actually, Cruise was actually the blueprint for the club. Actually, Cruise is Blitz and Blitz is Cruise. It's like our signature party. We always say signature party. But maybe the reason is like maybe the club now, we're always joking around that the club should be called Cruise. But I had this idea for Cruise in mind for a long time. I wanted to start this at Port Beeman actually. There was like a guy, like now one of my closest friends. Gio, who was a bouncer at Bob Beeman. And during our time when we worked at Bob Beeman, he outed himself and he had just came up with this new boyfriend he had called Werner, a guy from Belgium. And we like fell in love with each other. It's like hanging out all the time together. We were like, we have to do this party. And we wanted to do it at Bob Beeman. And the owners were not so much into it back then. And also the space didn't allow for it. We couldn't have done it the way we wanted it to be. And then I dropped out of Bob Beeman and I was telling the guys, hey, I think I'm going to open a club. And if we open a club, I want the three of us to throw like the best party ever. And they were like, OK, let's do it. And then I told my partners about this. So like Cruise was there basically from the beginning in the first month. Like we started the club with Cruise basically was there from the first month with its own artwork. Was it also a special feeling for me because like when you run a club, basically you don't throw like there's no own party at the club because usually parties are kind of like external promoters going in. And this is like something like in between because I run the club, but I still have my own party there. And Cruise was kind of taking off from the first... I remember the first Cruise. I was there. I was like, where are these people coming from? This is crazy. I mean, I couldn't have done it without Werner and Gio. They were like, okay, we invite all the people we know. And people were traveling from Athens and from Berlin to support Gio and Werner and me. for this party and I was like, I was in tears basically in the first cruise. I couldn't believe it. I was like, this is exactly, this is the crowd, these are the people. I feel so welcome and so comfortable and like I never felt so good in my own space like at this party. So cruise is like kind of the signature party but it kind of like swapped over to the other nights because These are the people who became friends of the club. This is our family and they come regularly. So this is basically the blueprint of it all. Thank you. you
