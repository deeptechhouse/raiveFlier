Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisors. Considering her level of experience, Ellen Allian is remarkably unchated. She was part of Berlin's techno scene from the beginning, with residencies at Iverk and Tresor, and spent a good chunk of the two decades since then as an international DJ. Along the way, she's watched DJ culture, and Berlin's scene in particular, change immeasurably. Still, it's clear that none of it has lost any allure for her. When Allian talks about music, clubs, and dancing today, it's with the same starry-eyed rapture you imagine she had 20 years ago as a young club kid in Berlin. Will Lynch caught up with Ellen Allian recently ahead of her New Year's Eve gig at Last Night on Earth in London. So how was South America? Yeah, I just came back like 10 days ago or something. Actually it was very, very, very good. This time I played in Argentina and I had two shows just in Brazil and so I wasn't in Mexico, I wasn't in Colombia and the tour was just amazing because all the clubs and... promoters did a very good job. I played for Greenfields in Lima, in Peru. Lima is a very difficult city, I think, how the people live there. contrast of American influences like North America and source. Very industrial. But the festival was just amazing. It was not too big, the right size. And when I started playing, people really arrived and I really seen it, how it's getting more packed and packed and packed and just very beautiful. And you just start and you really can see that people are coming for you. And the people gave me a lot of positive energy, very interesting. And then I played in Chile and Santiago. The promoter did the second independent festival with me playing live. And they made just a small stage for electronic music. And last year they had like, I don't know, 100 people on the stage. And this year... like a thousand people. And very good people because I played with some teachers from Chile, Matias Aguayo and some others. And so they brought a very intense crowd, really like the music lovers from Chile. And it was amazing. It was open air, a bit cold, actually. And then I took a plane to Argentina, Mendoza. It's just you fly over the mountains, the Anden. Beautiful view. And I played one open air based actually in Olive. tree or how you say that um an olive grove yes exactly and um private um country from the father who's producing um olive oil And it felt like a private party with 1,500 people, completely in love to dance and nice groups together, talking, drinking, having fun. So it was just so beautiful. I didn't expect that. It was, I think, one of the best events I had in South America because it was very in-team. The stage was built so beautiful because the guy who's running this is the architect. So everything was just beautiful and very well done. So very professional. And then I played in some other cities and yeah, everything was great. I really like that the people, they are mixed like between young people, gay people, and they love just to dance. I feel the socialism while playing because people talk a lot, you know, they dance together. It's a very warm community in South America. On the other hand, I played some other festivals in South America where everything is based more on very commercial music like Tiesto. David Guetta and all that stuff. And they promote a lot all these big artists to make money, of course. They need to do that. but they don't promote us. So I've seen many times also our floors not so full, but they're working on this. So there's a big communication. Starts now that they make radio shows with our music talking about us. But if it's about producing big festivals, they mostly promote the big artists. Of course, they spend a lot of money. But I think it's very important to promote the underground scene in the right way. And I think this starts now. What kind of people do you think know about the underground artists in South America? Who shows up to your stage? What kind of people are they? I mean, there's the Edge Club from Monato run. He's running a certain writing since years, like underground teachers, like every week, like they make three nights or four nights, like trying music. What kind of people? People that are just... to dance and electronic music and they are from South America. They're not from, they're South Americans, like they're also, I think, people from other countries living there, working there, but mostly South American people. You played a war room, right? I played Warung, yeah. It was a birthday party, I think, how many years? Like 15 years, 12 years? It's quite, I think, 15th birthday or 10th. With Sestrok, Sorgagabr and Solomon on the other floor and some others. Yeah, it's beautiful. It's like a big part 25, I would say. Everything... built wooden built you know very warm from the sound and half open air just roofs it's a beautiful club in front of the beach yeah it's nice I would say it's as a crowd is very mixed they come from everywhere because they do a lot of promotion so it's it wasn't so easy for me to catch the vibe of the music like bringing them together so I had to work quite hard to understand what's going on and I felt it's not like a community from there They really arrive from everywhere, which is amazing, you know, because Varung, it's a brand. But for a DJ, to catch the vibe for everybody in the room. It's trickier. It's trickier, which is a challenge for me as a DJ. Of course, it's interesting because in this way, I'm trying to connect with the people and I work on this. And it's like, it's a game in a way. It's a ping pong game of the music I choose and how I can feel it if I can feel the room. And that night it was really like. because I felt like the crowds are coming from different genres, different cities. They like different music. Some people like maybe more vocals. The others are coming to hear hard techno, whatever. I think because it was also our birthday party. party and others other days they just maybe come for one dj and expect you to play that where you playing so the fact that it's um a kind of trickier to play for a diverse crowd like that um rather than just like the locals or whatever um do you ever feel that way playing in berlin these days oh no Not at all. When I'm playing ball and I'm just playing what I'm playing. If I play panorama, I collect a special set because I know I can play all my old records, my old music, mixing it up with like special tunes. going very into my sound because I know the people understand. In Berlin, it's like, if I play panorama, it's of course really a house set. more based on old school electro and some B-pitch stuff between. And if I go playing maybe in big clubs like Link Bologna, I did an eight-hour set. I can play everything, you know, and I make just maybe two hours like hard techno before I build up this house. And then I build up the night. I mean, I'm playing waves. So I have the possibility to take many, many different styles. And I choose just how I feel and how I feel in the room. Do you say waves, like wave files? Wave files, yeah. I'm not playing records anymore since... I don't know how many years, five years maybe, because I had so many problems with playing records. They didn't arrive and I couldn't take them because I had to take many. If you play professional, you have to take many records. to switch, you know. And many times they didn't arrive. And from those turned hair words, they're not tight anymore. I mean, they don't produce them anymore. They're not tight when you mix. And then I had to change. Like, technically I had to change. It was hard the first times. On the first six months, it was really not easy. And now it's amazing because I can loop, I can make more things, you know. It's tight. If I mix it in, it stays static. And since then, I would say my DJ sets are also better because if I have technical problems. I start getting confused, unsure. My concentration is not based on what I'm choosing, what kind of track. I just have to figure out what's going on here. And sometimes it's like 30 minutes of your set. And this wasn't. possible for me anymore and now it's so static and so amazing and also I digitalize all my old records and bring them back and I can organize them so well on my hard drive it's amazing what kind of process I also made in my dj sets they're much better I checked all my old dj sets It wasn't okay, you know, there was okay, but sometimes the mistakes, it sounds like weird, you know, like, okay, there's a mistake. And now these days, if you make a mistake in the past, it was not a mistake in the club. Now, if something is not perfect, because all the young people are used to tractor DJs, like a perfect mix, it's a mistake. Then people talk about, yeah, she can't mix. or whatever, you know, in the past wasn't like this, if you made a mistake, it's because everybody knew something happened with record or, um, also in the past we made, much harder you know like offbeat and beat matching in a very strange way mixing outside not on the headphone you know in the past i put just record in and then i mix it outside it was floating inside not right and then i mixed it people could listen how i mix it better Yeah. Pitching was right. Why do you think that is? Like, is it just, there used to be more of a understanding that like, this is a party and I know you're going to take chances and not everything's going to be perfect or like now people see it as more of a performance or something like that. Or, you know, why do you think people kind of got more judgmental about stuff like mixing skills? I think the communication of music is so huge. Like on YouTube, you can watch DJs and everybody has very trained ears. And these days, everybody wants to be perfect. to be like you want to see the person, the artist. I think the people, I don't know, it's different. You have different people. Some people understand the person behind the personality and enjoying the personality, the excitement. And some people just nerdy. watching the skills or discussing about how you played. I mean, I'm doing the same. If I'm going out and I don't like the music so much, of course I will say or I will sing or I don't like the music so much. Also... okay if the people discuss about this because it's an intellectual discussion about music in another way you know you can say what you like what not if you like the skills or not because there are so many different skills there are so many different formats how you can play different technologies so there is a discussion And it's also good because in this way the people choose and pick up what they like or not. And not following only marketing or whatever. Of course, marketing is a big point now, how to brainwash people with who you're working, who's presenting you or whatever. this is getting bigger and bigger and bigger, which manipulate the people, but it's a part of it. What do you mean exactly about the marketing thing? Like what form does that take exactly in DJ world? The thing, yeah, big DJs just buying many advertisements or whatever they do to get bigger. buying likes on Facebook, pretending to be bigger than they are or pretending having amazing ideas or concepts. But it's not so based on concepts. It's more based on logos, marketing, branding, which is OK because in this way you can fill with clubs fast. It's about fast making money, especially Ibiza, for example. You have only two months to make money. So they need that kind of tools to bring the people. Whatever. So it's kind of like a necessary evil in some cases. No, it makes sense. I mean, for some people it makes sense. It's up to you what you want to do, you know, how you see your future, how you see your artist life, how you see your marketing plans, your business plans. So behind the music are business plans. For some, not. For some, it's the artist's life. They like to make music. They need to be excited what they're doing. They choose the right people they want to work with, not the people that bring them money or whatever. Every artist is different, which is nice. So you have different ways and just keep actually also the same. seen very very healthy discussions about music different ideas different clubs different music different characters yeah it's full of different ideas do you feel like you've been lucky to have sort of a strong personal brand over the years. I mean, the fact, you know, like your name has always sort of been strong on, on flyers and lineups and everything. I mean, I'm doing what I'm doing and. if it wouldn't be strong, it is not strong. So, um, what was the question? If I'm what? Well, just, you know, um, you're sort of talking about how, um, some DJs have to work to sort of market themselves and everything, but, um, it seems to me like you've kind of always had a sort of like a natural, um, personal brand. Like Ellen Ollian has always kind of, um, meant something to people, you know? I mean, I start back in the days. I'm, I would say, sir, I'm the third or second generation from, from all this electronic DJs. I think I'm the third generation. So, um, Everything I did, I did very naturally. I'm on a red line. You can see my bio or whatever. And yeah, and I'm here. I don't know, I can't give you the answer to this question. Because I'm just doing what I have to do as a woman, as a Berlin girl, or whatever. I think why I'm still here is because I love so much what I'm doing. without getting nervous for things or hectic or I'm not afraid of anything. I'm just sharing music in the club how I want to do it. And I'm going in the studio when I want to go in the studio. And I think people feel that I'm completely behind in what I'm doing, completely passionate. And I think until I have the passion, until people can exchange this passion with me, we can celebrate as long as I will be there on lineups. I think when I start having not as passion and people don't feel it anymore and promoters, I'm out. And I would say before... if I wouldn't feel it anymore I would stop with doing something else where I feel the passion I'm a very passionate person with everything I'm doing doesn't matter if I eat or meeting friends or making music or running my label company or a booking agency or whatever, doing a flyer or artwork, everything is with full blood and passion. And if it would grow my passion in another direction, art direction, paintings, making movies or whatever, then I would do it. Do you ever feel nostalgic? About what? Well, I guess, you know, kind of how you were just saying that. sort of an important thing for you is that you've always remained very passionate about what you're doing. But I feel like another important... sort of perspective to have is to not feel like um things are so different now from they were before things aren't as good anymore whatever which i think is sort of a common thing to hear from people that have been at it for a while um but it doesn't seem like you really um you know uh miss like the old days too much the old days in berlin or you know djing in general i mean I'm born here, my family is from Berlin, so I really seen everything from the beginning, yeah. And I would say now everything is... So amazing how many people are moving to Berlin, falling in love with Berlin, finding free space. In the past, the club scene was, of course, also a big love parade, but very commercial. in a way and a lot of underground Tresor of course either Planet and all these little clubs yeah they did a great job but some clubs I had really problems to fill the clubs. Some clubs were really full and no tourists. And after some years, the scene started getting a bit tired of the music, of the club scene. And some martial arts getting in the charts and all those things. And then the dream of underground died a little bit in the head of us. And as more tourists came, as more new energy, I could feel in the clubs. And the clubs started getting more full again. And new clubs opened and like Berka in Panorama Bar, based on the gay scene, worked strongly, heartily to keep the underground. And they brought all the people here. They made Berlin very interesting for underground again. And I would say the best club nights is very good music I have here in Berlin. again and that's why I can't cry about the past or whatever I love also seeing things change there are some positive aspects and some negative aspects always I mean we don't have war we don't have any diseases or whatever or big problems here in Berlin you know everything is growing in a very healthy way I would say if you're talking about capitalism yeah takes time it doesn't Of course, it's getting more expensive. There's not so much free space anymore. Do you ever feel concerned about kind of the way things are going in Berlin? Or do you think it might, you know, eventually lose some of its sort of special personality with, you know, rents going up and all the expatriates coming in and stuff like that? I would say the artist world is very important for Berlin. And as long artists are moving here, as long Berlin will be interesting. They can't come if it's getting too expensive, if all the flats are sold and nobody's living inside because they just buy and then they leave Berlin to just keep it running for later to sell it or whatever. Some rich people, like in Tel Aviv, for example, many people bought flats and they're not living there anymore. It's sometimes empty, you know, the city. And as long as people are moving here, bringing good ideas and creativity, as long as Berlin will be nice. And I think for the next 20 years, I mean, Berlin was always a city like that in the 20s. And so I don't think so it will change so much. And also, I mean, all the restaurants are open. here, you know, or the people coming here to open restaurants or shops, whatever, they are really important coming here. It's better than a restaurant that will open here from a guy from Florence, Firenze, or from Italy than maybe a Burger King or Mango or H&M and all this shit, or Mango. Yeah, I have the feeling that many people will move here to open little shops or trying to run their own business because there'll be crisis in Italy, in Spain. The tax is getting crazy in Italy, so many people will move and will try to find other basis where the taxes are better. At the moment, the taxes in Berlin are very, they make sense, you know, but not in other cities. It's impossible to run a small business for many people. And so I think that many people come here with new ideas. Let's see how it will change. I think it's good. come trying something move away whatever trying many people move anyway everywhere many people from Berlin move somewhere else you know so since our European communities arrived many people move all the time but for you that's just overall healthy thing like you're happy to see it happen I think it's healthy some people may be lost because they don't know where their home But they will find their home one day. And if Greek people can come here to work, if they find work, it's fantastic. I always had this impression that Berlin was really, really special to you. Back in the States, when I... first heard the albums like Berlinette and, um, shot kind and everything. Um, it felt like a, sort of like a postcard from Berlin's, you know, techno scene and everything. Um, of course I'm, I'm born here. I seen the wall came down and there's a big, all these processes are very inside of my head. And, um, It was a very big political, social process to bring the East and West together. And back in the days, I played a lot in the East, so I've seen all the provinces in the East. I listened to many West German people, what they said, and politic-wise, I've seen how strange people can be, not understanding the very important social process, just crying because something changes and everybody has to hold in this moment together and work on this and not thinking about just their own. bank account. For me, Germany is one country. That's why I pay my taxes also here. Because the country I'm born helped me a lot. when I was a child, trying to find myself. And Germany is helping young people. If you don't know what to do, you can go to the Arbeitsamt, trying to find a job or whatever. They help you. And I would say I'm behind my country, you know, and that's why I still have my business here. because I trust in Germany and the way I grew up here. And it's in my music also, in a way. Hope. Yeah. And Stadtkind is just a story of myself. how I could respect my lifestyle. Before, I wasn't always sure, oh, I'm a DJ, oh my God, I go. After Globus, I did the night with Tanit at Tresor, Globus, the house floor, every Sunday. the rest and I remember when we came out like Monday morning at 10 or 11 and other people just we'd seen them just going to work and I felt so bad going in bed many years for many years and Stadtkind actually I I did tracks just To show the people now I respect my lifestyle. And I'm a part of it. I'm part of Berlin because I pay my taxes. The music is sprouting everywhere now in Europe or in the world. And there's a music community in a way. And I understood it's art. It's not just taking drugs, you know, playing some records in the club, getting crazy. And Bellinet was just a little... a joke because after Stadtkünft everybody asked me about Berlin and then the first years I didn't understand what's going on and then I said fuck there's a Berlin hype now and I'm the one who has to talk about it okay here you have your belly net And then I understood, okay, everybody's interested now in having a story about Berlin and what's going on. And then the hype started, the fame. first the Berlin fame and then the Berghain fame and in some years maybe some I don't know what kind of fames yeah I mean it was really interesting because of course when you start talking about Berlin In America, you have always different questions and in Paris and France. It was also very interesting to talk about it because I wasn't talking about it. with Berlina and then I analyzed my life actually and the Berlin story again and then I came very into this in the story and I felt all the history back you know how I grew up what happened and and that's why it's a big story for me cause burn because my past is a past of many people from the east west how we came to how we moved everything here how we worked very hard on this every day to move it yeah um there wasn't any big clubs who pushed you or whatever you pushed you pushed everybody pushed in this moment to to transport the music and the feelings in the world I thought it was kind of interesting what you said about Stoutkin, that you is sort of like you had to, even though you loved this lifestyle in a way, you sort of had to find respect for it. Exactly. because these days when I start teaching at first I'm a woman my family wasn't so happy when when they understood she's really into it and she won't go out so yeah and I had to respect this is my life now and I will work every day on this, going in studios with producers and running my record company as good I can. It was a decision, main decision of my life, for my life. These days it's easy to take this decision because you see other artists, they are successful, they can live out of it. But I didn't know that, that I can, I had not much money all the time, you know, because the fees wasn't so fantastic. Taxes, not so easy to deal with. And yeah, it was a big process. It just seems like it's something a lot of people face in this DJ world and club world is learning to see the whole thing, not as a big party, but as actually... something like a career um even if it's not work yeah they're really focused on the career and they make everything to to uh grow fast um which is fine it's good you can use all those tools it's also very interesting um for the crowd you know see new talents and wonder childs or whatever wonder wonder talent wonder girls or um it's very important also because and that's where it keeps interest and it's exciting also for me to see that somebody is having this power to say okay I make amazing music now my DJ sets has to be the bomb or It's very important that the people also can watch that and enjoy it. To see something fast growing and to get maybe every three months a record out from this person, which every record is maybe good or bad or whatever. It's more exciting than you see somebody doing nothing and being bored behind the DJ desk. And I think this is great if an artist has an idea or concept behind a future plan. It's more safe for the person and interesting to watch from people outside. Then you have to just, I think it's not easy for this person because it's a lot of pressure. Stress, it's stress also. But there are so many good artists that can live their plans and their concepts, like Nicolas Jarre, for example, or also Moderat. you know, like when they play they have the plans, okay we make some moderate album, then we go on tour for two years and then we do Mozelec to Rapa Rat band again. So it's amazing that it's so professional now that you can concentrate really also on your plans and intellectually. If you have the background, like booking agencies, you know, or other booking agencies in other countries, you can focus really on your work or on the music, which is a very luxury life for artists these days. And this wasn't there in the past, you know, we just built up. in the last 20 years. So what was it like before, like just play loads of gigs and just see what happens? Exactly. Just playing and seeing what's going on. And then you have maybe clubs, they invite you regularly, like twice a year or three times. I was just playing, finding the records, fighting for the records. I think it was based on the record addiction, like getting the right record and finding them somewhere in the world. I felt like that every time I went to different cities. had to go to sonic rock in new york or some record store to find the record which i wanted to have and um said no we don't have i said oh let me go on the in the back back cellar please in the cellar maybe you want to go on the cellar you want to go on i say yeah did you ever find it in the cellar many times How was, did record store culture feel different back then? Did record store culture feel different back then? Record culture. Yeah, yeah. Like the atmosphere in record stores. Like I've heard that back in the day, it used to be a little bit more elitist or something. you know, the record stores would hold onto things for their friends or for big DJs and it could be intimidating to go in there as a new person or as a girl. Actually, you learn a lot if you... I mean, the record shop has a selection, so it's easier to find a specific sound of the record shop. You arrive in the record shop and then you have the specific sound of the record shop, which is a nice filter. But I'm very enjoying to build my own filters. And in this way, I can find just different styles, you know. And for me, it's more interesting to buy an internet because I have more possibilities. And of course, it's nice to talk with a record seller. And when they show you some records, you can hear the record loud. And then Ricardo Villalobos arrives or some big artists. Or even small artists and you talk with them. Some maybe send you a demo or whatever. Or you have a coffee after and eating a cake. It's kind of social communication based record store. But in terms of... being concentrated to pick up the right record you really want and not buying the wrong one while you're talking with another artist. I think for me, it's better to buy With my headphones in my house or in hotel rooms, putting them in a basket, listen again and again, and I really filter what I buy. And I would say my selection is now very controlled by myself, which is for me very amazing. And yeah, I mean. And most of the records are like clone hierarchs or others. They have also a section of digital shop. I buy my music in different web shops. So yeah, not only one shop. Takes more time. But I get so many information from new artists, you know, new labels. which is my passion, you know. I can do that like every night, like for eight hours, like three times each week. I'm searching for music and it's endless, which I love. It's like the sky, you know. We don't know how many stars there are. And it's the same if you start buying very, very, very complex digital. It's not about only buying digital. It's also what kind of information are you filtering, like news, daily news from art, fashion or news, political news. You just have to put the filter right on and then you switch into a world which is just endless and amazing. I feel like that's a skill you built up as you got older or something, like building your own filters instead of relying on other people's. It's limited. Yeah, and it takes more time if you have to go to different record shops. Of course, if a record shop is filtering already, it's just thanks to them, you know, you have less work in a way. And you follow a specific... sound which is easier much easier I would say a DJ which is buying some records in specific record stores it's not their own style they are really they should bring every day a cake to the record seller or whatever saying thank you because it's also a lot of work for them and I mean, how I said, Boomcat, Hardwax, Clone, the filter, Dex or whatever. thanks to them thank you I have big respect very big respect and I know all those people and they're very nerdy and they know what they what they are doing you know and they're very important that they're here if they wouldn't be here anymore many people would be lost and many people wouldn't play so good music or that kind of music do you still get excited about uh like getting great new tracks um the way you did you know back in the day like do you still get kind of like giddy um about having like a really really strong track to play i mean teaching is a kind of addiction because every time i'm playing and um If I have a good hand for the night and you have this euphoria in the club. My hormones, of course, getting crazy, like also the people on the dance floor. And so mostly I'm going very happy home. And it holds like today is Tuesday. Yesterday I still felt it. Today I'm coming down a bit. So my concentration is a bit less, but it really makes me so happy. And just mixing music I love so much and moving people so much, you know, and making people happy. This is addiction. That's why people go also in the club, because it's addiction to dance, on the music, drinking, relaxing, meeting nice people, feeling sexy or whatever. And I feel sexy in the club, you know, when I arrive at the club. And I start dancing, I feel my body, and then I start sweating while I'm playing. When I start getting sweaty, I'm really into it, you know, then I mix like crazy. And also the people's getting hot, you know, and all those feelings, they're so, it's really amazing. It's my addiction. It's not logically coming from my head. oh, this track, is it amazing, like in the past or whatever. It's not my concept, you know. It's just filtering the best music I can filter. It's also a thing of how much time I have, capacity, to have the filter on. just up to me and what is going on in the club is just euphoria and very full of passion and craziness freakiness and that's what I like freaks freaky moments Do you still get a lot of freaky moments like in the gigs you play these days? All the time. All the time. Because I'm very static as a person or the way I, how I play now. So I'm, I feel like connected with the people and I think the people there. They're coming to my parties. They know that. And that's why they are there since years. And they really come for me, you know, or to have those moments, to have those feelings. And my fans, they know what's going on. Yeah, I just feel like, you know, if you kind of had... It's a big crowd, you know, it's not like a fame crowd or whatever. It's like... Yeah, it's like you have a lot of fans, but it's kind of like an intimate group. Very intimate, yeah. I was just thinking if you got your, you know, if you're kind of first really special memories with the whole experience of DJing and being in clubs was places like Evoke and the original Trezor and everything. I feel like it must sometimes feel funny or something to play something like, um, cream fields in Peru or, um, you know, clubs in Ibiza or, um, like, does it ever feel like it's just crazy how, um, how different the atmosphere is at some of these things you're playing now from what it was back then? I would say the people these days switching into our world, it's not very different from, from what they feel, how they see it. Because many people arrive, like just maybe listen before, like other stuff, pop music or. hip-hop. After your teenage, you start going to clubs. First, they don't let you in. My nephew is 18, and they don't let him in watergate. So he doesn't have this experience. He knows I'm playing Panorama of Oregon, but he never could go there. I'm also a little bit afraid to take him. He never asks me if he asks me. Of course, I take him. But first he has to ask me. And I think they have the same experience like us back in the days. And because I see the people on the dance floor, how they smile, getting lost with the sound or into it. And for me, if I... I feel the same like back in the days. Nothing changed. because the music gives me the same body feeling and brain kick. And of course the atmosphere in the past was basically more the people. Now it's more commercial, more normal people. They know about our club scene. So they arrive and then they take maybe the beer and standing on the bar, watching. But in the past it was the same. Until the people could dance and switching to the music, it took a while. They had to come maybe 10 times. the first drug or whatever and I would say it's not the same I would say for me it's now more interesting because I travel around the world and playing for different for small clubs big clubs festivals different countries much more interesting because to understand how I can push the night with what kind of sound and in every country people have different feelings so this is much more interesting as a DJ for me now than playing as a resident at clubs the rest are globals and e-work of course I learned there a lot and I've seen many many things But now it's more interesting because I see the world and I play in different clubs. Also, I work with different people. And also, we sign different people on Beeperch from different countries. And we have different tools we are working with. Plans or whatever. It's much more... Also, the changes about how you play, what kind of... formats we can sell changes all the time so it keeps it more interesting
