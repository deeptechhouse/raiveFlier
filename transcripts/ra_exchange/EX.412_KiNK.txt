Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Kink. Growing up in Sofia, Bulgaria, Strahil Velchev became obsessed with dance music at the turn of the 90s, scoring his fix through a mix of radio and pirated cassettes. By the late 90s, he was making music at work and on friends' computers, though it wasn't until 2005 that a label finally agreed to release his tracks. In the nearly 15 years since, he's put out countless EPs and two albums, most recently the excellent Playground on Running Back, while his world-conquering live show still continues to push the boundaries of electronic music performance. Velchev discussed all this and more with Carlos Hawthorne when they shared the stage at the recent edition of Belfast's AVA Festival. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Kink is up next. You had your sound check last night. First impressions of the venue? Most of these people won't have seen it before. What did you think? It's pretty impressive. I mean, when I arrived yesterday, the crew was still working on the... on the visual side of it, but it's really impressive already. There are four areas. I'm going to have the chance to play the main stage and everybody's going to be surprised that we have something little we are getting ready for today. I don't want to reveal what it's going to be, but that's one of the reasons I had to come yesterday and practice a little bit. So please come over tonight and let's... Let's go for the best. You know, you have obviously quite an extensive live setup. Is sound checking something you try to do before every gig? I try as much as possible, but sometimes it's not possible to do it because when I do festivals, I arrive in the country when the event is already running. So I just have to show up. set up and play and it's quite difficult because I try not to fiddle around too much with my gear when the previous artist is playing so I give myself maybe 10 minutes before the start of my set. and many things can go wrong, but yeah, it's a surprise. Sometimes a defect can be an effect. That's what we say in Bulgaria. From the very few times I've DJed, I know that every time I'd go there, something would go wrong. You couldn't imagine it, but there'd be something, you know, just wouldn't be working. I imagine in your case, that must happen a stressful amount of times. Many things can go wrong and it happens maybe in three gigs, one time everything is perfect. But we do dance music, I guess. If you have a kick drum, a bit of a bass line, and maybe another percussive element like a hi-hat once in a while, that's enough. It's enough to keep me going. And I guess it's the same for the people who come to dance. Yeah, because kind of imperfection is actually a part of your act. Like you like that live, raw, random, spontaneous feel. Yeah, I get inspired by the situation. So if something goes wrong, when something goes wrong, I try to use it as an advantage. I remember a couple of years ago seeing Jeff Mills playing and he's quite crazy using a couple of decks and a drum machine. So at some point one of his mixes was going wrong. Both beats were not completely glued together. So he, instead of fixing the mix, he left the beats going even wrong further and further. And that's how somehow he created a new beat out of it. So I quite love that. Do you sometimes make mistakes on purpose, like do things like that? No, never in purpose. But sometimes I can do something extreme which would look like a mistake. And like completely stopping the music. Which I shouldn't suppose to do in a club, in a dance music environment. But contrast is fun. I mean, how improvised is it? I mean, I guess, obviously, you play live a lot. Do you go in with an idea of the start is sorted? How does it work in that respect? I used to be a DJ before I became a live act. Most of my life I've been into dance music. So my inspiration comes from people who play records, not that much from bands. I think as a DJ, I guess most of the experienced DJs out there know that it's good to have a couple of tunes ahead in your mind. I guess that's what I do with my live set. I don't have any sort of prearranged track list, but I have in mind a couple of potential combinations I can do if I don't have any ideas. And most of the times I just try to improvise. I try to look at the crowd. I give them what they want when I feel it's the time. And then I like to stress them once in a while and surprise them. Myself too. Yeah, I mean, you famously put on a real show. I mean, you have such an arsenal of amazing tracks at your disposal. You could have just created a more simple live set, just you and a computer, like many brilliant artists do. Why do the bigger thing? Why complicate things for yourself in this way? It's a good question. Actually, what I try to do is something very simple. When I moved from DJing to playing my music live, okay, the regular way of doing it is having your tracks on stems and somehow mixing your parts live. doing something like a concert, but for me it was very difficult to remember my own compositions. I'm not a real musician, I'm an engineer in the studio and I used to be a DJ and for me it was difficult to count bars and to try to remember what I have to do in certain compositions, so I thought I have to simplify it, so I don't think during performance, I just perform. So the way I do it is more like DJing with loops and then playing live on top of that. So as much as my system looks complicated, actually it's very simple. It's just dropping randomly some pre-recorded loops I have and then just playing keys and drums on top. And it's very spontaneous. I don't think about it. So it's quite simple. In terms of the kind of showman aspect, is that something that you've got better at over the years? Is it something you've kind of cultivated? Yeah, I found that it's very important to translate to the people what you do. Because in the beginning, when I was performing my music live... After the show I used to get reactions like "Wow, that was an amazing DJ set" and I mean that's still a compliment but for me it was very important to tell the people this is my own music. A lot of the parts, a lot of the melodies and rhythms I do, I do them right here in front of you. So a couple of years ago I was playing before my friend Mark Romboy, Systematic Records, and he was using this computer DJ setup and he had this little controller for the software Traktor. So this controller, it was connected to some sort of delay effect, some effect. And Mark is a tall guy, so he was standing up, he picked up this controller, and he was just modulating the sound, and people went crazy because... I mean, he was animating the crowd somehow, but at the same time he was actually processing the sound. And that was a direct translation of what he was doing. And I thought, yes, I can do that. I've always been very shy to be on stage and trying to pose and trying to move my hands for no reason. But after I saw Mark doing it, still interacting with the people, but while doing something, I thought, yes, I love it, I can do that. And since then, I try to pick up some machines I have. show what I do. Sometimes I bring the machines to the crowd and I let the people actually do sound, touch my machines and maybe 40% of the times it works. And it's amazing. Interesting because you have described yourself as a shy guy in real life. What is the kind of physical transformation when you come on stage? How do you feel? Do you feel like a different person? I think I became a different person. Also, I kind of overcome my problem talking to the people. I'm here already talking for a couple of minutes and my voice is still here. I love to dance since I was a very little kid. So the moment I hear music I like, I just forget about anything that stops me to have a good time. I love to make my music and when I'm in the venue, in the club, in front of the crowds, when I look at the people, I look at them as my friends, as just like-minded people. We are in this basement or a venue and we just jam together. That's how I see it. So when I'm in such a situation, I don't feel any... I'm not shy anymore. Can you remember your first live set? I will never forget it. I live in Bulgaria, in Sofia. So in 2002, there was this event. It's called Electronic Music Festival. And they, the organizers... They wanted to have me and my DJ crew, but they said, we are interested in local life acts only, we don't want to have DJs. So me and my friends, we went there, we brought two computers, we got old school computers with big deep screens, if you remember. was running a very early version of Ableton Live, probably the first version. That was the year 2002. The other computer was running early version of Native Instruments Reactor, which I intended to use as a effects processor for a hardware synth for a keyboard I brought. And the plan was amazing. We play Ableton Live from one computer, and we have... This is German analog synthesizer running through reactor from the other computer. But in reality, nothing worked. So we had a couple of thousand people waiting for us. There was no sound out of Ableton coming. And I had this pre-recorded mix with my music, which I played from a second computer from a software media player called Winamp. Maybe some of you remember. And yeah, I realized it's a live situation, the show must go on. So I started to pretend I'm playing live with a synthesizer I had. But it seems maybe I have a talent being on stage. So it seems I've been very convincing doing what I do. And something I have to mention, at that time, we used to have this TV show called Techno. It was... broadcasted every Saturday prime time on the national television. So when I was pretending playing with the synthesizer, I saw a camera, I saw the video crew from Techno, they come towards me and they start to film what I'm doing. So I thought, right, I have to be even more convincing. They came really close behind me. So I thought I'm gonna open this reactor software. It's really obscure modulus Software synthesizer. I thought I'm gonna open it on the screen and it looks very complicated. They're not gonna know what I'm doing So I started pretending I'm modulating the patch in the software. They filmed everything and After two minutes, I realized wow, this mouse is not even connected to that computer So, thank you. So, this one was on the television. But of course, they cut up the video. It looked amazing. And the conclusion was, it's not scary to be on stage. As I say, you have like-minded people in front of you. Also, what I learned for myself, you know, when you start from a very early point, you cannot really go lower. So it gave me such a big confidence to go on. That was my first live set. The only way is up. I'm curious about Sofia and Bulgaria. I mean, what was it like growing up there? Bulgaria used to be a communist country till 1989. There was not so much... information coming from the West till that time. Till 1989 we used to have the same few types of food in the shops, we used to dress the same way, we used to have grapefruits only around the New Year's time. We used to be hungry for a Western culture. When the system changed and we became a democratic country, the borders opened. Yeah, we were hungry for anything that comes from the West. And one of those things was the dance music. It was techno and house. So in the very early 90s, for me, first of all, it was the radio shows and it was those pirate cassette compilations you can find on the streets. There was no big market for records. It was too expensive for us. We were in the economical crisis at that time. But on the street you can find those tapes with a variety of electronic music. You could listen to it on the radio. And then towards 1993, 1994, we started to have these big raves. The promoters used to book totally unknown but very good DJs from Europe. And you can easily have 5, 6, 10,000 people in the room. And the people haven't got any information. They didn't know what is dub tech, nor they didn't know what is ambient or jungle drum base. They would just go there completely open. to discover something new, new music, new fashion. And that was a quite amazing start. It was very inspiring for me to be part of it, just as a listener. And did you have a crew of friends who were into the same thing as you? Was it an individual pursuit? I had music friends in the 90s, but for them it was something temporary. As much as this music, as much as this movement came very strong in the 90s, it came, it left as fast as it came because it was not a long way of building tradition. We haven't got tradition in electronic music. So I think in the early 2000s everything went down. And then it was when I met my music friends, late 90s but also early 2000s. And in the year 2000, me and three of my friends, we made a DJ crew together. And that's how we started to expand. exploring, learning how to play in venues, learning how to make music in a very limited situation, just with a very slow computer, small media speakers, and so on. It was a slow start. There's a bit of an Eastern European boom at the moment. Cities like Tbilisi and Kiev are doing well. I mean, what's stopping Sofia from becoming one of those cities? We have a great potential because the law is very liberal. I'm not extremely familiar with the type of licenses over there, but as long as I know, as long as I've played to a lot of clubs in Bulgaria, you can have the club open for, you know, as long as you want, 24, 48 hours. We are pretty easy with the drinking restrictions. There are no restrictions for alcohol. Why the electronic music scene is not that big, I don't have the answer, but it was big and it will be big again, for sure. You still live there, you've always lived there throughout your career. Was a part of that to try and build something there? At some point, yes. In the period of 2000s, me and my friends, our DJ crew is called Porno BPM for some strange reason. We played. The thing is, I was from a techno background, moved to house. One of our... friends, his artist name is Zeng, he was into breakbeats. My very good friend, Konstantin Petrov, he showed me how to make music in the late 90s. He is into rather deep house sound, always on the deeper side. And another guy, his name is Sub. He was playing house music, but really, really strong and dark. We had little success at some point. We were trying to invite some guests as well, but the music which we were pushing, it was not fitting the area. musically, so it didn't work for us. So at the time when we were growing older, my friends, they got real jobs. I was too addicted to music, so I thought I need to push this further. But my decision was to focus more on the international scene and reduce my time that I spent for events in Bulgaria. So for the moment we stopped doing anything, but I have power So I will I would love to try to contribute again. I think the time is coming But so far we haven't done anything in the past maybe 10 years Does it need a kind of like a great club that will attract? We have, as I said, we have the potential. The law is pretty liberal. We have good venues with good sound systems. At the moment, what I see in Sofia, that's the capital, there are a lot of small crews which are actually doing very adventurous bookings. Sometimes they lose money, but they are enthusiastic. they try to push boundaries. My problem at the moment is I don't have that much time. I'm busy with, luckily I'm busy with my gigs, I have so many projects in mind, I'm actually always catching up with deadlines, always late. So the only reason I still haven't contributed much. to the scene is that I'm not available. But I'm trying to make time. In the past two years, I take a couple of months break so I can focus in studio, so I can focus in meeting people in my own hometown. So it's coming. It's just slower than what I thought. You do host events every now and then and you play them anonymously and stuff? What I do in Bulgaria is once a year I do a big event. I play for my good friends called Metropolis. That's probably the biggest and the best promoter for techno music in Sofia, in Bulgaria. And then every month I have a free weekend. It's very intense what I do, so in order to survive, I try to have some time at home. So let's say every month I have a free weekend. Probably every second month I go to a small venue in Sofia, and me and my friends, still the same DJ crew. we do kind of unannounced events. We still mention it somehow on the web, so... the people are coming. So I'm still kind of participating. However, I don't feel like I'm helping the scene enough. And I hope I'll find time for this in the future. I'm curious about this period in your life when you're kind of totally obsessed with this music, but not yet professional. I mean, what did your life look like around that time? Like how much of your day were you dedicating to music and in what way? Yeah, in the beginning for me this music was a religion. I didn't know, talking about the 90s, I didn't have much information. I didn't know how the artists looked like. I didn't know how they would perform their music. I didn't even know how a real DJ set looked like. And all that mystery gained my curiosity, so I was really obsessed with it. Yeah, when I was in school in the 90s, I haven't got the budget to buy any equipment, so I would basically... try to modify the sound or make the sound with anything I can find at home. For example, I had this turntable and I was trying to scratch, but when I listened to hip-hop mixes, I realized that hip-hop DJs, when they scratch, they cut the sound with something. I didn't know there's supposed to be a mixer in the chain. And I was wondering how they are able to cut the sound. So what I did is I cut the cable going to the speaker. And I was touching both ends of the cable. So that's how I was making the sound going through. And so on and so on. I met also in the early to mid-90s, I met these guys. they wanted to make hip-hop music and they had gear and by gear I mean they had a dual cassette recorder So they would give me some tapes with hip-hop music and I would find clean drum loops and I would extend the drum loops by playing the clean drum loop from one cassette, recording on the second, then rewinding back the first cassette on the place where the drum loop starts, playing it back again, recording, and that's how I would extend the loop. And then I would scratch with my homemade crossfader by touching the cable. And so on. So how much time it would take, I don't know. I would use any moment to do this. What did your parents think of all this? Well, the music I was listening to, they would say, yeah, it sounds like horses running around. And our neighbor from the same floor, she was a very friendly woman, a friend of our family. But I remember one time she came and she said, you know what? There is something wrong with your washing machine. I read that your studio is in your mum's house. Is that still the case? I just moved it out. Literally, literally five, six days ago. So was that in the house that you were born in? Not born in. Me and my family, we moved in. It's a flat. We moved in that flat in 1984. And my studio was in my childhood room since, you know, I've been living there since 94. So I was able to start building up some sort of studio maybe in the mid-2000s, late 2000s. Before it was just torturing neighbors with just a pair of speakers. So that's nice. You lived elsewhere, but you'd be able to come home and see your mom. No, I always lived there. Actually, now we did a swap. So my mom lives in a place very nearby, maybe five minutes walk. So at the moment, I'm still there with my wife. For years, we say it's a temporary solution. Let's talk about your production. You said that tracks and ideas for tracks come to you in everyday life. When you're walking around, I guess when you're performing on stage. Do you have a process for remembering these ideas? In the very, very beginning, I used to somehow visualize the tracks. Because for a very big period of time, I haven't got gear. I haven't got a chance to produce. When I started to record, my first recordings were since probably 1998. At that time I haven't got any gear so I was visiting my friends who had a computer. Also I used to go to my father's office, he used to have a computer. And I would just use my one hour or two hours to make some loops and record them straight to tape. But I was not able to do this every day, so I would plan, I would imagine stuff. And then I would go and just quickly record something. Actually, like a lot of people used to do in the 90s when it was expensive to rent a studio. So you just go to the studio for two hours and you do your best shot. So that was in the beginning. Then I had my first computer in the year 2000, I think. And I was using this modular software, it's called Buzz, like B-U-Z-Z. And the way you make music with it, you don't play the music. You type codes in a hexadecimal system, that means numbers and letters, and then you get some sound out of it. So it was a very boring process. It was just programming sounds. And for a very long period of time, my music was very... programmed with a high detail in it, but it also was very square. You count to four and something happens, then you count to eight and something happens again, because I was not playing the music, I was writing it. And actually, since I started to play live, that was a big eye-opener, because when I'm on stage, I don't count. I'm just dancing and at some point I feel, okay, now it's time to remove the kick drum, okay, now it's time to play something I have in my mind. And it was never in such a square structure. It was more natural. And since I started doing it on stage, I thought, why I don't apply this in my studio? So now my approach is less mathematical and it's more physical, more natural. But you said the actual process in the studio is quite cold. It used to be, exactly. It used to be. It used to be. I think the time when I said that, I still used that platform when I was programming the music. But now... since maybe the past two, three years, it changed big time. So now it's more of playing music. How often will you be in the studio? It used to be every day because it's like almost every day when I'm not in the road. Because obviously it was in the same building. But from now on, let's see. I guess I'm always going to be there as much as I can because it's my way to relax as well. We have these fights with my wife when I come back from the week and I'm so tired. And always she says... She's excited to see me. I'm excited to see her as well, but I am consumed. I don't have energy to meet people as much as I love them. And I tell her, I'm really sorry, but I need my time off. I just need to be alone. And then I switch on my machines. So it's not only the job, it's not only a habit. release schedule I really love doing it and it's it's my way of relaxing and it doesn't mean that I have to have that doesn't have to be productive for the time sometimes I just jam and I don't have to record it is my way of healing from from being awake for 72 hours and so on. How else do you look after yourself on the road? I have to take care of myself better. I don't have this healthy lifestyle. I think I'm in a strange situation because I don't take any substances to help me to keep going. But at the same time, I don't... take good care of what I eat. I still drink a bit, so I have this... I don't have anything that can help me out to handle this life better. So the natural way is to start doing sports and eating healthier. You know, we are not perfect. You said yourself you're a fan and a dancer, first and foremost. I mean, has being a producer and getting to know all this different gear made you appreciate the music of some of your favorite artists even more? Yeah, for me, first of all, it was understanding the sound design. I'm not a classically trained musician, so my school for making music was not... understanding the classic composers or understanding the music theory. For me it was understanding how to make music like Larry Hurd, like Kevin Saunders and like Derek May. So in the very beginning I was trying to copy them. First of all not by using gear, just using software, but trying to understand. the basics of sound design. I read a really interesting interview with a great producer called Kirk DiGiorgio. He was saying the same thing. He said he was trying to copy his favorite records, but obviously he was getting there, but he was not able to reproduce the sound in the same way. So he was coming up with something original by trying to copy his favorite recordings. I guess that's what happened with me, you know, trying to understand the process of making sounds. I stumbled across something else. and then being able to buy gear it just expanded more options and I started to build my modular synthesizer system maybe four or five years ago and As much as I found this platform is not very practical for on stage and sometimes in the studio it makes you very slow but it was a very big eye-opener how to actually what is the path of the sound, what is the path of the modulations. Learning how my favorite artists were doing it is inspiring, it's fun. That's my school, not studying composition, but studying how my heroes made this music. How many pieces of gear do you own? I don't know. It's nothing too crazy. I know people like Matthew Johnson, for example. He has a crazy studio. I don't know. I have a pretty big modular synthesizer system. I've always been focused on buying new gear. I'm not that much a fan of the classic gear. I mean, as long as I have the Roland TR-909, my favorite drum machine, I have the EMU SP-1200, that's a drum-focused sampler, which does something magical with the sound. But generally, I'm really interested in new developments, because I'm not... I'm not that young, but I started as a producer with my computer, so I'm rather more open to new technology than to the classics. So I'd rather buy new stuff. Would you say you're addicted to buying new technology? Yeah. It's crazy. I managed to cure myself from the modular addiction. I've had that series. Yes, but now I am back to buying pre-configured synthesizers because what I found is when you buy a pre-configured unit, if it's done very smartly... It makes you very fast by transferring your idea from your head to the recording. And I really, really, I need help. I am online looking for new machines all the time. And when I find something, especially if it's not cheap, I talk to Konstantin, my studio partner now, or I talk to my wife. expecting that she would say, you know, don't buy it. But she says, are you happy? Does it make you happy? And I'm like, yeah, buy it then. I'm like, no, that's not the answer I'm looking for. How often will a new piece of gear enter your live setup on the road? I have... As I said, for me it's very important to have a very simple system on stage. I came up with the philosophy how I play my music maybe nine years ago. So I have my computer, which is the brain of everything. I have a MIDI keyboard, I have a drum machine, and I have those two devices called Launchpads by Novation. And I used this system since nine years ago. So this is the core. I want to have a system which is similar to having a mixer and two decks. Because once you play with this system for many years, you develop some sort of muscle memory. You don't think of the performance anymore. You just go for it. but still I want to go out of my comfort zone. So every month or every two months there is a piece of... Normally there is a synthesizer which I change. Every two months I bring something new. So I have the core. but there is a unit which I replace every two months. You mentioned your wife there, Rachel Rowe. She's a singer-songwriter from Bulgaria. That's correct, yes. Does having someone with... I mean, is she professionally trained? She is, yes. Is having someone with that kind of ear and that kind of expertise helpful to your own music making? Yes, it's very helpful because what I found for myself and a lot of... friends of mine who are not classically trained, we tend to, when we make a melody, we tend to stick to very simple chord progressions, and very obvious chord progressions, because we don't know the rules, we make something basic and it sounds right, and we are afraid to go out of it, because... we put such a big effort and finally we get something that sounds right. And when you have someone who is classically trained on your side, this person can tell you, yeah, but maybe you can try something. something else which is less safer. So, yeah, that's what I found for people like me who are not classically trained. Sometimes you fall in a trap where you just repeat the same formula because you don't know better. And it's nice to have people around you which can push you to go out of these boundaries. I think we're nearing the end, but just quickly, you know, you're someone who's always buying new gear, you're always looking to progress, you're always doing new things, you're playing a jungle set here, you're DJing vinyl there, you know, you're never sitting still. But what does the, you know, what does kink the artist look like in the bigger picture, in the future? Like, where is this going to go? I never had a plan. But what I would love to achieve is to create original music, which I think I still haven't done. So I think that's what is about to come. I would love to create completely original music. Wish me good luck. And you mentioned just before we started talking that you're interested in teaching. once you hang up your touring boots? Yeah, I think I have a very good experience at breaking through, making it out from a place where it's nearly impossible to become professional. underground artist. I tried pretty much every possible format of performing music live, so I think I have a good experience and I guess at some point when I'm not gonna be able or I'm not gonna want to travel that much, I would love to teach what I know. And what we are doing right now, it's helping me a lot because as I say, I used to be very shy. and now talking to all of you helps me out to fight my limitations. Who knows what comes in the future? Thank you very much. So a warm round of applause. Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you. you
