You'd remember me. You'd remember me. Hello and welcome to Resident of Pfizer's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident of Pfizer. Derek Carter does things his own way. His pioneering take on Chicago House, the classic label with Luke Solomon, the list goes on. The idiosyncratic Chicago House DJ rarely gives interviews, so I was lucky to grab him as part of a collaboration with Pitch and Sync earlier this year in Amsterdam. part of a talk called "How to Succeed in the Record Business Without Really Trying." The event went so well that we decided to make it into a live RA exchange. We talk about his many dogs, his solarium, and eventually his lengthy career in electronic music. Peace of history. Peace of history. Peace of history. Peace of history. Peace of history. Peace of history. Peace of history. Peace of history. Peace of history. Hi. Hi. Did you just come in today? I just got in this morning. How, um... How did your dogs take you leaving to Europe? They don't care. I know you have. They don't care. They just, you know, they know something's afoot when I start packing. And like, they see the bags and they just get really curious and want to nose around. And a couple of them actually left me toys inside the bag. So when I land somewhere, I open it up and right on top. Or just underneath something there's like a little ring of some sort, a cute little toy, like, don't forget us, daddy. But, yeah, they don't really care. They were more concerned that it was the 4th of July and I was leaving. And so it's Independence Day in the States and there's fireworks going off and all kinds of noises and things. And they get really kind of skittish. when there's lots of odd explosions going on. Except for one. One wants to eat the explosions. But the rest of them get a little worried that something's happening. How did you end up with so many dogs? You have like eight? Seven. Seven. Yeah. Well, that was sort of a divorce thing and some stuff like that. So you've just accumulated them over time? Yeah, I've collected them. Me and my partner had two. Then we got three. Then we got four. And then we're like, what's one more? What's one more? What's one more? So then you do that for a while, and then you end up with a big bunch of dogs. Well, a bunch of small dogs. Chicago, your apartment, it's big enough to accommodate all of this? Yeah. I have a building. Okay, an entire building. Yeah. So there's a floor for work, which is like my office, the studio, the record room, and then the garage out back. and the sort of dog run behind that which is fenced in and then there's a floor where we live normally which is just sort of like you know bedroom, living room, kitchen, dining room and all that. and then upstairs is the play area where the adults play. So there's like the cinema and there's a bar. There's a bar? Yeah. And then the guest quarters in the back and then there's a solarium. So this talk is titled How to Succeed in the Record Business. Apparently you've done quite well for yourself if you have a solarium. It's a solarium in name only. It's more of a... It's my ex's office. It used to be the office. And then I was like, fuck that. I don't have a solarium. So I put some big old trees out there. And it's got a lot of windows on three sides. So it's nice and you can sit up there and hang out. Watch stuff. Watch stuff. Yeah, you get a good view of the downtown of the city skyline. So it's really nice when the evening comes in and the sun's setting and starts to backlight all the skyscrapers and stuff. It can be peaceful. It's kind of like a zen kind of moment. Everybody needs a room where they can just go and gather power. And that's what it becomes. What's going on in the studio these days? You said one of those rooms, one of those many rooms is a studio. Lots of stuff. Working on some remixes, doing some edits and things. Just finished putting together the new single for Classic. And I do a lot of my... When I get promos and stuff from people, as they generally tend to email or send me links to promos and stuff, I always have to sort of remaster things because I get them. As is often the case in this new millennium, people do things in their bedrooms over headphones or some little shit speakers that they put on the dresser or whatever. And they can sound okay, but a lot of times they sound sort of medium. And so I've got a proper room, and I just take them in there, and I do a lot of pre-mastering so that when I play things, they sound like, to me, how they're supposed to sound. So it's a workroom. It's another office. It's an extension of everything else. But yeah, working on some remixes, trying to put together an album. You said you had an original single coming out. It's an original single, but it's one that was released prior to this. Basically, I'm re-releasing the Square Dancing album, and it's 10 years after the dance. So it's being put together with outtakes and new material, new edits, new remixes. And hopefully, if I can find someone to sort it out, we've got to kind of do a really nice art cover with some limited edition possibilities of just being able to have flats that we insert into some, well, for the vinyl anyway, insert into some PVC bags so that the actual art It's removable and frameable. And then you can just have the record with like the little insert sleeve. But, you know, do some tie-ins and make things like a little more, I don't know, give another level to things because you kind of need to have like a bit more cachet or, you know, something there. in this day and age. Classic is the label that you co-run with Luke Solomon. Correct. And you recently restarted it. And one of the things that I always loved about it in its first incarnation was... the art right um was that something when you started that label that was immediately on your mind that you knew well immediately needs to be we didn't really give much thought to it because um doing we thought anyway doing um these sort of independent individual uh sleeves was going to be cost prohibitive like we thought that that's just oh that's the realm of you know, Michael Jackson. That's what rich people do when they pay, or when they press, you know, a million of something, then yeah, you're going to have to need that. But then we found out that it really wasn't much more to do individual jackets as opposed to just those sort of zero die-cut things or house bags. So then we got off into it. And we really got off into it. After a while, we were just like, yeah, this is, you know, everything needs its own kind of visual representation and we need to do this. And it became a kind of a thing for us to make these musics that had instant... Peel of some sort, you know, like everything had its own kind of visual representation and we became kind of known for that. So like when you see it on the shelf or. in the bins or whatever, you know it's a classic record. Even though the artwork would change up, it was still sort of the same format with the same font and just kind of done really simply. It gave everything, each release, a little bit of life. So we just got into it and then went crazy with it. Was there a moment at which you thought, oh, we've maybe gone a little bit too far with this one? So imagine... who goes too far what is that what does that even mean nobody goes too far i mean we just luke and i have this sort of thing where we just um without sounding too cavalier we just kind of do what we want to do you know and especially since we kind of control the purse strings it was a bit like letting the monkeys run the zoo so we just could do whatever the heck we wanted to do at any point and just as long as we could figure out a way to make it sort of fiscally responsible and make the money back. Then we just kind of did it, you know. Fiscally responsible. So that he could pay the bills. Was he the one that was doing the accounting? Fiscally responsible? No. No, we had another fiscal responsibility monitor in the office. If someone's starting a label today, you know, you say that you're doing this special art for the re-release of something. Would you say that something like giving added value to a release has to be there to stand out? Possibly. Okay, from a retail point of view, I mean, the thing is, I've always worked in music. I've never really had what people would call a normal job, apart from like a department store for a year, and then I got fired because they should have fired me six months before. But I've always worked in music, and I've always had this thing where I wanted to be the everything. I wanted to like... write the songs, produce the records, then mix them and play all the keyboards and sing on them, then sell them at the record store because I worked at the record store and play them at the club. I wanted to have every aspect covered. Why? Because you're a control freak? No, because I wanted that experience. I just wanted to be like the guy. That dude does everything. You know? But at the time, I was like 17. That's what you think about when you're like 17 or 18. You're like, I'm going to be the bomb. I'm going to do everything. But... And working in record stores, what I found out is that people come in and they need something to catch their attention. A lot of times they get it from the music that they hear playing over the loudspeakers or whatever. But then a lot of times, you know, you can only play one record at a time or two at a time, you know, if you're in that transition. And you have something else which kind of grabs their attention. So, like, you know... You do a nice sleeve or something that has that pow, and then they can kind of, like, oh, that's interesting. I mean, you know, I thought about the times when I go record shopping, and even when I was younger, I bought a lot of really shitty records because they had cool covers. And I mean, and I was fine with that. Like, the record is shit, but the cover's awesome. So even in that respect, we kind of realized, and Luke's the same way. He's been buying records for forever. So we realized that there is something. That you can sell your shitty records. Yeah, you can sell a few packets of shit. Swell. They'll eat it. But we tried not to do that on the shitty part. We tried to do it with good stuff. And then also, now that we've grown up a bit, or had grown up a bit, to be able to do it with a bit of some cool. new taste level, I suppose. New taste level? Yeah. What does that mean? Well, from when we were young, the things that we thought were cool then to the things that we know are cool now. It evolves. What do you look back on and cringe a little bit? besides some hairstyles and a few really bad trouser choices. There's loads of things. It's just kind of the evolution of being in the world. You just realize certain things are happening and certain things are not happening. I read an interview with you where you said that you just sort of stopped caring a little bit about what other people think at a certain point. I do not. Anybody that knows me kind of knows that a lot of people have problems with no. I don't have a problem with no. I just know. Do you want to know? And it's like one of those things. Is that something you had to learn? Yeah, it is. It's something that you have to learn because you have to stop really, a lot of people sort of. It sort of comes off as like school, where you're in these cool cliques and then you know these people and this is happening. And I'm not in school anymore. I'm not trying to, this is not, I mean, in some ways it is a bit of a popularity contest when you're trying to sell records and make records and DJ and be in front of people and then you hope that they like you and, you know, your livelihood depends on it. But at the same time, you can't be a slave to do what you do because you want someone to like you. I mean, that just becomes a bit of a self-defeating thing. Like, that just is odd. Like, I need to do this because I need some validation or any of that sort of stuff. I just, you know, I validate myself. So, like, in a lot of that, then I did stop caring. I just don't really pay much attention to people who would, especially when they try to bring you down or say ill things about you, because you don't know. Not everyone, I don't know what you do. you know, I don't know what you do. I don't know. So I can't really be the judge of you or say that, you know, that was a bad decision all the time because it just is like, why are you so judgmental? You know, and I just stopped allowing myself to be judged in a lot of ways. And that takes some of the power back. And then you feel empowered and you can just make a crazy cover or do something else or whatever you feel like doing. When did that switch go off for you? Obviously, it's a gradual thing. It definitely is. I've always had this... I've been more evolutionary than revolutionary. It takes a bit of time. But I can't really say. I can't point an epiphany date or... Some time graph that says, like, right here. But it happened. Probably when I, after I got in my 30s, you know, like, you really stop with some of the... teenage stuff and you like you know start to become more self-aware and think about your position and things and why you do the things you do and why are you here still and what would you like to say or what would you like to have seen and in doing that when you kind of get your big picture together and realize the things that are important and things that really matter and as far as you think that your art's concerned then you become a little stronger and you become a little more emboldened and you can do the things that you feel like will hold out over the course of time like this is where we should be or this is what we should do let's work towards that instead of like being more reactionary to how people view things or what people think now should be because if you're chasing now you're gonna you're now that you're chasing it'll be six weeks eight weeks before you do what was happening then so you have to like try to plot the course that you meet something as it's going along it just becomes very confused yeah good that's how it works Were you still running classic at this time when you were having this sort of not epiphany, epiphany idea of, you know, these are the things that don't matter. These are the things that matter. I'm curious because you started out with such, it seemed like such a defined concept. We're going to count down from catalog number 100 to zero. Oh, that was initially a bit of a joke. That you would ever have 100 releases. Well, no. We did it to differentiate ourselves from everyone else's label. We thought that having a label and the release number is like 001, like people are like, like, you know, you're a little weary and you could be like, oh, that's their first release. I don't know. So I thought, let's just start at 100. So that all our releases are big numbers. We want big numbers. We want it to be on the sheet. Classic Music Company, number 95. And if you came into the label late and didn't know the hierarchy or how the situation was, you would think, wow, they're jamming. They're on 87. So it was that sort of thing. But at the same time, we thought it was a cool way to kind of flip the... release sheets and things that they used to hand out at the time or fax around on its head, you know, instead of like having released 002. 002 was, you know, 99. So it just, it came off better, I thought. Yeah. When the label ended, were you lost or was it like you were, I already have tons and tons of different things that I want to be doing? or that I'm already doing? Well, when the label ended, the main reason it ended was because the record business... had gone to shit. So we had three, I believe three distributors that had gone bankrupt and in going bankrupt and going under, they went down with, you know, hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of stock that was just sitting in their warehouses that we didn't have access to, that we couldn't get to. So that became issues with product. And having people to sell the product. So there was all that. We took a big hit on that. And then there's the thing with PRS and MCPS where they charge you fees not based on how many records you sell but how many records you press. So having all these bits of stock out there that are invoiced and say they've been pressed and we still have to pay. not just the artists for these things, which is primary, but then these societies that want their money based on the invoices that they've seen. our main distributor, who was our P&D distributor, went under. And it just became a bit of a, where are we? What's going on? What's happening? Like, luckily, it happened around, like, zero two. So it was, like, kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Like, we didn't really mean for it to be like that, but then it kind of turned out like that. It was just like, all right, well, you know, all this, the Venn diagram of this has us in the middle saying, give it up. It's time to take a break. So then that's kind of what we did. after everything went down with all the distributors and shops were closing and vinyl was just tanking and then we were just owing money out the ass and having to have an office. I mean, it's a very 90s way of operating business. You have an office with a fax machine and, you know, like, a fax machine. Do you remember? I need to get some thermal paper to put in my fax machine. I mean, it's just like, it was ridiculous. So we just decided that we needed to get rid of all that and focus on some other things for a while and just let it go for a minute. Figure out a way to pay all these bills and do all these things and take out second mortgages on the house to guarantee bank loans to make sure that... The solarium. Well, this is pre-solarium. You said the record business was turning to shit. It was undergoing a bit of a change. Where is it right now? I think it's better. Really? I think it's better in some regards. It has a boutique quality to it now. you know, it used to be like this big business and everything was all about sales and all this stuff. And now everyone has to be a bit more creative in order to see things happen. So it's got a bit more of a boutique, like a cottage industry. And you can do cooler things again on a smaller scale. And you can almost target your audience and reach out to people that you feel would be interested in what you have to offer. So it's kind of imploded. But that just makes it a little, you know, I think just to the core. So it works well in that respect. You just have to change your way of thinking and try to figure out a way to diversify your revenue streams and make the products that you do make that much better and that much more interesting. How have you diversified your revenue streams? Well, yeah, well, you know, besides just selling vinyl. you have to get on the digital sites, you have to learn how to get people aware because there is no brick and mortar shops anymore which were the kind of cornerstone or the touchstone of the record business. People go into the record stores, they would check out releases, see things that they thought are interesting or hear things. And it also was like a central hub for, at that time, what was a community. DJs come in and they can come in and talk and meet each other and see each other. And you could meet people from other different kind of walks, like singers would come in and hang out. And, you know, basically it's all people who really like music had a place to congregate. It's like a church of sorts. And now you don't have that. So you have to be a little more creative in getting your gospel out there, if you would. So you're on Twitter all day. Sometimes. Some days. Some days you do that. It's not like every day. It's not like all day. But some days, especially when I work in the studio, I've got two screens. So I have a screen that I'm actually working on, putting things together. And then there's a screen, I have a monitor, my media screen, where I have my Facebook up and my Twitter up and all these things. And I'm just kind of like, oh, so and so and so and so. And while you're waiting for, I don't know if anybody here does music, but sometimes if you're time stretching a vocal that's like six minutes. and you have to pull it all the way down from like 90 to 125 or anything. That'll take like three, four minutes to do. So like whatever, I got three, four minutes while I'm waiting and watching the ball and moving this. Cool. You know, you multitask and you just get stuff done. What other things are you doing differently these days in terms of, you said diversifying. I mean, I wonder if... you're thinking about music in a different way in terms of what you're producing or is it just burrowing down making house music still that's good enough? Maybe not good enough. That's a little condescending. Well, no, understandably. But I mean, I still kind of do what I like and do what I feel. So I don't know about what I'm doing differently in terms of making music. Apart from like, you know, where my sound... Wow, that sounds so stupid. Where my sound has evolved to. Yeah, okay. But I mean, you know, I'm not supposed to say that. Oh, my sound. That sounds just like really kind of arrogant and dumb. I think you've been around long enough not to care. Well, fair enough. I mean, I don't really care, but I still choose to censor myself when I feel I need it. Sure. So I just do kind of what I want to do. You know, I feel like... I want to make something that kind of reminds me of this or brings this to mind. And I don't necessarily know if I'd do anything different. I don't know if I know how to do anything different. You know, I just do what I do. And wherever I am along that timeline, kind of... puts me where I need to be, I feel. You know? Like, I just get in there and work. You start mashing buttons, you start, you know, picking sounds, you start working. I mean, the work itself sort of makes you think different, too. And, like, I was having a conversation with James, my agent manager, the other day, because I was working on, like, two tracks at the same time. And by doing that, I had to switch gears in a way. So I didn't want the two tracks I was working on at the same time to sound the same. So I would completely kind of polar opposite, you know, like, well, I work on this one for a couple hours and then work on this one for a couple hours and I get out of that head and get into this head. So you can kind of switch up and, you know, find ways to make yourself think different, differently. How, that must be tough. Was it longer to... Write those tracks than normal or was it easy to get in those different head spaces? Longer is how long does it take you to make a track? It depends on the track. Sometimes you can do it in a day. Sometimes you can do it in a couple hours Sometimes it takes a week, you know, it depends on what you want out of it, you know, sometimes I do things that Particularly when I'm working with vocals or vocalists. I'll get vocals. I'm working on this thing now from this. I guess they're like a quartet, but there's like a drummer, like two guys that play horns, and like a guitarist who also plays keys. And they do things. It's kind of like a soul, country soul kind of thing. It's kind of weird. And at the same time I was working, I've got a friend who fronts a... Klezmer Collective, which is like, I don't know, you know, Klezmer is like Jewish folk music, kind of Eastern European, kind of lots of like accordions and concertinas and, you know, violins and all this stuff. So I was working on stuff with them and their... rhythm is a little different, you know, and you're working with people who have like a different kind of like when you count rhythm, one and two and one and a two and a, you know, you're doing that sort of thing. It sort of falls a little bit differently. So in order to try to make it have the groove that I want to have, you got to sit there and like move a lot of. little parts. I mean, it's kind of tedious at points, but the end result is really quite satisfying. So, you know, you just get in there and just start working. You know, it depends. Like, sometimes things can just pop off, and sometimes sitting there trying to, you know, quantize an accordion solo is hard. I talked to you like maybe a year and a half ago, two years, and you were still trying to work with that Klezmer group. I've done like five projects with them. Okay. They keep calling me back. But you've finished them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They keep calling me back. And the guy just actually finished writing a ballet and just sent me a whole bunch of parts for this ballet he's done. What are you going to be doing for him exactly for the ballet? I don't know. I don't know. I got like some strings and some bells and shit. Mix some strings and bells together with a beat. I mean, I have no idea. You know, I just like kind of, I put it on the back burner for now because I have no idea what to do. And sometimes like you just have to put it on hold and like. man, you know, and just let it sit and kind of marinate or, you know, come back to it when you're in the right head. But yeah, I have no idea. I guess these are the projects that are really interesting to you. Yeah, well, they're the things that I find like, you know, challenging. challenging in a way you know the things that my 20 year old self would know what to do with these you know or my even my 25 year old self probably would just kind of not understand the gravity in some of it but now I have a I think a more mature respect for some things that I find interesting and that I find challenging and to take the time to meet the challenge would your what would your 20 year old self say to you if you were working you're stupid you're just oh my goodness He just, like, probably wouldn't even talk to me. He would just look at me like... You're working on a ballet, huh? Yeah, exactly. Nice one. Like, for real. Derek, what you doing? Like, my 20-year-old self was rowdy. Straight rowdy. Like, rowdy. So you've calmed down a little bit. No. Not at all. But what I've done is I think learned to make better choices when it comes to being public. Like I used to just do all my dirt in front of everybody. I didn't care. Like I'd just be wild and just be rawr. And now I just, you know. A little less up front with it and just, you know, I keep it cool. Are you, I mean, obviously you continue to do it, but what keeps you DJing around the world? I like DJing. Yeah? I really, really like DJing. Like some people just kind of do it to promote their record. or because they think that they have to as part of their career path or whatever. I really like DJing. I like getting in front of a bunch of people and playing music that I really like and hearing it really loud and watch people dance and like, ooh, I got this, motherfucker, I'm going to do this. And then you sort of trick them and then they come and they fall and like, ah! And then all of a sudden it happens and then it's like, ah! And I like that. I really get a kick out of that. That's like the one thing that I've hardly ever like soured on. Like some people, oh, DJing. I'm like, I have fun. I literally try to have fun. And I really like it. I love DJing. What have you soured on over the years? People. I always say I love the idea of people, but the actual implementation of them is less than amazing. So sometimes when trends hit, and I'm like, oh my goodness, how do 10,000 people care that much? What is this going on? I feel like, because I'm not really, maybe not an elder statesman, but I have a couple of decades under my belt, so I feel like... Even though I don't want to always say it, I often do have an opinion. I just usually, you know, I'll keep it to myself. I still had a few drinks and then I tell everybody. But sometimes I just think that, you know, people take the easy road and are satisfied with, you know. the minimum or the lowest common denominator those kinds of things that just allow people to feel a part of something which i also understand but you know like there's more you know so sometimes i i worry about that um i don't know i'm pretty easygoing i'm pretty uh optimistic in general um if we were to go tonight to see you play what what would we hear exactly is it good stuff good stuff good stuff i got lots of good stuff what's the newest thing you were working on to bring here for this um the newest thing i was working on i was working on a few things concurrently i've got a couple of re-edits i've been doing um And then I did this remix that I finished of my single, which I think is bomb. It sounds really good out when you play it. It sounds really good. I've got some secrets, some specials that I care not to divulge where they come from. You've got to have a special or two. You've got to have a thing that is your ha-ha. Do you think that's more important these days than it used to be? Or is it just the same? It's the same importance. It's the same. You always have to have it. I remember hanging out with Bobby Condors. late 80s, early 90s at some point. That's where I got the name from, the specials. He had all these acetates and I'm going to print them. That's my special. He had a little group of specials that only he had, that no one else had. Those were his almost like he was proud. Yeah. I think you need some of that. You need to have something that sort of differentiates you or like allows you, even if the world doesn't necessarily know it, but if you know it, then it will give you a little fuel to like carry on or like, you know, if you need to feel a little special, something that kind of buoys your mood or your place at the time. I mentioned you gotta please yourself as much as everyone else. Yeah, well, I mean, that's what I'm saying. I have fun. I like to have fun. And sometimes I need a special to, you know, to bop along to. And having your own specials, you know, it would kind of be odd if I heard someone else. play my special, I'm like, hey, that's mine. You know, like you have a sort of a connection with it and it becomes special because of that connection as well. It kind of feeds. To expunge me Me and my
