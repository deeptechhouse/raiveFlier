Welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artist labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Droid behavior is nearing a decade as one of Los Angeles' preeminent promoters of 4-4, a group of DJs, producers, photographers, and writers that have filled the need for regular underground techno parties in the city. Raiz, Evangeliz, and Fidel Vargas and Drumcell, Mo Espinosa, founded Droid, but over the years, things have grown exponentially. Credit for this is down to the trio's early embrace of email newsletters and online promotion, as well as their multimedia-heavy interface parties, which have seen the likes of Speedy J, Surgeon, and Marcel Dettman all take to the decks. But their tastes also run wider than the usual technosphere. In recent years, the crew has booked ghetto tech legend DJ Sluggo and Alvin-based scientist Shackleton. In conjunction with our Clubbing in Los Angeles feature that's going up this week on the site, Johnny Coleman sat down with the group to talk about the city and techno's place within it. I am Mo Espinosa, also known as Drumcell. Vidal Vargas, one half of Ra'ise. Vangelis Vargas, the other half of Ra'ise. And we're in like east-ish LA, like proper east side of LA. This is Rosemead, which is part of San Gabriel Valley, which is east of downtown. And I believe all the droid people are based out of San Gabriel Valley. Yeah, Rosemead, in case you didn't know, is officially the home of the cock sauce, the Thai rooster sauce. Okay, gotcha. Sriracha. Oh, really? Yeah, it's made here in Rosemead. No way. Fun fact. And Mo, where are you from again? Also East LA as well. Primarily a city called Hacienda Heights, which is a little bit further east than Rosemead. And lived there pretty much my whole life. I moved into downtown LA area and lived in Koreatown for quite some time. And then just recently went back out to my old neighborhood. How many more people officially comprise the whole Droid Collective? They're all on the Droid side, of course, but artist-wise we have... From Sal Reis audio injection Luis Flores from a call and then we all everyone's a DJ. Of course. We have a call also seconds as our photographer Vic Carrillo Subversive who also produces and DJs Derek Michael who has done a great deal of our overall web design and kind of branding look. And Bijan, who's our kind of behind-the-scenes man on every piece of media that exists ever. Yeah, there's so many people within our circle. It's kind of hard to name them all, and it's very family-orientated. Josiah, street promoter. Yeah, if we forgot to say your name, we still love you. Right on. And you guys all were clicking. You guys were all involved in your own music stuff in high school. There's a lot of maybe metal and really hard kind of sounds involved. I started playing guitar at a rather young age and primarily did the whole rounds with a rock band thing. Everything from playing in... hardcore punk rock bands to even ska bands and even kind of doing the post-industrial thing. Circled around many different bands, did the whole backyard gig thing and played many shows and actually started producing electronic music at a rather young age. I was actually still in high school at the time. I was kind of fortunate enough to get a job in a recording studio in Hollywood, which was primarily a dance music label, and really kind of cut my teeth producing in there, which... Led to me releasing some records and doing some stuff in the studio. Not necessarily involved with techno, but electronic music, nonetheless. And Vidal? Well, let's see. I was never really a fishing band. I kind of played trumpet, yelled into a few mics. Played bass, shook some tambourines, all in Von Helles' garage bands. He did a lot of garage band stuff throughout high school. And I just kind of followed suit. But I was heavily into music, of course, and expressing myself. So I was actually, I think my first kind of experience with expressing myself was poetry. I used to be really heavily into writing. like lyrics and stuff from like eighth grade all the way to sophomore year and then at the same time really just following music and I don't know if you want to say like archiving stuff but just really digging deep into everything I listened to following you know following and looking for the root and the blueprint of a lot of stuff so that was kind of my experience with music well that's kind of funny because it's a it for you know correct me if I'm wrong, but I think most of the stuff isn't vocalist. Or is vocalist. The stuff that I listen to and produce and hold out. It's cool that that was your entry and then it's not like you were consciously probably like, I hate vocalist. I think actually what happened is I went back and looked at all my poetry and said, this is all crap. I don't really like vocals. So let's just do the techno thing. I didn't have a lot to do with it This poetry of yours. Poetry is really bad. It's blackmail material. Collateral against your partners. My first bands that I really followed was Nine Chinels, Clash, Ted Kennedy's, and everything that's kind of related to that and came from that. That was kind of my early musical experiences. Eventually led to industrial and then just full-on electronic. Yeah, I think we shared quite a bit of that time. I mean, I'm a little older than Vidal, so I definitely kind of struck out with the whole, as a guitar player as well, since like 12, started taking lessons. And once I got into high school, got into really like thrash death metal stuff. And of course, all the old classic punk, like Misfits, Minor Threat. As I finished high school, I really kind of got more into the indie rock stuff, really more melodic and where you can actually make out what the singer was saying. It seemed to be more interesting to me. And I even remember though experiencing or my first experience with techno and rape music was like freshman year at our high school. We had one year towards or one day towards the end of the year where... they actually let the students DJ at lunch. And that was probably the first time I heard James Brown is dead. And I was just like, what is this stuff? This is really bizarre music. I mean, I had grown up on Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream and these proto-techno bands. But just that raw, really ravey, those old polychord synths and the saw waves, it was so alien to me almost. It just blew me away at first. Definitely another first example of that too. For both of us, exactly the same time as our amp, introduced us to a mixtape single of Maurice, This Is Acid. After that, I'm like, what is this? I'm going to be hearing this through my whole life now. She told us a bit about her experiences at these first undergrounds. This was like in 1990, so 89. It just hit the states, LA especially. She had it called Seed House. I'm not sure what that was. Acid House. I was like, well, it was yours that, uh, I think I was reading somewhere else, uh, the DJ Tron mixtape that just kind of like, I got someone else. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think, uh, at the time when I had originally got introduced into the kind of rave scene, I was kind of going through this whole, uh, you know, hardcore punk rock phase in my life. Where there was a lot of anger coming out through me musically and it was a teenager anywhere Totally and it wasn't only punk rock because I've never really been a purist of any particular sound Although you know I dived really deep into all these genres, but industrial played a really big part of me so I had already kind of I kind of had a gateway to electronic music through industrial music. And I knew what it was all about. But in particular, I remember the drummer of one of my bands, Pat Zamora, had come to me and he had been going to like, you know, early rave parties much longer than I had. And he brought to me this DJ Tron mixtape, which was called End of the Fucking World. And it was like a two cassette tape. One was a hard, harder, hardest, and 666 was the fourth side. The D side was the 666. Yeah, and it was pretty damn malicious and evil. And I think it right away kind of struck me. It struck a chord on that really aggressive kind of like something you could still like mosh to at a party or something like that. Yeah, they definitely did. That was kind of my gateway to things. My friends took me to a rave where there was ultimately a hardcore room. there because I was really interested in this music it blew me away it seemed like some sort of abstract music that came from outer space that someone kind of just delivered to me but being at that one first rave and kind of experienced the fact that there was multiple rooms and multiple genres of music just kind of really opened my eyes on how vast the genre or the scene was and ultimately my taste started to mature slowly and I just started kind of leaving that hardcore sound behind although I will say there's still a great deal of appreciation with me with really aggressive music like you know I still do dabble a little bit into breakcore and noise music and stuff like that. I think a lot of that really roots from my exposure to early hardcore music. How much do guitars play a role now? Because this is 10, 15 years later. Well, I still play guitar pretty often. Evangelist does as well. As far as in production as far as techno goes I have actually just most recently used quite a bit of guitar and some of my tracks but not really in a conventional way where it's like, you know, I'm strumming and playing sounds. I've done more experimental stuff like playing with feedback or using an Ebo, which basically just vibrates a string to get these long harmonic kind of tones and sampling them and mixing them into my tracks. So I think that if you heard any... the more recent productions that are coming out that I've done, you'll hear a lot of guitar in it, but I don't think you'd be able to make it out that it really is a guitar. It's pretty, it's pretty hidden in there. Yeah. I think within the genre of techno, it's pretty, or specifically our style that we produce and create. It's pretty hard to put a guitar riff or some sort of a melody, a melodic line. Because then it's disco. Yeah. It doesn't work. But I do approach the effects side of things. Learning to play the guitar, electric guitar, always playing with the different analog delays and distortions, the tubes and the amps. So I definitely approach... applying those same effects on my synth parts and drum parts just to kind of give it a certain edge and a certain sound so definitely have kind of that effects guitar electric guitar ear on this on the music and the production side of things there's also like this kind of subtle chord progressions and you chord changes and stuff that we also apply to our music, but it doesn't sound like guitar because we're not using guitars, we're using synths or just weird patches, but it's kind of based on, I guess, some of the theory that he was taught as a guitar student. music student in general. So going back to how you guys met originally, you guys had all had some sort of exposure to partying, but from what I gathered from talking to you guys and a lot of other people in the mid to late 90s, maybe when this was all really kind of coming together, that there wasn't, you know, certain people might even say there aren't that many. options now but you know then i assume that there there aren't like there weren't on any given weekend is everything like mega going in the mega rave direction or the opposite or no yeah i think the time we met yeah there was everything though back then there was massives there was small raves there was desert raves there was house parties there was in 2000 it was the desert raves and all these things things were starting to turn more into just the massive and the whole rave scene. What we grew up and loved about it kind of just died off for us. From the mid-90s to the 2000s, there was definitely a change where all the different options that we liked about it. changed into kind of these only very legal massives and of course I had to do a lot with all those kind of rave laws. There was all these authorities cracking down and really regulating on what is allowed to happen. So either you had to go really underground, do it in a legal club or do these very legal massives. So that really kind of... killed a lot of other things off, I think. Well, then with the rave law stuff too, it's then the penalty for breaking those laws if you do something is super criminal. So those slowed down and then there was a law. So this is, we're approaching 10 years coming up this year, right? So this is coming around. This is after, this is 2002. You guys start with a newsletter or a party? Which one came first? We started drawing behavior as a newsletter, as a way to basically just create a community of these like-minded individuals and then eventually build enough of a fan base or an audience or just people who are interested in this. to go to the events that either we're producing or other people were producing on this style of music. Yeah, but I mean, like you were saying a second ago, you know, there wasn't a lot of options and the scene was thriving quite a bit, but there wasn't a lot of options for techno or the music that we were in. Actually, it was kind of somewhat slim to none. What was happening in Progressive House? Trance and Progressive House was at its peak. I think there wasn't that many people in the city of LA who were knowledgeable enough about techno, or maybe there was, but in, you know, a city with population near like, you know, I don't know what, 18 million or something like that. Everybody was so spread out that it was. kind of impossible to kind of network with people who like the music. I met these guys through a mutual friend of mine who had told me they were playing at some house party, right? And he was like, yeah, these guys play techno. And for me, I was like... These guys play techno. Like, I don't know anybody else who listens to techno. Yeah. And I was going to say that as, as when I first had walked into this warehouse or to this house party, they were already up on and performing. And I had walked into two guys on a table playing with two tower PCs, you know, like two tower PCs with two, like, you know, two monitors, you know, And for me, I honestly, for as long as we've been going to these parties, that was the very first time I'd ever seen anybody doing a live performance on a computer. And this is pre-laptop days when laptops were kind of accessible where people were performing on them. And sure enough, they were playing techno. And it was incredible. The set was really great. And that started off a long relationship. We instantly started talking. They started throwing a lot of house parties at their house, and we'd come by, bring records. At our other house in Montebello. It was actually at their parents' house when they were gone. It was kind of like the very cliche, the parents are gone, let's rage the house. Risky business. Yeah, totally. Party style, you know? And they were pretty damn wild, to be honest. But, you know, there would be the turntable set up in the kitchen, like on the kitchen counter, and we all played records until sunrise, and everybody would rage out and dance. And I think at one point, you know, me and Vidal had started talking about how, like, you know, it's really time to get this whole... techno scene moving and you know try to at least since through them I was meeting other people who were into the music and you know we're like how do we get all these people together and you know Vidal started talking about the newsletter and what we were doing with the newsletter and that's actually kind of where it all began where We decided, you know, even before saying it was a newsletter, we made these business cards. It was just a business card that said Eat, Sleep, Shit Techno with an email address on it. That's how you say it. It's for behavior. Yeah. And basically, Victor Carrillo, who's also a part of our crew, had worked at this record store called Higher Source. And, you know, Higher Source carried a lot of pretty good techno. Who was ordering records for them at the time? Hyper worked there Yeah, hyperactive. There was quite a few. No, this higher source, well, he worked at the Huntington Beach one, which was an OC, but then they opened up another one in Santa Monica. Oh, Santa Monica. And he was pretty much in charge of running that record shop. And he used to get people that would come in all the time and buy techno records. And I used to tell him, at the time, you know, Vic would like, you know, we were just the little kids who were kind We would give them these cards and be like, if anyone comes into this record store and buys techno, just give them one and tell them to email us. And, you know, a lot of... cool contacts. That's how I kind of met John Tejada and a few other guys was through Vic. But regardless, we on the streets would run into people who listen to techno quite often and give them the card and then people would just email us and show a genuine amount of interest. into like, hey, we're into techno too. And that's pretty much how the newsletter kind of began. It grew really large quite fast. Yeah, I think you guys have, from the outside, from the majority of people who don't listen to any sort of particularly dance music in general, the sounds you guys like are not necessarily ultimately very accessible. But I feel like it's interesting that your presentation of things and like you guys as people talking about like your version of a street team is like go hang out with someone, have a drink, you know, like just have like a nice chat with them and then be like, oh yeah. And also I do this party, like this really accessible personal thing and this really accessible information source, even though some of them. the music is hard to penetrate, I think, for a lot of people. And I think the music itself is the filter, really. Some people worry, like, you expose yourself too much, you're going to get all these kind of people that don't really like what you're doing and just show up for random. When we were playing, I don't think so. But, you know, at the same time, we just presented kind of in a, you know, cool... widespread way people to pick and choose what they like and people who are generally interested or have some kind of common grounds with it will show up and participate. I think that's what it's always been. I mean, we definitely dump those cards everywhere. I mean, I used to go, he used to be passing by the record stores. I used to be going to everyone's parties, like Green Galactic's parties, some parties that developer Gons used to do, stuff that Santiago Salazar and... Juan Mendes we're DJing at and all these little random shows that I don't even know what the hell is going on and just throwing cards around and meeting everybody and eventually bring everyone together so we could all kind of participate in this you know events and what not and eventually even as artists because now everyone's kind of collaborating supporting each other charting remixing But that was really the start of the success about things. I mean, like I said, a city with so much, a large population, there was a lot of people in the city that was into the music, but bringing them together was actually the most difficult and the hardest step. And we kept the newsletters pretty personal because this is even like pre like massive spam promotional days when, you know, newsletters was. This was a group of people that we had met in person and we had got together. We had a whole list of enthusiastic people who were so sick and tired of a very dry techno city in LA who were looking for things. And when we had this whole collection of people, then it was really easy to send out blasts about events going on around the city. and getting all those people in one place to have a good time. So I think that was a very key and essential part of pulling it all together. So it started then and the party started and you guys, it obviously probably wasn't like an overnight thing by any means. No, it was a struggle. We actually just kind of collaborated with other people too in the beginning, like Duotone kind of helped promote their parties before we even really started doing our own events, which I guess was Interface, which was officially our first kind of series. Mechanism was our first party, but Interface was our first series. Mechanism was just a funny one-off in Koreatown. It was a fun party, though. When did Interface officially start? I think 2003, maybe. Yeah, around August or so. And the first release came later, because these guys are, you know, they... The first release came even before that. Okay. Actually, the label came out, actually, before we had really done most of our first events. Mike, I don't know. I think it came out that summer. Everything kind of crisscrosses over time. Yeah. At Detroit. Yeah, we actually pressed the first Droid record and we went to Detroit and... I had a box full of records that I wasn't even really as concerned so much about selling to make my money back as much as I was trying to give out as many free copies of that record as we possibly could. And I was actually quite afraid kind of going into it because, you know, you're not really sure what people's reactions to this is going to be. Or how you can gauge them if they're being polite or if they're just like, oh, thank you. Well, the story was pretty, they're pretty And this is for the festival. This is for Dent. This is for Detroit. This is when it was still called Dent. This was a while ago, right? Exactly. This is actually the second year the festival had ever been going on. Yeah. Probably 2002 Detroit. But luckily enough to us, the crowd was extremely accepting and very responsive. The first day of the festival, I passed out so many records to all my favorite DJs and heroes and people that we looked up to. And it was like the second day at the festival, you heard the record being played on multiple stages around the festival. What did that feel like? It was really rewarding. Did it feel surreal at all? It did feel surreal, like if it was almost coming too easy, like in a way. You know what I mean? But then you came home and realized that you needed to do a lot of work. You're like, this is the number one place to be for this sound at this moment. And then you came home and you're like, we've got a lot of work to do. Who are the early guys that... When did you guys and Chris Levy get along, or Speedy Jack? That happened far further into the whole deal. Some of the very first interfaces, Dan Bell. We were booking a lot of domestic DJs at the first 10 interface parties. A lot of US guys. Mike Dearborn, DJ Hyperactive. Mark Verbo. A lot of the guys were really just US. because we didn't really have the funds or the connection to get these European guys yet. But it came eventually, you know, and then eventually we started getting people like Neil Landstrom and Surgeon. And we kind of, so a lot of these guys, we were breaking to the US, or to the LA market, because they'd never played LA ever. And they were like, had these kind of legendary names all over the world. But no one had done any shows with them, so we had to make it happen. You've got to take that risk to see, hey, is there actually an audience to see this month in, month out? Interface was always a monthly? I don't know. It was whenever we could. Yeah, it was just whenever we could pull it together. There's never been a set schedule to Interface. It was always whenever we could pull it together. But I think what we really benefited from the most was... LA is always kind of a city in the States that a lot of people look to. I mean, of course, New York as well and LA, you know, being such a very musically central city. And just media in general. Yeah. And, you know, you would get these European techno DJs who would come to the States and they'd play Chicago, they'd play Detroit, they'd play New York, but they never ventured to the West Coast. I mean, they never really came out. Well, some of really pull towards out here. So I think there was kind of a natural attraction to, you know, especially when we first started reaching out to some people, you know, people were like, LA sounds interesting. Yeah, let's try it out. LA didn't birth a lot of like... worldwide legendary DJs in the 70s and 80s. They had a few in the later 90s. Especially rock stuff. Right, yeah. People talk about the rock scene from LA and hip-hop, which is huge. Right. And so... DJ culture, dance music culture, not so big. And most of those situations, the early ones worked out well? Like, people showed up? Yeah. I mean, at that point... You're in a strong momentum going. Yeah, we had a rather strong momentum. And with the newsletter, it's kind of cool. People were very enthusiastic about things. So we would throw a party and blast it on the newsletter. And we had actually a pretty strong following. And I think one of the key things was... You know, keeping the vibe intimate and small and being able to book a venue that you know you can fill. How do you do that with a European, someone who's coming from far away? How do you keep the venue small, the price small enough, and you guys break even? Or now, how do you do that? Or what's the number that you're comfortable with as far as capacity? Where do you set the ceiling on that? Like 400 people? Well, interface has been like... 500? You know, obviously you need to keep budgets down. And I think I briefly had mentioned that a lot of... And more recently, a lot of the acts that we've booked have been within our social circles. This is a slight friend discount. Well, it's not necessarily always a friend discount, but it's also a matter of just explaining to them what the economy and the market is like here. It's like, hey, you can't get paid this X amount of money, and this is what we do. And I promise you, you're going to have a really good fucking time. And they really do. You have some fresh produce. You can tune out. It's nice weather, especially in the winter. be much more pronounced to have like a northern european dj to come come here in december and it's well it is for them anyway yeah it's just another day another sunny day in l.a right but they love it they eat it up So things are rolling in the mid-aughts, I guess now, and things are going along. At what point do things start growing in the sense where you have new opportunities? I think a lot of the kind of, I don't want to say international opportunities that we're kind of... been gaining over the years comes from our production careers not necessarily just our promotion careers like it has a lot to do with ourselves as artists releasing records having these records charted supported by everyone all over the world and people are kind of looking at us like who is this new talent how do we get them on board we're doing europe either it's tours or remixes so that actually created a lot of momentum for us to kind of I don't know, maybe start going over there and start performing and also just kind of raising the profile of Droid in general because a lot of the records that we released are just on that label at first and then eventually we all kind of spread out doing remixes and releases everywhere else. In my opinion, just from what I've seen, is it's kind of a combination of things to be honest. I wouldn't even really attribute it all to our releases or all to what we've done in LA but a little bit of both. Because, you know, in the last couple of years when we actually started touring and playing more gigs, more just hearing the feedback from the crowds of whatever city we visited, you know, first of all, yes, they are into the record label. They are into the records and they do listen to our music. But also as a brand, Droid Behavior has a ton of online media content, you know. People have all seen these videos of interface parties and the elaborate visual installations and, you know, the podcasts we've done, the interviews we've done, and, you know, all the educational process that's been feeded through our... website and I think all of that really contributes to to everything and the interest that has come with us because there are tons of other producers in LA you know or in general who produce tons of records but haven't necessarily been maybe been as active on the touring end of it so in my opinion and anyone can feel free to disagree with me I think it's been a combination of both Really? I mean, there was one particular record that me and Audio Injection had did together. Well, the EP was called Communicate EP, and two of the other tracks, I still cringe when I hear them. But there's one particular track on it called Bottle Opener that... did really really well. We got licensed and charted and that kind of really began with Chris leaving and Speedy J who really put a great deal of help into it all. Chris was supporting it a lot and that one EP kind of got him in touch with me who primarily had asked me to do some remixes for CLR. kind of really helped me break into the whole European kind of world and playing gigs out there. Chris had a really big hand in it and helped me out a lot to actually start getting gigs over on the other side of the pond. But it's stuff that did that your relationship with Chris started in the party like and did you guys bring him in town versus that? How you really got to know him or you just started when he cut the remix request? And then Yeah, it was kind of like he asked me to do a remix and kind of work a little bit closer with the label. And I was like, hey, well, you know, now that we're doing this, you want to come out to L.A. and play a gig? And brought him out. And it was actually a really, really fun show that Chris had played here. Really started a lot of relationships and a lot of things started kind of taking off from there. Okay, let's talk about Interface. What is at its core? Interface is the warehouse or the late night. Right. Dubiously official. The party with the last few things that I had seen and the last one I remember had several screens and a really intense and nice but elegant kind of visual thing going on, a visual projection thing going on. I guess it's kind of the marriage of high-tech music and high-tech audio-visual. Because we really do... want to make sure that we're presenting some very creative visuals at the event. Yeah, that's a really big part of it, the visual part of it. But also, Interface has been... kind of a slowly evolving beast over the years. So what did it start out as? Well, in the beginning, all of us were very inspired of kind of bringing the vibe or techno to the warehouse vibe that we kind of grew up in LA with in general. Just what inspired me to go to quote-unquote raves in the early... And the environments and the venues that they had used, you know, that was kind of the idea of trying to bring interface into that same kind of world. But over the years, the whole kind of visual concept slowly started to emerge into interface. The idea was primarily to build kind of an entire audiovisual immersive environment where people can kind of come in and, you know, the visuals are not necessarily an accessory to the event. I mean, you see visuals at any club or anywhere you go where the DJ's playing and there's the VJ in the corner of the room and he's just shooting shit on the wall and it's just going crazy and nobody really pays attention. No one really... gives a shit about what's going on it's just kind of background noise you know what i mean and you know keeps the club lit up and all that shit but i think the point with the visuals and interface was to for somehow visually enhance the music and the music somehow visually enhance the visuals that makes sense where they kind of worked back and forth To kind of just create an entire like emotion or kind of vibe in the entire room. You know, we had done things where we just kind of keep the warehouse completely dark and black. And people come in and it's just a completely black room. And then at one point when the moment's right. everything just kind of goes off and then you kind of get it. It makes sense. And it's always been kind of like a 10-11 to sunrise kind of thing or like later. LA or California, we have the 2 a.m. liquor law as an official. Some things can go later. You can't serve things, but it's hard to get them at legit venues. But for the most part, if you want to do something, pass two. It has to be unofficial. I mean, yeah, I guess that's how it's been done in LA. Now we're trying to expand and do it out of LA. We did Detroit. We have some other interface events coming up around the US and maybe even Europe. So we're going to be seeing how that goes and we're going to adjust accordingly. Regardless of what kind of legalities or whatnot, our main focus is to present the music that's related to the droid label or just droid experience, as well as the visuals. So that's what our main focus is. The hours, you know, maybe not as important. Yeah, it depends. It can be adjusted. We definitely want to be able to present the music and the vibe that comes from the music and have the visuals enhance that. So that's why we work closely. We've worked with quite a few visualists over the years who've all brought some very interesting things to the table lately over the octaform. from Atlanta who's kind of curating whatever is going on on the screen. Yeah, we've worked with a long stream of different, you know, visualists. And I think another really important thing about Interface in general is just really the more artistic side of it. You know, trying to collaborate with as many artistic minds to kind of set up an environment and do some... creative things in the spaces. I mean, even like the flyers play a pretty big role in the interface itself. Everything plays on everything. And it all plays onto the Droid brand in general. And everything that we do, whether it's the label, the event, the podcast, the record, is all extension of the Droid brand. Everything has to kind of have a certain look or a certain feel. So when people get a hold of it, they understand this is droid behavior. Right. Kind of coming up into like the present, like, you know, you guys have had, let's say in the last like two years, year and a half, whatever, like a lot more opportunities to go abroad as DJs and have other kind of, you know, corporate or other kind of like bigger fish things as things have kind of exploded. And so there's a lot of money being thrown around things. from the corporate end, whether it's festivals or sponsorship tie-ins or whatever. Tell me about how that process works. How do you actually talk about these things? We definitely worked with a few kind of bigger, I don't know if you want to call it organizations, over the years, even from the early get-go's. We worked with clubs like Avalon. We did stuff with Scion. whatever, some stuff with Insomniac. But I think what keeps us, I don't know if you want to say, to our cores, that we always still manage to do our own 100% produced events or media completely separate from that. We don't just do the projects with them. We always have our own things going on. I think that's what kind of keeps us grounded. But we always take on those bigger projects with these bigger organizations because we're also all about kind of spreading the message of our music and exposing our music to as much audience as possible. And again, like I said earlier, the music itself is a filter. We don't have to worry about... well, we spread ourselves so much thin that we're going to get all this kind of crowd that doesn't relate to what we're doing. I don't really see that happening because it's only really going to affect people who really connect with the music and we want them involved with what we're doing. Yeah, I mean, for the most part, the educational side of things really plays a big role in it, too. I mean, it's really easy for any of us to kind of be the stereotypical techno snobs and kind of raise our nose at it and be like, well, we don't want to be involved with those people. But living in a city where, especially we kind of come from a background where trying to build or help add to a building scene in LA, a lot of opportunities working with bigger organizations, should I say, can benefit a lot of people. Because we've seen that happen. We've reached out to people that were beyond our network of what we could get with our small little newsletter or anything like that. We had worked with Scion for quite a bit doing the whole Detroit thing. people who they could reach to that we couldn't that came out and listened to the techno and then ultimately kind of found out about us and our newsletter and now you see them as regular faces at every event that we do. So I think there's still a lot of work to do on the West Coast. We've achieved a lot, and a lot of headway has been done, but there's still a lot more work to do. There's a lot more people that I think could be exposed to better music. Anything else this year? Isn't Dazzy coming out for the first time? We have a lot of amazing things planned for this year, and I'm really excited to see Donato Dazzy in a few weeks at Prime. Talk about the Thursday night thing. Basically, the Thursday night show, which we do almost monthly, we kind of started that to fill this void of between the next crazy interface party and also something that works with our kind of touring schedules. A lot of people aren't here on Fridays and Saturdays. We can't do these weekend shows. We have to route them in on Thursdays for our sake as artists. and promoters and also even for the sake of those artists who are touring who maybe can't pick up these kind of midweek shows and they're really good shows I mean they're really good the vibe and the whole everything is on par with anything on a weekend I missed the Perk Trax one but I went to the DJ Sluggo one before that and I can't remember the last time I saw it it was some crazy ghetto house footwork it was great and it's not what I normally associate with you guys but I feel like You know, you guys represent a lot of different directions of... We actually have very diverse influences and what not and tastes when it comes to like, I don't know if you want to call it underground or electronic, but... And we've definitely presented almost all of them at a Droid party at some point, whether it's Richard Devine, Daedalus, Sluggo, some acid DJs, the hard techno DJs, Minimal, like we've done it all. And we're going to keep on doing it. And this is just an example. Donal Dazzy is not really like, I don't know, DJ Sluggo or Daedalus, which is all stuff that's played at Prime this year. But, you know, we still love it the same and we want to push it and expose it to our crowd and hope that they, you know, love it as much as we do. Yeah, and I guess the last thing I want to talk about was... The other kind of, you know, the Droogs and the Rondas and some of the other kind of stronger people in the community right now, like, everyone is kind of getting either their own heat as DJs or some of the productions are doing this and that. And, like, everyone I talk to is very, like, adamant about, like, being like, no, I want to. take the show on the road but I don't want to move you know I don't I love that Berlin exists or that this exists or that this place that's more of like an obvious like club capital exists but I enjoy my life here so do you guys have the same thing or do you guys have Cali for life Cali for life yeah well we're definitely not moving away from here right but as I said earlier we are definitely interested and working on doing outside of LA. We already did one and it was amazing and I think with that momentum we're going to be able to produce other stuff with a... you know, a great reception. So we actually got a lot of good feedback and even some cool opportunities right after that show. There's always time to hit the road and play gigs for sure. But as far as permanent living situation, I don't know about you guys, but I'm pretty damn happy where I am. I think an important thing for us, like my brother and I, is... to be living here is we have a pretty strong connection with our families and friends. I don't want to, I don't want to lose that. Your literal families and friends. And then also you're like all the stuff you've built over the last decade. There's also, it really actually has a lot to do with our overall success, but the literal family plays a big role in it as well. You know what I mean?
