Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Today, Croatia is one of Europe's foremost party destinations, but that wasn't the case 10 years ago. Nick Colgan Garden Festival was the event that pioneered the concept of the Croatian dance festival and has since become one of Europe's best-loved music events. Colgan's story is a winding and unlikely one. He's travelled the world looking for the perfect party, a journey that's taken him from his home of Birmingham in the UK to San Francisco, South America and eventually Croatia's Adriatic coast. Since Garden's early days, Colgan has been working with Dave Harvey of Future Boogie Records to help program the event. It's a relationship that's been at the heart of Garden's wide-ranging booking policy. As the Garden Festival edges towards its last ever event in July, Stephen Titmuss sat down with Colgan and Harvey to chart its history and hear a little more about what the next chapter may hold. Could you both please introduce yourselves and say your role at Garden Festival? My name is Nick Colgan and I'm the founder or co-founder, the person that started it all off I suppose back in 2006. And I'm Dave Harvey and I am the booker for Garden Festival, shall I say, and I also wear several different hats, Future Boogie Recordings, Love Saves the Day in Bristol, The Wow at Glastonbury and several other. event man with fingers in pies shall we say like i like pies as well i never knew that so obviously we're going into the 10th garden festival guys the lineup's looking amazing it's all looking brilliant but you're gonna stop why are you gonna stop doing garden festival after such a successful 10 years in the game well i'm definitely gonna let you answer that one yeah well i mean this it was it really wasn't an easy decision because it's been It really has been an event that every year surpassed the previous year but we just thought that 10 years is a long time with anything. We've got a lot of things going on and certainly from my perspective My side, you know, I needed to concentrate my efforts on other things that were starting to move. So it was simply a case of just too many projects going on and not really being able to focus your attention on it as much as you might like? Well, yeah, that and like I thought, you know, number 10, when's the next place? Number 15. That's another five years, you know. No, I think it really was. It really was that. For me, it was that, you know. I mean, just to sort of put the sort of other side of it, when this idea was kind of sold to me that it was going to finish, you know, Nick was saying, we really want to go out on a high. It's been fantastic. And we've got these other projects that we want to look at. And I was going, you are joking. We can't finish it. You know what I Yeah, but to be perfectly honest, you know, it's a very difficult decision, but I think it's the right decision. I think that this year is definitely going to be one to remember. So maybe go back to the start, to the 10 years ago. Croatia is obviously a very established festival destination now. Was that the case 10 years ago? To put it simply, no, I mean, you know, it certainly wasn't. I mean, there was a lot of stuff locally going on, you know, throughout the war years and stuff. There was quite a good scene there, but there certainly wasn't any international scene there at all. I mean, we arrived there in 2004, and the reason we did the first garden festival was to try and attract people over there to have a look at what we were doing, to be honest. So, no, the simple answer. that is that no we were the only people there then and when you first announced that you'd be doing a festival um in croatia what was the reaction from people back in britain what did they think of croatia you know obviously you've mentioned it was of course yugoslavian wars and whatnot like Well, I don't think it was an announcement then. It was a few phone calls to a few mates, to be perfectly honest. We said, look, we've been living over here. Come over and have a look and bring your records with you. And that's kind of how it started, to be honest. What we did, when we first arrived here, we realised, in Croatia, sorry, we realised how beautiful it was and I was totally ignorant to the fact that it had like a... over a thousand islands and a beautiful coastline and wonderful history and great sea and, you know, the weather being. We were totally, you know, ignorant to that fact. And I just thought that it needed, you know, it needed something else. You know, there was something missing from it. And yeah, and that's how it starts. And we're going to talk a lot about that first part. Dave, you were actually at the first one. What was your involvement at the very first event? So basically my business partner, Steve, he already had a relationship with Nick, DJing for him and so on. And he basically was like, yeah, these Brummies are starting this rave in Croatia on a beach. And I was like, what? And he was like, yeah, I'm going to go out and play if you want to come out, Wicked. And I was like, brilliant. Took my tunes with me. in a slightly over-enthusiastic manner, was like, any chance of a set? And got slotted in, and that was kind of how it all started. So you effectively blagged your way onto the lineup more or less? Yeah, basically, yeah. Did we pay your flight that year? No. Okay. So Nick, you've got a really long history before all of this, before Croatia, working in the music industry. we've got limited time, but you've got such a history. I want to go into some of that, you know. So maybe first off, you know, you were in a... Boy band as a kid? Is this right? You know, I read this on the internet. Can you talk me through this? Yeah, no, believe it or not. I was in a band called Boys Like Judd. I was 18 years. I remember I worked in a shop in Birmingham city centre and this guy called Barney, anyway, he came into this shop and he said, listen, do you play any instruments? I said, no. He said, well, it doesn't matter. You look. You look all right. Do you want to be in a band? And I've gone, well, yeah, of course. And anyway, we set up, we started this band and the bass player was Martin Reckie from Fash. And anyway, we ended up with being managed by the Barrows Brothers, who also managed Duran Duran. And yeah, you know, we kind of almost made it as a boy band. So how did that end then? Because obviously, you know, you're not a pop star now. No, no, no. I suppose, you know, we had, I can't remember, to be perfectly honest, how long it was. It ended when we all realised that we weren't going to make it as pop stars and we needed to get ourselves proper jobs. But you stayed in music, so what happened next? Oh, wow, bloody hell. I think UB40 probably happened next. I mean, in the band, in Boys Like Judd, the drummer was the drummer of UB40, and James Brown, who I've worked with kind of all my life, really, I suppose, in music projects. And, yeah, no, I went to work with UB40. Well, I was working with UB40 at that point as well, you know, touring and whatever, in the studio. looking after their outside productions. like Star Company Productions and Earl's stuff and that as well, yeah. So from there, you know, it seems there's a period where you went to America. Like, how did you end up, you know, travelling to both South America and the USA as well? I went to South America with a band called Electro 101 first and we went to do this. We were working with ID Magazine. They had this, like, world tour thing. We were on tour with, I think with Graham Park and Nancy Noise or something like that. And anyway, I went to, we went to South America to do a tour over there with Electrode 101. And I met a guy called Martin Gontad, who now runs Creamfields in Argentina. And I ended up staying there for like three, three, four years. And what were you doing over there? Well, yeah, we put on parties, basically. We put six parties on a year for guest genes, and it was called Dance Energy, if I remember rightly. I think Paul Oakenfold was the first. first guest we had. Paul O'Connor was obviously massive back then. Were these big raves? No, no, no. He wasn't massive back then. I think we paid him $500 or something like that. Can I mention what he... Sorry. It's okay. Paul's been paid a lot of money now. It's fine. Basically, the guy that I work with, he used to get a budget from Guess Jeans. We just put on the production, so it certainly wasn't about money. And they certainly weren't big, although they got bigger towards the end. Great. And then I read that you ended up in San Francisco running boat parties. How did that come around? Well, my partner now, Eddie, he married a girl from Los Angeles. Well, he married a girl from Los Angeles. Married Gail and moved there. I can't remember what year. But, yes, so anyway, they had a shop down on Lower Hague called Bulletproof and started doing these boat parties around the Bay Area. And then I kind of, like, went from South America up through San Francisco and we met. up again and yeah started doing these boat parties amongst other things. They sounded pretty special you know was it was they going around the kind of the bay area and? No they were I mean they were really I mean it was they were really special you know and it wasn't just the boat parties we did these things at a club called Miss Pearls which was right in the Tenderloin and you know possibly one of the best clubs I've ever been to you know I mean it wasn't really a club it was a hotel. a motel but a very special place and yeah I suppose time timing's been quite quite essential with everything that we've done you know I mean I look basically but we kind of time things right I have to say as well they were definitely more legendary than he's letting on there because in the last couple of years when I've been in San Francisco I have people who don't know that I know them talking to me about the Bulletproof boat parties. And I'm a bit like, I know those guys. And they're like, no way. And I'm like, yeah, I do actually. Yeah, no, they were totally legendary. I mean, everybody and I couldn't. list the name of the people that played there but a lot of people that were involved that made it very special. Amazing and obviously boat parties are a huge huge part of the Garden Festival what is it about boat parties that engender such high spirits it would seem? It's the same with, like, I don't know, like going on a bus tour, isn't it, I suppose. It's like as soon as people get outside of wherever they are, then they feel as if they can let go a little bit more, and I think even more when you're underwater, you know. And also as well, what you are, if you think about it, the voyages now for the Garden Festival, they're four hours long. Being four hours on a boat with 200 people, then you Yeah, totally. Captive audience is a huge part of it. It is quite special. It's kind of like when we first went and did them, we'd done a few parties in Bristol on boats and it was kind of like, we'd always be like, just add water and then it's like everybody's just hyped up. straight away and even more so at gardens I think I mean the first year we did I think we did two boat parties the first year last year at Tisno we did 54 boat parties last year which is quite incredible I mean at the garden we do 22 boat parties and I really can't believe it and we really can't get a boat big enough you know So after San Francisco, you moved to Croatia. Was that 2004 that you first went over there? Yeah, no, I came back from San Francisco. I went from San Francisco and I went down to the Barra, Mexico. And in 1994, got married in San Francisco. And 1994, went back to the UK. and then spent some time in the UK. And then I was there for about three or four years in the UK, and touring around again with UB40. And then, yeah, we came to Croatia on a holiday. And it was... first just a holiday that you went there like obviously you stayed much longer what made you want to stay we were invited by a friend to come and have a look at a place to let's go and have a look at his plate you know to see his place where his family lived in this little village and we were totally totally ignorant really to how it was and I mean, I knew it was part of Yugoslavia, but I didn't know it was like on the coast. I didn't know there was a thousand islands. I didn't know anything about it, to be honest. And we came there and had a holiday for two weeks and really, like, I don't know, fell in love with the place, the look of the place and the people. Obviously, staying there from a holiday, you ended up opening a bar. That seems like quite a jump, really. It somewhere? No, everybody thought I was absolutely barmy, including my wife, really, to be honest. But, I mean, I don't know whether you've ever been to the Gardens of Zadar, but we were taken to this venue in the old town of Zadar on the walls, and it had been derelict since the war. And I remember going in there and just thinking, oh, you know, what a place to open a bar. Although I'd never run a bar in my life, to tell you the truth. Had you ever wanted to own a bar before? No, nor my wife. We hadn't got a clue. But anyway, we did it. And what happened was, we were there in August, and then we went back in October to have a look at this place. And then they gave us ten days. They said, look, you've got ten days to make your mind up. And I think if we were given any longer than that, then we probably wouldn't have done it, to be honest. And I've gone just, yes, let's do it. And Charlotte, you know, she is possibly the beyond every good man. so the garden Zadar set up it's the bar that you run that's all going again it seems like a massive leap to start running a festival you know so how does that go around well I'll tell you what happened there what happened was we opened in 2004 in the summer, you know, all guns blazing and everything, and we had to get the staff. This is a total lounge bar with beds and everything, and there was nothing, nothing like this in Zadar or on the Dalmatian coast at all, and we had to get the staff to actually lie on the beds to let people know that they could actually lie down on the furniture. So it was then, in 2005, we realised that, hold on a second, we need to do something to attract people over to make it a bit more international, I think. So kind of the original one was mainly set up just as a way of kind of showcasing the area, really, like you had fallen in love with it. I don't even think we even thought that deeply about it, to be perfectly honest. Which, I mean, it makes me sound absolutely stupid, but no. What it was, we were looking for something different. We were looking for something different to do, maybe to move out of Birmingham. We were in Birmingham then, and don't get me wrong, I mean, I love Birmingham. It's my home city. But we were looking to do something different. I think that was more the reason for us entering into the bar game. Again, it's brilliant listening to you saying this now in a sort of like sensible one because I've heard several different stories ranging from... Yeah, we got there and we were like, we could do a bloody great rave here and so on and so forth, which I hope happened because that's the way I am. No, well, listen, I mean, you know, it's always, isn't it, whenever I go to a place, and it drives Charlotte mad, you know, whenever I go to a place, really and truthfully. I'm looking to see whether it's a good place for a party, to be honest. And this was a great place for a party. What makes a good place for a party? Well, yes, that's a great question. Well, first and foremost, the location. The location obviously makes a great place for a party. But moving on from the gardens, I don't know. I don't know what makes a great place for a party. Somewhere like Petruchina. Petruchina was like somewhere where you go And you fall upon, you know, you're not invited or you actually find it like, I don't know, like by just walking around. I was walking the dogs. And you get there and you just think, Jesus, this is something special. I want all me mates to come and have a look at it. Yeah, I mean, in fairness, that site, because, you know, as I said, when we went out there, we literally had no idea what to expect. We were like... raved by some brummies by the sea okay and we got there and it was just like this is like something you might see in a film like you know yeah the crazy sort of like 70s club a beach bar looking out onto the sea. But even that, you know, I mean, what Dave said there, it's like we really did this. We stumbled across it. I lived up the road. After we were stoned in the garden, we realised that, well, not realised, we wanted to do a party, basically. But we quickly found out that the garden's adder wasn't the place to do the party because of noise restrictions and the... you know, the people that lived above us, let's say. But anyway, so I'd moved to this place called Petrichana, a little fishing village 13 kilometres away. And I was walking the dogs one morning and we saw this club that, look, there was me and Ed, saw this like, it wasn't a club, like a circular... concrete building and I remember looking and thinking what the hell and this is on a so it's on a peninsula as well like on a headland which is like the most really really quite beautiful and I think what the hell is it you know and then we've as we got closer we'd like we'd like realise that it was it was a nightclub you know that hadn't been used for since the 80s it was built in 1967 and anyway so So Eddie's going, you know, let's go and get the keys. And we managed to get them off the director. We got them off the director. I remember going in there and it was cool. I can't remember what it was called. But we've gone in there and this place hadn't been touched since like 1974 or something, I don't know. So you just literally stumbled across this disused nightclub in a beautiful fishing village and you thought, this is the place that makes a great car. And you lived there? And we lived there. I could walk to work. It was perfect. And then we set about, yeah, and then we've gone, okay, well, let's see. And then I've gone to the guy that owned the hotel who actually owned the club and that as well and said, listen, how about if we did a party here? And to my surprise, he's gone, yeah. And so we did one. Amazing. So the very first one, did it cost you a lot of money to kind of get off the ground and convince people? Yes. Yeah, it cost. Well, no, it didn't cost a lot of money because what we did was just invited friends and family. But of course, the production and stuff still costs. And I remember at the end of it, I remember, I mean, we did not several things wrong. We did everything wrong, to be honest. I remember waking up the first morning, the morning after the first night, and Eddie phoning me and going, like, have you organised clean-up? And I've gone, what do you mean, organised clean-up? He's gone, well, who's going to clean the site up? I'm going to have to cut in here because you did the exact same thing on the... the first year of Tisno and there was me, you and Eddie and a couple of people who'd been up all night cleaning up that bloody beach bar for about three hours. I think it's good for the soul for everyone to get involved. It reminds you of the graft. Yeah, exactly. I remember actually that first year we had a refrigerated lorry. that was calling down the booze, and he had to get off on the Monday morning, and it was a fish lorry it was, so the smell wasn't that good. And I believe, I remember having Luke Unabomber, Phil Cooper, there were no faking, everyone just unloading this lorry, and then having to leave on the afternoon after. So Dave, you said your original knowledge of this event, it was just a crazy Brummie that was running this event in Croatia. You came to the first one, you DJed, what did you make of it all? Well, I mean, to be totally honest, my head was a bit knocked off by it because, as you say, I didn't have a clue what we were going to. I knew it was these two Brummies and that was essentially it. and it was on the sea and then, you know, we got there and there's this ridiculously beautiful little cove, a beach bar looking out into the sea, this amazing club with then not only the club but like the outside of the club with like these sort of like sunken dance floors and I mean, it was like picture postcard and it was, I mean, it was, everybody was like, what the bloody hell, it felt like. I imagine people felt when they went to Ibiza first and they were like, wow, what have we discovered? I think a really important thing to say here, which I've hoped we've been able to keep... for the ten years that we've been going, is the feeling there. The feeling was quite special, you know. It was like a... You know, it was. It was a family. It was like a getting together of, like, a group of like-minded people that really... Like that, you know, everyone chipped in, you know, if there was something that needed to be done, everyone did it. There was no VIP areas. There was nothing like that, you know. Was it all because it was friends think possibly that certainly had something to do with it in the in the start of it but then like i say you know the following year then it was like oh to be honest me and eddie i remember me and eddie sitting there in we did it in june actually i remember sitting there in july and thinking oh Do we really want to do that again? You know, or, you know, not because we had a bad time, but, you know, like financially, I don't know whether we could have possibly done it. But then the feedback from everybody was like absolutely incredible, you know. So it wasn't a financial success, the first one. No, it was a disaster, a financial disaster. But to be perfectly honest, it really isn't the whole thing. It's not financially pushed at all, you know. But it ain't about the money. It really isn't about the money. It's about the lifestyle, I think. I've got to say as well, like, coming from the punter's perspective, you know, I came away from that just being like, oh, my God, wow, that was, like, really special. I can't remember how many people, 300 people, something like that, Pretty much everybody who I met on that trip, they're my really, really closest friends now. And they're coming back now. And they're still coming back now. And it really was like everyone, it was just like collective experience of just like, wow, that is... just ridiculous so obviously the first one when you decided to do another one even though there was you know questions but yeah when did the events start getting bigger you know when did it feel like it started kind of taking off i'll tell you what happened in 2007 we moved it to july because we found out that it was just bloody too the sea was too cold for a start and we couldn't rely on the on the weather as much so we moved it to july for 2007 2008 we went from i don't know like 800 people to a couple of thousand people. And then 2009, it got a bit, not out of hand, but there was like, I don't know, 3,500 or something like that. And that's when we fought then, and that's when we were like... made a conscious decision to cap it at like two and a half thousand people because logistically it didn't feel right. You know, it was like... And that's fascinating that you would cap a successful event because that's not what most promoters do when they get... bigger, they tend to go bigger and bigger. Did you feel that you would lose something if you went bigger? No, 100%. We'd lose everything, I think, if we went bigger. We'd just become like a one-off event in a beautiful place. But what we wanted to do... At that point as well, there was people that were involved with us, like the electric elephant lot or electric chair lot, sound wave lot, that had been coming to our events and said, how about if we do something? So we thought, well, hold on a second. Rather than us double our capacity... rather than the village take a, you know, rather than it be uncomfortable in the village, because that's another important thing. You know, you have to include the whole, you know, the people that live there. How about we do more events? And that's how it started doing. You also did one year where, well, I say we, but I was involved by that point, did one year where it was over two weekends, which nearly killed me. The double whammy. That was... That was my idea. What a stupid idea. It was 14 days. So hold on, take me through it. The event lasted for 14 days? Yeah, basically. We had two separate lineups, and, I mean, it was just out of order. I tell you, it was the first year. It was after 2009, so everyone's got all 3,500, too many people, and I thought, yeah, you're right, you're right, let's do it over two weeks, but it didn't quite work It didn't quite work. It was bloody brilliant. No, it was absolutely brilliant. There was a lot of casualties. But we kind of do the same thing now, really, with Electric Elephant. We do that same thing. It's a garden festival that goes straight in to Electric Elephant. So it's actually 13 days of partying. So I suppose, really, though, when you started to bring in other promoters to that site, That really was the beginning of Croatia as more of an international festival destination when it wasn't just one festival, it was more than others. You really were the first. No, 100%. I mean, we did Outlook. The first Outlook festival was in Petruchina. We did Outlook festival in Petruchina. we soon realised that the guys were on to something special but he didn't fit with our venue he really didn't fit with our venue he caused us problems within the village because whatever reason it was just a bit of a younger crowd really wasn't it they were a little bit rowdy well they tagged the church door for a start so that didn't go down well with the priest there was a bang on the door at 6 o'clock in the morning Do you know, like, Z-E-D? I don't know who the hell's that. But that's really interesting as well because you, well, certainly your festival has remained a very good relationship with the local community. How have you managed to do that after 10 years? Because that can't necessarily be easy all the time. I really do think that the most important thing, if you look at everything that's going on now event-wise, I mean, we live there and I've lived there for 11 years, so it's my home. So I kind of understand how the local... people feel, you know, and we've always really, it's always been really important to include them, you know, and it is important to include them in every decision, I mean, of course you're not going to please everyone all the time, but it's important to include them, and rather than them think, oh, we're going to come in and we're going to take a load of money and then run off, you know, that's like... I mean, also, you know, it definitely has to be said, you know, we were discussing this earlier, the crowd that you get at Garden and the other events on that site and the general vibe means that people just don't tend to misbehave. As I said earlier, last year there were a few, we'll call them scallywags, who I knew from other events around the world. who were all there and I was a bit like, ooh, and they were good as gold all weekend because the thing about it is if you misbehave, you really stand out and I think that it just creates a real, like a level. It's self-policed, isn't it really? Yeah. like security and stuff like that. It took us a while to get that right, to be honest. At first, certainly on the club, I remember when we first opened Barbell, they just wanted to kill everybody that came in. It was like, hold on a second, like a little smile or something like that. And then I remember Charlotte. Charlotte bought more pink T-shirts. And they weren't having it, you know, they weren't having it till the end of the tour. So we're skipping on a little bit now. We're talking about, obviously, we're talking about Tisno and how you moved to there. But, you know, that's probably worth some explanation now because the current garden site is the second garden site. And it's very different to the first one. How did you, again, how did you stumble across that site? I think that's the story in itself. No But we didn't want to leave Petrichina, number one. And we didn't realise, we didn't know that we had to leave there until I think it was the October, it could have been the November, so we were already in the flow. So basically all the events were in the flow and we hadn't got a venue. So what we did was we invited everybody over. all the promoters over for, like, an emergency meeting. So I went, all right, lads, well, we haven't got a venue. And in the meantime, Eddie and myself were up and down the coast looking for a new place, which is where we found Barber Ellis, the new Barber Ellis. Because at first we found this place and thought, well, maybe we can do it there. But we were kind of like, I suppose a bit like, you know, like, you know. not maybe we can do it there. It certainly didn't feel like us finding Petrichina. It was like we would have been a bit pushed. But then I remember, it was the Wednesday afternoon, I remember getting a phone call from Eddie, and he couldn't even speak. He was like, he was seriously like... And he really couldn't speak. I go, well, Ed, take a few. a few breaths, he's gone, and then eventually he's come out, he's gone, I've found it, I've found the place. So anyway, I've jumped in the car and drove down there and it was incredible really. I suppose it's important to kind of say what the actual Garden Festival site's like, you know, because it's quite, in the best possible way, quite bizarre. It's like an ex-military, like, kind of holiday camp, or is it? Yeah, well, yeah, it was owned. Yeah, well, that was the next hurdle to jump over, really. I mean, what it is, it's in its own bay, and it's also in a natural amphitheatre, so we don't affect or anything, there's no residence. For the first time, it had its own accommodation on site, so we've got 80 apartments, we've now got Airstream trailers and Shikar tents and stuff. You know, like it was, it belonged to a company called, well, it still belongs to a company called ENA, which is an oil company, and it was where all their families in the socialistic times had their... holidays for generations and generations so yeah so it is kind of like a you know it's an odd place but an amazingly beautiful place so the barbarellas club in tisno is an absolutely amazing venue like for my money one of the best clubs i've probably ever been to in some visually in many different reasons well how did you thank you for that well second that second that How did you find it, though? Because it wasn't a club at the time. You kind of stumbled across it again? It was when we were looking for a new venue. We had Barbarella's in Petricana, which was on site, basically. I mean, the whole festival was built around the club. And we felt it important that, I don't know, a club is always different to a festival. So it was always important for us to have that. But when we found the Barbarella site now in Tisno, that was where we were first thinking of doing the festival. We've got another 5,000 square metres at the back of that and we were thinking maybe we can get away with it, doing it there. But it wasn't right, it wasn't big enough for a start. But anyway, so then we found Tisno. When we found Tisno, then we thought, well, hold on, we haven't got Barbarella's. And then I've gone to Eddie, I've gone, well, listen, how about the place where we first looked at? Let's turn that into a club. You kept the name Barbarella's between the two venues. Why was that? Well, originally, the first club that we ever went to, me and Eddie ever went to, was called Barberos in Birmingham in the 70s. I don't know, it must have been 77, something like that. But it was like, you know, it was an amazing place where I would get in one week and then I wouldn't get in the next week. And then, I don't know, we wanted that connection with Birmingham and stuff. It was owned by my friend's dad, Eddie Futrell, who was the king of Clubland. And we decided to, you know, keep the name and Nicky's logo as well. He wasn't really happy about that. Well, he was actually. He was all right about it. But I had to tell him. So one thing I do want to say about the Garden Festival generally, it seems like the bookings are quite well thought out. The music policy in the daytime is quite Balearic and things like that. Has that been a conscious decision over the years or is that something that's, you know, that's the way you think you should do it? Well... Yeah, definitely very conscious. The setting lends itself to, you know, that style of music, which we've definitely got to start getting people to start terming Adriatic for the future. But for the minute, we'll go with Belair. But, yeah, no, the setting is, you know, it's like it's perfect for that sort of music. You know, we've had times where... I've had my wrists slapped, shall we say, for having a little bit too pumping music on in the daytime, essentially because we're trying to include as many people as we can. And for some people, it's their only set of the weekend and they're like, this is my headline slot, whatever. But generally, people get it. Sorry, I'm quite excited about it. Dave suggested that we do an early morning thing from six till midday, which is a scary thing for me on a logistical side because we've got people. trying to clean up the site and generally as well things can kind of get messy and at that time of the day on a festival site. But, you know, Dave suggested and spoke to the international field guys and they programmed the Friday, Saturday and Sunday, I think. Just Saturday and Sunday. Just Saturday and Sunday. But hopefully you'll be there on Friday trying to set up. I will be, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I'm really looking forward to it. Like, so total ambient music, you know, on the beach and stuff. And which I think, you know, it's like it's the perfect setting for it. I'm personally really excited about Like, I really want to do this chill-out session. And I was a bit like, chill out, we've got to come up with a better term than that. But yeah, I kind of get it. And we sort of discussed it at length. And I think it's going to be amazing. And everyone wants to play, of course. Yeah. That's kind of what I was getting at there, you know, because I go to a lot of festivals. But you very rarely see... programming that's thought out in a way that takes away from DJs playing big beats at festivals and things like that. You know, a lot of, I'd say, you know, 40% of your programming is thinking about playing relaxing music during the daytime, which is very unique for a festival. Do you know what? I'd like, I'd like to sort of. take credit for that but actually Electric Elephant are very similar they're in a in exactly the same way they've got a very similar I think it's the venue as well isn't it it's like you know I mean and I think also like DJ DJ wise you know I think they really enjoy the fact that they can go down there and play wherever they want you know and that's like you know it's a big thing you know sometimes those sets can be like you know up there with the club sets because It's just you're looking out on that sea and you're playing some bloody... Exactly, the club as well. The club for me. For me, the club, because the first time ever it was outside of the festival site, it meant that people had to go that seven kilometres, whether it be by road or by boat, which was a great way to get to the club. But it was seven kilometres outside the event. For me, it was like a breath of fresh air. It meant that you could be all day on the festival site and then you can go home, have a bit of dinner, get changed, come down to the festival site for a bit and then go out. It was like a breath of fresh air, I thought. And I think the DJs are like as well. And the club nights, for me, are very, very special. What's been your favourite club night in the new setting? Because obviously there's been many options. You guys must have a favourite. Well, I'm going to have to say Future Boogie. What else can I say? But seriously, Future Boogie, I think it encapsulates what we're about. It's not about big names or whatever it means. Excuse me. I've never seen as many people in the DJ booth in all my years. But there's been so many. Now that Nick's luckily saved me from having to blow my own trumpet there, Craig Richards last year was literally out of order. And everyone was in there. And there's all these like... proper seasoned DJs and pros all just literally losing their shit on the dance floor and being like, this is amazing. And being part of that is... With Sunsea beating that, a lot of the American DJs, it's really nice seeing them getting really like... Kerry Chandler loves playing there. I don't know, there's been so many people that have played there and no-one's come away going, I tell you what, I don't want to play there. In fact, it's problematic now getting them to play on site. Everyone wants to play the bloody club. Literally, it's one of those situations where DJs just naturally up their game. And like, you know, everyone who we have playing at the festival is a really good DJ. That is, you know, we don't just put people who are names. We put people who are bloody good DJs. But in that club, everybody is like, they up their game and now loads of people will play things that they probably wouldn't play anywhere else because they might be like, oh, it's not quite cool enough or whatever. But in there, it works because it's that special. One thing that's probably worth clarifying for people who haven't been to this club, we haven't really even said this, it's completely open air. It's a garden. It's a garden. But when the sun comes up, you obviously get a really special moment and I've heard some great music played in those scenarios as well. It is a very unique place to be playing, I guess, all in all. Definitely. And I think that... That outdoor thing, the sunrise thing, it means that it can go from absolutely banging, having it right off, to really groovy and interesting for the last hour or whatever because the environment, the situation lends itself to doing that. and it's it's it's magic i think even the bus journeys from the site to the club are interesting you know i mean i've had some great times the bus is a great boy i have to say it's all about the speedboat to the club like literally on the speed james bond no but it's just like you're just on it going how the bloody hell are we getting away with this this is ridiculous so One thing I do hear a lot of people say, I'd be really interested to get your thoughts. A lot of people say that Croatia is the new Ibiza. I don't know if I necessarily agree with that, but what do you guys think? I certainly, I mean, I don't agree with it, you know, I think Ibiza is Ibiza, I mean, it's a great place and a beautiful place and with so much history and, you know, so much going on now, I think Croatia, I think, I can kind of understand where people start talking about it because, I don't know, the first year I went to Ibiza was 1989, I think I was in Ibiza and is that kind of... of vibe I suppose where everything's a bit like but you can't compare no no they're two very different animals it's like completely different Ibiza as you say is Ibiza plus the other thing with Ibiza is you have such a huge concentration of the same. I mean, how many people go to Ibiza? I mean, I haven't got a clue, but millions upon millions upon millions. Whereas what we do in Croatia is kind of like, you know, they come because of what's going on. It's still, like Croatia's still very specialist, actually, if you look at the line-ups that are over there. You know, even like your high darts, which is probably the most... mainstream, I guess you'd say, from the British promoters. You know, I don't even know how big Hyde is, but it's not... If, you know, like, the masses can't go and see 50 of their biggest DJs in a week within the space of 10, 15 minutes' drive, you know, it's only kind of like one offering at a time. So therefore, you know, Croatia, it doesn't have that sort of like critical mass to be like Ibiza. And it's a lot cheaper. It's a damn sight cheaper as well. I've been to Ibiza a few times this year. Jesus Christ. Yeah, I suppose they're all really good points. What I often think when people say it's like Ibiza, I think they think it's like the Ibiza of the 80s or something like that, where the frontiers are all new and there's open-air clubs and things like that. Yeah, I mean, do you know what, though? The majority of people that say that never went to the early Ibiza. It's like this kind of myth that they've heard about. So they haven't got anything to compare it to, really. But no, there's definitely parallels with that kind of, you know, I mean, you can't, is there an open-air club in Ibiza these days? I don't think it exists, does it? Okay, yeah, but I mean... But it's very different. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But one thing that I do find really interesting about Garnet Festival, you know, you can talk about it in loose terms like vibe. things like that but but i do find that the crowd are very well behaved and a good example would would be last year I was there on your Secret Island party. Actually, when, you know, it's so, for people who don't know, the Secret Island party serves food and things like that. And at the end of it, I think it was you, Dave, and Soul Clap guys were like, okay, everyone clear up. And actually everyone did clear up after themselves, didn't leave any litter. That's very rare to kind of get that at a festival. It is, but I think in that... instance or that situation it's such a special thing and it is totally unspoilt before we get there it's like the old days of free parties you know what I mean you'd go to these free parties and it'd be in the middle of nowhere and it'd be trashed by the end of it because everyone's like chucking their cans around but then at the end everyone would get around together and clean it all up and you'd leave and you wouldn't even be able to know that people have been there no exactly I mean we're party for the day and everybody's aware you know and I love that I really do like you know because if look if it didn't happen then we wouldn't be able to do it again the following year you know it's like so everybody is it's like uh it is like It's quite lovely to watch. It is really good. It's really good. It's funny because the guys who we know from Burning Man disco nights who are coming to do a boat party this year, like Burning Man is completely like zero tolerance of any kind of litter or anything, even to the extent of faggash, you know what I mean? And they're kind of like... What are you guys up to in England like they see photos of Glastonbury and they're like what on you know? Like how is it got to that and it's I think with things like Glastonbury There's always been like a safety net of people cleaning up after people. Well, there's been an army of people doing it Yeah, do you know I mean but in Croatia on that secret island or whatever it's less, you know that it that isn't there So people are more responsible It seems easy now you're saying it to kind of, you know, encourage people to do these things, but most festival promoters don't do things like this, you know, like what makes you think that, you know, you have to go the extra mile? It's probably Eddie running around shouting, to be perfectly honest. Put that away! Clean that up! Do you mean in terms of going and doing a party on an island? Yeah, absolutely. That's always come from Nick and Eddie because they're like, oh, Dave, bloody hell, you won't believe this island we found. And I'm like, you what? You want to go and... OK. I'll tell you about the secret. I was invited by the mayor of Tisno, the mayor of Shibinik and the mayor of Myrta, which is the island. for me to go and have a look at certain venues and stuff. And we got to this island. The mayor of Murto is, I don't know, he's only 28 or something. Anyway, they took us to this venue, and it was after we'd found Tisno. They took us, and we just go, can we do a party here? And he's just gone, well... Yeah, as long as you clean up after yourself. It's as simple as that. Yeah, no, it really was as simple as that. And I think it's looking to the future. I think it's something that we want to offer more and more because it's not so much like a weekend event. This is like a holiday with a musical backdrop for one of a better... to say without blowing too much smoke up your ass as you sat next to me but I love that about you and Eddie the fact that you know for example when you went to Petruchina you're like fucking hell we could do something really amazing here and you know when you went to that island most promoters don't do those things they literally don't because it's kind of like they've ticked all the boxes that they need to do but you're almost as excited now as whenever. And you see these opportunities, you're like, I mean, I'm the same. I go, I could do a great part here. But I've always found it very inspiring about you two. Sorry. Thank you very much. Funny enough, I remember last year on that secret island party, the mayor was on that. boat in itself you know i can't imagine boris johnson going to fabric the man of murder and his mate were on that boat and you know what they were trying to do convince me to have it on another another place that they found that was bigger you know i don't know i don't know whether we could have more people was that the place that was a monastery or something like exactly that you know what i mean i mean come on watch this space well yes So I think we're getting from this conversation that pretty much any place you go, you think how good's the party going to be? It's going to be there. Yeah, I suppose that's the way I think. Yeah, or, you know, the party or the vibe or the, you know, like the, yeah. So clearly since you started doing the garden 10 years ago, there's been a massive influx of festivals in Croatia from all areas of the world. Do you think it's sustainable, the kind of increase in festivals that are going on in that country? I think it is, you know, but there's, of course, you know, everything can reach saturation point. But, you know, I mean, but look at Ibiza. I think what you've got to do is kind of define yourself or, you know, like kind of like create your own little niche as such, you know, and then do what you believe in and carry on with that, you know. Look, what's good will carry on and what's bad will fall by the wayside, basically. I think the last few years... actually have kind of proved that there is a you know at the minute there isn't a ceiling on it there is the sort of market and whatever and also the space for the different events because at present actually all the events have got their own kind of identity and whatever and you've got like the bigger events like dimensions and but then you've also got the smaller events that you don't have to be like you know smashing out there's also hip-hop events now they're starting as well you know so it seems like you know it's becoming a much wider thing than no exactly you know you know we want to do a beer festival yeah amazing i guess generally um you know and you would have great insight into this you know how do you think it's changed the image of Croatia these festivals because you know we talked 10 years ago people might have had connotations about you know the Yugoslavian war and things like that now it's a party destination right yeah well I mean I suppose it's one that Dave could answer more than me because I mean I live in Croatia but I mean Yeah, there was two major things, I think. Number one was opening up travel to get to the coast in Croatia. But yeah, I think people were generally a little bit kind of put off about what happened in the 90s and stuff. But once they got there, then nine out of ten, they come back. And I think, yeah, the party destination is quite a statement. The thing about it is, you know, it's kind of like, I mean, there's a multitude of reasons why it's become what it has. And I think it ranges from the fact that in those early days, it was so cheap. You could get a flight for 100 quid. You'd get accommodation for 20 euros or 20 quid, whatever a night, you know, and it was ridiculously cheap. So therefore, it just spurred on a load of people to come out there, even just to give it a go. And then once they got there, they were like, bloody hell, wow. And then I think what's now happened is, you know, if you want to go and listen to the biggest house and techno DJs in the world. and that's your thing, you can go to Ibiza and that's catered for, but it's really expensive to the point where it's prohibitively expensive for a lot of kids, whereas you can go to Croatia and you can still afford it. I mean, it's got more expensive, but you can still afford it. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, that more specialist music thing, like Dimensions, you're not going to go anywhere else in the world and get that sort of... programming and range of... And the venues as well. Oh yeah, of course, the venues and the location, the landscape, everything about it, but just in almost like a practical sense, it's like... You know, we obviously discussed this is going to be the last garden festival, but Nick, you're not... retiring or hanging up your boots, you know, you're still going to be busy. Can you say some of the projects you're working on? I'm running off to Mexico. No, no, no. I mean, the place has now opened a brewery, like a craft brewery in Dalmatia. The reasons, I mean, I've been, I was probably two years trying to convince. Dave that it was the right way to go and also what we do after but I think you know what I needed to do was free up my time to look at other projects that I was working on and stuff but it doesn't mean to say that the Garden Festival stops, you know, the Garden Festival as it is stops but then you know we'll certainly carry on into the future And can you give a bit more information about how that's going to work? I think we should mention Mexico, plans for Mexico. Well, okay, yeah, we can mention Mexico. I mean, you know, again, we were looking at doing a tropical garden, we were looking at doing, and we went to the Philippines, and a friend of ours has a great festival over there called Malasimbo, and we went over there and we had a look, but logistically it would have been an absolute nightmare. but now we may have found a place that we can set up something for, I don't know, December, January 2017 in Mexico on the Oaxaca coast, which we're quite excited about. I'm going over there for a couple of months at the end of this year to have a look. really excited. I know, yeah, yeah. But no, I am really, really, really excited. And is that going to be somewhere that's going to be, you know, easy to get to or not? Or is it a bit more off the beaten track? No, I mean, it's certainly off the beaten track. I mean, it's... There's no direct flights there for a start. I've never been there and that's why I'm going out there this year. But you have to go via Mexico, so it's not got that kind of, you know, it's not like a one-stop shop, let's say. But I think now, certainly with our connections with San Francisco and the disco nights and the LA guys and stuff, you know, I think it's time that we started to have a look further afield. And the fact that when I sort of spoke to a few people who would really like to get involved in it and I went, oh, you know, it's like six or seven hours. And they were like, six or seven hours? That's nothing. And I'm like, right, OK, well, that's definitely the spirit we're looking for. And I suppose, you know, the million dollar question is, is what happens next at Tisno? Because I know the Suntra Beat guys are carrying on. There hole are you guys going to carry on doing something that you know there'll never be a hole really and truthfully you know it's the start of the season and and of course you know we've we've already filled that hole I think I suppose Dave should fill you in about yeah okay yeah Nick said like a couple of years ago he's like going oh yeah you know like oh do you want to take over and that? And I was a bit like, well, yeah, cool. You know, thinking that he meant as garden, you know, continue. And I mean, we do quite a lot of the sort of like pre-event work anyway, obviously booking and all the rest of it. then last year he's like, right, next year's going to be the last one. And I was like, what the hell are you talking about? He's like, no, that's it, that's it, that's it. And at the time I was like thinking, oh, you know what, I'm just going to let him have his little moment and his wobble. He's obviously just having a wobble. And then it's like, you know, a few weeks later he's like, look, look don't want garden to finish garden is like in many ways been the making of me I met my wife there you know my future wife should I say you know I've made some of my best friends you're getting married there we're getting married there You know, I'm like, I don't want this to end. Please, can you reconsider? And he's kind of like just gone on and he said, look, you know, essentially you're doing a lot of it anyway. It's a logical progression. You know, you're as much a part of it as we are now. Anyway, we decided in the end. Am I going on? No, you weren't going on. You were going in the right direction. But I think what we did in... the end we decided but what we decided to do was to to carry on you know to carry on things but like under dave's uh flag bearing yeah leadership so do we have a name for the for the new event the name is love international and it's kind of like i love the name shout out to tom pain for coming up with that one love international um and it's great no i'm really looking forward to it's the you know the same team involved and it's going to be fun. So in a way it's the end of an era but also the beginning of an era. Going out with a bang and then starting off with another bang. It is very much like a natural forward progression. It's the only way forward. It's that special that I certainly don't want it to end and neither does anybody else. I mean I spoke to a lot of people, I spoke to a lot of DJs who come and play for us friends who came and play for us and told them kind of like unofficially because I wasn't supposed to be telling people that it was finishing and I said what do you think about us taking over and they were just like fucking do it do you know what I mean like who else is going to do it and And with that sort of enthusiasm, then we were like, okay, cool. Because at one point I was like, it's a bit of a poison to tell us that because garden is so magic. How are you going to fill the boots of that, you know, a week, a year later and be like, oh yeah, cool. It's brilliant. But fingers crossed. No, it is. It's going to be special. Bye. Bye.
