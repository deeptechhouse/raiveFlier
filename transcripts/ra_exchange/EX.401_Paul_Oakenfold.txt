I knew that I'd been mad in love before. And how it could be with you Really hurt me baby Really hurt me baby How can you have a day without a night You're the book that I have opened And now I've got to know Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. Our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Paul Oakenfold. In 2018, Oakenfold has done all there is to do with a DJ. He helped bring about paradigm shifts in dance music and contributed to its rise into an international concern. His hallowed 1987 trip to Ibiza helped kick off the Balearic movement, and he was in the thick of the Acid House explosion the following year. Within the space of a few years, he was one of the most famous DJs in the world. He took electronic music to the masses with a huge array of remixes and opening sets for superstars like U2 and Madonna. As Matt McDermott found out in this conversation, despite his myriad achievements, Oakenfold still got the competitive spirit that drove his career to such giddy heights. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Paul Oakenfold is up next. We are at Paul Okenpold's studio. Somewhere in the Hollywood Hills, we've got about 10,000 LPs and 12 inches on the wall, a few guitars, and a lot of movie posters. And from what I understand, you've had something to do. Yeah, every poster on the wall I've either scored or done cues for. familiar some not i'm sure to you uh two dj consoles um and obviously the new denim setup and uh a few uh bits and bobs memorabilia that i've been presented with or gold discs when i toured on the jaeger meister transmission tour is what it is i suppose it's part of mine there's all the wards i want up there there's another story it's certainly got character this room and you have a lot going on currently you've just had a graphic novel come out, The Wonderful World of Perfecto. Last year, you were up at base camp at Everest. You also launched the EM Awards. Wow, last year was a busy 100 years. Yeah, so what's your day-to-day like? Are you still working 12 hours a day, 15 hours a day? Yeah, I mean... Just to break it down, the Mount Everest Base Camp event was something that a friend of mine came to me a few years ago and asked me if I would ever contemplate DJing at Base Camp Mount Everest. And I was like, yeah, you know, I mean, that sounds amazing. not really realising what it entailed. And then once we got permission, because it's a national park, you can't just go to base camp and put on an event. We didn't want to do that. We certainly wanted to do it in the right, respectful way. which was get permission, raise money for the local people who live on the mountain and bring something to the table. And that something that we brought to the table was recording... these musicians, recording these monks from these monasteries en route, and making a track through electronic music. Could we merge these ancient sounds with today's modern electronic sounds? So we set off to do that, to raise money, to do an event and to record a track. And that took a process of three years to actually get it over the finish line. And then we didn't know if the equipment would work at nearly 18,000 feet. And I didn't know if I'd work. I mean, I'd never hiked or slept in a sleeping bag. So suddenly, be careful what you wish for. You've got to prepare, train, work out. And we pulled it off. We actually did it. And it was a huge achievement personally. We raised a lot of money for children and music. and we shot it in VR. We made a documentary that will be out sometime this year, and it was an amazing achievement that took a long, long time to do, as was the awards. I mean, the awards, I felt that in this space, we're coming of age, we're 30 years. Club culture, as it's known today, started in late '87, where everyone started to look at the DJ, everyone was focusing on him and the music that he was playing. Of course, prior to that, there was electronic music. The DJ was in the corner, no one was really taking much notice of him. Of course there was a, you know, obviously bands and artists making electronic music, but club culture as it's known today. came around in like in 87 so i felt that along with a few of my colleagues that it was the right time to come together and and uh pull off an electronic music awards for for our space and and that's what we did um so we're moving it into this year uh which would be the second year and and It's all about supporting the community, being part of the community. And we've had great support from everyone. So the Electronic Music Awards, the inaugural edition was last year. And you honored originators like Juan Atkins and basically threw a party in downtown L.A. But one of the things you said there. In 87, that's when dancers stopped looking at each other, started looking up towards the stage. And that's something that has continually happened throughout your career to varying extents, you know, being on the main stage at Glastonbury, being on the main stage at Coachella. in your initial nights out at the Paradise Garage, do you think anything's missing with that relationship? I mean, look, I think if you're a music fan and you're a fan of DJs, when you are at Paradise Garage, you're in awe of the DJ. But he's miles up there, you can't see him. But the general crowd are dancing and we're looking at one another. What changed was that suddenly the whole dance floor focused on the DJ and all looked in the same direction. 30 years later, we're doing exactly the same thing, but we've got a telephone. in our hand and we're either turning around and going, look at me with the DJ in the background or you're taking a picture of the DJ. That was... the big shift that really brought it home to, I think, the community worldwide. In terms of being a DJ and listening to other DJs, I've always looked up to the DJ, or even if I'm at a bar talking to you. I'm listening. I'm listening to everything, you know, I mean, because you're a fan. Now, I'd say the biggest change is that, is technology has made it easier for everyone to be a DJ. And a lot of DJs are in it for the wrong reasons. They're in it for the obvious reasons of fame, fortune and girls. Back then, there wasn't none of that. It was about all that music that you see on that wall. It was that passion. There wasn't no money in it. It wasn't a career. You made a career out of it. I studied to be a chef. I was... studying to be a fully qualified French cuisine high-end chef. And then I was doing that because that was the love and passion. There was no money in that. And I'm very fortunate that I made a career out of that. I think that's... to your to to what you said earlier on was probably why I'm the first in in in a few things is because there was no there's no one for me to look up to there was no one doing comics doing Everest playing on main stages working with you two on Madonna there was no DJs doing that and I never felt that We should just live in a nightclub. I don't, you know, DJs are hugely talented individuals who produce music for other people, produce their own music. I mean, look at some of the greatest producers out there. Calvin Harris, he's one of the greatest producers. He's had as many hits. in Britain as the likes of Elvis or the Beatles. I mean, it's incredible when you really break it down and look at the facts, how some of these, you know, Dre started as a DJ. You know what I mean? If you watch that. That movie, Straight Outta Compton, which I did, I wasn't aware that Dr. Dre started as a DJ. And he's one of the greatest ever producers. Point being, you know, I think with this whole community, it's now become a global community. It felt right with the awards. You know, I'm in a wonderful position where I can help give back and support. And these opportunities come along like the comic. I'm a fan of comics. I got asked if I would like to do one. And I was like, yeah, why not? And that's really how these things come along. It's not me sitting there going, wow, I want to go up to Mount Everest. I didn't even think about it. It was just, you know, a friend came to me and said, would you ever consider doing it? And, you know, while there are these sort of outsized opportunities where you're breaking new ground with the awards as well as the graphic novel, 2017 was also like a back to basics year for you. A couple things that were interesting to me were on the Generations compilation, for instance, like. That's an amazing compilation that's getting down what Alfredo was playing, tracks like the Manuel Gauteng edit or Carly Simon's Why or even Born Slippy and stuff like that. These are all on a 54-track compilation called Generations that attempts to sum up. some of this music's importance. It seems like you're sort of giving a primer to some people. Are you trying to... Is it a nostalgic thing or are you trying to show a new generation, no, this is where I come from? That's a good question and the answer is the second part of what you said. We were rolling into 1987. I was inspired by this DJ that I came across. in Ibiza and it became a 30-year cycle and I sat there and thought well I'd like to share that moment with the young generation that only ever read about it would never experience it and never see it and never really understand it So I was like, well, why don't I put this down and document it? Don't put all the obvious tunes, but put the records that explained and shaped a culture and go out on that and play three-hour sets on vinyl. on that new media player, mix it up, take you on this journey, explain, share, educate what went on. And that was the idea. And again, be careful what you wish for because when you're pulling vinyl and you've got to carry it around airports and you're lugging boxes of it and... Then you're playing it and it ain't like just mixing on a CDJ or a media player where it's all locked and you just press play. You've got to really work these tunes and you're going over this spectrum of... The quality of sound, the story you're trying to tell, the BPMs, the tempos are vast. There's a tremendous amount of work that goes into it. Saying that, I really enjoyed it. I wanted to just share that moment. I've done it. I've moved on. This year is about 1988 and that Spectrum Sound, which is Acid House. I haven't played Acid House in years. So now I'm like trying to find all these old Acid House records, which was fun. I spent a month doing that. It's good. I mean, it's not a retro set. I'm just jumping back into a few tunes. A lot of it's current, as you came in and you can hear a lot of current tunes, but I dropped some of those old tunes in from that period because, especially in Britain, I mean, there's every week. There's now a party based on that 1988 sound. So to speak of that era, another first that at the time people didn't necessarily know about. You wrote the first article about Acid House. in London, Berman Segoe's Balearic. I've talked with some other people about this era. This record collector, Mark Seven, told me that Early in 87, he tried to throw an acid house party and just everybody looked at him like, what are you doing? You know, it was still like the soul thing. And then like six months later, everybody had smiley face t-shirts like the change was quick. Yeah. Because you were DJing hip hop until two, and then you'd start the after hours. So you watched the change happen, and you felt like London was ready for it at the time. Well, I knew not only I, but a few people. The change was ecstasy. That was the big change. It's difficult to take ecstasy and dance to hip-hop. You know, it's a different meaning, a different sound, a different lyric. Hip-hop, obviously, and it doesn't work with ecstasy. Ecstasy is euphoric. And the electronic sound and the meaning behind it and the melody and the emotion and the lyric, I'll take you to the promised land. Lyrics like that, we are, you know, positive lyrics. I think that played a huge important part. That played an important part. Timing played an important part. We were in a depression. In the UK, it was difficult for young people, you know, with what was going on with Margaret Thatcher, who was the Prime Minister in England at the time. It was hard if you were a kid, and we were. And along came this music, along came this drug. As I said, the timing was there and a few people had this attitude that we're going to change shit. That's why it's really interesting what's going on with these kids in Florida because as much as it's going to be incredibly difficult to change anything in this country because, you know, America... It's the land of cowboys who grew up with guns, right? I hope they change something. And we did. Our generation in England, we changed something. We... completely went against the system, against the government, against what was going on, against the law of the land, and we changed it. And it wasn't easy, but we had this movement that just became bigger and bigger and bigger, so much so that you'd find 20,000 kids in a field. in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night, and the government, the police, the system had no idea how to deal with it, and they were bringing in these laws to shut it down, and no matter what they were doing, there was ways and means that we would just become bigger and more support, and now look at us. We grew out of, I'm a working class guy. that grew out, as many of us did, grew out of a scene in 1987, 1988, and changed the landscape of British culture. It's interesting, when I was talking with Alex Patterson a couple months ago for a similar exchange, who played the VIP room at your club, Land of Oz, that's where the orb... as it came to be was formulated, he said, you know, the thing about those times is they were great, but if you lived through them, you don't remember much of them. Yeah. I mean, it's... But I don't know if you're meant to, because it was about being in the moment. There was no phones. There was no-one running around with cameras. There was no-one documenting it. It was freedom at the... ..at a real moment where you were living. How difficult is it to live in the moment? How many people... live in the moment and they don't think about tomorrow, they don't think about next week, don't think about bills that they've got to pay, they are totally free and they just want to be there at that moment with like-minded people no one no one's worrying about anything right so to now say i don't remember it you're not meant to really i mean you were having this time of your life And as strange as that sounds, that you don't remember it, because it wasn't about the memories, it was about being there. Now... As you grow older, you know, you remember certain things, but that's a very interesting question because I think if you asked a lot of people today, actually remember what went on, they'd probably sum it up and say it was just amazing times. You know, those generic answers. It was great. It was friendship. It was love. You know, but then you just say, do you actually remember on 1989 on that? I ain't got a clue. You know. And just to reference Alex really quickly, he also had an A&R job just like you for EG Records. And you were with Rush Release. and by 93, you were playing stadiums with U2, sort of odd, circuitous route to that. But what I wanted to say is that... By the time that you were bringing Acid House to London, you already had a good business head. Well, I learned that. I didn't have it. No, that's not true, actually. My dad taught me a good lesson, which I share with your listener and you, and I think it's very important. So I signed a record called Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, which is Will Smith. I signed it to a record company in the UK. I went in the recording studio and I did a remix because the arrangement of the song didn't work for the UK. And it became a hit. It became a pop hit. And it sold. It went on to sell hundreds of thousands of records. And I never got paid. I did the remix, I signed the record, and I never got paid. And I sat down with my father and I explained this situation. And he said to me, listen, he goes, why do you think it's called the record business? And I sat there and I went, what do you mean? He says, it's called a business for a reason. And you're in that business. So go away and learn the business. Otherwise, you're going to continually be ripped off if you don't understand the job that you're doing. And I sat down and I was like, oh my God, that's right, I'm in the record business. So why not go away and learn about the business so I don't get ripped off? And I did. Now, I'm not saying I know, I certainly don't know the business changes, and now you have lawyers and managers, but I had none of that. And my advice is, you know, to anyone who's getting in the business, get a lawyer. You've got to have a lawyer, you know, to help you. As we were talking about... after the club, you become one of the first sort of touring DJs at that point. And then after this U2 remix, you end up behind your turntables in stadiums at that point. And I was curious about the sets that you were playing at that time, because I was envisioning these massive... opening sets for U2 and Madonna, but you're still playing the crowd in that instance. Oh, yeah. I mean, when I've gone, I've opened for, apart from... Madonna and U2, I've opened for Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lenny Kravitz, played huge main stages like Net Aid, which is Live Aid, Nelson Mandela with Beyonce. I've played a lot of those big events. You read the... crowd you know you go into it when you know going okay This is not about underground electronic music. This is a mass commercial crowd that want to hear songs. They want to connect with the artist who's performing, whoever that artist is. So I would approach it in that way. I would play my remixes of... a Justin Timberlake or a Snoop Dogg or a Madonna. You know, I would play electronic music, but with all my mixes that I've done for all these different artists. So that was the connection. That is how it would kind of work, where I'd drop in my mix of Nirvana if I'm opening for a rock band like U2. It would be my mix of Rihanna if I'm opening for Madonna, which is more of a pop act. So I would tailor my show, but it's still all my mixes. And then I'd drop my own tunes in there. But yeah, I mean, that would be my approach. That's how it would work. It helps when you have about 700 remixes as well. Yeah. I mean, and if there's something that I haven't remixed, that's a big, you know, like sense. Situation Rolling Stones, right? I didn't mix that, but I did a bootleg version of it, which would, because I know it would work, you know. So that's it. You mentioned something interesting about that first Fresh Prince and Chazzy Jeff remix that you made. where you said this isn't going to work for UK radio. I know how to make this work for UK radio. And that's like 1984, 1985. What do you mean by that exactly? And does that still inform your remixing now? Yeah. The structure of the original was wrong. It was, the hook didn't... come in at the right... So there's a traditional structure with, let's say, radio music, right? And that original... from Will and Jeff, wasn't structured in that way. So, because it was a rap, it was a free-flowing rap, and then the sample would come in whenever. So I restructured it and remade the beat and the bass line more friendly for the UK market. I mean, I grew up... listening as we all do in Britain. We have one radio station that plays to the whole country and it's a great radio station, Radio 1. So I grew up listening to Radio 1. So for me, it was all about understanding, you know, structure and it was the way it's just there in the background. listening to it and you still study songwriters like burke baccarat and like yeah i mean i i've i turned this studio into a writing suite and i really you know i'm dyslexic i find it difficult to write songs but I understand structure arrangement key lyric subject matter because I've worked with a lot of good people yeah one of the things that you've mentioned in other interviews is when you're working with a vocalist you just sit there and brainstorm what's this song actually about and this is what's happened with like Cher for instance you guys just Yeah, it starts here. So I'll have a rhythm. I'll write a rhythm that works, let's put it that way. So I test it in the nightclub. So you'll come in, I'll play you this track and I'll say, look, this has been road tested. It works as an instrumental and here's what I'm thinking. you know, whatever the climate is, whatever's inspiring me, whatever I'm feeling, I'd be like, look, I'm thinking this is a subject matter. And in terms of a chorus, something really uplifting and memorable with a strong hook. So then you, as the co-writer and putting down the demo vocal, will start. coming up with a few ideas, then we brainstorm and then we just flush it out, you know. Or I may just put it on a loop and say, I'll leave it with you for 30 minutes in your own space and then I'll go up, make a cup of tea, come back down and then we, you know, we jump into it. Whatever that process is to make you feel comfortable. in terms of a collaboration, because I've already done a lot of it, because I've already done the instrumentation and played it out, so we're already halfway there with something that works. And that's the benefits of being a DJ, rather than picking up the guitar over there and starting from scratch. I already bring a lot to the table before we start. It's interesting. Something that's been coming up in this interview is this will work for UK radio. This works in the club. This is how you DJ to 50,000 people. There's always this idea of like, there are these people out there. I need to make them happy. I guess on the opposite end of the spectrum, you have these kind of dour experimentalists who are like, I really want to express what I want to do. It doesn't matter if only five people are listening. Well, I have a wealth of experience and knowledge. It didn't just come, I learnt that. And I do do what I want to do. I don't think my new artist album will do as well as it could do if I made it radio-friendly. My next artist album, I've recorded with an orchestra. I have hip-hop singers on it. I have pop singers on it. I have unknown singers on it. Some of the songs are commercial. Some are not. It's exactly what I want to do where I am in my life. I don't... I'm not worried if it's a hit. I'm not trying to be a pop star. I'm not concerned with even doing a lot of media or videos. That's where I am. It's very self-indulgent. Now, would I like people to enjoy it, share it, listen to it and like it? Yeah, of course I would. You know, I grew up... in a moment where sharing in a moment in music where sharing is good. It's why would I want to write a piece of music and not play it to you? And if you don't like it, fine, you know, there's no, it's, um, I'm not. that worried if you do fantastic but i don't write music for just me to listen to i like to share and give and support and help that's who i am as a person um so we shall see I mean, I'll play you a track before you leave and it's pretty out there. You won't expect to hear what I'm going to play you. Now, I don't know if anyone's going to like it, but I really like it. It's really challenging me and it's really exciting to really push the boat. your somewhat interesting interview because you've had a, what I would call like Damascus moments throughout your life. The first one that you've referred to is your dad being like, you know, it's called a music business, right? Like an actual business. The second one watching out. Fredo at Amnesia. Or Larry Levan at Paradise Garage. So there's three right there. Let's talk about Goa. Oh, my God. I got lost in Goa. How did you arrive there? Through my friend Ian. Ian Paul was a traveller and he came back and he's like, this is underground scene in Goa. I'm like, Goa? India? He's like, you've got to come. And Ian knew all about music. And when Ian says, you've got to go, you've got to go, because Ian's on the real crisp and front line of underground music, or he was then. And I'm like, all right, you know, I'm off, I'm coming, let's go. And that's where we found psychedelic trance. And I was like, oh, my God, this is outrageous. You know, this is 20 odd years ago. And it was just so exciting and so cutting edge that it really inspired me. It's hard to find. in this day and age, things like this anymore. The world's... It's not the way it was. We're all aware of that. To find something underground, different, fresh, new, exciting... will always be difficult because we have social media that puts it out there straight away and it's gone. It's not that moment. Yeah, how has being an A&R changed for you? Are you signing stuff off of Instagram videos? No, I mean, you know, I'm not. I mean, music's disposable now. It's 25,000 dance records. a month or just on Beatport alone. I mean, it comes and goes. Unfortunately, it's not special no more. The days where you buy that album with an Andy Warhol cover, where you'd look at the artwork, where you'd frame the artwork, where it would be something that you would be proud of. I mean, you don't even give anyone anything physical no more. It's just online and you stream it. You don't buy it, keep it and save it. The older generation do, but music's not like that now. So I'm not here to change the game. I'm here to be on the pitch playing. To go back to Goa, though, you put out this mix in 1994. Have you heard that? I have, yeah. And it kind of presaged some of your film work to some extent, because you were pulling in the Vangelis. Would you say that that trip that your friend Ian said you had to make, that changed the course of your career as well, right? that visit. Yeah. And can you explain how? That was an important moment in my career because I really embraced that sound, I embraced that moment and it was really inspiring. I mean Wherever I go, if the inspiration's there, I'm very lucky. You know, 1999, I'm playing at Burning Man. You know, we're in 2018 and there was no sound systems when I was playing Burning Man. You know what I mean? And that was an inspiring festival. Now it's a common festival that everyone knows about. So Goa was edgy, it was underground, it was different, it was exciting. It ticked all those boxes. that really wanted, I really wanted to come back and be incorporated. those sounds in what I was doing at that time. And that sort of predicated the rise of this trance sound at that time as well. Well, it was the foundations of trance as we know it today, for sure. 2000, you move over to the States in 1999, wasn't it? Yeah. Okay, and... At that time, this is another instance where you go somewhere that not many people in your field are. Like, you went to Burning Man that year. in 99 um this sort of like big beat thing had sort of come and gone at that point like that was like more like mid 90s like 96 97 but you find yourself in the u.s and what's what's the climate like for electronic music at that period oh well it was underground i mean you know i'd come to the u.s uh with a different mentality. I wanted to tour America in the right way. So I just focused on being in America and playing everywhere. So I would go up to Alaska, to Birmingham, Alabama. I would be going to places where no one was going and playing electronic music. And I would be making CDs and I'd be giving them out free in the crowd and I'd be really working it and laying down foundations. I was bootlegging my own mixes. You were like a missionary. My God, I've never heard anyone ever say that. Oh, my God. Something about America has stuck with you. You've been here for 20 years at this point. Well, I had no plans to live there. I scored that movie Swordfish again. If opportunities come your way and they're really big moments in your life, it's scary, you're insecure, you don't know whether you can do it, but you've got to embrace it. Because if you don't embrace it, you may live to regret it. You can always go and do it and then realise it's not for you and go back. How has functioning in Hollywood been for you the last 14 years? I've been very lucky that it's embraced me. You know, from these films you see on the wall. to playing on the Hollywood Boulevard, to playing at the Hollywood Bowl twice. I mean, it's become my home. This is now what I call home. And when I was born in London, I'd certainly say, you know, I feel that I'll be here for the rest of my life. To get into another first. You also sort of broke into the Vegas market, like in terms of like an every Saturday residency. I came out of all these films and I was working on doing less and less DJing. And I was getting itchy fingers. I was like, man, you know what I mean? It's difficult to start flying all over the world and come back and do this. So why don't I do a residency? Because I've grown up on residencies. I was a resident at the Ministry of Sound, Cream in Liverpool, Home in London. So I thought... If I find somewhere where every Saturday I can be, then I can work on the film in the week, then I have my show and I have a balance. So I started to look at, well, am I going to do LA, New York and Miami? And I'm seeing... I don't know, there's something about Vegas and there was no clubs going on like there is now. There was nothing. Most of the hotels didn't even have nightclubs actually. And then I looked at what the Maloose were doing and they were a young hotel. And then we figured out a deal where every Saturday I would fly up, be the resident, and the room was a big room. We could make a show out of it. No one knew if we'd get that amount of electronic fans because there wasn't no one doing that. And we built it out and we made it happen and it changed the landscape in Las Vegas. It shaped the culture that came out of it. It was nightclubs and electronic music and now... That's what dominates Las Vegas. I mean, and we, you know, they all started to copy us, all the other hotels, and that was understandable because if you've got 4,500 people there every week, people are like, well, hang on, they're spending a fortune. We want a piece of that. And these other hotels had... Bigger budgets, more money, bigger nightclubs. And I'd done my stint. I'd done it for three years. And I was like, you know what? This is enough now. Vegas, I've done my Vegas stint. I know it's very commercial. I feel like you sell your soul. I want to go and do other things. So I moved on and, you know, and it is what it is. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, you laid the groundwork for an economy where at least for a period of time, that place is like the win. EDM was doing more revenue than gambling for, for. A little bit of time there. I'm sure, you know, when we were doing our pool parties, I was doing, at the Hard Rock, I would do my Saturday night pool, my Saturday day pool parties, where we'd have 4,000 people there. And then Saturday night, we'd have nearly 5,000 people there. We were well ahead of the curve and then everyone was doing pool parties and everyone was doing nightclubs and then it becomes really difficult for all of these clubs to compete. But it is what it is. That's why it has to be extremely commercial and that's why I was like, this ain't for me. I'd done my bit. Okay, so, you know, you started up a boffo Vegas residency. You played main stage at Coachella before Jane's Addiction. You did Glastonbury Day, 80,000 people. But then last year you were like... I'm going to Pike's. I'm playing the tiny room. Yeah. You know, and, and what was pop up for four weeks? Yeah. Harvey did something similar as well. Like what, obviously that place is steeped in the lore. Yes. Of island mythology. But how was that? It was great. It was free. It was guest list. Go online, register, and come along. And, you know, it got a little bit too crazy, though, because we ended up having like 1,000 people. And, you know, it wasn't meant to be that crazy. But I said to Alfredo, I said, listen, I'm going to do a pop-up. I'm going to make it free. It's about, for one moment only, this, the crowd that comes. whether they've seen you or me or they haven't, they can hear this music that inspired us based on that mix compilation, Generations. So, Alfredo, I'd like you to play the music that inspired me when I stood there looking up at you. I'd like you to do the same. Play that moment just so people can come and go, oh, wow, that's what it was all about. That's what it was like. And that's why it was so great. That's why it was such an incredible, wonderful moment, because we're never going to do it again. I just wanted to do this little pop-up, and it was a lot of fun. Yeah, I heard the recording from the first night. Did you? Yeah. You know, you're playing The Cure, you're playing all over the place. Yeah, literally all over the place. So now Acid House. Yeah, so now I'm not going to do it this year. I'm not going to do a pop-up. I'm going to drop some of those old Acid House classics. I'm going to do a special gig. in Ibiza for Clockwork Orange, where I'm only going to play that moment because I don't like going back and doing retro sets. So I will do it because everyone's asking me. So I was like, okay, I'll do it once, possibly twice, and that's it. Do you have any tips for aging gracefully in dance music? I think I am. I think that it's a difficult moment where you look yourself in the mirror and realise, you know, that you are coming towards the end of your career. I've got over that moment where I don't need to compete with a 20-year-old DJ. You know, I'm not the new kid on the block. I've been doing it... for many years and I bring a lot more to the table where I can help that young DJ and I do with a lot of the artists that I sign to my record company that's where my strength lies so you know I still enjoy going and playing at these clubs but You have to, all of us, not me, all of us will come to a moment in their life where they realise, all right, this is where I am, I'm changing, this is what I want, this is what I enjoy, and maybe that isn't what it was, you know, 20 years ago. I've done that. I don't need to go back and prove to anyone. I don't want to, most importantly. In the same sense, through all these accomplishments, you obviously are a competitive guy. Sure. And so this has been like an interesting, like, philosophical change. It is because, you know, you do, it's a difficult moment to take your pedal, take your foot off that pedal where you are competitive. You want to be the best. You are the best. And then you realize that. There's a life, there's a cycle in life and it's quite hard to deal with because, you know, we live in a world where you want a new shirt, a new restaurant, a new this, a new car, a new... Everything's new. You want a new laptop, you know, and I'm not new. I'm not new. You know, it's... It is what it is, but if you're the best at what you do and you work at it really hard and you bring a lot more to the table and you're respected in that way, then you are going to be around. And that's the way it is. I heard it all before Thank you. Thank you. Outro Music
