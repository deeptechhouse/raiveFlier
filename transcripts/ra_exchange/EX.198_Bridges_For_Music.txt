Thank you. Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Valentino Berriassetta worked at Amnesia in Ibiza for a number of years. It was an experience he enjoyed, but the island's hedonistic and sometimes shallow lifestyle left him feeling unfulfilled. He'd long been interested in dance music's capacity to create social change, and he came up with an ambitious plan to start a non-profit organization based on this very idea. Bridges for Music aimed to use music as a tool to bridge geographical and social gaps. They set up workshops in South African townships with globally famous DJs like Richie Horton and Luciano, and the events were warmly welcomed by the local communities. Now, with plans in the works for permanent music spaces in South Africa, and beyond, we met with Barry Assessa in London to find out how he bought it all together. Thank you. So I understand you worked with amnesia in Ibiza for many, many years. That's right. Yeah, that's right. I worked for four years in Ibiza. And yeah, it was an amazing experience. And could you explain your role and kind of how that looks? Yeah, I was working as the brand manager, as I said, for four years. And yeah, I mean, you know, being an IP, obviously, it's an amazing way to make contacts, to experience the industry at the maximum level. And it also kind of makes you open your eyes, you know, and see a lot of stuff that... you know, make you think in a way, you know, and where the industry is going, you know, and what you want to do with your time, you know. And Ibiza has great, great things, you know, I love the island. But you also kind of see some kind of meaningless things, you know, and things in the industry that actually were not the real reason why I started in this industry. I started working in the industry, running my own record label and club in Valencia, a club called Barraca, which is one of the oldest clubs in Spain. It's now, I think, 65 years old. And where we had the pleasure of having, you know, the likes of Richie Horton, Luciano, Laurent Garnier and all these guys. And that was actually the real reason why I started in the music industry, my passion for music and being in touch with the crowd and with the people and bringing people together through music. And obviously working in Amnesia for some time, it becomes a pure business where you're focused on building the brand and selling tickets and it becomes more so half a pure business. So you say perhaps that things end up getting in the way of the music a little bit and in situations like Ibiza yeah I mean obviously you know like clapping Ibiza is a it's an enormous business engine you know and When you work at some positions, you might not even listen to an artist in the whole summer. You're working in the office 9 to 9, probably 12 hours a day. everything is last minute. We work with different promoters every day. We are open for 120 nights in a row. And that's pretty exhausting. At some point, you kind of forget why you are working in this industry. What is your job entirely exactly? Basically, everything around the brand. So basically, I built the whole marketing department, which didn't exist when I arrived to the club. Funny enough, you know, because everyone thinks Amnesia might be a huge club with a huge structure, but it isn't. And yeah, I basically built the whole marketing department from the PR department, online marketing, franchise, etc. Everything that had something to do with the brand. All the partnerships we developed, partnerships with MTV, with BlackBerry, with Pioneer, with Native Instruments. So, yeah, that was my role, basically. So do you remember when you started to think that maybe it was time for a fresh challenge and, you know, maybe the... the lifestyle had kind of run its course for you a little bit? Yeah, talking to other people in the industry and friends that I have met have done throughout this journey, we kind of all had the same feeling and we were feeling that the industry has a great opportunity to give back and to bring a lot of positive impact to new territories where it's developing. And we also felt that there is a common trend in the industry where artists want to kind of give back, you know, and they are realizing the power they have in their hands, you know, and the strong engagement they have with their audiences. So talking to the guys that are actually now on our board, yeah, we decided to create this nonprofit platform that kind of gives a platform to the industry to... gather all together and try to develop it in a responsible way. So it was almost like a direct reaction to the Ibiza lifestyle in a way. Yeah, I think that was maybe the spark, you know. Obviously, we all know what's going on in Ibiza, you know, and not only in Ibiza, you know, many places around the world. I mean, it's not only Ibiza. I think whether you go to Vegas or you go to... even in London, you know, you can find places like that, you know, and there's a lot of show off. There is a lot of VIP. There's a lot of, you know, things that are actually totally the opposite as what music is supposed to do. You know, music should bring people together. And sometimes when you go to a club music, no, not music, you know, but it's dividing people in a way, you know. And I think you find it everywhere. So it's not only about Ibiza. So I'm interested to know, how did the idea start to come together? What was the early form of Bridges for Music? Well, traveling around the world, we all discovered how electronic music is arriving to every single corner of the world, and even to underprivileged communities, whether you go to Brazil. And you go to the favelas there and you see how small kids are starting to play electronic music. And obviously going to South Africa was the final spark, you know, because in the townships, as you know, we get house music is the biggest music genre. And you walk through the townships and you see how everyone is into deep house. You know, you hear deep house coming out of a hairdresser of a cab. of a shack, you know, and you discover amazing talent trying to build their careers with no resources. And seeing how electronic music was arriving to these places made us also think, you know, the power electronic music is getting and an amazing opportunity we have working in the industry and having the contacts we have. to actually do something good with it. Do you have a long history with South Africa? When did you first visit the country? I visited the country for the first time five years ago. And actually it was for a totally different reason. I mean, as a tourist, basically. And by then I went into the townships because my girlfriend at that time, she was studying responsible tourism and she was into slam tourism, you know, which is becoming very, very popular lately. There's a lot of tourism going into these areas and there's a big ethical discussion whether that's ethical or not, you know, like looking at poor people. Is it like a poverty safari or is it really a good opportunity to engage with those communities and leave something positive? You know, that's basically what she was researching. How do you feel about that issue? I think it's definitely a great opportunity if it's done well. There are tour operators that bring tourists to the townships. and don't share anything with the community. But there are others that are very responsible in actually creating a revenue stream for the community and creating a cultural exchange. It depends if you go there with your camera and are taking pictures to the small kids. You have to show your friends overseas how cool you are going to a slum. Then obviously it's nothing positive. If you go there with the intention of really getting to know the real culture of the country and engaging with the people there, then it's definitely something good. And I wouldn't actually be doing what I'm doing now if I wouldn't have gone with a township tour into the townships. Yeah, sure. And this is something you said that you'd maybe done in other places. You'd kind of alluded to, you know, you seeing things in Brazil and like other places. Yeah, 100%. Actually, when I went to Brazil, I went to the Rossinha favela in Rio de Janeiro. And I went again, for the same reason, I wanted to discover the community. And I went with a guide that was recommended, because he was also very responsible. Going through the favela, I don't know how the conversation happened, but he told me he was running a DJ school. And I was like, really? Wow. Well, I work in the music industry. Can you show me? Or yeah, well, I mean, it's very casual. You know, I teach the kids from my living room at home. And he was telling me how he was saving money for buying a new mixer. And I felt, wow, that this guy is doing such an amazing work for the community and is struggling to buy a new mixer. And obviously when you work in Amnesia or any club in Ibiza, you get equipment sponsored by your sponsors and it just gets you a phone call. And the brands want to have their products there. But I was sure that the brands like Pioneer or Native Instruments, any of these brands, you know, would like to give this guy some support. But they didn't know about him. And it's all about connections, you know, connections count. And that's where actually the name Bridges for Music came about, about finding these people that are in need of resources and connecting them with the brands and the people that are able to help. And how did you find the reaction in some of these places for you as an outsider showing an interest in what these people were doing? I mean, was it a largely positive reaction to your presence? Absolutely, yeah. We felt so welcomed in the townships, you know, that people are so hungry of connecting, of learning. And that's a feeling that also, you know, Richie Horton, when he was there, you know, felt. I think everyone has felt very, very good. And our experience there has been only positive. Do you think there's maybe a case of misinformation in the wider world or there's a wider world perception about? what it's like in these places? Do you think that there's been like a, you know, has it been sensationalized a little bit as to the dangers connected with these places or, you know, did your experiences there kind of differ from what your perception might have been going into it? Totally, totally. I think it's a misperception, you know, and obviously I always tell the guys in South Africa that it's very important to... to go into townships and engage with these people and tell our friends overseas because people still think that people are shooting around in the townships and that it's very, very dangerous. Even my mom, she's like, but where are you going? And she has been even to South Africa with me and she has seen how it is. The reality is that things are getting better and better. Obviously, there's still problems, you know, and it's nothing that it's going to be solved in one generation. But I would encourage everyone to come to South Africa and experience it. So what would you say were the kind of biggest challenges? faced in setting up the project? The biggest challenges are obviously as a non-profit organization you know covering our overhead you know overhead versus program is always the biggest challenge you know I think for everyone getting getting all the all the corporate support. Also gathering and getting everyone together in South Africa. Although I have to say that the organization has been super embraced by everyone there, which is one of the key things of having done what we've done so far. But I would say funding is the biggest challenge always. Because everything we do costs a lot of money and people don't understand the work that is behind the scenes. It's not only about putting or doing something with ritual in the townships. There is a lot of costs around that that need to be covered. And obviously there is a lot of outcome out of that that is not really tangible in a way. One of the biggest outcomes of having these guys in the townships running workshops. is breaking down a lot of fears and bridging the gap between the city scene and the township scene, inspiring local talent, connecting them with international audience and bringing exposure to these areas. And that's something very, very non-tangible. It's very difficult to value that. Yeah, because I guess in these areas there isn't really that fluidity of movement between the people. You know, the people from the inner city, they're not going out to the townships and kind of vice versa in a way. Yeah, totally. I mean, obviously everyone knows the story of South Africa, which is very, very special. And it's going to take a lot of time to change that. Black people live mostly in townships, although there's obviously a... rising middle class among the black community. And there is still a big division between the white scene and the black scene. And it also happens in the music scene. And there are a lot of parties that are mostly for white audiences. And there are parties that are only for black people. in the townships. You will never or not never but very rarely see white people dancing in the township in a black party and vice versa. Then you have also the side run scene which is purely white. You will never ever see a black guy there unless he's lost. But I have to say that local promoters are also now working towards cross-pollinating both scenes and there are really nice results. I have to say, for example, at the Cape Town Electronic Music Festival this year, we saw a very, very mixed audience. even at the mad decent party you know um was really really really mixed and i don't know i kind of see a change and and that's very positive and it's only going to make of the south african scene even bigger and and better and more richer than than it is now can you tell us about the ambassadors that you brought on board and perhaps why you chose to work with them well we we started the whole thing with richie horton i mean we have a a friendship from from the last 10 years you know since we first started working together and and you know when we sat down with him in ibiza and we told him about this idea you know of creating a non-profit platform and doing this tour with him in South Africa, he was immediately down for it and very, very excited about coming down to South Africa. He was already planning to discover new territories that year. I mean, that was last year. And he's obviously the perfect artist to kick off this type of organization. He's known to be a forward-thinking artist, but more than anything, he is an amazing human being. And he has the heart in the right place. And he's a very inspiring person as well. So sitting in a township with Black Coffee and talking to... to a mixed audience, but to a lot of black people that not necessarily knew who Richie Orton was, was a big challenge, you know, and he did it amazing. It was one of the most inspiring moments personally for me, but I think it was very inspiring also for everyone that was there. We also come with the support of Black Coffee locally, who also embraced the project and has been key in developing this organization as well. He's, as you might know, like a rock star in the townships and he's a perfect example for the youth in South Africa. He has his own foundation. He's very committed to developing the scene and he's probably now the best ambassador for the South African music scene. You're also working with Luciano Skrillex at this point. And is it Boys Noise? You've done something with Dixon. Yeah. So basically after Rich, you know, we also sat down at the same time actually with Luciano who also jumped on board immediately. And we also have a long relationship with him. And yeah, and he, again, you know, like Luciano is an amazing person. You know, he has the heart and the right. place too and he has always been really interested in this type of initiatives. He is now launching his own initiative called One Con for Life and he's supporting us and we are working together and developing new ideas. And yeah, I mean, there's a lot of work that Luciano is doing behind the scenes that people don't know, you know? And those are the things that I think we want to also bring to light, you know, and communicate. So do these guys kind of become long-term partners of yours? Is there like ambassadorship like over a long period of time or how is it working? Well, there's nothing, you know, on paper, you know, things that happen organically. We are all friends. We've been working together for many years and we are in this because we love it and we, you know, we believe in it. and has to happen organically. Everyone is very busy, everyone has their own commitments and stuff. And yes, we are developing new ideas and we are planning the future, but I cannot tell we have any type of ambassadorship contract or whatever. It seemed as though even them as artists, they were kind of learning from the experience. I was really struck by the video you put out with Luciano where he kind of said, wow, yeah, the most surprising thing was Africa has its own electronic music, you know, with a look of genuine chalk on his face. Yeah, totally. No, yeah. I mean, it is enriching for the local people. It was very enriching for them as well. You know, like going into... This community is mind-blowing for anyone that is passionate for electric music. I mean, from the RA documentary that you put out, you can see the amazing house music culture that exists in those areas. And that's something very special for the artists because they also see the opportunity to give back through their core thing, electronic music. It's not about going to a community that has a big problem with AIDS. And they can donate money. But here, actually, they can go and talk about music and inspire the youth through music because the people is really interested, genuinely interested in electronic music, which is pretty amazing. How did their music go down? It was kind of interesting because obviously the prevalent sound, as we were kind of discussing before we started, is very kind of... vocal and soulful and percussive and then with someone like Rich Horton whose sound is like something more towards techno how did that go across would you say? Well that was actually a very interesting moment you know I remember when Rich was about to to play in Soweto and one of the townships in Johannesburg. He was pretty nervous, you know, he was like saying, "Well, I don't know how the people are going to react to my sound." Obviously he adapted very well, but he still played techno, you know, and the people danced and he was supposed to play for one hour and he ended up playing four hours. People went crazy, you know, and it was a very, very special moment, I think, because we all realized, and especially he realized, you know the power of music to bring people together, although obviously he knows that better than anyone. But I think in that special scenario, seeing how black people were in one corner in the beginning of the party and then some white people that came from the city center were in another corner. And then after an hour, everyone was dancing together, you know, and listening to Richie Horton, who, as you said, you know. It's not maybe the closest sound to the usual Township sound. But yeah, I mean, we always say the drums come from Africa and the people there know very well how to dance. Would you say it's a desire of yours to introduce people in places like South Africa to new sounds? Yeah, I mean, as I said, people in townships are so hungry and that's something that we discovered with, for example, with Skrillex. I would never ever think that dubstep is really a known sound in the townships. And actually, we were very surprised how many people knew Skrillex and were super excited to having him in their communities, you know. it was amazing and since then we have seen a lot of young kids playing dubstep you know kids from kaya licha from langa from townships outside of cape town are now playing in dubstep parties in town and that's that's amazing and that's kind of the inspiration that he left behind kind of a ripple effect absolutely yeah so could you explain like what form the the workshops take and kind of what a bridges for music event looks like Well, a workshop is basically, it takes two hours, three hours. We usually have like a warm-up session where we have a local artist or one of our partners talking about music business or anything related with the music industry that kind of can inspire the audience. And then we have a two-hour conversation with the artist. Usually together with a local opinion leader, whether it was Black Coffee with Richie Ornum, for example, or Vinnie Da Vinci with Luciano or Nisqy One with Skrillex. And it's a two hours talk where we talk about the early years in their careers. We try to show the challenges they had to face when they were trying to break through, you know, and trying to show the youngsters in this community is that. You know, they were facing the same kind of challenges that they are facing. Obviously, there are other challenges that the kids in the townships have to face, but it's very inspiring to see how a guy like Skrillex, for example, five years ago, he was working as a landlord in an office building in LA. And, you know, now is one of the most, one of the biggest artists in the world. And that is very inspiring for the kids there, you know, to see that it's actually possible then also we go into a more technical um part of the talk where we either speak about music production or we explain their djing setup or something like that and and then we open the floor for questions and the local kids can are able to ask any questions and just engage and how would you say that they've gone so far overall has been very inspiring it's very very inspiring as i said before like feeling how welcome we have felt in these areas how hungry the people are the smart questions they they have and you know and and seeing how thankful they are also for for hosting these events in their communities you know i think it's the first time this type of of events happen uh there and for them this is they're very proud you know I mean, what's your perception of what opportunities for young people are like in the country at the moment? Is that the situation that's kind of improving in terms of employment? And, you know, do people see music as maybe something to better themselves, you know, like a self-improvement type of situation? I think the opportunities are massive. You know, like I just came out from Cape Town and there was... talking to some of the guys that have been part of all our initiatives. And I was telling them, you have such an amazing scene here. Not only because the local market is huge, as I told you before, of the record, you know, like South Africa has its own market. I would even say they wouldn't need any international support. to have their own opportunities. The Black Coffees are selling thousands of copies, hard copies of their albums, and they are getting lots of gigs every weekend across the country, getting pretty decent fees. And there are a lot of parties there. I read an article in a newspaper that said South Africa has the highest DJ per capita ratio in the world. And that says it all. There is definitely a market. So the opportunities for the local people are enormous. But then if you add to that the international appeal of South Africa right now with Black Coffee traveling around the world, with international artists landing in South Africa and having a great time. And the vibrant scene that exists now in Cape Town, for example, there's no artist that doesn't love Cape Town when they play there. In Johannesburg, the same. The energy, I don't know, it's really cooking down there. And I really think that it's going to take off and it's only going to get better and bigger. Do you feel as though South African artists will be traveling within the international market within kind of increasing frequency in the coming years? I mean, do you think that what they're doing will travel? Absolutely, yeah. I mean, I think that we've seen it with Black Coffee, but it's going to happen more and more. And as soon as these guys are starting to travel, like Black Coffee is starting to travel, he's going to align his sound a little bit more with the global trend, keeping the roots of the African sound. And that's going to make it so much more appealing, I think, even if it's already working very, very well. And that's something that's going to influence, you know, the younger generation of DJs in South Africa. And that's going to make the South African sound a bit more exportable. And yeah, definitely, I'm sure we're going to see more and more artists down there. they're bringing definitely something very very fresh to the to the music scene so beyond the workshops and the events that you stage is there kind of a sense that you want to put something more long-term down like what what is the legacy of kind of what you're doing yeah i mean the workshops obviously are were very inspiring and it's something really really positive but It's a one-day event, you know, and that's the reason why we are now working on a music school that we want to build in Cape Town in one of the townships there called Langa. And that's kind of the legacy we want to leave behind on a daily basis, a space where the kids have access to the right resources to develop their skills, whether it's as a DJ or as a producer, but also around other things in the music industry, like graphic design, video editing, anything that is involved in the music industry that can, you know, make you earn a better life in a way. And this space is, so that's why we call them, you know, creative hubs more than just music schools, because we want them to be a space where also the kids have, you know, a space to have open conversations, keep out of trouble, out on the streets and connect with each other. Because what happens also in the townships is that... local producers are very, very separate. They are in their own bedroom studios, sometimes in informal settlements, sometimes in normal houses, but they don't really collaborate with each other because they don't have a space, a common space where they can just go and share ideas and collaborate with each other. So this space aims to become that space. And also from the architecture point of view, we want to bring kind of a fresh air to the community. and create an iconic building in the township that becomes kind of more aspirational. And yeah, that's probably what keeps us busy right now. So is this something that you've begun work on? Is it kind of like, you know, the funding secured and everything sort of heading towards that? Yeah, we, I mean, we are now, we have just locked down all the space and we locked down all the details of the... project. We are working with a local architect to develop the whole project and we are starting to get funds in. Actually, we just got a donation from Skrillex Label, from Tomorrowland, from Pioneer, from Ableton, and they are slowly starting to contribute some money to make this happen. But obviously, we are still far away to reach the fundraising goal and for that we have some fundraising campaigns aligned for the future. with some of our ambassadors, which hopefully will help us to make this happen. What would those look like? Well, it's campaigns around crowdfunding. I mean, I cannot really tell anything more right now, but we're looking to launch something around September to basically engage with fans and artists and festivals. kind of raise money for creating these music apps so do you see this as being kind of a what you've done in south africa as being a transferable model like are there plans to go into other territories yeah definitely i mean south africa has been the perfect test pilot it's a perfect place to to develop everything always learn a lot of things and then replicate it in other places as soon as we feel it's the moment and we're capable of absorbing all that amount of work. But there are amazing places in Africa that are definitely taking off. I spent 10 days in Kenya some weeks ago. And you see how electronic music again is arriving to every single corner there. And whether you walk through a slam in a lobby or if you go to any of the commercial clubs, you see that electronic music or EDM or however you want to call it is there. And it's just a matter of time that it's going to explode. Yeah, I mean, do you feel as though the connections are there still to be made? I mean, obviously, we're living in an age where most people are online and everybody's posting music. and their music is certainly out there. But do you feel like there maybe are these, you know, these lack of connections between these kind of amazing sounds that are emanating from these emerging markets and maybe what's going on in Europe, for example? Totally, yeah. I think you mentioned internet and obviously internet is... is the key of development. I mean, that's the reason why electronic music is arriving to this place, because internet is slowly growing in these areas, and that's enabling local artists to have access to anyone out there. Even, for example, it's very funny how many township artists do know Tomorrowland, because they all have seen the amazing videos or the viral videos they put out. And that's happening everywhere and slowly everywhere in Africa. And yeah, there is definitely still the time to come where local artists or local sounds are going to be discovered overseas. And I think everyone in the industry is always hungry of new sounds and fresher ideas. And I think that's what these areas have to offer, you know, like really, really new ideas and new sounds. And I remember being in Kibera, which is one of the biggest slums in Africa, in Nairobi. And walking through there, you know, you hear so many different sounds, you know, I would say reggae is bigger than anything else. And I met a guy there that gave me a CD and, you know, I didn't listen to it maybe for two or three weeks because I never had the time. I didn't have a seat room in my computer, blah, blah. And then suddenly one day I put it in the car and I was blown away. I couldn't believe it. I was like, wow, this is so forward thinking. I mean, this is proper experimental electronic music. How the hell is this guy, you know, doing this music? And I actually met this guy in a handcraft shack where they were just selling small things to the local community, not even to tourists. And I was like, wow. He said, we put... together this CD, you know, we are doing music on the side and we were doing this yesterday on a live, but our passion is music. And wow, blew my mind, you know? So in terms of the project on a kind of long-term basis, like what are your measures of success? Like how would you kind of reflect on what you've been doing five years from now, for example, and look back and say, okay, we were successful. Well, as I said before, there are a lot of things that are not tangible, that are very, very difficult to measure. But I understand that's a common question to non-profit organizations. How are you going to track success or how are you going to evaluate yourself? And I think from one side, seeing how many people is coming out of the townships and is making it on an international level. how many people actually has earned a better life in the townships through our initiatives or our programming on the ground. We're running also a scholarship program with SAE. and with some other educational partners where we offer the opportunity to guys from underprivileged areas to study at SAE Cape Town and then also SAE on an international level. And seeing how many people is going through that program and seeing how many people is kind of developing their skills and getting more educated, I think that's a good way to measure success. obviously if we if we have i don't know 10 black coffees in the future traveling all over the world and then going back to their communities and inspiring the local kids you know and staying committed to their communities that would be an amazing success but also you know seeing how we develop these music schools and how this this this space has become a nest for young creative minds to flourish you know that that is also a way to to make sure success whether they become professional djs or not or successful producers you know i think the fact of having a space like this during your teenage and having a space where you can kind of be safe of the usual problems of a township and yeah share ideas you know and have open conversations is already something very very positive for the community have you met with any kind of like negativity or resistance in setting up the project i mean i'd record when we'd announce the project that maybe a couple of people were probably South Africans are saying that they felt somehow it was like patronizing in a way like, Oh, do we need help? Like we're a smaller country or something. Have you encountered that much? And kind of what would you say to those people? Yeah, I mean, we have found some challenges. And people in the townships, sometimes they're kind of waiting that you go and knock on the doors. Whether by going there and doing the works that we've been doing, anyone that is genuinely interested in moving forward should come to the workshops. kind of engage with us because we cannot obviously not go to every single house you know and knock on the door and say hey are you a producer come and join us you know so I think there is I think that mentality should change with time and actually this this is a comment that comes from from an artist that works with us from the townships he told us this the other day you know he has to tell some of his like music colleagues in the township to come and engage with us, you know, because they think that we should go and engage with them, you know. It's like a proactive attitude, you know, that I think they should take instead of waiting for us. Yeah, I mean, it's part of what you're doing, kind of building trust in a way. Totally, yeah, totally. Like, obviously, when you arrive to a place like this, you know, people have been promised so many things in these areas, you know, that never happened, starting with the politicians, you know, and with lots of other people. That I think, you know, building trust is definitely a challenge for anyone that wants to do something there. But it's fair enough, you know, I also understand it. I don't blame them for that, you know. And we have to build that trust by delivering, delivering real opportunities, making things happen and, you know, showing them that we can kind of, yes, help them develop their careers. That's it. And in terms of opportunities, how might that look for people who are kind of coming through your doors? Well, for example, very recently we locked down a partnership with Glastonbury where they're going to offer slots to artists from these underprivileged communities. So we're going to have two guys traveling outside of their own townships in South Africa. to Glastonbury, traveling out of the country for the first time and living a life-changing experience. So that's already a great opportunity. We are having the same type of partnership with Tomorrowland. as well.
