Life by 86 Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch, and I'm the Associate Editor at Resident Advisor. Few DJs have as much history as Helmut Geyer, aka DJ Hell. The Munich native started collecting records in the late 70s and DJing in the 80s. He went clubbing in West Berlin well before the wall came down and played at clubs like E-Burke and the original Trezor just as the city's techno scene was being born. In the 90s, he launched his iconic label, International DJ Gigolo Records, and played a key role in popularizing electroclash. Over the years, he shared the studio with everyone from P. Diddy to Brian Ferry. This month, just before Trezor released his career-spanning Kern mix, he'll stop by R.A.'s Berlin office for a trip down memory lane. So, it's fashion week. You've been pretty busy, right? Yeah, that week it's kind of even two parties in one day. I played Harper's Bazaar yesterday at the beautiful villa at Teegarden. There was more like speeches going on and official people from the from the magazine and they gonna start it next year. I heard of a first German issue and then I played a fashion video award party. I was also in the jury. voting for the best videos and Wednesday I played Patrick Moore. He's a designer from Munich, moved to Berlin and tonight I'm playing with DJ Chaos in a small club called Chalet in Kreuzberg. And then I go to Spain on Saturday. And the day before I played in Ibiza at Pacha. It's a Solomon night. He called it Solomon plus one. And I was the plus one DJ. And it was an amazing night on Sunday. So this week is maybe the most busiest week of the year. And Tuesday I played Privileged. I forgot that. So I think it's eight or nine parties a week. And a lot of glitzy parties. No, some are glitzy, or how you call it, or some are spectacular, like the Solomon Night. Yesterday I played at Arena Club, and it was three to six o'clock in the morning, and it's a week. day even during the fashion week. I mean there were still people but it was not a glitzy one but I liked it, I enjoyed it and the people liked it as well. What's your connection to the fashion world? I was always involved in the fashion world already in the early techno days and I remember in the 90s especially in Berlin it was Kinda... strong anti-fashion world. There was no fashion week in Berlin and a lot of people wear military clothes from the techno and house scene. They say it's for the fight in the city. It was more like a rough time here in the early 90s and we were wearing work wear, Carhartt. I mean still very popular but it was the first time the car jumped over to Europe and we were We were into workwear, red wings, shoes, mixed with military clothes and secondhand clothes, 70s secondhand stuff. So that was the style inside the clubs. But I was already very interested in great fashion and great tailoring, and I was always inspired by this kind of people. Of course, this is really connected with the music and techno world, not techno world, but with the music world. I always said, like very many loaders, music and fashion was always the passion, not only in Rio, so I think all around the world. And I think when I look back, when it was not allowed to... wear something extraordinary when you're DJing. But I think these days more and more people are into the fashion world. And I also see myself as an artist representing something on a tour or on a festival. You should not wear the same clothes on a traveling, on your... dinner and then at your performance and the next day you wear the same clothes as going back wherever you come from. So, I mean, with Cigalo, you know, we were always into fashion with people like Fischer Spooner and a lot of other bands, but there was one funny quote from a band that were called the Fat Truckers. And it was kind of electronic punk. They were from London. And they came. We had our gigolo night here during the love parade. They were performing live. And I saw them coming from the airport, went to the hotel, go to dinner, performing and leaving. And they had the same shirt, shoes and T-shirt for two days. And I said... Why don't you think about something cool or something that fits with your music when you're performing? They said a funny thing. They said, oh, we are not Fischer Spooner, you know. So I got it, you know, but that brings it to the point. They don't want to get dressed up. They just like more lazy guys and want to travel comfortable as much as possible or perform comfortable. So they come with one T-shirt and one jeans and one pair of shoes. It seems like that strikes you as like a missed opportunity or something. Yeah, you should take care, you know. You should think about when you perform in the, not a dress or something, but... This reflects your personality, I think. To me, it was always a very natural and regular thing being connected with the fashion world. Finally, I did shows with Karl Lagerfeld and I did shows with... Versace in Milano and there was a lot of other people asked me for producing their show music and even Preta Porter music and I thought why not bringing some dirty old school Chicago acid into Versace you know and I mean they liked it I was surprised and you know I didn't change my musical style or my ideas behind or concept behind my music and me as an artist so I thought why not bringing something special into this world you know and it's always very inspiring work with people from the fashion world because they're very well organized and really on a top level you know you can't do anything wrong because shortly before the show it needs to be perfect and in time and then when the show is going on, there's no way back, you know? So working with all these people is really inspiring and, um, uh, I love to do it. Is that the way you operate? You know, the, um, that, that attention to detail and making sure everything's right. Like, is, is that the, is that the way you operate as an artist? I always try to work on that level because I'm. I think after 30 years I have some experience traveling, doing shows, doing something unexpected, not following the rules, you know, create your own rules and do it on a high professional level. And I don't think they go in another way, you know. I was always following my own rules and tried. to motivate people around me and go the same way. So let's talk about your mix first, Curran. I was thinking sort of the concept of this mix series is to tell your own story through the mix or to kind of dig through your old records. You must have a pretty astounding record collection at this point. What was the process like of digging through your old stuff for the mix? How did that actually work? Yeah, I understand the concept from the first one went really well with DJ Deep that he combined Chicago, Detroit, old school. but also the new school from that kind of area and also what's going on here in Europe. And it's also based on house concepts and on... newer kind of techno concepts and also they want to have some unreleased material so I was happy that Dan Bell just offered me a unreleased version from the early 90s I mean that's amazing and I did a lot of I wouldn't say edits I did a lot of totally new mixes of songs I found in my collection and I think I went through the whole collection from... from buying and collecting records over 30 years, it took me some days. And I listened to a lot of stuff and finally that's the best I have. Now I've found a lot of records. I didn't even know I still own it, you know. And the bad thing is I have no order in my... collection i have the same ikea kind of expedite yeah like all djs have it and i have a lot of them so there's there's promos old new material it's pretty mixed up and uh like years ago i start throwing away the covers so i have only the inside sleeve and the vinyl you know so It took me a while and I found a lot of records that touched me already in the early 80s. Let's say early 90s, not the 80s. There's some 80s stuff, but it's like 90s stuff where this music was produced mainly in the States, Chicago and Detroit and New York. And I remember the early 90s when in Germany we were thinking about the DJs and the producers, how they made this kick so strong or why does this hi-hat sound like that? And we didn't know that a trio... three should be used for an acid track you know and if some people say if it's not a original Roland 303 it's not an acid track you know maybe sounds like that so a lot of stories behind every record and In 1991, the Sherman scene was starting coming up, riff scene and a club. It was more like a club scene because there was no festival. So the producers start getting into the secrets of 808, 909, 303, 101 and how to create the special sound and how to manipulate the machines. I thought when I went to this or collecting best music and stuff I had at home, it all comes from the States. And, you know, you forgot about the things because now you think it's all made in Berlin. I mean, you know, basically because everybody's living here and it's very focused on Berlin. When you live here and work here, you think this is the center of the world. But if you go back like 20 years, it was Chicago, Detroit, and New York completely. When you think about house music, it's amazing what producers and DJs already did in 1991, 1992. And that was maybe the main thing I realized that they were such on a high level already and doing stuff that's really sounding modern today. Okay, one example, I found this Odori record. I was searching for 20 years. and I found out that it was produced in New York and he was a famous DJ there. He played at the club called Danceteria. And I knew this record is something really extraordinary and outstanding and I played it already in '91 in the clubs here in Germany. Later on, I found out when I asked about the rights because I thought I'm going to re-release it on Gigolo because it's such an amazing record. I got in contact with the owner of the rights in New York and two weeks later, he sent an email and said he has bad news. The producer died. And I was thinking, this is a really touching story, because I was searching for that record over 20 years. And then I found him, and two weeks later, he died in Mexico. He was living in Mexico. And another amazing story is, he was the first producer of the first Madonna single called Everybody. He was boyfriend of Madonna as well. There's pictures all over. And it was big news in the press in New York. And Madonna even said something about it. But he was the first guy who founded Madonna, produced her, and played it in the clubs and on the radio. I mean, it's an amazing story. And I, till now, today, I don't know what it tells me. You know, I have to find out because I'm working on a remix of this song. And it's the first song on the compilation. And the song is called Movements 1 to 4. And on the B-side, it's 4 to 8 or something. It's an outstanding masterpiece of 20 music of... African, Voodoo, Techno. I don't want to say mad, beautiful. It's like one of the most beautiful records I have in my collection. And so I'm in contact with the owners in New York and they asked yesterday if I'm ready with the remixes. I'm not because it's like... I tried to understand the concept from this DJ and producer, why he did it in that way and why it sounded, till now, so differently. so touchy you know it's so emotional and um i'm happy that i found the record it's the original copy and uh i'm very sorry that he he died in mexico and um the story with madonna and this you know he was famous teacher and i mean this endless story and it's It's very touchy to me because this record influenced me big time and now I'm retouching it. It's going to work out well. It's just one story. We could sit for another three hours to tell stories about every record I found. And you remember pictures of what record shop bought it in Chicago or maybe Japan, maybe London. And it's all original copies and most of the labels are not existing. But a big thanks to Tresor and Paolo, who was a helping hand on getting the rights for most of the tracks. I think from my first track listing, there's only one track missing. Wow. And it's okay. It was Claude Young. And it's a very old record from Detroit. It's called Planet... There is no Planet Earth. Brother from another planet. And it's an amazing techno record. Really analog, hardcore sounding. And he said, yes, let's do it. And then he said, oh, maybe I'm not into it. And at the end he said, I don't want to be in a compilation. And the mix was already done. So, sorry Claude. I know him from back in the days, you know, and I would be happy to have this special record on the mix. But that was the only one not getting, the only track I'm not getting the rights on it. So I'm pretty happy about the mix down and everything. Yeah, and you've done a ton of mix CDs over the years. I mean, was it always, has it changed, like how hard it is to license? the tracks or has making a mix CD, you know, is it different now than it was, say, back in the day? I think it's different, but I think I have to credit Paolo. He made it happen. You know, I know back in the days, people were asking for crazy advances and, you know, lawyers talk and rights talk and not exclusive talks. And to me, it seems to be easier these days. But when I think about the 90s, there was, okay, I think I sent my first email in 92 or 93, but there was no other people sending back an answer. Because think about it, there was no... It was internet, but not like today. So you had to call the people, you had to send a fax. They need to send it back. Then they send... a DUT cassette or maybe some other... Okay, DUT or maybe they send a record and from that original record... you made another copy for using it in the mix or... Back in the days, most of the compilation I mixed on a vinyl setup inside the club like real to real, like one to one, like mixing it and when it was something was not perfect and you were already nearly the end, you start from the beginning. And that was like real DJ mixing. Nowadays you use programs, whatever you like. And so I think it's a big difference. But on the musical side and the musical influences, I think if you put all the compilations I did, put everything together, you can see a strong guideline or a strong... personality maybe yeah yeah and i read that you said that you think the the kern mix is actually kind of in some way similar to um x-mix 5 uh wild style is that true i could use some of the x-mix wild style tracks into kern but I already touched that so there was some future tracks you know and some old Chicago tracks as well there was I think 95 and the concept was pretty much special and extraordinary at that time producing videos special made videos for every track and release a VHS videocassette on the market in the record shop for the compilation. Plus you got a CD with the DJ mix and then you have to buy a VHS videocassette and put it into your video recorder. That was 95. People, I think, right now don't think about it. But musical-wise, there was some connection already. Yeah, you can watch the whole video on YouTube. It's kind of funny. Yeah, yeah. So they were nominating great visual artists for every track, and then they did a 90-minute video looping movie. whatever and it was played in the clubs and at that time it was pretty much extraordinary yeah and um i mean you started collecting records probably in the late 70s um what kind of you know how did you get the bug what what turned you on to music in such a big way I was always fascinated and really thrilled about new music and new genres. I was lucky enough to be old enough to understand when punk music was jumping out of, let's say, England. And it was music never heard before and I was already kind of a teenager. be fascinated by the music and I was old enough to understand the first hip-hop and this kind of beat creation, a Bambaataa New York style. and DJ'd already then and I was old enough to understand the first electro movement and then early mid 80s house kind of out of disco you know and funk music first like let's say JM Silk and I already played it in the club. So I think I'm a lucky one to get all these movements and new kind of music, already developed it as a DJ and played it in the clubs and were influenced by the music. I mean, it's basically my life. So I was always searching for the new stuff, even hard to get stuff, old stuff. I'm like a maniac collector. It was coming to a point where there was nothing left for collecting labels from... the first release to the new year's ones. And so I found the first techno record in Detroit called "Shariwari" and I think it was... Was it 80s? I think mid 80s. There were some original copies and there were a group of people doing parties in their neighborhood called Charivari. And then they said, oh, we want to have our own kind of music together with these parties because they were really very successful. So these two guys produced a song called Charivari and put it on a 12 inch. And it went really popular, played in the radio there, sold thousands of copies, but it never jumped over to Germany that day or Europe because we don't have a direct distribution. So this was a Detroit phenomenon. And I get together with the people from Shariwari, re-released it, did some remixes on Gigolo and went on tour with the guys in Europe. in the 90s and i was i'm really i was not thinking about to record the live set i mean i could really if i could release that now because i remember when they were we were touring here there were two guys looking like dressed like the 80s fascinated by european culture never been here and we were touring all over europe and they played a totally live set Shariwari tracks that I never heard again. And it was amazing and I was, I'm really not happy about it. I'm not recording it because I never met the guys again. They went back to Detroit and they have families and a regular job, but they were the original creators before Derek Chuan and... you know, all these other guys. And, yeah, they did this great tour and a one-hour live show singing and dancing and playing live. So, you know, so many stories about all this music. And I was always fascinated by the... stories behind it i was always interested meet the people get information out of the original people you know get all the stories and and even so i went on a level where it was pretty much perfect collection you know so I start okay I start collecting cassettes from DJ mixes from Ron Hardy from early 80s you know legendary teacher from Chicago and he did special edits for music that he he only played at the warehouse in Chicago so There was tapes around and I get a copy of a copy of a copy of a metal cassette, you know. And then I start cutting out tracks from that, remastered it and put it on dub plates, you know, for me playing it in the clubs. I still have it at home with some really crazy music on it. I think this is maybe pretty much the craziest level you can jump on. If you cut down cassettes, put it on digital, remaster it, and then put it on a dub plate. I mean, nowadays you don't have to put it on a dub plate, but that was the level I reached pretty much crazy. I'm still collecting, but not like crazy. I think I put all my DJ money, everything I earned as a DJ, put always into newest records. And okay, here's the real truth. Back in the 80s, it was like, should I buy some food, you know, or should I get the newest 12-inch? And you know the answer. Yeah, you kind of mentioned it, but I understand that you're kind of a completist. You will seek out every single release from a label that you like. Why do you think you have that compulsion? That kind of goes beyond having enough records to play. To every compilation I did, everything I produced, I always... said I want to do it my way and I want to do the best compilation possible not just another one you know that doesn't interest me I want to do the best one you know and so I don't know how people's gonna like the mix or maybe not digging it because it's a lot of old material there but I think a lot of people will maybe buy it and like it and be influenced by it and get the story of the Odori record, listen to Dan Bell, unreleased material and, you know, seeing all this innovative music brought together in a solid mix. It just interests me to do the best possible, not just something that maybe works in a club or maybe is a good mix for the summer. It should be a statement, of course. So when you were first DJing, You said it was like in the late 70s. You were already playing in clubs. It was in Munich. Outside Munich, yeah. I mean, what kind of music were you playing? What were the clubs like? What was the scene like pre-Hausen Techno? I wouldn't call it a scene. We were fed up with the music that was played in the club. They were basically on Beatles. Fleetwood Mac and Doors. I mean, till now I love that music, but that time we were against it because there was a new revolution coming out called punk music and there was bands like the Undertones and the Ramones. early damned whatever coming out of England and I was pretty much really shocked by that music and we thought it's time to play it in the club so if nobody's doing it I'm gonna do it you know so and then it went it went into the so-called German wave electronic new wave it called Deutsche Welle and suddenly we had electronic punk new wave music with German vocals it was a huge revolution and it was a huge scene here in all the cities in Germany and Berlin was one of the mecca already of bands like Einstürzend Neubauten and Törtlich Adores And they did new things, really kind of experimenting with electronic music and noise. That was a very strong movement. And it was the first time that we found a German identity with the lyrics and create our own sound. And I was really influenced by bands like Duff. I mean, Kraftwerk was there, but it was not into a way for a Deutsche Welle movement. So there was a lot of bands like Duff and Krups and Einstürz and Neubauten, all German names, upwards, more like punk, but they mixed up electronic with punk music. I did some compilation for that as well called New Deutsch. It's on Cigar.lu, you can check it out. Yeah, I was happy to see all the bands live on concert. But back in the days, you didn't went to a nightclub, you went to the concerts. There was some DJs playing that music, but more powerful was like going to festivals and concerts and see the bands live. There was already a huge scene here in Berlin. But there was like the dark area of Berlin when the wall was still around and it was pretty much a totally different place. You wouldn't believe this area here in the early 80s. Why? What was it like? It was dark, dirty and depressing. I think this was the east part here. We were not allowed. I mean, you were allowed to come here for 24 hours. But it was just strange. I mean, you were even allowed to talk to the people, but there were Germans as well. I went there once or twice to the east part, but it was kind of a movie like George Orwell, 1984. Everybody seemed to be in a different world and mindset and brainwashed. I mean, it was interesting to see. I was on one side shocked by it, but on the other side totally fascinated by these two parts of Berlin. So it was very interesting, amazing to see what's going on on the other side of the wall. So would you come to Berlin just to go to concerts and parties and stuff like that? And buy records, of course. I mean, we slept in... in squatted houses or they were even not squatted they were just empty and we came here with a sleeping bag with the car and go to the Autobahn to the east part of Germany. And we had a sleeping bag and no money. And we went to the Jungle Club and other bars and live concerts, yeah. And get through record shops, of course, because there was some maybe unusual new bands of Berlin or US imports. And they were quite good connected here already. So and it was amazing city. It was a crazy nightlife. Not like now, but there was a lot of big punk and new wave and Deutsche Welle movement here in Berlin. I was totally fascinated. There was no other level like that in Germany. It was really amazing, powerful. And let's say crazy. Were you picking up gigs in Berlin? That time? No, no, no. I was really DJing, but they were not looking for a Munich DJ. That time. I think there was a real clash between Munich and Berlin. I mean, a lot of people from Bavaria moved to Berlin at that time and were fascinated by the city and the power already of the city. But I didn't play here. I think my first gig was at Tresor Records in the early 90s. I was on tour with a band called... Nightmares on Wax and they were doing techno music on Warp Records at that time, like so-called bleep kind of techno music. They had a new album and a top ten single in the UK, so they said, let's jump over to Germany. I was the tour DJ and the driver of the bus and I was two or three guys of Nightmares on Wax and a tour manager and we were playing in Hamburg, Munich, Berlin, Cologne. some gigs and it was i think it was my first techno dj gig in berlin and it was maybe 91 and even that was not easy because the the resident teachers of tresor said we don't want anybody outside of berlin playing in our club Why? Why do they have that attitude? What's okay? Let's go back. It was DJs like Rock, DJ Rock, DJ Tanith and Johnson. And they said, this is our movement, maybe. And this is already music coming out of Berlin. And we connected with the Detroit scene. And we really don't want to... bring anybody in there, we don't know. If there is somebody coming, you need to prove it. So I proved it. And from that night on, I became really good friends with everybody. Because I proved it that I'm able to do a proper techno set, but at that time there was not a lot of techno records on the market, you know. that fits in a Tresor Club concept. So I think I proved it and I became really good friends with them. So it could go the other way around that if they wouldn't like it, they maybe stop me playing. It would be a possibility chance that they say, this doesn't fit in our Tresor Club. This DJ needs to stop now. But I think I did a good job and I played pretty well. Because I was loaded with a lot of stuff they maybe don't know because I was shopping in London in the record shops and I had a lot of new releases that maybe they don't have. I was prepared. Do you remember your DJ set from that night? The party was crazy because they were a top 10 act from the UK and everybody loved Nightmares on Wax because they had some really groundbreaking, revolutionary tunes out on the market and they were like new and hot. and the whole scene was there and then me DJing. It was an amazing night. It was brutal, loud sound system, dark strobe light and fog all over. I couldn't see much of the people because it was always dark. And you couldn't even talk because you would not understand anybody. It was the original Tresor basement down in this old bank, Tresor kind of situation. It was pretty amazing. I never saw something like that before in my whole life. So it was pretty much... thrilled and influenced by that night and I thought I want to have that again. Maybe I moved to Berlin and two years later I was moving to Berlin. You played at Ewerk around that time too, right? Ewerk and Planet, yeah. What were those clubs like? I think this was the original and blueprint for everything that followed after that because They were using places where there was even unclear ownership of the building. They just used that empty space because Berlin was built back in the days for around... 5,000 people maybe, and there was 2 million or 3 million people living there. So there were so many empty spaces around the 90s, and especially where EVEC Planet and Tresort was in one area in Mitte here. And it was a quite dark and rough area, but the nightclubs Planet and EVEC was already made on a... on a highly professional level and inviting international DJs and pretty much built a strong sound of Berlin that time. Tresor was standing for Hard Techno from Detroit and E-Work was standing, let's call it the Berlin House. And there was a DJ, I always say it again and again, he was called Dr. Mathe. later on famous becoming the founder and creator of Love Parade but he was playing US house only hard to get stuff from record labels like Saber records and Strictly Rhythm was even I think not existing but really like deep original deep house records also with kind of Chicago influence, but that was the sound of Berlin. It was based on house music, already kind of minimal period, but that was the early 90s, you know, so this is 20 years ago, and there was already the gay scene involved in that, and as you can read now in all these books that are published. The East scene, when East and West came together, the East people jumped over to Berlin and they made the scene happening here. And it was just like a very amazing time. And there was a really strong scene going to Planet and E-Work every weekend. And it was a very closed scene. I don't know how many people were involved, maybe 2,000, 3,000 people. And then he became world famous quickly because this was no other club like Planet and E-Work. And I think this is where the house and techno culture starts here in Berlin. And Dr. Motte was the main DJ. Everybody was influenced by him. He played like amazing sets, hours and hours. to the morning hours and then there was already the first start of after hours here in Berlin into clubs and presort and people didn't know what's an after hour what do you mean like after hour what what what is that you know why you know because clubs regularly that time in Germany stop at three or four o'clock and suddenly there was no limitation you go to six or seven club and then Planet and E-Work goes to 9 or 10 or next day, midday. So because people really were so into that music, it was really kind of religion for everybody and like a very strong movement. And, you know, I know people, they, from the new scene, they say, oh, no, don't talk about Planet and E-Work all the time. You know, I was not there. I don't know what. that influence I was too young I was even not born whatever you know so but there was to me I was dancing for eight hours into either to music from Johnson or Terrible or Disco or Motte or Rock or some yeah it was based on Berlin DJs they were not sometimes they were international DJs But it was based on a Berlin house music scene, pretty strong and pretty amazing. Yeah, so I guess, all right, so if you played your first gig in Berlin sometime, you know, Tresor sometime. the early 90s. International DJ gigolo started not very long after that, right? 96, 97, yeah. So what happened in between? How did you turn into a professional DJ, label curator? I always had concepts for my own songs and producing and write ideas down and thinking about how this is going to be. the next step in my career so in 92 I did a record called My Definition of House Music and I think that brought me onto the map and into the scene and already known as producer and helped me going on on a worldwide career and that was pretty much tough because that record was a good seller as well and you know you will be everybody will watch what's going on on the next level and so I started on a pretty high level with first record and then I was not interested in this house music thing for the moment I thought I want to do some acid stuff now but more like faster and stronger because there was some really kind of rough acid movement at that time so I went into that. So I was producing and producing my first album. And then I got offered an A&R manager job from a big company in Frankfurt. They were looking for a manager. So they asked me to do it. And I had no experience into that world. I was just a producer and DJ. So I said, okay, why not trying that? Get behind the table, get into the music world with the lawyers, with the contracts, with seeing how this works, doing videos. And I worked with bands like Snap. Dr. Albarn and stuff like that. But I really was not touched by their music. I like Snap a lot because they did a lot of rhythms of dance and stuff like that. I liked their music and it was very well produced. But I thought, why not bringing bands like Orb? to the German market because when they released the album in the UK it went on number one the first day, you know, so I thought why not bring in some chill-out music and orb music to Germany and that was my, I think one of my first signings for that label but it didn't went into the charts so I also signed Blake Baxter that time. because he had a project with Moritz von Oswald. And I signed that stuff. And I also signed Felix. It was the number one record in the UK. And I think it went number two in Germany. But after a while, I stopped working there. I mean, I was not successful enough for their understanding. They forced me to stop, I was happy to stop. Then I thought it was like '94, before I moved to New York, I thought, I know how this music world, the music business works, and I will not go in there again. You know, I don't wanna, this is not my world. I wanna be a DJ and producer and maybe... not running your own label, not be involved in any kind of music business. But it was that time, so... I changed my mind in 96 and 97 because it was time to do something different. And because techno and especially techno music was going into a direction I was not totally agree with that. So I thought let's bring some different aspect to electronic music. So I started Gigolo. Signed people like Jeff Mills, Zombie Nation, Christopher Just, and people from Boston. He did a song called Save the Planet, Kill Yourself. And weird records I liked out of my collection and re-released it and some electro. So suddenly Miss Kitten and the Hacker, Tigger, Vitalik and, you know, till now after 300 releases and 15 years running the label. I see things differently and I'm happy that I decided to jump into the music business as well and find new artists, developing new movements, maybe be also responsible for a movement called Electro Clash. So I was even... giving the name to this movement, you know, it was based on my ideas. I remember this was jumping into the spotlight of the music world, fashion world and lifestyle world all over the world. It was exploding and everybody hated it. Being named or being put into this movement because it was maybe too popular. And if something gets too much in the spotlight... the innovative and good people are not interested anymore so on the highest point of this electro clash thing I stopped releasing this kind of music because I thought I'm somewhere else already. We did this in 98 and in 2002 I'm somewhere else already. I'm gonna follow the sign and the magic of a new sound coming out of New York called bands like LCD Sound System and Rapture. And there was a guy... putting out a lot of good stuff in England. Trevor Jackson on his label. And it was a very strong movement. I even don't have a name for it. Like dance, rock music suddenly became popular again. And like one year ago, in 2001, you were thinking, it's not possible that I'm going to play a track with a guitar sounding sound inside. And suddenly, this New York, no wave sound. jumped out everywhere and I was totally fascinated by them and I followed. I followed that sign, moving to New York again and worked with people like James Murphy and all this like innovative singer and producer. And so I went back to New York and when Electro Clash was on the highest level, but I was just not interested anymore. But nowadays, I think it's great that you were part or even like... behind that movement and pushed the bands behind that and did something for maybe the music history books. I see it differently now in 2013. I'm happy that I pushed it and I pushed all these artists. becoming famous and we did something especially for the scene and I felt nowadays a lot of DJs get into that vibe again, you know, like really great DJs get with labels like Hot Creation or, you know, all these kind of producers and DJs, they're looking for something different, you know. It doesn't sound too differently what we did back in the day. So I'm happy about that. And I also think that Gigolo was also kind of maybe blueprint for labels like Ed Banger or Kitsune, you know, because they followed this kind of footsteps, really taking care of covers, putting a great live show, taking care of... unusual DJ sets and break the rules and do whatever you want. And I think Ed Banger and Kitsun really went a great way and went very successful with the same concepts that we had some years before. So I'm quite happy to... was part of this movement and went maybe the right way. And what was the inspiration for the electroclash thing? It was a natural process. It popped out everywhere, all around the world. And I was like, wait a second, there is something happening. It's like sounding different, it's like song structure, people doing real songs with vocals and not influenced by the heart of techno movement or whatever happened before they really influenced by maybe pop music and just create a new style of... maybe 80s influenced kind of music and really putting a live act together and performing live on stage and getting away from this DJ culture. It was pretty much controlled by DJs already there and just do their thing and not be afraid of. not getting played from other DJs. It was like a very strong sign from everywhere. People from Australia, a lot of people from New York, people from... France, from Berlin. So I just collected them and said, let's do something together and let's give it a name. So I did. And what was the, what was like the catalyst of the whole thing? Like was, was there, you know, what made everyone find out about Electro Clash? There was a festival in New York done by another guy. And I was the musical director for that. And he was more getting the sponsors and the venues done. But suddenly he jumped into my business. And so I jumped out of that. But he still... I jumped out of the festival. But he still did it. I created already the name for it. And so then there was a lot of compilations like Electro Clash. And the press was loving it, you know, because there was a new movement. And there were so many bands dressed like freaky. Or, you know, there was fashion designers jumping into their live stage costumes with Miss Kitty and, you know, and Fischer Spooner and all these other bands. And it becomes something extraordinary and become even the worst magazines you will not think about ever talk to them, were reporting about this new movement. It was out of control. really out of control because it was all over. I remember on the TV news, on every magazine you can think about it, nobody wanted to miss this special new thing, so everybody was jumping on it. And it opened so many doors for a lot of artists and this kind of music. So it was kind of out of control because suddenly the major companies were jumping on all the artists I found and mostly they took them. So I knew I'm just like a guy finding them, pushing them, let them go their way. And then later on, there will be a big company paying even. a crazy amount of money for Fischer's Spooner. But I was okay with that, but I knew it. If something gets in a spotlight like that and they have a great live show, they have a great album, the major companies will jump on it. It was the same with the Deutsche Welle. It was the same with punk music. the same with all kinds of movements so it was the same with electro clash i don't want to say it was a sellout or anything but it was the same structure and same situation like with other movements so it seems like a natural phenomenon yeah it's a very natural phenomena and uh No one of the artists said, I want to stick to my thing. I'm not signing this big deal now. There was maybe Bobby Contis, but he was not. Sorry, but he was on Gigolo. But I did also stuff like... early Bobby Condor or Tuxedo Moon, you know, because I thought this is also necessary. And it was at the same time when Electro Clash was popular. I was not going the business way and just focusing on that and putting another compilation, another act, sign a major contract. We signed a distribution contract at that time with a company from Berlin here. They moved from Hamburg to Berlin called Universal Records. But that was just like a... distribution deal and a lot of people in the scene I think misunderstood it and didn't like it they said oh Gigolo is selling out they're signing with the major companies but what I did was just like saying I want to give all these great artists and people a better opportunity to sell the music there was never any compromise on any release or any remix even you know I really controlled every little detail and if there was a remix I'm not agreeing on it I didn't release it you know and I did not allow to let the majors release it so it was a distribution deal it was a business deal yeah but for better distribution and more getting into the spotlight for the ciclo artists so you just kind of said how the same thing had happened with them Deutsche Welle and punk and everything. Yeah. It just kind of made me think. So you've seen these movements kind of come through and since electro clash. Has there been another one as big or as significant as those? Yeah, I would say Minimal was a huge movement after Electro Clash. But this magic that goes out from DFA at that time... and a Trevor Jackson's label and maybe Gigolo Records never touched the German market as I was thinking you know I don't know it's interesting that it was never as popular I mean it's still there but it was never as big as it went worldwide you know so But I mean, Ed Banger and Kitsune, they did a lot of stuff like sounding like that. And there was this electroclash movement was still there somewhere. and picked up by newer young guys now, but they maybe don't think about this electroclassic thing. They just like that music. So I think the minimal wave was a big movement, but also this kind of formulas and structures were done already 10 years ago. by people from Cologne or people from Berlin called Studio One and around the Compact family. They were very based on minimal music. I mean, Jeff Mills did a lot of concepts on minimal music on Axis and other labels and Basic Channel. And Chain Reaction was doing these concepts already in the mid-early 90s. Okay, it was a new digital version out of these concepts and formulas, but I don't think it was kind of totally pretty new. But it was hard and it was like never stopping till now, till we're talking. It's still around, you know, but I think this minimal movement was pretty much... innovative in a way and the good thing is it jumped into or it got a marriage with the house music and even early Detroit kind of techno music mixed with the minimal music becoming a sound I would call it the sound of Berlin or the soundtrack of Berlin and it's still it's still around now it's a mixture of early house music, digital minimal music, concepts of disco and techno and wow, it's... I don't know what's the new name for it. I call it the minimal or I call it the Berlin sound or Berlin house, you know, because people now say it's the deep house. But to me, Deep House was a different understanding and formula, original Deep House. So if they call it Deep House, I don't think it's Deep House in that original meaning, but it doesn't matter, whatever you call it. But I play a lot of that stuff, you know, popular, like newer stuff of the so-called Deep House scene. But on the other side, there's a huge new techno movement coming up with the younger guys everywhere and based on loop concepts and stuff. And it's pretty much... powerful and really, really, really, really innovative again, you know, because we had this loop area already using cycles on a vinyl in the mid-90s and playing only loops on three record tables and creating some, you know, putting the sequences on top and using some high hits from that record and some kick. snare from that record and create something unique you know it was more like a dj thing using the loops and um i think this is coming back in more like a techno direction and um i don't know what's the wave of the summer you tell me i have no idea i just see there's so many great music i buy so many music now every day uh in the shops here on the internet on what I get from other people or DJs or sending in as a demo. It's so many great produced and innovative music at this moment. For the DJs, it's unbelievable. So that part never changed, you buying music like a maniac. That never slowed down, really. on a different level. I mean, these days you just don't go to the record shops, but I still go to the record shops because there's a lot of vinyl-only stuff, limited stuff, and if I would not get the vinyl, you know, I went to a phonica in London and I bought so many amazing stuff I didn't find on the internet or, let's say, on Beatport or on other... possible download portals so I'm checking every possible sometimes I even download some YouTube stuff I mean it's not sounding good but you can rework it in the studio and you do all your special DJ edits for hyping up your own DJ set and And, you know, it's looking for news and new material and old material remastered or redone by yourself with an edit. It never stops, you know. True. So at this point, I mean, you know, you have this kind of classic label. You've done more than a dozen DJ mixes, a few albums. do you feel like there's anything left that you haven't done that you really want to do or that you want to satisfy? I released a single two days, three days ago, first of July, and it's with a singer called Klaus Nomi. And I never touched that opera electronic. kind of area and that was something new for me so that's why I did it and I think Klaus Nomi was an outstanding great innovative singer and person person he had an amazing personality and an unbelievable voice and the great thing when you get deep into his story He's from Bavaria, moved to Berlin, and then went to New York. I did the same thing. I was born in Bavaria, moved to Berlin, went to New York, and went back. We have some similarity here and I was really inspired by him already in the early 80s doing this opera electronic kind of music and so that was something new in my life, in my DJ and producer world so I get the rights of the original songs. and did a new kind of version and that's the new single and it's it's out now and that's a that's a new area for me i don't know where where where this will take me so uh um that's that's something new and fresh for me i don't want to repeat what i did already so um what's your next project after this mix Do you think you have another album in the pipeline? There's so many of you where you said maybe 2014, like you do one every five years. True, it's five years coming up, yeah. I had some tracks done, but it's based on another concept. And I will release it, but not as an album. And you need a really kind of concept or... or the right feeling for doing a new album and I talked to some people already but it's nothing we start now but the only thing I can say is maybe it's gonna be a techno album no vocals It's going to be some vocals maybe, but there's a lot of DJs nowadays, they say, I don't like if there's some vocals or voices in there. I don't play the track. It's not cool. So whatever. I was always into vocals but I think the new album, it will be produced in Berlin. I can't tell you names but I talk to them now and they agreed on really doing a techno album. So I start after the summer because they're on vacation now and some guys I always dreamed about to work with them. And finally, after 20 years meeting these people, I kind of sit in the studio with them and do, I think it's going to be a techno album.
