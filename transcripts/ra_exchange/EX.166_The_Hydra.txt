Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. In the most competitive clubbing market in the world, the Hydras stood tall by championing diversity. The London event series is the brainchild of Dolan Bergen and AJ Jayaram, who came together last year to create a season of parties that showcased some of dance music's best labels and promoters. Their stories up to that point reflected the shifting tides of London's club scene. JRM worked for a decade at the end, the much-loved London Club that, along with many other venues in the city, closed its doors in 2009. Bergen, meanwhile, started his electric mines parties back in 2005. He utilised disused spaces in East London until increasing pressure from local authorities meant a migration to the warehouses and lofts that had recently become so prevalent in London. As they get into the swing of their latest season, I sat down with them to discuss the next big shifts in the scene and the hyper-competitive world of London event promotions. So I just wanted to start, you recently launched your latest event series, which I would have guessed would have been in the last month. Is that right, AJ? The very first night was Friday, sorry, Saturday even, the 24th of August. 24th of August. With the blueprint. So we launched on the August Bank holiday weekend, as we did last year. with a double header, blueprint and running back this year. How did it go? Yeah, I mean, it was pretty fraught with challenges and difficulties and massive stress. But overall, I think it went pretty well. What was the main stress, would you say, on that particular evening? Just the dynamic between Dolan and I? I don't know. You know, we... It's hard. We work really hard to try and get everything done. you know, dear to certain sort of values in terms of sound, operation, programming, promo, the whole thing. You know, we're a two-man operation putting together just shy of 20 events. So there are other people involved, but fundamentally it's Dolan and I really sort of driving everything. So, you know, on event weekend... I think for the electric and blueprint we had 1,700, 1,800 people. We had about 800, 900 for running backs. A lot of people to try and keep happy, if you know what I mean. So it's a mission, but we're quietly confident that we're capable of doing a good job and hopefully that came through that weekend, really. Sorry, go on, Dan. Yeah, no, I was just going to say that there's also, like, implications of using two venues across two nights. So one in South London and then straight to East London on the day afterwards. And it's just the small things, really, of just managing that between the two places. Yeah, as you say, a bit of a stress, but it went really well, I think, in the end. Both were full and there was no major hiccups. So that was the main thing. Everyone seemed pleased with it. Could you, maybe for people who are not as aware of what you do, could you kind of summarise this season and approach and just tell us about your... kind of mission statement and how these things play out for you. If we go further back a little bit to the first year and you know the Hydra in 2012, really that was a case of Dolan and I bringing together label showcases, events that we'd both been working on and were looking to work on. And really, it just seemed like an interesting idea to bring them together all under one banner. So first year was obviously kind of a case of setting out our stall, but this year really, I guess, was about consolidation. was about scaling up to a degree, you know, within reason, working with the people that we enjoyed working with and the events that worked last year and adding a few new, hopefully exciting and interesting bits into the mix. So I think we kind of achieved that. you know, almost 50% more events this year. I guess another feature of what happened last year, really, and this was serendipity more than design, but it's something we've talked about a bit, but it's the fact that we originally started off planning on doing the whole series at Hackney Down Studios, which is an incredible space in London. But we actually found out sort of a month before we launched the series last year that it wasn't going to be possible. Yeah, it ended up being a case of us sort of having to move those 12 events into various clubs and spaces all over London. And for this year, really, a similar-ish kind of thing happened with... studio spaces in Wapping, which had been a sort of home for us with a few events and planned to do the bulk of the events this year there. And we had a licensing application. Unfortunately, it was rejected. So we ended up using lots of different venues again this year. And that's kind of become a USP of sorts. really like I say not by design but I think it's interesting the way that's evolved and we do our best to make sure that every venue we go into we make it the way we want it to be if it was our own venue really I guess one of the striking things from the outside the back of the series is the way that it's largely based around record labels what's kind of behind that decision? Like, where does that model come from for you guys? I think personally, a large part of that is just my own. background in this industry and you know something we did a lot at the end um and i kind of also think that um labels and and you know the producers who who work together and release some records you know it's kind of a gang it's kind of a tribe and i think people sort of subscribe to those tribes and gangs and identify with them And it certainly, for us in any case, it certainly distinguishes what we do from, I guess, a lot of other nights where a promoter may, you know, it's absolutely great to do this, but a promoter may choose to have his or her sort of favourite DJs and people who they're following at a given moment in time, bringing those together. But I think with the label stuff, it kind of happens sort of extensively more organically because these people sort of work together. And so they kind of I guess they feel a desire to want to do things together. And that actually helps us to put the events together in the way that we want, because we work very collaboratively with all of the labels, all the artists. And ultimately, I think it ends up with us providing something a little bit different. Can you talk a little bit about, you mentioned the end there and sort of your background. Can you tell us a little bit about sort of where you've come from and what's got you up to this point? Yeah. So I started at the end in 2000 as the office junior. And I was pretty lucky, actually. A couple of things happened quite early on. The first was that the head programmer at the time, a girl called Charlotte, who was working with Leo very closely on everything, she left to take a role at MTV. Within a year of sort of being off as junior, I was kind of... sort of fast-tracked into the promotions side of things and the programming side of things. And then probably about six months after that, as a result of the success of Low Life and I guess Love Story, Leo and Matt, Leo and Bushwacker, they signed to Excel. And what that meant was that... Leo's sort of workload increased exponentially and his DJ schedule went through the roof. They were both playing every Friday, every Saturday, every weekend, lots of festivals, trips to Brazil. They were super busy. So his commitments were stretched. Also, I had to record a... a new album as well. So as a result of that, I kind of had to step up a little bit and took on more programming responsibility. And, you know, it was a great opportunity for me. I'll always be grateful for that. And I guess, you know. It required a lot of trust from him. But I kind of like to think that I engendered that trust in as much as. I had a deep love of music, which he was aware of, probably a little bit nerdy as well, which kind of helps. So, you know, I kind of ended up doing the programming in that way. And soon enough, I had more or less complete autonomy, which was, you know, amazing, really. And I was at the end until it closed. So I was there for about 10 years. And then after that, one of my colleagues there, Ryan, one of the things that came out of the close was that Ryan and I had to tell. all of the people that we'd sort of booked in for various nights, what was happening. And, you know, a nice thing really to come with that for us was the fact that a lot of them asked us, you know, what are you guys doing? Are you planning on promoting? Are you going to carry on? And if so, then, you know, we'd love to work with you, which is great for us. So that was kind of the catalyst for us setting up We Fear Silence. We did that for about a year completely independently. It's kind of similar to now at various London venues. But it was extremely difficult. The recession had kicked in fully by then. Some parties we were making money, some parties we were losing money. It was hard going. And in a sense, what kind of bailed us out, and I actually also like to think we kind of bailed them out as well, but we were approached by Cable who asked us to, basically they asked us to get involved because, you know, they'd had a team in place. a fairly sort of inauspicious start, unfortunately. But one of the things they said to us was when the team originally discussed... what they wanted to do, what their ethos was going to be, that apparently unanimously they kind of said that they wanted it to be, to fill the gap at the end effectively. So they approached us about more or less doing that. And they kind of, you know, they kind of gave us the keys, keys to the Ferrari and free reign to go in and kind of create a nightclub in our own image, if you like, which for Ryan and I was just... Incredible. So we gave it a shot. Ryan took on the operations side of things. I kind of carried on with the programming and promotions. We put a team together and we did that for a while. And, you know, I think I think we had certain successes. had a very strong residency that we brought in with Blueprint. Deviation came in, Swamp81, Shogun Audio, Butters. There was some... Interesting key nights there and really reflected the kind of across the board ethos of what we had always wanted to do with We Fear Silence. I suppose latterly really what happened was, you know, these nights, as is the case with most stuff that we currently do, Dolan and I, they're a niche of a niche. No one's sort of making a fortune here. As a business, it's very difficult to sustain that. So in the end, after sort of much deliberation and discussion, I ended up leaving in October of, last year, year before, would have been? Yeah, 2011. And then... Shortly after that is kind of when we set up Broken Hand Uneven and The Hydra. And what actually happened was Dolan actually approached Cable probably July of that year about bringing Oscar Ton to the venue. Unfortunately, his venue had fallen through. Something's never changed, obviously. But his venue had fallen through. And so we sort of worked together on that event. Went really well. Dylan and I struck up a friendship. We realised we had a similar outlook on music and the way that the industry and this kind of our side of things work. And, yeah, like I say, we had we both had a few things we were working on in terms of the label showcases or events or brands or whatever. And we also had a few things that we both wanted to work on. And it was just a natural alliance. I think, you know, we dovetail very well. You know, Dolan's really, really good at things I'm utterly hopeless at. Such as? I'm not very well organised. Okay. Dolan's a machine when it comes to things like that. Absolutely next level. But it really works in that sense. So, you know, pulling our ideas together and, you know, working... together on a business and ultimately on this series felt like the right thing to do, I think. Yeah, sure. Dolan, can you tell us a little bit about Electric Minds, which I think in London is the name, the umbrella term that most people associate you with. And how long, when did that all start for you? I'm just trying to think what year it started. It's about seven years old. And where we are in Dalston now, at the moment where your offices are, I used to live just across the road. And Dalston was a different place back then. You know, there was a lot of free parties. You could put on parties and you wouldn't really get too much of a problem. And I lived in a big warehouse just over the road. I initially set it up with a friend as a free party. We had a big warehouse, two floors, eight of us living there. And I just found the name of a record, an old boogie record. I quite liked it. It was called Electric Minds, or it was by Electric Minds. And we were in a rush to find the name for a party we put on. It was a free event. We did it and just from like word of mouth or an email, about a thousand people turned up. For the first event? Yeah, it was a friend's birthday and it was, you know, like it was a community in Dalston. Everything was like warehouses. If we weren't having a party, then there'd be someone else. Every weekend you could find something. It's different now, you know, I won't bore you all about it, but, you know, it's rules and regulations that didn't really exist So after I did a few parties at my house, the people I lived with, they couldn't sustain that for much longer. So I looked for elsewhere. In East London at the time, there was a lot of empty spaces, especially in Dalston, even up to Limehouse. You could find places and it was a very simple matter. applying for a small license and you could put on a party. So Electric Minds started from there. I was also working with some producers at the time and it's made sense to start a record label. Like it was all one thing and it was fun. You know, we did a party every now and then, every now and then we did a record and I went on for... a while I had a few problems sometimes with the police you know sometimes they'd come down but it it seemed to be quite easy to do not easy it was very stressful but it was you could continue this series of parties every now and then and use different spaces like an empty church a warehouse a basement um and that went on for a while I'm just trying to think when I had a friend that I lived with who had a studio in Shoreditch and that's when it really started to become more of a regular thing. We started doing a series of parties in this loft space in Shoreditch. And that was incredible. It holds like 250, 300 people. And I just decided one year, rather than doing these small bookings every now and then, why not do a series of events and announce in January seven, eight dates for the whole year. So that's when we started getting people in like Move D, Tony Leone. I think Marcus Wargall and Christopher Rowe, it was just people that were willing to play in a space like that and maybe not so much for the money but more for the party. really it was good and it got a good reputation um i did did that for a while and i was happy to do that i was working full-time it was kind of something i did outside of work but then things became a bit more serious and i enjoyed it i wanted to do it more and more and um Shortly before I met AJ, I started working with Ali from Warm. We started to up the game, do these bigger events, start working with people like Lovebox. I brought over Marcel Dettmann quite a while ago to do a comics album launch party. So there was a relationship with Oscar Ton. Ali did the first Oscar Ton event at Corsica Studios. And after that, we decided, let's do a series of events as well as doing the Warm and Electric Minds. Let's do... you know, Oscar Ton or speak to Lovebots about doing, you know, a launch party because there's only so much you can do with Electric Minds or your own brand. You know, you can't have every week like Electric Minds have a list of DJs. And we were excited by Oscar Ton and other labels like that. So it made sense to kind of ask them if we could like handle their London shows. We did some really amazing parties for Oscar Ton. That was a very difficult one because there was a huge amount of expectation on us because everyone thought we were trying to... you know, emulate Berghain and Panorama Bar in London, which we weren't. We were trying to, you know, do a label showcase, but we turned an empty space in Shoreditch, the Red Gallery, into like a really amazing party, a lot of trouble, like, you know, even to the draping, putting it up on the walls, to the sound, it was good acoustics. So I think from doing that, people were interested in working with us. And just as Ali wanted to concentrate on his agency because he was basically working flat out, I then met AJ from doing the Oscar Tonic Cable. really was looking for someone to work with me because you can only do so much on your own and you've got to have nerves of steel really to do these things because they cost a lot of money and you need to have a pool of resources. And as AJ said, it was just the right time and we met. We both were into music that we were into and it made sense. AJ bringing a side of electronic music that perhaps I didn't have so much of a knowledge of. He was talking about Ninja Tunes and the guys from Deviation. It's not a million miles away from what we do, but it was stuff that was maybe not something I'd look at. And that's when the idea came to sort of do a series and pool our resources and bring in what we'd consider to be like-minded labels. We're really clear on who we want to work with and there's a side of electronic music that we prefer to say that we don't. to work with um i think we've probably been talking for 10-15 minutes at this point and um i've heard lots of words like stressful yeah there's a pain in the ass um and you know phrases to this effect so i think my next question has to be what is the base motivation for you guys like why did you start doing this what what is this innate desire you have to to do this because it you know ostensibly seems like one of the most stressful jobs in the world I mean it definitely is anyone that's around us will know well me in particular that I'm a nightmare when I get stressed it's like you know all hell breaks loose AJ's much calmer and I guess the two work well together but There's not a lot of money in this. People think that as a promoter, you're walking away with tens of thousands of pounds. You know, the level of money, especially doing what we're doing, is small. And therefore, we don't have a massive team around us. It's just AJ and I. And we're lucky that we work with people on a part-time basis that are really amazing, everyone that works with us. But we have to do a lot of work. I guess it is very competitive in London and we're both, fair to say, quite competitive people and we like to succeed. So we want to do things properly. You know, we want to, I don't know, there's a goal out there. We want to do the impossible and certainly doing a series in London when you've got other London bookings to consider that you may not have. to do in other cities because there's not so much competition it's almost impossible to do the series so as soon as someone says no then we want to say yes you know it's like i don't know why it's i guess it's the makeup of of the person do you feel like you have a similarly competitive streak aj um I mean, I'm not sure I'm quite as competitive as Dalen, but there's probably an element of, you know, because I've done this for a while, there's probably an element of I probably can't do anything else, frankly. I do think we're very privileged to be working with music. We're both just huge fans of whatever we're into. And people will talk to you about whether or not you just go and work in a bank or do something that's potentially more lucrative. Well, yeah, I'm sure both of us could do that and we'd earn probably more money. want to throw ourselves off a cliff. You know, I mean, it's, we're lucky to be able to do this and to be able to be immersed in an industry, which, you know, I think there's definitely something exciting about standing on a stage of a London venue, seeing Mad Mike, Robert Hood and Jeff Mills all kind of like high-fiving each other for the first time in 20 years. I mean. call me romantic, but that was kind of kind of, you know, it's kind of cool. And you don't get those moments in an investment bank or, or wherever. So there's definitely that. Would you say it's quite high highs and low lows? Yeah, I think, I think so, but probably like lots of other jobs, you know, I'm sure. I'm sure that's the case of lots of other professions. But, you know, the highs can be really high and the lows can be soul destroying probably. But, you know, we set out to do this. You know, Dylan's right. We're not putting on a Vici at the O2. We're not sort of walking away with bundles of cash, but I think we both feel that long term, and it is a long term plan. It's not a hit and run. You know, we're in this for a while, hopefully, that, you know, the Hydra and everything we do evolves in the right way that, you know, it will earn us a good living and we'll both be able to enjoy what we're doing. without sort of stressing out as much as we are now and it'll kind of plateau a little bit, you know, in that sense. Really, as AJ said, like the reason that we're in it is because, you know, I buy records, you know, I like to DJ. That was the main interest, you know, to start off with. The kind of crazy competitive side is like you have to have it because it's not really much a competition in terms of other promoters and clubs. It's the authorities. It goes against you sometimes to do it. So you have got to have a little bit of something to kind of get you through those crazy times because there has been moments where, you know, you've lost a venue on the day and you've got like 40 or 50,000 pounds invested in it. And I don't know, you just get... faced with such impossible situations sometimes that there has to be a mix of like passion competitiveness you know drive all of those things to to get you through it because yeah there are testing times definitely i mean i also think that you know whether competitiveness is the right phrase or not i'm not sure but you know what one one thing that um you know dolan you know and myself, but, you know, Don in particular, I guess, with the more off-location stuff, which, you know, he's been more of a pioneer of almost than myself because I'm more used to sort of licensed venues, but he's utterly uncompromising with things like sound, operations, the bar team, just making sure that everything is of the highest calibre. And, you know, not everyone in London is like that, unfortunately. But if that's how the competitiveness manifests itself, then I think that's a good thing. So obviously there are myriad considerations and things to think about. doing what you do so what i'd like to know is how you would sit down and um begin to conceive of the season of events such as the ones you put on like what's the starting point for you um i think the starting point is like the core people that you work with so like electric minds is something i've done for a long time now so we have our regular schedule of events that we want to do that Oscar Ton's pretty much been there from the beginning. AJ's worked with Blueprint. There are the labels that I think will always be the core of it. But really the start of it is a bit of a brainstorm really, isn't it? We sit down, have a list of everyone we want to work with and then starts the work of contacting labels, agents, managers, trying to put all of this together. really I mean say for this year we're in September now the series started in August we started working on this in November I think and we really only got to the point of launching a series in July June, July, took eight months to put together 20, 20, 23 events, basically. Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, if anything, we were slightly behind with things last year because the first season kind of took it out of us. But I think really, you know, the first port of call is in a sense, you know, now that we've got one under our belt is looking at how that went, looking at what worked. I think it's easy to forget, you know, to consider and look at who we enjoyed working with. You know, that's vitally important, I think. Did you have sort of key learnings from last year? Were there any takeaways or things that you wanted to do better? How long have we got? The biggest change for this year is last year was, I think, the end of... the mass amount of warehouse off-location parties in London. I mean, I won't get into it all because my girlfriends, AJ, everyone around me is so bored of hearing about it. But there's been a directive from like... the government to very tighten up on licensing. It's seen as a waste of money on public services. You know, they want to tighten up on it. So the biggest change this year, and actually it's been a relief really, is that we've moved away from doing warehouse parties and we're working with a group of venues in London that we consider to be to be of a really good standard and and and you what you have with that is stability there's no risk i mean i've lost track of the amount of times now we've had a venue pulled from us on the day of an event you know by working with these venues we we hopefully have seen the back of that and um you know that gives peace of mind to the labels we work with with us our sanity you know it can't it couldn't continue and I think that's a trend in London that everyone's seen. And I was talking to someone from New York yesterday and I think that's actually the same things going on there as well. Yeah, I'd say it's the biggest learning curve really to get out of that. Not to dive too deeply down the TBA, East London rabbit hole, but what got us to that place? Or was there such a proliferation of these type of events over the last few years? I think, as AJ said, when the end start, There was, I mean, this has been covered a lot of times. There was a lot of nightclubs in London and those options have gone. So it propelled everyone to want to use their own space. It's also fun. It's a bit edgy. You know, people wanted that kind of edginess. But I mean, after a few years, you know, the simple things like, you know, good toilets, air conditioning, all that kind of stuff. People were like, OK, well, we've There's no facilities and, you know, licensed venues might not have that excitement, but they have everything else. And I think people are starting to realize that now. And I think it's a good thing, but then it's a bad thing. You know, it does lose its creativity. We've had some, I mean, amazing events. The one we did last year at Hacky Downs for Oscar Ton of Substance, I think, I don't think will be seen. for a while, you know, so it loses that. But then, you know, it's a safe environment, at least for everyone now. And it gives us some stability. I hate to talk about the money, but financially, you can't do 25 events and risk losing a venue for them all. We'd never be able to do it again. And what about this sort of what I would consider to be a slightly newer model where you do work seasonally, you're working in blocks of events, things like the warehouse project in Manchester, like what's kind of given rise to this different way of doing things, do you think? I think certainly in London, everything is seasonal. And you look at the way electronic music's gone, you know, January, everyone goes to Mexico for a festival. March is Miami, you know, then the Croatia and Ibiza kicks off. For us, I've always found winter and autumn to be a really good time to do events. People are, you know, the festival season's behind them, they've recharged, and then it's... kind of heads down really if people want to go out and you know they're in London and they're they're ready to do it I suppose on the face of it when you when you in the context of this conversation and obviously what the warehouse project have achieved over 10 10 years I think it might appear to be the case that the back end of the year is sort of top loaded with events. But outside of our series, maybe in motion, I suppose you could throw into that category. I don't think there are loads of series that take place like that in the UK necessarily. you know, increasingly you need to avoid the summer like the plague because there is sort of 10 festivals a weekend, all of which may have some kind of influence on what you're doing. But do you think that that's become more so the case in the time you've been working in dance music? I mean, this festival has had a really, really big impact on the local club scenes, like to an increasing extent. Yeah, I mean, it's on so many levels, just, you know, whether it's pulling people away from what you're doing or just the simple sort of difficulties of booking people. Therefore, you know, what was interesting about last year was. in a new sense was sort of when we had Block in the kind of period of the year that it took place, they'd ring-fenced a lot of sort of DJs and artists and understandably so, but it kind of put a new complexion on the whole sort of the year because then we had to reassess the way we're going to do things. And, you know, even things like that, I guess, may push promoters to... to the end of the year or to look at doing things differently. But it's more and more tricky to work out how to, you know, where to place everything. We try really hard to, you know, to work with the likes of Judy and Andy at Fabric or, you know, the guys at Corsica. and try and help give everyone a decent stab at their bookings. But obviously on top of that, there are independent promoters who are looking to create new events and put on new nights. It just makes it even more complicated. It's very, very saturated at the moment. which makes things hard. I mean, taking something of a step back, you say the market's saturated. Do you think London's a good place to go out for a clubber at the moment? generally speaking? I mean, yes and no. I think, which is obviously a total cop-out, I think, you know, you could argue that London's kind of on its arse because, as we were talking about a minute ago, you know, those, you know, we lost the end, we lost Turnmills, the King's Cross venues, you know, Key, Canvas, the Cross. even more recently, Matter and Cable. They were all venues of a certain standing. Arguably, none of those have been adequately replaced. And then, you know, we're talking about the off-location thing. If that is dying down now, then it's kind of like, you know, outside of, you know, the key strongholds in London fabric ministry and I don't know, the likes of maybe XOI or FIRE that are kind of in the ascendancy, I guess. You know, there's not an awful lot there. And this is London. You know, this is a key territory. Conversely, I do think that whilst the venue situation isn't great, the music situation, I think, is. You know, I think, you know, there's more interesting, you know, diverse. you know, cutting edge music coming from this city or the UK in general, Bristol maybe, than arguably there's ever been. So, you know, your experience going out can... can still be really enjoyable. How much of a factor is dealing with local authorities and the police in London? Yeah, it's basically become more and more of an issue, really. You have to work very closely with them. And I guess in some respects, rightly so, because you're... you're responsible for, you know, X amount of people. And obviously you want to make sure that everyone's safe and having a good time. But the essence of a party is there has to be some kind of hedonism in there. And you get away from your week and you want to lose your, well, you want to lose yourself for the night because, you know, you're stressed, you work, everyone's in jobs that sometimes they don't particularly like. And they're basically asking us now to put such controls on it that you'll lose that factor. So, you know, you don't want to go to a venue and be fully searched at the door with metal detectors. And I don't know, it just doesn't really, it's not part of the party, really. You know, we've just got back from Dimensions Festival, which they had like the most amazing sound systems we've ever really heard outside. And that's because, you know, the Croatian authorities are perhaps a bit more lenient with them. with that side of things. But if you go to a festival in England now, you know, everyone moans about a festival organiser saying, oh, they haven't put in a good enough sound system. But the fact of the matter is you've got 10 council officials sitting outside the festival DB meters ready to, you know, whack a £50,000 fine on the organisers if they go over a certain level. I just think it's got a bit out of control. in 20 years you know that I've been going to events I don't think we've progressed any further with dealing with authorities in fact I think there's more restrictions now on nightlife than there was 20 years ago which is quite a sad state of affairs really I mean can you see that only getting worse is that kind of a long-term worry for for what you do um I mean I don't know too much about it but we've We've got a conservative government and, you know, this comes from the top somewhere. You know, there's whatever way you look at it, there's increased pressures on the nightlife, be that noise levels, environmental health. you know, what searches you have to have at the door, you know. I mean, what you actually have to do with people if they, you know, do break the law inside the club, you know, you're basically being asked to hand them over to the police, which is a bit upsetting, to be honest, because, you know, you're organising something that's supposed to be fun and obviously you have safety in mind for people. But we do expect people to make up their mind about a few things. And yeah, I don't know what's to come in the future, but it would seem, having talked to other London venues, that everyone's facing serious pressure at the moment. Yeah, I mean, it comes across, you know, everything that's been mentioned there and the state of affairs generally, it kind of comes across as a bit... sort of draconian, the measures that have been taken. And, you know, some of them you do sort of, you do sympathise with and understand, but at some point, as with many sort of things like this, I suppose, common sense has to prevail and, you know, people want to go out. They want to listen to music. They want to dance. They want to enjoy themselves. And if that's being prohibited by measures that are simply over the top, then that's just a real shame. Do you think there's a lack of dialogue and understanding between the two sides? Almost certainly, I'd have thought so. I mean, you know, the recent clampdown, if you like. is almost a case of them just suddenly realising that there are a lot of off-location events going on in the sense that it hadn't been monitored up until now and, you know, the boroughs aren't talking to each other and suddenly, lo and behold, you know, it's... it's a mild panic because um you know the pennies dropped do you feel as though um working in more regular well working in stable venues is um a little bit easier in this respect like are you under less pressure than if you're um going with the tba model um i'm actually quite surprised this year because when we announced TBA venues for, you know, labels like Indovisions and Oscar Tarn and everyone else we work with, the amount of dialogue, especially on like Resident Advisor and the forums was unprecedented really for some of them. Just to clarify, that was in reaction to some of these? Well, you know, guessing where the venue is. Oh, I see. Right. And it wasn't a game that we wouldn't tell people. we had to move venues sometimes four or five times before we even announced it. So it was very stressful. And, you know, yeah, I mean, it is a consideration, definitely. And I think this year when we've announced... all of the venues, there hasn't really been much of a reaction in terms of like people, you know, negatively commenting. Everyone, I think, sort of appreciates it and knows where they're at. We can announce their venue. They can plan their travel. If they've got to book a hotel. And we've picked good venues, I think. Everyone's happy with them so far. Yeah, and I think also, you know, in terms of that sort of feedback, you know, all feedback is... Well, sort of constructive feedback is welcome. But, you know, I think with established license venues, you know, there's only so much that we can do to try and get them to the level that we feel that they should be. So any criticism leveled specific, you know, space is. I guess it feels more that we don't have to shoulder the full burden of that, you know, which does take the pressure off a little bit because, you know, you'll know better than us, Ryan. Sometimes the forums just, you know, they're pretty vitriolic and intense. Well, I did want to talk to you about that because, I mean, I guess I just want to know. How disheartening is that to you as a promoter to browse like a resident advisor forum, Fred? Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, Dylan and I probably share slightly different opinions to a degree on this in as much as, you know, my, when we were at the end, we, and this is with respect, we generally didn't really. read the forums at all. It wasn't sort of like a company-wide kind of maxim or anything like that, but it was more a case of just, you know, we were heads down, very much a case of, you know, let's just crack on and do what we do and not worry too much about, you know, trolls or anything like this. And that's not to say the feedback isn't welcome, as I say, but I think it's more a case of... If you pay too much attention to... negative feedback on a forum. You know, all you need is probably three people commenting negatively on the same thing before it actually feels like everyone who attended that party feels the same way about it. And that is disheartening because, you know, as we mentioned in this discussion, we, you know, we do put a lot into it. So at that level, it's hard to sort of not take it personally. Um, so I, I try and personally try and steer clear of the forums. You, you won't really see me on there. Um, Dylan's very much the voice, um, on, on the forums and, and, you know, he'll, he'll, he, he fights our corner and, and does so really well, I think. But, um. I think sometimes it just feels a little bit like the comments being made are either sort of willfully kind of incendiary or, you know, deliberately trying to provoke because you can tell quite often that a comment's been made without actually either thinking it through in terms of what's gone on or just, you know, from a position of... of kind of blind ignorance almost because, and what's nice is when they get found out by other people on the forum. There was something really nice recently actually, and it must have been after the Blueprint event where a handful of people were basically sort of, someone had made a comment about the sound, which is a hugely subjective thing anyway, but a group of people started commenting on the fact that, you know, well, at least someone is putting these events on in London. you know, whoever made that comment is only on the forum and only went because they were interested in what we're doing. And it's, it was just a really nice kind of unique bit of solidarity that I don't think we see enough on the forum, sadly. I think it's quite good to engage sometimes. And like, there's been a few occasions where I just think some stuff's been written is so unjust. Like I just can't help myself almost than to like answer the points. Cause. you know, why wouldn't you? You know, you've put all this time and effort into it and, you know, it would be silly of us to think that people would think about all the effort to go into it. But yeah, I mean, I guess this is now a... sort of modern reality of being a promoter isn't it it's the instant feedback yeah and I but that is the primary reason I look at it for feedback you know it's good to hear why people enjoyed it or didn't enjoy it and most of the you know most of it's actually true you know we haven't been happy with things it's echoed in what we hear online so yeah I mean it's good really obviously there's been a few comments where great but but I think it's good to engage so I just wanted to kind of look to the future a little bit I just wondered how you kind of see what you're doing developing obviously you've got your next few months lined up but how far can you take this like how far do you plan to take this have you thought that far ahead yeah I mean we definitely have The thing that's lacking in London is big venues. We're really happy with what we've done this year and we hope that we can do that next year and come up with some more interesting ideas. We'd definitely like... do a few shows, not loads, but two or three that are going to be big. But you're very restricted in London with the venue situation at the moment. I think it would be nice to have options of three, four, five thousand people. There are certainly shows where you could probably afford to. invest in that and, you know, there'd be exciting shows to do, but there really is only two, maybe three venues that... that have the capacity to do those shows. And usually they're restricted to like three o'clock in the morning. And that's not what people want. They want to be able to go out till six, seven, eight o'clock in the morning. So we're looking at that now and hopefully we can do that for next year. Yeah, I mean, we're literally just getting into sort of ideas for programming for next year as we speak. But I think it'll sort of really... It'll be a case of, you know, let's say we do 25, 26 events next year, then I think it'd be a case of a handful of those being. hopefully quite large um some in the middle maybe some really quite small but um the the the conceit really will be to to um pick up from where we you know we'll have left off at the end of this year um and just see what else is you know what else is going on at the end of the year we'll reflect upon how the year's been musically um as we were saying earlier we'll take a view on the things that work but also you know i think with each year we want to we want to keep it fresh we want to keep doing new and interesting things um you know i suppose if you're operating at a level like the warehouse project for example um it's it must be so difficult to try each time to sort of do a series of that scale and and keep it completely different year after year it's impossible really um i think Perhaps because we're, you know, we're quite a bit smaller at the moment, you know, we can still sort of flex in that way. But, you know, yeah, it's a long-term plan, as we were saying before. Hopefully, you know, we'll get five years under our belt and then maybe look at completely flipping the script and doing something totally different, but within the same sort of framework. The benefit or what it became about... with using lots of different venues is they're all of different sizes. There's lots of labels that we like and that was the reason why we wanted to do this series because there's lots of music that we love and some of it isn't suitable for a venue of a thousand people so we can use different venues and we can still work with small labels and we can still work with the bigger ones and hopefully there is that kind of eclectic feel to the series and certainly something that... It's perhaps not always represented in London. So hopefully there's room for it all, basically, for next year. Do you feel as though there are still people out there in London who want to open new venues? Yeah, I mean, we would like to, you know. But again, the amount of money needed, you know. Is it just a little bit out of reach at the moment, do you feel? Definitely. Unless you have an investor, I mean, it's bad enough for people in London at the moment trying to buy a house, you know, to go to a bank and speak to them and say, we want to open up a nightclub, probably one of the riskiest businesses. Can you lend us half a million, probably more, a million pounds? You know, I don't even know where you'd start with that. We have looked into it. There is definitely a need for it, you know. It's a tall to, um, invent, uh, invest in a nightclub, uh, where, you know, they may ask you, what sort of thing are we talking about? And you say to them, well, um, one week we might have Karen live. I mean, it means nothing to, to the majority of people with, with the kind of funds or, or even desire to, to invest in something like that. If, um, If we told them perhaps that we do a lot of EDM, then that might, you know, change the playing field. But yeah, you know, I think what we, the level we're operating at and the kind of music. that we're into and we promote doesn't necessarily lend itself to the sort of confidence that would get us enough money to have a club built. But just as a compromise to that, actually, something that AJ and I have done, and we mentioned it earlier, is we've been working with a studio that started off with Electric Minds, a small loft studio. And the owner's taken on a separate building in Wapping. And it's kind of a compromise to getting a venue that we've had to work with someone who has a photographic studio Monday to Friday. And we're able to go in and offer our services to turn that into an event space at a weekend. So that will hopefully be our way of working with a venue. And we already did a number of shows this year there. We've got some coming up for the season. And that's really going to be a core basis for the series next year. It provides us, you know, a space where we can work with someone we trust and some stability again. And that's the one space that we've got really that's kind of still the warehouse pop-up events because... It has got good facilities, but it's an empty space and we're able to roll in our production there when we do those events. What would a fantasy venue look like for you guys? As in which clubs do we like? Which clubs inspire us? I mean, you're giving a blank check. What are you setting up? We talked about this in the past and we were looking at some spaces. I mean, you know... It would be nice to have a big club, you know, because, you know, there's nothing better than having like a couple of thousand people there. But I just think getting a club in London, it's like four or five hundred people, maybe with a second room. If you could get that right and just have the best sound. I think that's what London really needs at the moment. It's just having somewhere with a consistent line-up, good sound, and maybe an easy-ish location to reach, then that would be brilliant. I kind of feel like there isn't a club... in London at the moment, which sort of fills the gap between small sort of intimate kind of clubbing experience and, you know, the larger kind of night out that you'd have at Fabric or Ministry. And, you know, everyone's got its place. But I think, you know, if we could find or if someone built something that kind of sat. nicely between the two with all the things we've discussed great programming great sound yeah I kind of feel like there's a gap there that needs to be needs to be either exploited or fulfilled sort of in summary to kind of bring things to a close what would you say is the biggest challenge you face as being a promoter in London in 2013 I think And it's a very broad area, but bookings are increasingly difficult because obviously we discuss sort of London and markets generally just being saturated, but also. You know, we currently you can you can record or release a 12 inch, which is sort of fairly well received. And by the end of that week, you'll have a manager and you'll probably be on a thousand pounds for like an hour's work. And, you know, it's not the case with everyone, but there's a kind of element of that happening more and more. And it makes things very difficult for Dale and I because, you know, we want to book things that we're into, but that are at a certain level. And, you know, we can't support the sort of fees that some of these people want because... We're supporting them in the sense that we're trying to put them on hopefully high profile shows. But, you know, if the money is so high that we can't actually book a more sort of, I guess, recognised headliner, then, you know, the event itself won't work. from a financial perspective or culturally or anything like this. So it's becoming difficult with the sort of everyone has a manager kind of culture. And that, you know, in tandem with that is, you know, the way that certain agents operate, really. You know, we've had agents quote us fees, which are... you know, completely arbitrary without any consideration of the artist's profile or their, you know, current standing or their release schedule or what they've got coming up or anything like that. It's just a kind of pie in the sky sort of figure because an agent wants better money than they've been offered and the manager's perhaps saying the same thing. Now, that's not to say that... you know, all agents and all managers like that, they're not, but there are pockets here and there which, you know, make it really difficult. So I don't know. I think I kind of feel and we kind of feel like something needs. to change that you know there needs to be a little bit more um there needs to be more appreciation of fact that um you know some of the events that as an artist you you you could do might serve your career um better than than um actually just asking for a bit of extra cash at the time which um you know clearly won't do you feel as though a little bit the um hype PR marketing kind of bubble is inflating prices do you think that it's in some ways distorting the fees that people are maybe requesting yeah I think definitely and like you only have to look at what's happening at the moment you just keep hearing like there's this thing about EDM you know America's blowing up and You know, there's dollar signs everywhere and, you know, certain people will want to obtain that and that's fine. You know, like go for it. When AJ said earlier, you know, like when you've got someone that's starting out, you know, we understand how much time goes into making that record in order to do your gig on a Saturday night and earn that thousand pounds. But it's about working with people from the beginning. We've worked with artists that started off earning on small fees and we've grown with them. We keep up with it as their profile raises and we go with that. It's just there's always going to be an element where people... just want the money and you know that's not really what we've ever been about we work hard at what we do and we'd hope that in London the events that we do people would want to be part of them it's not necessarily just about a blank checkbook And as AJ mentioned earlier, you know, no one's really millionaires from this. You know, far from it, it's a difficult game to be in. Thank you. so Thank you. Thank you. ♪ ♪ Thank you.
