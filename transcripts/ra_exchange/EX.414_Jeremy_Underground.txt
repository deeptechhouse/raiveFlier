I knew it would change, you are what you are But I can only give so much, only I know that we both do things, don't ignore Sometimes if we plead guilty, we'd be much better off We love each other, deep down inside But why not talk about it? Oh, oh, bandalil, give a little, that's all we do. Bandalil, I give a little, that's all we do. Bandalil, I give a little, that's all we do. Bandalil, give a little, that's all we do. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Jeremy Underground. Jeremy Fichon was still a young man when he became a leading light in the resurgence of Garage House from New York and New Jersey around 2010. Soon after founding his label My Love is Underground, he was heralded along with the likes of Motor City Drum Ensemble as one of Europe's true connoisseur DJs. But when a dispute over a booking for a gig in Edinburgh turned into a full-blown con controversy in September 2017, the Frenchman was on the receiving end of a wave of public anger and mockery. While the incident raised valid questions, it deepened feelings of anxiety and depression he's encountered since childhood. By his own admission, he's struggled to deal with the backlash, and ten months on, he says it continues to affect him. In this exchange, Fichon opens up about the controversy and much more besides. discussing his emotional well-being, the ups and downs of life as a professional DJ, and his move to the French countryside. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Jeremy Underground is up next. Thank you. I was thinking back to the first time I saw you DJ. It was 2011 in London. At the camp. At the camp, yeah. It was, am I right in saying, the first My Love is Underground showcase in London? Yeah, ever. Yeah, it was the first My Love is Underground party ever, basically. The first one ever. It was you, Brother and Jane Fitz played that night. Yeah, exactly. I mean, amazing memories. That's not exactly where everything started for the DJ thing for me. I would say the thing started in November 2010 for me in Paris at Nick V's party called the Mona. Yeah, he put us on the lineup, me and Sammy, aka Brother. And yeah, that was the revelation. Like, okay, we can play that music in clubs. The club was full. People enjoy it. And it's like, man, everything is possible now. So it wasn't too long after that then that you were sort of playing in London? Yeah, it was less than a year after. Yeah, yeah. I think, yeah, six months after. Like, it was in May 2011, the camp thing. Yeah. And I guess at that point in your, I guess, DJ life, did you have any specific ambitions or goals that you wanted to reach? No, really not. I mean, I've been to early house, Chicago house since I was a kid. But honestly, according to the music I was listening to at the clubs at the time, I was like, yeah, nobody cares about the music I'm into, you know, nobody quite plays it anymore, you know. So there was really no ambitions at all. It was just like, okay, we got those opportunities, let's take the best of it. But if you told me back then that I would still be DJing as a professional touring DJ eight years after, I would have never believed it, really. How does it feel to sort of fast forward seven years and you're touring the world, playing gigs every weekend? Well, touring mostly Europe. Let's be frank. I'm spending most of my time in Europe. man, it's amazing. Like it's, as I just said, it's something I would have never imagined or, you know, hoped for. It's sick. You know, I've met so much great people on the road, made so much friends. It's a beautiful job. It's a hard job. People sometimes don't figure out, you know, what it is to travel alone, not to sleep, being away from your friends. You know, your social life completely changes. You're not with your friends anymore at weekends or whatever, chilling, whatever. So like there is that little part where sometimes people don't actually realize that it's also a really hard job. But at the same time, it's amazing, of course. You can't complain, basically. of course your early love for house is fairly well documented i'd like to sort of dive into I guess, an other side to your musical personality, which is the soul and jazz side. I guess for me and most people that first kind of sprung up or came to our attention when you played at the first Euro Melody Party. Yeah, yeah, yeah, which is one of my best memories ever. So let's say, you know, Kerry Chandler was your sort of gateway into... Yeah. house music. Yeah, and DJ deep as far as long as DJ goes, yeah. What was your entry point or your gateway into soul then? Well, first of all, a local friend called Nino. Guys, the real first name is Sylvain. He was into house. We met through the house forums and stuff, but he was also into jazz soul funk. And at some point, you know, you discover a lot of house records and you always kind of get back to the same references, same artists. You're like, yeah, well, you know, let's dig a bit deeper. So there was that guy, another guy called Alex Roger Tornhill. It's his nickname. And mostly like two guys from New York, a legendary unknown DJ called G-Bay X. from New York and another one called Richie Love on the Run he co-runs melodies with Sam Floating Points and so he had this I mean he still has this blog called Secret Rendezvous and you could find like mixes from that guy called GBX who used to work at a record shop called Big City Records and man like those mixes they blew me They blew me away. It was like a second... It was just the same feeling as when I discovered my first character on the records and stuff in DJ Deep mixes and Radio Nova. It was like, wow, this is sick. And that was like around 2008. So about 10 years ago. Yeah, man, I mean, that music, yeah, it's sick. I mean, I love it as much as House. Sometimes it's a bit hard to mix different worlds because some House people, they don't really care about the rest. And mostly the raw groove guys, they don't really care about House. It's mostly that way, actually. So it's sometimes a bit hard to mix it up. But yeah, thankfully, those past few years, even if my sets, they keep having a... a strong house core I always sneak in a few seven inches beginning or the end or something like like I love it as much as house basically what commonalities have you observed between house music and soul what ties them together for you well you know I mean house comes from disco disco comes from you know the soul funk and stuff so it's all like the same basically musical family I guess but you know as far as i'm concerned it's all about the emotions like i don't you know analyze too much like oh yeah this scene these djs they were playing this they were not playing that whatever just like i discover a record and it brings that serotonin shoot in my brain and i listen to it over over and again i'm pretty obsessed like when i discover a new killer record like i can listen to it like 50 times in a row and for a month and you know it's like it's mostly like that i don't really analyze much or trying to be too intellectual about music whatsoever it's just like i discover a killer thing and you know it might be a really simple chicago early chicago record with you know just the drum machine and that drives me as much crazy as a beautiful soul record you know it's just like emotions Just to sort of pluck out one example, the Sonia Spence tune, Love Flow On. I first heard that on YouTube and you uploaded it in 2008 or 2009. It's funny, there are millions of views on that video, on that upload, yeah. So yeah, tell me, how did you like... personally discover that record well I discovered it through Richie that guy I just told that guy I just told you about Love on the Run through through his blog and and back then you could find it quite easily I'm not so sure about that anymore the original but yeah I mean that tune is an anthem it's it's it's so amazing like now it gets placed on the Radio Nova in Paris like maybe radios in the uk i don't know but yeah finally got the attention it deserved and that was on your uh compilation beauty yeah yeah yeah yeah which i'm really happy of actually and so tell me a bit about the the process behind the scenes of getting uh a soul compilation together? Well, I met Danny from Psych and Magic at a festival called Bestival. I think it's in the Isle of Wight or something or the Isle of Man. I can't remember. But we met in 2013 and I was booked to play a house set with my buddy brother. So we banged it out house on the main stage, pretty young people and stuff like doing the house stuff. But I was also booked to... play another small additional gig for Gideon from Block 9. He had his truck or something. And there I played strictly 45 soul funk, you know, stuff that, you know, I would have maybe not feel, felt comfortable to play at the regular festival. And Danny from Psych and Magic was there and he was like, man, who are you? Like. what are those records you're playing? And that night we got pretty high, to be honest. And we were like, yeah, let's put out the compilation. So that was 2013 and the compilation came out three years after. So it took like three years for the Claremont guys who were on the label to clear the playlist and everything. So it was like a big achievement. after three years of trying to clear every tune, because obviously for those tunes from the 70s, it's a hard work. Yeah, I've sort of heard various things about, yeah, the lengths people have to go to to track someone down, rights holders, et cetera. I mean, were there... Any tunes that you couldn't quite squeeze onto the compilation? Yeah, yeah, there was one. Yeah, I mean, a few, like some people died and there's, you know, no one, nobody knows who owns the rights. You could do it, but at the same time, you want to be honest and you're like, come on, if nobody agreed, you know, we're not going to put it out. And there was that little issue with Sonia Spence because apparently a few different people own the rights. So someone else, a guy from Belgium, I think, put it on the compilation. He was like, hey, man, you don't have the rights. I'm like, yeah, man, I think that we both have the rights from different sources. So, you know, let's I mean, I'm glad you're doing your thing and I'm doing my thing as well. And, you know, there are actually two more chances. I mean, there are more chances that people discover the tune. So let's take it and complicated, yeah. Especially when people die, then you get like, I don't know, the sons, they own the right, but sometimes they fight with the family whatsoever. Like, it can get a bit tricky. I'd like to... talk to you a bit about obsession from the outside it appears as if yeah you you have a obsessive approach to digging and to djing and i was wondering how many hours a week say you spend searching for for music well it's it's the most of my day like i mean um i would say maybe less than before because when you take the djing to a professional level you gotta take care of your company of your invoices like all that boring stuff that is really not related to music and you know checking the itineraries the flights the whatever so it sadly it makes less time for music but um Yeah, it's most of my day, you know, also spend time trying to do sport, running, cycling, whatsoever. But the rest is all like, yeah, listening to music, exchanging music with close friends. I moved away to the countryside now, so there's no record shops around by 500 kilometers or something. So it's mostly online for me those past years. and it's also rediscovering records that uh you know about 10 years ago whatsoever like i get like you know 5k records or something um i sold a lot i want to keep selling and reducing my collection to maybe 2 or 3k max but also, you know, digging again and maybe the change, the taste evolved as well, you know, like maybe that B-side track, I didn't like it back then, but now I'm into it. But yeah, it's a non-stop thing, you know, it's passion and it's not even like... trying to find the most rare record or the record that nobody else plays it's it's just finding the track that brings emotions to me you know like uh and it can be a really obvious cut from an lp that is quite overlooked because it's not cool enough for the digger scene you know or it could be that super rare thing whatever but at the end it's it's i'm trying to escape from the the superficial values like is that record expensive or not whatever no I'm trying to focus on the music and what what does it bring to my brain you know do I feel good when I listen to it That's the main point. And I mean, is there a point where your obsession becomes problematic to you? Where it becomes a bad thing instead of a good thing? Yeah, I've been trying to take it easy and, you know, try to also consider that, you know, I got to take care of my body, do sport and stuff and not just focus on records because if you're just only... about records and the music like it can get quite unhealthy you know it's also good to have other passions like I'm into football I'm into all the healthy stuff I mean quite lately not not since forever but Yeah, you know, I'm trying to have this, you know, keep touch with these friends who are not interested that I'm a DJ as well. You know, it's also a healthy thing, you know, to talk about, not to talk about fees or gig or who I'm playing with, you know. I think it's a really sane thing to do when your professional life is all about that. It's also to escape, you know. I guess, yeah, electronic music is a bubble. Yeah. How difficult do you find it at times living inside that bubble? It's about like not spending too much reading even your site, which is great. But, you know, it talks about a lot of different things. And I don't want to get disturbed by who's in, who's hyped at the minute, whatever. I just want to do my thing. I don't want to spend too much time on Facebook anymore. Well, actually, I don't take care of my page anymore. It's like sometimes I write it up, but have a team taking care of this because if you're constantly looking for whatever people write as comments, whatever, it takes too much time out of you. It's the time that you don't spend digging in your crates and thinking about your set, whatever. Yeah, trying to stay away from press, like not being involved too much and thinking too much, oh, this guy is playing that and it works well, maybe I should do the same, whatever. It's good to keep your distances as well, a little bit with all of that word, at least during the weekdays when you're at home, because otherwise it can get a bit crazy. I guess you mentioned Facebook. it would be remiss of me not to ask at this point about Saunagate. Yeah. I guess most people listening to this will know what's happened, but I guess the broad brushstrokes are that last year a party... a promoter in Scotland, posted some screenshots of email correspondence with your former agent where this agent had threatened to bite them with regards to, I guess, a disagreement over... finding the correct hotel for you equipped with a sauna. Yeah, yeah. Well, it was not exactly that actually because the hotel they were offering, they had a sauna as well. But it's so, I mean, I'm not going to get into the details of that story, but, you know, it all came down to insults. But it also comes down to part of my responsibility of maybe touring too much and being, you know, too careful about little details like hotels whatsoever, which are not linked to music at all. And that's one thing I'm going to say, which is honest. It's like, you know, when you're touring all, I mean, when you've been constantly touring all the time. Yeah, I mean, I'm not a machine. Sometimes I've lost the coolness and the carefree attitude that you have when you start. Sometimes it's amazing, but I'm also quite unstable. Like, you know, the mood changes a lot during the year, you know, between the winter and the summer. And yeah, sometimes I can get moody or care too much about details which are far from the music. And that's my part of responsibility in that story. I guess the eye or the angle was mostly directed towards the agent's comments and people were maybe mocking you. No, because at the end of the day, people know me. They don't know my former agent or they might not have heard from these guys, these promoters. So, you know, one year after, it's only, you know, people don't have the whole story. They just remember, oh, Jeremy, Sona, whatever. They're making jokes. They keep making jokes, mostly on your site, actually, which has always been full of people trolling, let's be honest. Yeah, it was a good lesson learned, but also a bit unfair. I mean, I don't know. It was like I also realized, yeah, maybe I should tour less, enjoy it more, focus less on those details. But it was tough because, you know, I'm not a politician or a football player. I'm a middle-sized DJ from the underground. And trust me, 500 kilometers around where I live, nobody. knows who I am or what I do. And when I go shopping on Monday morning to the supermarket, you know, I'm a total stranger. So I think, you know, maybe some people will live in London or Berlin or Paris Center and they want to do something in the music. They want to have a career and they spend their days on Array or Mixmag reading, whatever. I think they should stay out of the bubble a little and realize that even Jack Master or Black Madonna or whoever is Dixon, they're not on TV. They're not on the mainstream radio. Like you go to the countryside and you ask people around who is a DJ. The only answer I get is David Guetta, you know. So people should maybe stay out a little bit of the bubble and, you know, avoid sometimes being jealous of other people's success and everything because at the end of the day, we're not like... Cristiano Ronaldo or Zinedine Zidane or whatsoever. We're not like huge heroes with millions of followers whatsoever. So sometimes people should get... a bit of context back to what we do. I mean, not many people find themselves in the middle, in the eye of an online shitstorm, and you did. I'd like to ask about the personal toll that took on you. Well, I've always been suffering of depression and anxiety, back and forth. Lots of people talk about these topics these days in the music industry. Well, in my case, it started way before the music even, because I have a personal... kind of a tough personal story. My mother's decided when I was 15, my dad died the day of my birthday five years after. So I didn't have like the best of, you know, I mean, yeah, it's always been tough. And, you know, then I gave up school. I didn't really know what to do with my life. Then music came and it kind of saved everything. But The anxiety, the lack of self-esteem, the troubles of being yourself, whatever. I don't know how to explain that in English properly, but it's always been here, you know. And back and forth, like not all the time. Sometimes I would feel good, sometimes bad. I'm not a bipolar, but, you know, it still goes up and down. And so when that happened, I was like, yeah, well. I was not prepared for this and it's still hard to this day. But yeah, I'm also trying to focus on not reading the internet too much, not checking the comments, not reading Facebook anymore. I just do Instagram as far as social media goes, which I think is still cool. I don't know for how long, but... But yeah, it's been tough. But, you know, also you realize you may be messed up a little. Although I think in that story, the main responsibility was not mine, but I still had a little one. And yeah, you focus back on your stuff. You try to escape the Internet, but, you know, you also feel bad. Let's be honest. I mean, apart from, you know, avoiding too much contact with the Internet, what other... have you employed to tackle stress and anxiety and depression? Well, first of all, I quit drinking for two whole years from 2015 to 2017. I got back into it last summer, but I think I will quit again soon. I also stopped smoking for six years, but back into it now, sadly. Psychologists, psychiatrists, sometimes they don't work. Medications, they work, but they work for a limited amount of time because it's basically a drug. It's a psychotrop. So it helps you, of course, but it's also a drug. So when you quit it, you feel bad. Sport has been helping a lot. I ran three marathons in my life, which is probably maybe the biggest achievement. The one I'm mostly proud of. I mean, finishing the first marathon of Paris was probably the best feeling in my life back in 2013. Trying to find a good balance between sport, food, good sleep during the week. but it's not always easy with the DJ life, you know, even if you're healthy during the week, then you, you know, you, you break all the cycles at weekends and yeah, when you don't take drugs whatsoever, I mean, I quit taking drugs also for years ago. I was never big into it, but you know, I still lived the early DJ life, you know, having fun and stuff, but yeah, it's hard to find the balance. Because also, yeah, when you lack self-esteem and you have big problems of confidence, like sometimes being exposed or recorded, like I was for you guys at Sonar, you know, it's not like the regular gig. You know, it puts an amount of pressure that is sometimes really hard to take. It's part of the job. At some point, you're trying to be good. You're trying to do your thing. So people want to record you. They want to put you on postcasts or whatever. For an unstable person like me, it can really be hard to deal with. So I'm trying to do my best, but I'm not a machine. Sometimes I'm good, sometimes I'm bad, you know. It's like, you got to be honest, like I'm not always happy with my DJ sets at all. And sometimes I feel like I really rocked it. And sometimes I feel like, oh yeah, man, I was not into it tonight. I was too stressed. Like there was that dude looking at me in the crowd unhappy and, you know, and I couldn't escape. Am I doing something wrong? Am I, you know. And some people take cocaine to escape that state of mind. But if I was taking cocaine at every kick, I would have been dead already, for sure. I mean, it's a massive thing, I guess, in the DJ world. People using alcohol and drugs as a way to kind of relax in stressful situations, I guess, when you're standing out there in front of loads of people. You say you're sort of... had gone off alcohol and maybe drinking a bit again now, what sort of difference does it make to your, I guess, professional life and your personal life when you are drinking versus when you're not? Well, first of all, yeah, I've been drinking for a year now back, but I never got drunk. I never messed up during the set, whatever. But still, the day after, you're really tired. Now, I live in a small town in the countryside of the south of France. So when I get back from gigs, which are mostly two flights because there are almost no direct flights from Marseille, I have to drive one hour on the highway. So I cannot really afford to be hangover, even alcohol hangover or even worse, drug hangover because then I would kill myself on the road. I think it's a balance because I'm also going to be honest, like being completely sober for two years, sometimes it was not quite fun, you know, so it's about, yeah, maybe you have one or two glasses and then you stop, you know, but of course, if it ends up like drinking the whole bottle of tequila and you miss your flight the day after, then it's not cool, you know. I mean, some clubbers, they love that, you know, they love the rockstar DJs Most of the people going out there are 20 years old. They want to forget maybe, you know, some parts of their life, like, I don't know, studying or a job that makes them unhappy, whatever. So I completely get it that the rock star DJs are, you know, appreciated. But yeah, I mean, as far as I'm concerned, I cannot take it like this. I cannot do it. And you mentioned that you've moved to live in the French countryside. Yeah, tell me, paint me a picture of where you're living and what it's like and how that's helping. Well, it's a beautiful area from the south of France. I've always had this love and hate relationship with Paris. Well, first of all, I'm not a real Parisian. I've always lived in the countryside, not in the countryside, in the suburbs, sorry. where you have to take the train to go to town and stuff, and you have to get your driving license when you're 18, which is not the case of Parisians because they have the subway everywhere. You know, it was more quiet than downtown, but also people, I think this town is getting so stressful and so violent. And so, I don't know, I don't feel the vibe anymore. I mean, the clubbing scene became really cool with, you know, everything that Concrete did. the Rex Club and everything. So that part is not a problem. And there was not a problem at all for me, but it's more like, yeah. getting stuck in a traffic jam and stuff like in the traffic jam i'm quite glad when i come back on monday to you know enjoy a garden for a really cheap rental actually compared to what i would get for that price in paris but not everybody's ready for that some people need the social life to drinks every night with friends and stuff like i've always been a bit as social so I'm fine with that. I'd like to swing the conversation back towards house music now. Yeah. I read in one of your previous interviews that you said house is an underappreciated art form. Do you still feel like that's the case? Not really. I think that maybe a few years ago, well, especially as far as I'm concerned, I'm not going to talk about house generally, but... just my little person like when you guys put my house compilation in 2014 as the best compilation of the year I mean these were really good days for me like because like yeah I could play all the New York stuff and you know and it was pretty new to people And you know how music goes, it goes by cycles, different hypes. And of course, the hype is not there anymore for early 90s house whatsoever. You know, like the number of copies we sold on the label back then was pretty insane. But I'm not sure this would ever happen anymore. So it goes up and down. But house is alive. Of course, it's still there. It's not the hippest thing at the minute at all. But I'm not going to give up or try to adapt to what's hip at the minute. That's not me. That wouldn't work out at all. So yeah, house is still there. I still love it even more than soul funk whatsoever. It's my first love. It's the way I grew up with music, was listening to masters at work. Kerry Chandler and stuff, you know, and like, you know, for me, it's still, you know, I opened up the Sonar thing with Danilo with Masters at Work dub, you know, the Braxton's. Yeah. Which, I mean, a version called The Reprise, but it's by the Masters at Work and Frankie Feliciano. And, you know, like most of the young people, they don't know it. You know, for me, it's a classic. I was listening to it on the radio back then. But like and it's still magical. You know, it's all about finding timeless music that, you know, that was amazing when it was released, that would still sound amazing 10 years after and 20 years after. That's the way I see my selections. I'm trying to play stuff that I will not regret. in 10 years time you know for in any style basically I heard you play that at Phonox recently yeah as well and it got a absolutely huge response yeah yeah yeah so i guess it's not like 90s house maybe isn't as much a thing as it was around that 2014 yeah but it's still it's still no no it's still alive of course of course of course of course no yeah because it is because it is timeless basically so you know And I mentioned Phonox there, you're sort of coming to the end of your sort of month-long residency there. How's that gone for you? Really good. So yeah, I must say that... you know when you play only four dates it's not quite a real residency but still like doing that only you know four dates every friday in a row in the same club and i've never done it before and phonox is my favorite place in london and one of my favorite clubs in the world basically so i was really happy to be able to do that At first I was supposed to do it alone, open to close, six hours alone, the way I did it at the previous bookings at Phonox. But then I was like, yeah, why not also book friends for the warm-up, people that are mostly bedroom DJs or people that don't tour much and people that I respect a lot. So I put up this little lineup of warm-up DJs and DJs that would play back-to-back as well at the end of the night. It's also cool for someone like me who's not that confident sometimes to be around friends, you know, and not just the promoter or fans whatsoever. It's also people you can talk to when you play. It's really important for my psychology, you know, sometimes being around people that make you feel good instead of sometimes feeling a bit lonely. So yeah, I'm really happy. Let's see how it goes tonight, but it was packed every Friday, so I'm really glad. I guess I noticed you were playing digital only, and I know it's a slightly tired question in some ways, but... I guess that's your thing now. You're not bringing records to gigs. Why did you make that choice? So I've been battling for vinyl. I mean, well, I don't make music, so I'm a record collector at first. I was never really intending to become a DJ whatsoever. So of course, it's always been about records, collecting records. So of course when I started getting gigs, I had to play records obviously, you know, and I didn't even know how to use CDJs whatsoever. But then when you tour more and more and you play bigger gigs, festivals whatsoever, you realize that actually the vinyl isn't working in most of the places except for very few clubs and very few festivals. and the piece Gabrielle wrote for you guys a few months ago was absolutely on point. I've always been wanting to actually write something like that. Gabrielle did it better. She's got a better English than mine. Yeah, it's an issue, you know, because vinyl has been so hip those past years, like the revival of vinyl, the revival, you know, the sales getting better and better, but... Actually, when you're a professional touring DJ, you realize that you can play records at maybe 20 or 30% of the venues. Meaning you can still try to play it anywhere, but you'll always get feedback whatsoever. The needle jumping because someone pushed the table whatsoever. And that made me become so stressed about the setups and requesting in advance what do you use for isolation, whatever. At some point it became uncool to request all of those questions to promoters. And I had a few talks with bigger DJs, close friends of mine. I'm not going to name drop anyone, but they were like, man, why do you keep on just like playing vinyl only? You know, you should. So I started to make a transition and I was like, oh yeah, well, actually I can also make my own edits and stuff, remaster tracks that don't sound good and stuff. And so then I made a transition to fully digital. But I do the rips with a lot of care. It's not just like I download stuff on Beatport. No, it's like... My iTunes and record boxes, I spend a lot of time in it. Most of the files are kind of reboosted, edited, cleaned. You don't hear any crackles anymore whatsoever. It takes a lot of time. It's convenient. It's a necessary evil to do that when you have a busy touring schedule. But the pleasure is not the same anymore. I gotta be honest. I'm doing it because it's convenient. and I had too much troubles with records in the past that would damage a set and you know and people in the crowd they don't know or sometimes they don't even see that you're playing records and if the record is jumping or if you hear feedback they're not gonna say oh poor Jeremy they're like ooh this is bad we want to hear loud music you know So it's a necessary level, but yeah, you know, this whole debate, the sound of vinyl versus the sound of digital. I mean, even when you really care about your files digitally and you do it the proper way, I would say, I don't know, the blendings are not the same anymore. I don't know. I'm going to keep on doing it, but I remember the pleasure of doing the right blend on a record was higher. than the pleasure of blending digital files. So the reason that you prefer vinyl DJing is because of the challenge and also the sound quality, is that right? Yeah, kind of. But it's not all black and white, of course. I also enjoy looping on the CDJ. Well, I mostly enjoy the fact that it's going to work everywhere and the stress of taking care of everything. has disappeared so it's easier but yeah in the future like pretty soon I will probably get back at playing kind of both at places where I know it's gonna work like proper clubs like you know Phonox Rex Club all these venues you know that vinyl works perfectly you know because there is steady DJ booth and they have a 30 years experience whatever as far as for example for Rex Club just to you know get back at the pleasure of you know actually beat matching a proper record I was speaking to Rich from Sound Services here in London, who I'm guessing you probably know. Yeah, of course. And he mentioned you and Floating Points as two of the very few people who, he says, use rotary mixes as an instrument. And I was wondering if you could tell me what you think he means by that. I'm sure there are a lot more DJs that use... uh rotary mixers really well like i don't know danilo hooney all these people on tile like you know in my in my kind of scene uh they use it really well but uh thanks richie but getting back to the point I just talked about like when you play digital files it's not so relevant anymore you know that's I mean for records yeah go for a dgr 400 if you can afford it go for condessa go go for the crazy mixers but then when you switch to digital files you know sometimes now I'm you know playing in the pioneer and you know back because yeah it's kind of fine you know But yeah, I mean, these are beautiful pieces. Like when you play records, it's amazing. It's a big investment. It's a lot of money, all of those mixers. But yeah, you can really hear the difference. So I might be... For records at least. I might be opening a can of worms here, but why are rotary mixers better to you? Especially when you're using records. Well, it's just the sound, you know, I'm not, well, as you know, I don't make music, so I'm not that nerdy into components. Like I'm not Sam, you know, I'm the opposite of Sam, you know, Sam Floating Points was crazy about anything technical, but no, but I mean, just, just try to blend two records with a Pioneer 900, DGM 900. and with Condessa and you will hear the difference, trust me. It's not like something that has to be explained on paper. You don't even have to write about it. Just listen, you know. It's the way you feel it. And also like if you have a basic style of mixing, which is, you know, mostly the case for house and disco, like just one record after the other and you don't keep records at the same time for five minutes with lots of effects, whatever. The rotary feeling is really good, you know. It's better than a regular fader. So knobs are more fun than faders, I guess, or more. But also maybe, you know, these past few years, it was maybe a bit too hip as well. Like everybody getting a rotary or whatever. And I was like, okay, maybe it's time to step back. Do you find generally if something does become very hip or very trendy, you naturally want to step away from it? Well, I mean, not all the time. I mean, if that thing is really into you, you're not going to step out of it because it's too trendy. But yeah, sometimes. Yeah, I mean, mostly... I felt like maybe it went a bit too much these past years of, you know, big dudes sometimes playing vinyl only sets and branded like this. And that's where it went to the point where, okay, this is too much, you know, like, you know, like if you've been playing digital for 10 years and now you just want to play records again because that's hip, that's a bit wrong. you know, but whatever. That's not a main issue in my life. We talked a little bit about how I guess there was like a renaissance for... you know, very specific, I guess, style of house, you know, a few years ago, the 90s New York slash New Jersey house. And maybe that's kind of cooled off a bit. Of course, it's never going to disappear. But did you, have you found yourself sort of, have your DJ sets perhaps changed a little bit in the past couple of years? Do people want to listen to other stuff as well, like including your crowd? Yeah, I mean, when I started DJing, I really had a that style you know like push that style as much as possible so you were there at that party at the camp uh eight years ago no seven years ago when we actually sold the seven inch on MLIU yeah we used to play yeah strictly strictly New York house and then yeah just playing that got me bored as well you know so I started playing also the disco also a bit of the soul funk also a bit of the Chicago stuff also a bit you know, maybe sometimes techno, I play techno now. I mean, every now and then I would never play two hours of straight techno at all. But yeah, it became a bit more fun to play a bit of everything. Although I would say I'm still, I still have quite a small spectrum compared to some of my friends who really go wild on every, every, every genre and it works really well for them. But yeah. Yeah, for me, it's still very like, yeah, modern soul disco, soulful house, acid house and groovy techno. That's my thing as far as the DJ sets go and then at home, pretty much everything, but including jazz, of course. But yeah, yeah, that's my, it's all like. yeah for me it's all kind of the same family i think there's some kind of coherence like around all of those styles but yeah that's me maybe i know some people don't like it like when i play harder but they also have to realize that i really love that stuff so you know you can please anyone of course you know Like some people who were seeing me seven years ago, they were strictly coming for the underground dubs versions. Or, you know, and I was delivering that. And maybe now I only play one in my set, you know. So they'll be like, yeah, Jeremy, whatever. But, you know, you got to evolve as well. You know, if you always play the same stuff, you get bored. You mentioned before that, you know, you thought it'd be good to have a... house music museum somewhere what would you yeah well yeah yeah well yeah well I forgot I said that but it would make sense yeah well it would have to be in Chicago of course and what would you have in there I don't know recruits on the wall like videos of Larry or talking Carrie Chandler talking and all these people Louis Vega talking DJ deep talking like even you know like whoever was you know main guy in the European countries and this music is still alive but still you know it's 30 years old and yeah I mean for me it's as important as soul music or disco music so yeah maybe yeah yeah it would be time to yeah maybe step the game up you know it's not dead it's still here this music is still played and everything and there are news coming up all the time But also I think it's old enough now to consider it as something really historical. But it already is, you know, but yeah. taking things to the higher level, you know, while there was that book, that Japanese book where they mentioned My Love is on the Ground, which was a bit crazy, but about like all the best house records of the time. But Japanese do that, you know, Japanese do those crazy books about soul funk albums with all of that text that you cannot read. And you're like, wow, wow, wow. different colors depending on the rarity i got all of these books you know and they did one they did one for house and i was like yeah yeah yeah come on yeah why not you know this music is as serious as soul funk is or disco you know it's been here forever and and it's known worldwide so yeah What are your favorite music books? I would say, yeah, it's a tough question. I mean, I read Electro Shock when I was a kid. I mean, when I was a teenager, I have a lot of respect for Laurent Garnier, even though, you know, like, of course, he's been mostly into techno, but I really wish DJ Deep wrote a book. about all that era that fascinates me, you know, like the mid-90s and stuff. But I would say it's not really about Love Saves the Day or whatever. It's mostly those Japanese books where I learned so much about rare albums. So it's not exactly... These are books. It's not a text, but yeah, I mean, the spiritual jazz books and stuff, and you actually... score across with your pen, by everything you've listened to, through Discogs, YouTube, whatever, the blogs. So I've studied those books quite a lot. You went on your own pilgrimage, I guess, when you were younger to New Jersey to, I guess, see where the important spots for Kerry Chandler in his youth. And you took footage. You took a recording? Yeah, I mean, well, that's being extreme, you know. It's like, yeah, I went to the basement where Kerry Chandler did his first record, which is Get It Off, which came out on Atlantic. But at first it came out on a private label called Express Records, which is a record I've been looking for for years. And at the end, I won it on eBay against Kerry. Well, that's a story already told in a few interviews, but we found out that summer. hey, Kerry, I got your record. And I was like, yeah, me too. Well, I lost it on eBay. I was like, yeah, sorry. But there was also another guy bidding, but like we were three different people. Yeah, that travel actually, I mean, after that travel to New York where I could see, you know, meet a few people, see a few places that were important. But, you know, that kind of disappeared suddenly. Yeah, it was like, OK, I got to do something. You know, I was a bit lost with my life. Don't know what to do. No studies, no nothing. OK, why not, you know, starting a label with some of the old unreleased music, some of the great music that my friends are producing, people like Brother, Inner Sense, Cool Vibe. And yeah, it got noticed pretty quickly. So yeah, it was a good thing to do. You've gone from a stage with Kerry Chandler where you idolized him and then you met him and then you've kind of got to a stage where you're playing back to back with him and you're quite close with him. I guess there's the saying, never meet your idols, but it feels like Kerry is probably an exception to that. What was it like the first time you played back-to-back with him? Well, it was very stressful, let's be honest. That's the first thing I would say. Kerry is the nicest guy around and everybody knows that. But it was a boiler room. Then again, what I said earlier, all the cameras, you're not... exactly you don't exactly come on stage happy and smiling you're like damn it everybody looks at me you know and and sometimes it's hard but um no but carries the carries the nicest guy around like it's it's always been a pleasure like talking to him and you know sharing personal stories back and forth and And now we're doing those shows together. Yeah, it's great. I love it, you know. But I generally really enjoy back-to-backs because the ones I've done with Danilo, the ones I've done with Gerd Jansson two years ago, we played a few times together. Like, it's kind of cool to be able to relax every five minutes and look at what the other is doing instead of being focused on your set all the time. And, of course, you got to do it with the right person. And sometimes, you know, it doesn't work. Sometimes it works crazy. You know, it's a bit random, of course, unless you prepare it all, which is not fun as well. So how much preparation did you put in for that back-to-back with Kerry, for example? How much did you think about that? Well, I'm always like, hey, Kerry, what do we do? Like, how do we start? and he's like hey man ever whatever you want like you know he's so nice that so uh so yeah it's a bit random it's it comes on the moment like oh yeah he plays this i'm gonna play that and you know that that's the way it works just lately with danilo we thought that you know we came on after ben clock so we thought like maybe we should start with house you know for a little while and then go somewhere else but that's why i started with house we started yeah maybe if five house tracks in a row and i think yeah that was probably the best thing to do and so we kind of prepared that but um but yeah it's not also fun to prepare it all you know you mentioned playing with danilo you know i guess you've played with him a few times before robert johnson various other spots yeah um but most recently at sonar yeah full disclosure was the ra stage What's your DJing relationship like with him and are you guys competitive when it comes to finding tunes? No, I mean no, no, no, no. It's not a game, it's not a battle, you know. Sometimes I read up comments like, oh yeah, he played better than you, whatever. As if people think that it's a football game between two teams. No, well, he's bigger than me. So if this is happening, it's because he wanted it, not the other way around. But people don't realize that. No, it's not about competition. We kind of started playing back-to-back quite randomly. I was playing at the Weather Festival and he started playing with me and you know it went really well and it's good memories and then Yeah, that was like three years ago And then the dimensions thing, it was also random. Like, I just came on stage telling him how good his set was because I was just dancing in the crowd. And he told me, hey, man, come on, play with me, you know, but it was not planned at all. So then we had all of these requests to play together. No, but Danilo, I met him really late. Like, I was buying his records when they came out, like all the raw cuts, like fantastic stuff. And I was But we never met on the road. We met on the road like in 2014 only. but I always wanted to meet him because I knew that we had, you know, a lot of, a lot of the same love for the same music, you know, and, and yeah, he's a great dude. Like he's the best. I mean, he's my favorite DJ in this touring thing. Like he's a good friend, but also like, I really respect him. Like all the music is done and I think it's, yeah, it's great. It's great. And looking ahead, you know, 2018 like a good year for you in terms of life and music balance Man, keep on you know, keep on trying to feel good at gigs Try to feel at ease Playing good shows, you know, it's always about reaching a new audience because you know There's a lot of people who came who used to come to all of my parties, but they're getting older They find their girlfriends boyfriends, whatever and they stop going out. So then you always have to convince new people. I mean, I've been doing this professionally for eight years. And between being 23 and being 31, you know, you... see a lot of people disappearing from that like they're still into music but they don't go out anymore so you always have to get the new the new generation even though the whole Digger thing is really huge with all the great work that Huni Antal is doing I feel like there's still much more people to convince you know like in all of those tech house areas like you know trying to convince people to also listen to a bit of vocals, maybe try to listen to a bit of soul music as well. You know, I mean, there's always people to convince, you know, and, and that's always a new challenge, like, you know, making new fans and, but people who are actually aren't really understanding what this is about, you know. Do you see that as your job to convince people? Yeah, of course. Of course. Of course. And that's why I'm so sensitive that sometimes I see someone that's not smiling at me or something and I'm like, this is, you know, am I doing something wrong or, but yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all about, yeah, convincing new people about trying to listen to good music at home, you know, every. person has a different taste but you know i sometimes play festivals where yeah it's a total challenge you know i think the bigger you get like for some of my friends Like they really play at those festivals where you would think like nobody cares about them. But, you know, then it's the real challenge, you know, like playing in a small room with only your friends or only record diggers, you know, while you do it in the beginning. But then it's not so fun anymore. Then it's all about the challenge of, you know, trying to find a new audience and trying to, you know, teach the youngsters about all those great masters that work dubs or all those. great early tracks releases or all of those great modern soul records, you know, it's about that. It's about trying to share, you know, with as much people as possible. Music's had a massive impact on your life, obviously, from a very young age. Does it, that healing power that it had for you as a child and as a young man, is it still as strong now? Yeah, it's strong, but the thing is, like, listening to music at home, sharing music with friends is not the same as touring all the time as a professional DJ. You know, it's like two completely different things. Like, on one side, you're at home, you're chilling, you're listening to music, you welcome friends and stuff. And on the other side, sometimes it can get like a bit like, oh, I'm so tired. I'm so exhausted. Oh, they put me on that huge stage. I'm so stressed. So, you know, it's sometimes it's I mean, you know, it's like stepping to the professional side. Yeah. Sometimes it's a bit hard. Like, I mean, it's amazing. It's like lots of people dream about it. And I kind of dream that it's going to last for long for me as well, you know, of course. But yeah, sometimes when you step to the proper professional side, yeah, it can be a bit hard to handle. sometimes maybe yeah you lose the cool a little and but then a few days after you get back home and there's that record waiting for you in your box and you're like oh this is sick and i really want to play it on friday when i come back to the club you know so it's always up and down but yeah it's all you know coming back to the dj life it's also about I mean, we're all different, but like I would never do four gigs in a row anymore. Like I really rarely do three gigs in a row anymore as well because, you know, it damages your ears. You're too tired to actually enjoy it when you play, you know. It's more about trying to enjoy when you play, you know. So, yeah. pick up the right shows pick up the right audience or pick up the right challenge as we said and uh and then you love your job you know but when you overdo it and i see a lot of people are doing it i'm like hey guys do you still really love what you do you know it's it's uh it's hard what are the signs of when you see your your peers um overdoing it is it just taking too many gigs or yeah yeah yeah I mean but then again we're all different some people have much more positive energy than than I do life made me moody you know so I'm not always smiling I mean I think I'm decent cool guy but some people think the opposite but yeah maybe they saw me on the wrong day but uh some Some people can do a few all-nighters in a row. And I'm like, well, when I do an all-nighter, I'm really empty afterwards. And my ears hurt and stuff. So, you know, do it the right way. And it's a marathon. It's not a sprint, you know. But then I'm not going to give advices to anyone. But maybe, yeah, to the starting DJ, you know, who's getting some hype after some boiler room whatsoever, which was my case three years ago. Yeah, don't overdo it because it's not about you crashing as a burnout, same as it happened to me in 2016. No, it's about enjoying what you do on the long term. So don't overdo gigs because, yeah, it's a tiring one. You mentioned burnout. 2016 would you like to talk about that and what happened there and what you learned from it well it was not just the music it was also a few things in my personal life but but yeah after Boiler Room back to back with Danilo you get you know you get some hype and you play more and more and you do those three gigs in a row every weekend and And it's the winter and you just move to a new place and you're like, yeah, where I am, you know, and yeah, I completely lost it. Anxiety came back like really strong. I had to cancel a few gigs. I had to go back on medications. I had to, yeah, completely. I mean, I already had quit alcohol, but yeah, I was like, I became like extremely healthy. Yeah, it's a classic one for DJs. And that happened to me as well. So now I'm trying to be, yeah, okay. Yeah, you know, sometimes I'm like, yeah, I'm playing only once in the weekend. Yeah, you know. Also, it's maybe sometimes better to save yourself, you know. But then again, we're all different. There's a special context for me, you know, like where... I've been dealing with those anxiety and depression issues for a very long time since I was a teenager. So, yeah, I probably got to be more careful than some other people. But, yeah, I'm trying to do my job as best as possible. But that means also turning off gigs. sometimes refusing to do too much. Does the idea of being a role model, how does that sit with you? That's hard to deal with. Like people see you in the boiler room and you become their hero. But of course, they don't know anything about your personal life, what you do, whatever, what are your other interests. And people might be disappointed sometimes, you know, if they knew the whole truth whatsoever. But yeah, for me, it's hard to get that step of, yeah, trying to look like something on Instagram whatsoever. No, you know, I can only be me. And like for me, taking a picture is really hard. Like those press shots, like all those things you have to do as a DJ. Like it's always like, man, I don't want to do that. you know, I hate it, you know? I mean, you know, I come from the background of just buying records, you know? So then like, yeah, having your face on the cover of a magazine, whatever, it happened to me twice in French magazines. But man, I never even opened those magazines. or I didn't even keep them. I don't want to look at it. I'm feeling a bit anxious at looking at this, you know, because this is not the kind of, it's good, you know, for your career, you got to do it. But for me, it's really non-natural. I wonder if there's, you know, do you experience where people think you're older than you are because I guess obviously you're still a young man but you've been around I guess on the circuit for a long time and from a young age. Well, it was mostly the case before but now there's a lot of younger people in the scene. I'm not the youngest at all anymore. I guess, I don't know. Mulgrab is 24 or something. You get lots of kids coming. No, I was always the youngest at record shops for sure. Like, yeah, I was basically buying records. Yeah, well, the first records when I was 11, but then kind of seriously from the age of 15. So yeah, I was always the youngest at the club, at the record shop whatsoever. Well, I started touring at 23, so just not that young, but... But yeah, I learned a lot when I was young. So yeah, obviously it was a bit strange. Like it's cool because I got lots of knowledge about music at an early stage and that defined my taste early. But maybe it was a bit too early as well because all the other sides of my life, like school or whatever, social life were always a bit weird. Yeah, for sure. How long do you think you'll keep DJing for? Well, hopefully until forever, you know. Hopefully until the point where I can actually choose when I play and everything. As I said, you know, hypes go up and down. Like the thing, you know, the 90s house thing is not there anymore. But there is still a spot for me, of course. yeah i hope it's gonna last man uh as i said you know at the end of the day even if sometimes it's hard to deal with that job i it also saved my life let's be honest and and and i really enjoy it as well it's kind of contradictory what i just said but you know it's just like depending on the mood of the day you know sometimes it's amazing sometimes it's it's hard to deal with but yeah i hope you know i'll be able to keep on music I love in clubs for a long time. Man, you know, I have no diploma. I don't even have the single lowest diploma in France because I gave up school. after my mother's decided and even actually before that it was not going well at all so yeah I lost all the social aspects so if tomorrow gigs were stopping I really don't know what to do you know I mean maybe I could find a job in music because I got a few contacts now here and there but uh no it's a beautiful job as long as you know I really keep on trying to find my balance about you know these alcohol cigarettes sleep not too much gigs enough gigs whatever as long as i can keep on finding a balance i want to keep on doing that for a long time man until i'm too tired for sure as you wander through your life your eyes it's got something there'll be bad days take a picture And that is all. Don't make sense. The future of. You can take it. Fake it. Make it. Right. It's a thing you choose. You can take it. Fake it. Make it. Right. Just stay. As you walk through your life. You'll realize it's got something. There'll be bad days. You never. Take a pic and that is all Don't make predictions, the future holds, you never know You can take it, fake it, make it, it's the thing you choose You can take it, fake it, as long as it's you Especially what the future make to you. Everything you choose. Take back. Make it right.
