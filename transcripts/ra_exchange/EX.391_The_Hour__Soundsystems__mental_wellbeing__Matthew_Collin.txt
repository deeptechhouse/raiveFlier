You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour. This is RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Coming up on this month's show, what makes a great sound? That's the question that Rich Cuffley from Sound Services, one of London's leading sound hire companies, will be answering as he takes us on a tour of one of his latest club installations. And the author Matthew Collin will be telling us about Rave On, his new book that looks at the rapid development of global dance music culture. But first, we released a feature at the end of last year that talked about the phenomenon of wellness. clean living in dance music. Whether you think this is an overdue development in the hedonistic world of dance music, or if you think it's a ridiculous collision of two seemingly opposing ideals, it feels obvious that an increasing number of us these days are thinking about our mental well-being. As we just reached the end of January, and many of us are still in the New Year's resolutions mindset, we thought it'd be interesting to to ask a small group of electronic music artists how they look after their mental health. First up, here's the Berlin-based techno artist, Rebecca. - I started doing CrossFit about, I don't know, two and a half years ago. And it was, it came because I was doing a lot of... cardio and I don't know I just I mean I love the cardio but I just didn't see any change in my body so I was doing all this working out like hours every week and then I got smaller but I didn't really get stronger so I got recommended to do CrossFit And it was just really tough, you know, like it has this kind of intensity that I really enjoy. It just was really challenging. And what I discovered pretty quickly was that you go into a class of CrossFit and then for that whole hour or so, you're just not thinking about anything else. And I really started to do CrossFit when CLR was breaking down. And I just found CrossFit and it just helped me because it got me out of my mind and all this worry and this kind of nervous energy that I had based around my career. and it just helped me remove myself. Do you think as well that it's important to be considering your mental health when you're someone who's kind of more in the in the public eye when we're talking about DJs and dance music we're not discussing like you know globally famous sports people or politicians or something like that but do you think there's a kind of additional mental strain that comes with being in the public eye a little bit more? I just think that artists on the whole, like across the board, you know, not even just music, are just completely... sensitive you know um it kind of goes with the territory you know you're a creative person and that means that you're a lot more sensitive to to different stimuli i suppose and and you know that form of wanting to express something comes from that having that sort of sensitivity and that also can work the other way because you know you put a little bit of yourself out there into the world and you're hoping that it's going to be well received and obviously now we live in this age this social media age where it's really easy to write hateful comments all the time so it's kind of the balance of like filtering out all of this sort of negativity all the time so I think it is really important to to have something that you can kind of help strengthen your mind or you know take you away from this kind of obsessive behavior that we all have around social media as well and for me as an artist I suppose it does you know the things that I do whether it is yoga or crossfit or you know some meditation it just helps my state of being here's Lucy the Italian artist behind the stroboscopic artifacts label for me um my Mental well-being has been crucially important because I've been in the last, let's say, 10 to 12 years, which is pretty much where my music career started, quite unstable at points. It's a tricky balance because there are certain things that I do to allow myself to be in a better place. allow myself a certain level of inner harmony and balance with myself, like for example yoga practice and mainly meditation. But at the same time, time let's say I can't go too deep in it because every time I go too extreme with my practice and I start practicing like really every day and meditating and things like I reach a certain state of kind of suspension and that state is actually not a very creative space you know so I always have to be careful in, let's say, calming the demons inside me, but not too much, because those demons are also the root of all my creativity in music. Is this a process of discovery that you've undertaken over the last few years? I've been practicing. I've been practicing yoga since, yeah, I would say 10 years, something like this, and started to dive deeper into the more meditative side of those practices. since five or six years and at some point that matured into this sound bath meditation classes that I lead in Berlin weekly that are for me kind of a reset point every single week for me that is a something very important to do to kind of find again some kind of rooting, you know, some connection to the ground, let's say. Because, you know, with our job, you're constantly, like being a performer, you're constantly in front of... Big crowds are constantly, let's say, at the center of attention. Like your ego can be easily pumped. I am a public person, but I am very private as well. Peggy Goo, the Korean artist who's currently based in Berlin. I like to have my own space. But on the weekend, you cannot have that. You have to socialize. And sometimes it can take a lot of energies. When you tour alone, when you travel alone, it affects you emotionally. Some people just think, oh, DJ is the easiest job. They just go there and play a few hours and they get the money. But they don't understand that it's not just what you see on the DJ booth. But I decide to be like this. So, of course, there are things that I have to take care of. And there are things that I have to swallow and there are things that I have to go through. I decide to be a public person. I think taking care of yourself is very important because sometimes when you tour quite a lot, like I was touring quite a lot last year and I was very tired physically and mentally. And to be okay, I started to eat very healthy. I think eating healthy is super important for me. Because when you're traveling, it's very easy to not eat regularly. Or, you know, when you go to a different country, you might not have your favorite dishes or something that you always take. For example, for me... like having organic juices are very important like shot turmeric shot ginger shot i used to run 10ks every day i used to be crazy with exercise but then after touring working i didn't have time and i realized that not working out affects me mentally and physically both and especially when you're a dj you go somewhere on the weekend and it's so easy to get drunk or wasted and when you wake up the next day you know the hangover is like one of the most horrible feeling too. Sometimes I play on Friday and I ended up drinking a lot and the next day I have a hangover then it's not the same energy that I should have when you go when I go to different places on Saturday the next day. So I this year I'm trying not to even smoke. And I try not to drink a lot. And I also have my own meditation as well. Once I come back from the gig, I try to have this moment where I have silence. I just think. I'll swear I'm not drunk. In Berlin, we're back with Lucy to hear more about the sound bath meditation classes he hosts each week. So this sound bath meditation classes I was talking about, it's something that I started in Berlin some two and a half years ago, where I kind of... of started to share to a public certain practices that I was experimenting with personally or with a very close circuit so friends and it's pretty much like what I what I tried to do is to put together those things that are that I find really in common ground between making music and being in the music world constantly and being interested also in those more meditative practices. So I kind of put together different techniques from both worlds and started this concept of sound bath meditation. which right now happens weekly in a yoga school in Berlin. And it's nice because it's in the evening, which is normally my right time, let's say, for certain kind of feelings coming in, you know, a certain kind of energy that starts to flow in me happens. I've always been a night person, let's say. And I normally mix certain techniques from like pranayama, which are like some deep breathing techniques that helps the public to get in tune into a certain mind state. And then the actual samba starts where I... where I play with these gongs, which are very, very, very interesting instruments to me and that are actually hidden but very present in a lot of my productions. Each and every gong makes your body vibrate in a certain way that cannot be repeated. that kind of physical micro vibrations like a micro massage is a bit what happened in a club as well you know that's why we're I do think we're all very addicted to bass for real because because of a physical even biological reason as well you know like things inside our body start vibrating our body is made out of water mainly you know so when when we are trespassed by this base frequencies this uh this water start to um engage into a tiny vibration and when this vibration is um amplified in the whole body becomes like a very very special state you know that i can connect quite well between the two different experiences like a meditation session or a moment in a club where you really feel you are somewhere else and I'm not just talking about using of drugs but for the music itself you know what I mean I'm sure a lot of the people that listen to this podcast right now experience at least sometimes in their life to go in a club completely sober without taking anything and still, if it's the right place with the right sound system and the right amount of time passed. to still feel kind of high in a way, you know. That's when energy starts to move because of these vibrations, you know. It's really energetical, emotional, psychological. And here's Jim Coles, the Bristol-based... artist better known as Omunit. From the perspective of being an artist I think that mental health is part and parcel of looking after yourself especially if you're doing your creative work full-time. you have a lot of responsibility to just maintain your energy levels and kind of your time really and mental health really is something that I think a lot of creative people maybe struggle with or it's definitely for a lot of people more of an open issue and less of a taboo so I think that it's good to kind of share information about this. And my word on it is that ultimately I respect the work of Terence McKenna. One of the things he said in one of his lectures was playing out the internal weather. And the idea of this internal weather that's happening, we all have it. All human beings have it. And I think it's very necessary as creative people to... yeah to just to stay in touch with it and you can learn new ways of expressing yourself creatively from exploring your kind of inner world and I find that that's the best kind of way of maintaining mental health really and with that comes physical you know the mind and the body are part of the same thing they are really the same thing in my opinion so everything you think has an effect on your body at a cellular level It's all hand in hand. So I do think exercise and just making sure, because a lot of what we do is sedentary as well. So I feel like you have to balance that with movement. Diet as well. The whole picture, you know, just learning how to be a real person in the creative world is key, but also can be a struggle. That's kind of my whole picture. picture on it is there a a particular um practice that you subscribe to or you know do you use any form of like reflection or sort of mindfulness techniques or anything along those lines in terms of techniques and specific approaches I would say for me I think over the years I've just read a lot and more than the practice of reading which is just good for your brain I just read a lot of I guess what you call new age or self-help some things I've taken with me some things I've left behind but like really the work of certain authors has just helped to of expand my worldview and kind of ask questions internally. I connect a lot with Buddhism but I wouldn't call myself a Buddhist. I think that there's something to be learned from every ancient tradition and I feel that It's just amazing that we have all these resources to be curious about. So that would be my thing, I think, is probably reading and reflecting and trying to experience in the real world, you know, and not so conceptually. But I would also recommend meditation. I've definitely meditated quite a bit in the past. and found that very beneficial. Learning how to breathe is really key. Yoga. I do yoga every morning and that kind of helps me just kind of get my body kind of ready for the day, you know. But there's so much out there. Everybody has their own kind of thing they connect with. So I'd say just be curious and try stuff would be my advice. We've known Rich Cuffley here at RA for a good few years now. He helped install our sound system in our office. He's worked with us on RA sessions. And he's been a guiding hand down the years for London promoters who want to install a great sound system at their party. Rich's enthusiasm for all things sound is pretty legendary. So when he told us about a new sound system installation he'd completed at the new E1 venue in Wapping. We asked if he'd mind showing us his new creation. Well, RA contributor Stephen Titmuss picked his brains about what makes a killer sound system. We're in Wapping. It's a grey, blustery day in London. To the right of me is the A1203. That's one of the main arteries into London, a very busy, chugging road. And we're going to go to E1 London, which is a brand new club. It supposedly has a fantastic system. And we're going to go and meet the man behind that, Rich Cuffley, who's a sound engineer with a great deal of expertise in the field. So through here, this is the smaller of the two rooms. This is the black studio. You can tell it's the black studio because everything in here is black. The walls, the ceiling, the system. So Rich, why has the sound system got plastic wrapping all over it at the moment? It's to protect it. Currently, the project's ongoing. At the moment, they're doing a huge part of it, which is improving the toilet facilities. Just outside this door is pretty much a building site and I think everyone was shocked how much dust was created. So I instantly came in and panicked and said we need to cover everything. Obviously the delicate components of loudspeakers and stuff, dust. won't do it any good so we're just taking precautions for that what's the kind of delicate stuff that would be in one of those things um i mean on the uh evo 6s which are flown you've got kind of diaphragms and the usual loudspeaker stuff which a little bit of dust in there really wouldn't help so we're just wrapping them to keep all of that out from the beginning i mean the the 215s and stuff they're they're not really going to come to any harm but you know the kind of tweeters and the 10 inches there it's it's really not good for them to be covered in dust We used the space and the room for temporary events for a good five years. So we used to have the DJ on this side when we brought a rig in and it kind of suited flow of people, etc. So when we went for the permanent install, we thought a lot about... the room and how it laid out and if we could improve what we were doing before. With the DJ over there on a temporary setup it never felt like there was really a home or somewhere comfortable for the DJs to work, it was quite temporary and kind of came into the dance floor so when we had the opportunity to build a proper console and DJ booth we... We jumped it. There was a cupboard at the back which we knocked into which claimed a little bit more room and gave us a bit more dance floor area. So I guess it's worth saying that... before you guys stepped in, this was a place that had temporary sound systems and what you've changed is to put a permanent club in store in here. Exactly that. I mean, we were lucky enough, we did all of the one-off gigs in here. So we were doing it to a really high standard with temporary stuff, but this just allowed us to take it to the kind of next degree of... of sound quality and usability really. So what we're looking at, we've got... a bunch of speakers here they all look big and exciting and powerful but are they rich yes what you're looking at is um this was a huge design feature and this was what started the project a sketch of this and this design was um what kind of propelled the project forward and it's based on the premise of using all the bass in one area, a mono block it tends to be called, so the thought behind that is by putting the bass in one position it doesn't have arguments with other bass bins in here so if you put a bass bin under each top for the floor point when that bass meets in the middle there'll be areas where there's no bass and it's cancelled out. So what you usually see in most raves is four speakers in the corner with bass blocks underneath the speakers but what we've got here is a massive load of bass speakers. surrounded in concrete, it looks like? Yes, my bunker. They have, I mean, this is quite an engineering feat. They have, from a sketch that was a dream from me to actually make this happen is quite, as I say, an engineering feat. It's made of concrete. precisely the dimensions of the four double 21s and the 32 and the other advantage is this also doubles up as the dj work surface so it's only taking half as much floor space as having a dj set up and bass bin so it's trying to get more um floor space out of the room but acoustically it works really well the premise is by building this with concrete it cannot vibrate so all of the base and energy that's created by these base bins can only go one way and that's out onto the dance floor so it makes it even more efficient so this is going to be quite a crude question but how much does something like this cost we're talking about encasing stuff in concrete there's function ones everywhere like yeah you know that's got to set you back a pretty penny yeah it's certainly not a cheap project to start the the first problem we had was making a span of concrete that big that didn't have any downward support Luckily the owners had contacts with guys who are concrete specialists and this was created by someone who builds skyscrapers for a living. Their know-how enabled us to build something that on paper looked pretty much impossible, really. The owners were, their prime motivation was getting the sound amazing, which is really, really rare these days. So totally grateful that they listened to all recommendations and built the bunker. So I guess you've got... Totally high in speakers. But have you done more other stuff to the room? Have you done stuff to treat the room? Yeah, yeah. Huge difference. All of the systems we deploy are a great standard and even more for me recently, the quality of the room and the acoustic of the room is a huge factor and doing this has made me realise even more that the room is so important. So before we started, an acoustic consultant was brought in. We used Shulm Market Consultants. and he recommended two steps to make it sound better in here, and that consists of the hanging tiles you see in the ceiling, which takes care of high frequency and mid-range. We've also supplemented those boards by rock walling on top of them, which helps at slightly lower frequencies, but because the bass... is so, you could say outrageous, but because there's loads of bass in it, it's really important to tame those frequencies as well. So if you look at the back wall where the bar is, this is all custom-built bass traps. So this controls low frequency. It comes out of here. When it hits that wall, it's dissipated, so it doesn't bounce back and give us any cancellation. So, yeah, on two parts, they've gone a lot further than most venues would to make it sound good. And for someone who's not an expert, you know, you look into this room, the exciting bits of the speakers, you're probably not excited by those bits of felt. I am. how big of a difference they make if you didn't have them. Huge, absolutely huge. It's, as I said, it's been, I know that it makes a difference, but by using this space with no treatment, some treatment, and now where we are now, it's so clear to me the difference that the room acoustic makes. your system's only going to be as good as the room, really, which a lot of people neglect when they're doing clubs. We're walking up some concrete steps above the huge array of bass bins, and now we're in where the DJ would play. in front of me is even more concrete. Yeah, the back of the bunker, with the premise of using the same footprint for the bass and the DJ, it lends itself really well. It gives us more than 16 foot of DJ console, which enables us to run two setups. So when we're changing between people's riders, while one person's playing, we can prepare, set up and get ready with the next set. The DJ can step up, load memory keys. If it's a PA or something, they can start to get themselves ready. So it just makes changeovers a lot smoother, really. And I'm seeing a whole host of what looks like amplifiers and graphic equalizers over there. Yeah. We've got the main amp rack, little design feature that we wanted to include and the owners were keen to do as well, is to have the amp rack showing. into the DJ booth. The area by the amp rack is where the engineer works, so there would be a desk, etc. there, but it gives us a really good visual indication that the system's running within safe parameters and everything's okay. Plus... when you've spent so much money on the best quality amps and processing, there's no harm in showing the artists, the managers, everyone else, you know, the quality of the equipment we're using. So it also helps keep it. cool as well like what would happen if you used like a less good amp with like a function one sound system well it's only ever going to be as good as the weakest link so um you know if the cabling's not up to standard if the amplifiers aren't up to standard if the processing isn't up to standard then the system simply isn't as good as it could be so if you made a huge investment in a system this good then you need to maintain that quality all the way down the line to the amplifiers. It's a huge investment, but again, if you're going to do something, it's worth doing it really properly. Very dynamically run. So at the beginning of a night when there's not many people in, it'll obviously run at a much lower volume. There's always in both rooms one of our engineers who... is really well qualified and knows the system inside out and they will constantly assess what volume it should be at so we would be thinking primarily that it's comfortable for someone on the dance floor we also want to reserve some headroom for that big headliner so that there's impact when they start Any engineer that's working here will spend a majority of their time on the dance floor where the customers are, ensuring that everything sounds tip-top and it's the right level. So that's, you know, as well as changing over the artists and stuff, that's a really big responsibility for the engineer that's in that room and something that... you know, people don't always value. But again, like the components, it's only as good as the guy that's running it, tuning it and using it on that night. So we're aiming for all of those things to be, you know, as good as they can possibly be. We're really lucky. We've got a great team of engineers who are really, really skilled. So what are the things that can let a sound system down then, even if you've got all the fantastic equipment? Well, from sort of starting at the beginning, it would be quality of music files. More than ever, these function systems are so precise that they're not forgiving to bad program material, MP3s. You might not hear the difference between an MP3 and a WAV file on... some earbuds or something but this is like a microscope and any flaws or bad bit rates you know it will be really obvious it will lose energy excitement and simply won't sound as good Mixer usage, if the mix is in the red and it's clipping and it's distorted, that will be amplified and come out of the loudspeakers and make it unpleasant to listen to. So really, at every stage, it's very easy to ruin the quality of the sound. That's just the material that's being played and the DJ mixer. So everything after that, you need to give the same consideration. So DJs, no redlining, no MP3s. No, as ever. I mean, we normally, you know, when you book a night and artists and stuff, you book the artist, pay the artist fee, receive their rider, give them what they want. But we try and be a bit more proactive here and we're sending out information about the system for people that are interested. or excited by that and just stressing that you know this is the place where sound quality is everything we're reproducing low end that sometimes can't be heard on other lesser systems so we try and get the artists as excited as we are so it's like if you've got music that's got low info on it this is the place to showcase it and play it so hopefully you know everyone wants an amazing sounding room with some magic in there. So we've tried to do everything our end with the install and the engineering. So if the DJs and artists can sort of give the same commitment, then all of the components are there to make something really special, you know? For you personally, was this kind of a dream come true, being able to do a full club install? Yeah, of course. It's so rare for someone to understand the equipment that's required and, you know, buy it, but also to treat it. the rooms and go to these lengths is pretty it's unprecedented really the last sort of piece to the puzzle is the toilets and stuff the last problem that we had um new year's eve and before that is there just weren't enough toilets so to give people an amazing sound experience amazing djs in an amazing space and then for people to not be happy about waiting for a toilet which is fair enough you know this is going to make it come together and give us all the facilities we need I mean they used to get extra removable toilets outside but you know when it's cold it's not very pleasant to go outside so they used to do everything they could but I think the commitment to building that just shows how serious they are about making somewhere really special Every time I go out that way, I sort of talk to myself because there's three sets of double doors. Then I remember why there's got to be three sets of double doors to stop noise leaking. Yeah. Shut up. So we're in the smaller room now. There's a much bigger room on the other side of this wall. What's the difference between the two rooms? They're both designed on the same premises, a four-point system. The smaller room is eight meters between each speaker. The larger room is 12 meters between each speaker, so it's got a greater capacity. It's called The Warehouse, so it's much more of a big room, warehouse-y vibe, whereas the black studio we're in now is smaller, more intimate. I think there's pros and cons to both. I really love this smaller room. It sounds so hi-fi in here. Next door, though, New Year's Eve, Ben Clock in there was something else. The scale of it and the size of the crowd you can fit in just works really well. System-wise, it's pretty much double the base that we've got in the Black Studio. of eight double 21s and then two BR32s. The BR32s are a brand new product it's a 32 inch base bin this is a substitute for we used to use infra base and infra horns similar to the bottom of the stacks at berghain those huge horns to reproduce really low frequencies technology's moved on and now we've got a very small unit i mean okay it's a 32 inch driver but it's much smaller footprint and it's reproducing the same frequencies um it's probably giving us more level but the precision and the musicality of the new stuff is absolutely mind-blowing. It's really reproducing much lower frequencies and information. When we started using these with Function, we were all hearing and feeling things that we hadn't felt before. exciting and deploying it. No one really knows how to time and set up and cross over these things so it was a real journey of discovery to get them sounding right and integrating them with the rest of the systems. It was great to start in the black studio with 1.32 and then when we moved into the warehouse and it doubled up it can be quite breathtaking. the volume you get so we kind of it had taught us a little bit about how the 32 works with the 21s and how to time it so it was a huge advantage but with again mono there's mono block bass in the larger warehouse which unusually is on the side of the dance floor which most people when they walk in comment on and A lot of people, you know, when you look at a system, normally it's facing you, so it seems kind of... counterintuitive to put it onto the side of the room but because it's low frequency and the sound it creates is more omnidirectional it works really well on the side and one benefit that we hadn't expected that worked really well is the the bass on the side means the whole room feels connected including the DJ it's like everyone's in the same room room and the same space experiencing the same sound and bass so I think it integrates the DJ into the room a lot better and it works really well on a bigger scale like that. And you've been in the game for a really long time decades how unusual is this level of investment have you seen it before? Probably only twice in the time that I've been doing it. In the 90s, there was a huge competition between clubs and, you know, that's kind of when ministry and stuff were over. and fabric opening, that was a well-treated room. So it's been a long time since someone has made an investment like this. realizes how important sound is to a club. So I just, you know, I really look forward to experimenting with it and hopefully seeing people realize the importance of it because when it's neglected or I go to somewhere that doesn't sound great, it can upset me because I'm kind of all about sound and if it's not great... people don't really notice it or react to it and your brain's so clever it'll mask it and everything else. So to put two rooms of incredible sound that's really well specced in a treated room I think is a huge change and something that's been missing in London for a long time. So yeah, as ever, super excited about it. The respected author Matthew Collin recently returned with a new book called Rave On. Collin has written several books about music, including Altered State, The Story of Ecstasy Culture and Acid House. which came out back in 1998. His new one turns its attention to the global phenomenon of dance music. Colin wanted to explore how dance music is evolving in different cultures across the world. He stopped by our London studio earlier this month and told Ray Philp about the creative journey behind Rave On. Hello, Matthew. Hello. Great to be here with you today. Thank you so much. You've written a book. It's called Rave On. How did the idea for the book emerge? It was actually the idea of my publisher who published my... book Altered State 20 years ago which was about the origins of acid house and the rave scene in Britain in the late 80s early 90s and she said well why don't you do a book about what's happened to it all now how it's all become globalised and how now this culture is what was a subculture has become mass culture everywhere in the world And I said, absolutely no way. That's impossible. I can't do that. No one can do that. Because, you know, now everything is everywhere. I mean, if you want to hear... dubstep in Istanbul or psytrance in Vladivostok or footwork in Buenos Aires you can. There'll be a small kind of scene there it would take an encyclopedia author to put together a comprehensive guide to everything that's going on in electronic dance music around the world and then it would have to be updated every other month. So I said, there's absolutely no way. I can't do this. And no one can do it. And then I got talked into it, of course. And it seemed like it would be interesting to... find out how this culture adapts when it's adopted in different places around the world. Is it just adopted as a complete import, a complete Western European or US? important not changed or does it develop its own characteristics depending on on the society and culture that it grows up in that and that was i thought okay then maybe there is a possibility to do something but the idea of any kind of comprehensive guide to electronic dance music around the world these days impossible So as part of the method of sorting which places you would travel to in order to kind of form this book, a question of selecting the places that shaped electronic music in the most interesting ways. Yes, basically. I mean, when you're looking at the influence some certain places have had on the culture of electronic dance music. some on the music, some on the culture, you cannot kind of leave out places like Berlin or Ibiza. So they have to be dealt with. And there's lots of ideas and questions and history and people that you just can't gloss over in any way. But then it was more a question of looking at what's interesting, where is an interesting story that should be told and says more than these DJs played at this rave in this place. That's a listing, that's not a book. Therefore I chose a series of places that I thought represented a series of different ideas and interpretations. and of course that I look forward to get to. Sorry Sydney, Australia but I love you. One of the things that struck me early on about this book is obviously you would have spent a lot of time at parties. And I guess, you know, you must have been inhabiting these places in as almost like in two roles. You would have been, on the one hand, someone who, like, you know, a reporter who was just observing this stuff with an objective eye. And on the other hand, you were there as a participant who may or may not have enjoyed kind of like what was unfolding. Was it easier or not to reconcile those two positions when you were at any given place? I've been a participant observer for so long that it's really hard not to think in any other way. You know, the advantage... that I had, I guess, with this project is that I have got interviews going back quite a... I mean, the interviews in this book date back, some of them date back to 1988. I had the luxury of being able to draw on older material and therefore build up a narrative in that way. What's interesting is that now it's much easier to be a journalist in a club since the rise of the smartphone. Because before, if you're a journalist in a club and you're writing in a notebook, everyone's looking at you like you're a total weirdo. What's that guy doing? Is he undercover? Yeah, he's undercover, that guy over there. Watch him. Now you can tap away happily making notes on your smartphone. No one takes a blind bit of notice. That is something that's definitely improved. for journalists covering this kind of culture. I mean, I was at this illegal rave in some of the wilds of southern France. And, you know, I was taking... taking notes by tapping away on my phone. If I'd been writing in a notebook, I'd have got a kicking, seriously. But it was absolutely fine to tap away on my phone. When you were, you know, in the pre-smartphone era, when you were reporting in these kinds of environments, like, what did you actually do? I think I had a better memory back then, to be quite honest, before I left all the brain cells along the wayside, to be quite honest. Yeah. But this culture was never covered in the depth and breadth that it is today. I mean, the... depth of quality of coverage is much better than it ever has been and certainly I think part of that is because no one really thought that you know youth cults used to come along they'd have like two years peak years and then they'd have another kind of five years of still being around but not being as vital and then you'd have your hardcore adherents who'd wear the clothes for the rest of their lives. No one ever expected this culture to go on developing for 30 years. That was... And so it wasn't documented in the same way. I don't think people realise that they look back and see this as an incredibly significant period in cultural history. So when you're looking for photographs from the 80s, 90s, or video, you often find there's pretty much next to nothing. And what there is is terrible in terms of its really, really poor quality. Because people just weren't thinking that this was... this was serious, yeah, they were thinking it was serious, but they weren't thinking if it was in terms of a historic cultural movement, because there was much more kind of naivety about it. Something you mentioned earlier was about the sort of observing newness and that sort of being near the top of what you notice from a journalistic point of view. In the course of this book, was there a particular party or event that really kind of ticked that box in terms of newness, you know, the sort of novelty factor? Well, there's obviously things that were absolutely new to me. I don't think it's any more possible for someone to be the overall expert on this culture and know everything about it anymore. I think it's too large and too diverse for that and for someone to set themselves up as the ultimate gatekeeper or oracle. for one person to do that is now absolutely impossible and would be incredibly disingenuous for me to pretend to be like some kind of super overall expert. I mean, for a lot of this stuff, things that have been going on for years, such as the psytrance scene in Israel, you know, this was my first experience of it. So... I mean, what struck me as the absolute newest thing was, in terms of the most exciting, was what was happening in South Africa. Because that... developed out of the specific social and political circumstances in South Africa after apartheid. And that was very interesting how the rise of electronic dance music came just after the fall of apartheid and the kind of new democratic South Africa developed at the same time as the South African electronic dance music scene. And there were obviously some connections between them and it was shaped by the way South African society changed. So that for me was... The most interesting and inspiring thing. But I think in general, in terms of what made me feel good, what kind of warmed my heart in a way was... All these people, like, all the time, arguing about dance music. Should it be this? Should it be that? Oh, your music's too commercial. You should be more underground. But no, we want the music to go to the greatest amount of people possible. No, you're just sellouts. All this argument, it just showed how 30 years after the acid house and all that, people still believe in this stuff so deeply that they're so passionate about it because they've invested all this belief and commitment and time in it. And it's something that they feel is theirs and they need to defend it. They need to defend their position. They need to defend the faith in a way. And this made me feel very, very optimistic about the culture in general because... it was still questioning itself in that way that showed that was still a spirit of belief and passion in it, which I thought was wonderful. There's a particular example of maybe this like sort of outpouring of passion I wanted to run by. Came across as pretty eye-popping. passage in the book where you're in conversation with someone at Kazantip who is a self-described foreign minister and he got really annoyed at you when you described the event as a festival because if my reading of it is correct Kazantip describes itself as a sort of sovereign state. That's correct. Yes. Yes. I'm going to just read this. The great nation. The great nation. Just going to read this little bit. The next afternoon, I sat down for a while with Kazantip's foreign minister, a dark eyed, intense young man in shorts and toe boots called Oleg Mishuris from Venetia in Ukraine, who insisted without any irony on referring to Marshunok as the president. and Kazantip as the great nation throughout our conversation and got a bit irritated when I described it as a festival. And then he sort of, yeah, goes on to just goes on the sort of diatribe about how Kazantip is, yeah, this, as you say, this great nation. You don't buy a ticket, you buy a visa for entry and they have a constitution laying out what the casentip subjects should... should believe and what rules they should obey and they have their president and every evening at sundown a gong would be banged and he'd deliver this homily to his great nation some kind of incomprehensible lecture. Kazantipy was kind of the burning man of the former Soviet Union. It went on for three or four weeks, originally in Ukraine, but then it got into problems because of the annexation of Crimea and had to move out. out of Ukraine. But it was interesting to me as this was like taking the idea of a nightclub or a rave as an autonomous zone to its absolute logical conclusion to declare it an actually a separate state. And to declare normal rules do not apply here. We're even going to have a president and a constitution and just to take it so far away from everyday reality. And it's kind of hyper escapism, isn't it? And they were in character the whole time. This foreign minister, he got very gnarky when I mentioned the word festival. I may have mentioned that word on purpose, knowing I might get that reaction. But he believed it. He drank the Kool-Aid, that guy. Seriously, nice chap. Very, very helpful. It also highlighted, the whole thing highlighted how this idea of clubbing or raving as an alternate reality, when it comes up against real reality, it is suddenly... becomes unable to actually deal with that because um now this kazantip um claimed to be its own republic but as soon as uh the russian military came in and then the let's let's not talk about the republic anymore let's we'll just go somewhere else like immediately It was interesting to me to see the limits of what was possible. How far can you take this idea of the temporary autonomous zone, the kind of pirate encampment set up to exist for several days or several weeks and then to disappear again before it can be crushed by the state? This was also what interested me about these... French Technovols which is a scene that's been going on since the mid 90s basically outlaw raves around Europe France is kind of the nexus of it all because it's a very big rural country a lot of space and because of the specific politics of France people can get away with certain things if they say they're doing it in the name of liberation and social dissidence. And that was also interesting for me because they had this very genuine belief that their culture, their version of rave culture was generally a dissident social movement in a political way. Not just... that they wanted to get out of their heads and dance to bonkers techno for four days in a row. But they were living a genuinely alternative lifestyle, as it would be defined in political terms, showing a social alternative to bourgeois living. And they genuinely believed that. So that, again, for me, it's interesting when people take these things and then they take them on and take them on. And, you know, the only problem for me was that I just couldn't stand the music, mate. 170 BPM for five days in a row is a harsh one. Sometimes things are interesting even if you don't necessarily like the music. It's interesting you mentioned sort of talking about those two scenes and by contrast, one of the themes of the book is the... increasing commercial nature of dance music and how that's kind of proliferated in certain cities. To what extent are the kind of like eccentric scenes and characters that you describe that we've just sort of been talking about under pressure or threat from this kind of, you know, this nascently... wealthy sort of like commercial side of dance music? That's a really interesting question because I think a lot of people certainly on the ideological purist continuum of electronic dance music see the mass marketing and globalisation of this culture as the enemy, as evil, as exploitation, as if they just woke up and noticed we live in a capitalist society. Shock, horror. But, on the other hand, they're still doing exactly what they want to do. So, I mean, I think... The lunatic fringes are always going to be there because they're always going to be people who want to do it in their own way. And one interesting example on my travels was these guys in Dubai. Dubai, absolutely hyper-capitalist. construction. It's almost a surreal place. All about money. All about money. And there's these guys there. The guy was telling me, I want to play art music. I want to educate people. I was thinking, you chose Dubai to do this? You really wanted to put yourself up against it. So what I think. Whatever the situation in terms of... We could also argue about where is the line between underground and mainstream anyway, and everyone will put that line somewhere different. But I think that there are always going to be people doing interesting things because there are always going to be interesting people who want to do things in their own way. I think this is how this all spread in the first place anyway, in that you had people who, like this guy in Dubai, he wanted to create a community of like-minds around the thing that he believed in. Now, he didn't... want to do that because he wanted to develop a series of franchises around it. He did it because he loved the music and wanted to have a big group of friends all enjoying that music in the same time in the same place once a week and to create his own little a little society of joy and abandon, nocturnal pleasure. So there's always going to be people like that, I think. And they are the people who are going to move this forward. It's patently clear that change doesn't come from the centre, change comes from the margins. because the centre has no reason to change. The centre doesn't need to. Change comes from the margin. It's people like this, these mavericks and idealists. These are the people who are going to push it forward. It's not going to be the big entertainment corporations who have now bought up a certain number of brand names of festivals or whatever, because that is not what they do. That's not what they're for. you I think I've got one last question for you. I'm really interested in this idea of you revisiting sort of, you know, the dance music scene, you know, decades after Altered State. One of the passages in the book that caught my eye was a bit about IMS, the music conference in Ibiza, and how it had been set up when one of the founders, I think, described it as their... described the sort of dance music industry as being in a lull. And I sort of wonder whether this kind of... bubble that you sort of allude to in the book that's growing will eventually burst or whether you know this is out now this is just how it's going to be from now on i don't know if this is uh how it's going to be from now on i mean it's it's it's only a fool that predicts the future anyway i think but um i think actually one of the edm guys the i interviewed in las vegas actually made uh young lad um He was playing at all these dreadful glitzy clubs in Vegas, but he made the best point about this because there was a lot of talk about, is this EDM bubble going to burst? How much longer has it got? Are people going to get into something else instead? He made the point that... dance music has had many names and many forms over over its history and that's going back further than acid house and all that that's you know that we're going going going back to uh you know the 1920s or or or whenever it's had so many different forms so many different names and It is still continuing. Yes, there might be, it might contract economically in certain areas, as it has done before. At the end of the disco era, went back underground, re-emerged as house. This could, yeah, of course this could happen again. But the idea that... people are going to stop dancing to music, well, that's frankly ridiculous, isn't it? Okay, that's it for this month's show. Thank you for listening. Join us at the end of March for another hour of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides.
