You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour, RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. I'm Martha, producer of The Hour, here to guide you through this month's episode. On this month's edition, we'll look back at Resident Advisor's 24/7 party, which took place at London's Fold nightclub in December. In addition to 24 hours of music, we also held a full day of workshops and interviews in partnership with CDR, in an underground room below Fold's main dance floor, decked out as a greasy spoon cafe. Throughout this episode of The Hour, you'll hear some of the highlights from those discussions, including LB and Deb Onair talking about pirate radio, as well as Steffi Allert of Manchester's Meat Free Collective chatting to Soraya Brewer about how to put on a techno party. First up... RA's editor-in-chief, Aaron Coulthate, caught up with RA's head of events, Ryan Miller, on the Monday after the 24/7 party took place, to reflect on how it all went down. I'm sitting here with RA's Head of Events, Ryan Miller, a couple of days after our 24-7 party at Fold in London. Hi, Ryan. Hello. How are you feeling? A little bit tired. Got a bit of a cold that I've developed from working about 40 hours over the weekend, but I'm incredibly happy about how everything went. Why don't we start by you telling us a bit about your role at RA? evolves and the 24-7 concept in general? Yeah, for sure. So I've been working at Horizon Advisor for about four years now. And my role is anything that happens in a real life space, I have something to do with and I oversee it and help it come to life, whether or not that's working with you and the editorial team and live our exchanges or... things with the brand partnerships teams or I curate the festival stages. Yeah, at the moment I'm a team of one, so it's quite a lot of work, but I get to curate stages at some of the most interesting venues, festivals and events all around the world. with artists that I truly believe in. So it's an incredible, yeah, it's a really fun job to do. So before London, where has the 24-7 series taken you? So we started in 2018. The event went to Berlin, Bogota, Melbourne, Tbilisi, New York and Milan. And how long has the London 24-7 party been in the works? At the beginning, we were planning on doing, we were planning on kicking off the series in London because it's our home turf and it's in a very important city to us all. But unfortunately, we just couldn't find the right venue. The costs were spiraling and we just felt that if we're doing this event in London, we needed to do it justice and we didn't want to do it unless it was the exact vision that we had for the concept. And throughout the course of 2018, we explored a bunch of options and Fold opened and presented itself. And we felt like that was somewhere where we had a lot of scope to do something really creative and really interesting. If we could tweak a few things about the space and figure out a few finer details. And they were up for it. They'd done a couple of things. couple 24-hour parties they do them every now and then so they had the right license for it which made it 10 times easier but we knew that if we were going to do this we had to do something different to what they normally do which is when we started talking about the additional spaces we're talking about studio spaces lift spaces room twos and I'm bringing a program that they don't really We do down at Fold very often in terms of mixing drummer, bass, garage, techno, house and blog house all under one roof. Well, you know, we had talked about the plans for the party and in writing I knew what you were planning, but actually walking into Fold last Saturday and seeing the space transformed. It was really quite a remarkable experience, to be honest. And aside from the main room, why don't you talk us through the other spaces that were utilized for the event and how you program those? Yeah, of course. So we had the main room, which is, you know, if you've ever seen the rare photos of Fold, that would be the photo you would have seen. It's a nice square room, nice function one sound system. But the building in which Fold is. housed is an old printing facility and across this whole space there's like six or seven rooms that we could access for this event so what we did was we've been working with them for a while and they were they told us that we could open up a second almost second main room out the back And then within the complex, we found that there was a industrial elevator and we could use that to put a little DJ booth in. And then just near the main room within Folds, there's a run of five recording studios. one of which has got more modular gear than you've ever seen in your life. It's like a space station, one of which is housing a little radio station that they stream from every now and then. And two of them are just kind of like chill out spaces for the team that work there. So it took a little bit of convincing, but they allowed us to turn one of the studios into what was essentially a fake bathroom with turntables and a massive rig in it. And then we took the elevator shaft around the corner and put a DJ booth in it and asked DJ Bus Replacement Service and the HMT hard crew to DJ in that, which again had a ridiculously oversized rig. And then we wanted to have a space where we could build a greasy spoon cafe to house talks. One of the things that we think is really important for 24-7 is that The exchange program that we do is kind of a bit silly, kind of a bit fun. And if you've been at a party for 15 hours and you've got someone talking about pirate radio anecdotes, you know, you should be a laugh. We'd looked at doing a container in the garden and there was a tent and we had explored a bunch of options. But fortunately, we managed to find another space, which is an old office, which is on the ground floor. And yeah, we turned that into a greasy spoon cafe, just very red lights and tablecloths and stuff like that with ketchup and mustard everywhere. So the event started at midday on Saturday and finished at midday on Sunday. Could you give us a bit of a glimpse into how those 24 hours unfolded for you personally? Yeah, of course. So I was at the venue at 8 a.m. with the production team, the sound team, which had been there from the night before, the builders who had been working for two weeks in two separate shifts, a day team and a night team, which tagged in and tagged out. So the building never... stopped and yeah by the time the doors rolled around you know we had the welcome committee who are giving people tea bags and bananas and everyone as they came in and I just found myself floating around obviously I was very fortunate in that we had all the RA crew on board we had this crazy big crew we had a bunch of artist liaisons we had the vibe to deck detectors in the main room that were and the other rooms that were keeping you know making sure everything was running smoothly there so my role is just kind of cutting around the place making sure everyone's happening happy frantically checking my phone for various WhatsApp messages that are coming in left, right and center and just kind of overseeing everything, whether or not that means I need to run into the main room and stick new gels on a window or whether or not I need to run to room two and help the sound system crew. It's a combination of things, really. So it's a bit manic for 24 hours. What kind of things went wrong on the day? To be honest, we were quite fortunate in that there was no major issues. The funniest thing that happened was about 1 a.m. when the way that the tickets worked meant that the second allocation for the night, a lot of people turned up around 1 a.m. And it was all a bit hectic on the door, but we were getting people in pretty smoothly. And then one crew kind of rolled through. One girl was wearing a T-shirt that had security written on it. And then the girl who was with her started claiming to be object to the security guards who didn't know what was going on. I was then like, hang on a minute, you're not object. And then she was like, no, no, we're just with object's team, I think. And then someone right now let's just put you out i'm afraid you just can't come in right now this is just isn't true you're obviously not object And then I went back inside. A few hours later, someone runs down. One of the doormen runs up to me and he's like, yo, so one of the staff came out the front here and just said that TJ is actually DJing right now and he forgot to put them on the guest list. So we've let them in. And then that transpired to also be completely untrue. And the staff member was just a random friend who... just blagged it big time so yeah they won that battle fair play i mean it's so brazen if yeah you got to pay tribute to that it's pretty funny to be fair yeah um and you know london is not a city where 24-hour parties are an easy or common thing um so how do you get this kind of event approved by the relevant authorities? Well, it's just one of those things where you just need to, the venue is so important and the space, they need to have a good relationship with local authorities in the first place. Fold has a number of 24-hour licenses that are allowed to do per year and they were happy to give us one of those licenses. So that made things a million times easier knowing that it was almost taken care of. Obviously, later down the line, we were hit with certain issues with the fold. But generally speaking, that side of things was pretty seamless. When we were looking at doing it at external venues, that's when you're talking about multiple temporary event notices and things get super, super complicated. So much so, it's borderline impossible. And obviously, there was... in the lead up to the event, um, some question marks over whether fold would even be allowed to operate for the, um, for the party. Um, you know, were you any stage worried that the event wouldn't take place? And, um, what, what, uh, is the kind of plan B in that kind of scenario? Yeah. Like, you know, um, the fold team are great and the fold team are working so hard to get the space in a place that they were happy with for 24 seven. You know, we're talking about multiple rooms that they'd never done before. And when we were hit with, when everyone was hit with the initial round of news and the license was suspended, you know, all that building work had to stop for two weeks. And then they had the appeal. They got the license back. Everything kicked back in. There was definitely huge question marks over whether or not it was going to take place. But... Fortunately, the team, you know, they've got a good legal team. They were prepared for the situation if it ever did come. And yeah, they kept in touch with us the whole time. The information that they gave us led us to believe that everything was going to go ahead as planned. And it did. And you can see, you know, that's often the case with events. You know, things go to the wire and you just have to be prepared to hold your nerve and see it out. And when it comes off, it... properly comes off and next thing you know it's midday and you've got vodka and orange juice in your hand so where exactly were you when midday rolled around on sunday and how are you feeling with a vodka and orange juice in my hand um stood on the dance floor you know the way that we had the rooms the final two hours the main room was the only thing that was open and what was so good was just looking around and seeing majority of the djs that had played was still there All the crew that were working on the event were there. All the RA staff were there. A bunch of different people in the crowd. It was such an amazing vibe. The windows had the multicolored sunlight coming through. It's difficult to kind of like take in at that point because you're like, we've been talking about this for so long and now it's here and it's about to finish and I can finally relax and it's just about to be over. But yeah, it's just a sense of like, nice work, everyone. Like we pulled together, we did this. On to the next one, I guess. And what are the plans for 24/7? So I think we're going to try and take it to cities where we feel like it's going to be something that will have serious contribution to the local scene there. When we did it in Tbilisi, you know, it's the first time a 24-hour event had ever happened in Tbilisi legally. Maybe some stuff, I'm sure some other stuff happened. So at the minute we're talking with the club in Kiev, which could be really fun. And then there's also another venue in Germany that I probably can't talk about just yet because it's always just planning. But it's not in Berlin, I'll say that much. How many people are you aware of that lasted the whole 24 hours? So in the crew that were working on it, I mean, when you start to look like the sound engineer was there from Friday evening until I don't even know what time on Sunday. And then you've got various members of the RA crew that got there around the same time. of time that I did and we're still there on the dance floor at the end talking about who's going to have the after party so I was incredibly impressed by a bunch of the RA crew um yeah shout out to Connor and James I'll give them a shout out and what were your personal highlights of the party Personal highlights. Wow. I think walking around and seeing HMT crew playing in the lift area, playing some crunk, gabber, reggaeton combination of sounds and everyone going absolutely mental. It was just one of those things where you're like, what on earth is going on? I love this. This is absolutely bonkers. That was a big highlight. And then also, you know, we put together the program essentially around two artists. Those artists are Fabio and the contribution that he's had to London rave culture is, you know, nothing comes close. And Leif, who on a completely other end of the spectrum. But he's an artist that I've seen play a bunch of times and he was someone that you picture him and the vibe that he has at a certain time and you hear him play and you just think this at. like the middle of the morning and a new room would just be bonkers. And then to have him come and do it after us, you know, he was the first artist that we booked. So to see him in the new booth on this insane Danley Audio sound system, yeah, that was a big highlight for me. In addition to Fabio's DJ set, he also did an interview in the Greasy Spoon area. And him telling the story about when he first heard Never No More Lonely by Fingers Inc. nearly brought a tear to my eye. That was actually one of my personal highlights as well. Yeah, my little brother was watching that and he's a music head, but not as much as, say, you and I. And he was just saying how inspiring it is listening to Fabio talk about his life and music and the contribution that he's willingly given to like... furthering the scene that now all of us are so fortunate enough to like exist in and do stuff in. So yeah, you know, Fabio is an absolute legend. So shout out to him. And I guess one of the question marks over the actual program for the party was the unannounced set that took place on Saturday night. Do you want to tell us about that? So with 24-7, we always have an unannounced guest play. In Berlin, it was Kerry Chandler. In New York, it was Fortet. And we wanted to do the same in London. We wanted it to be around midnight. So it was 12 hours in, a really intense sound in that main room of Folds. We had someone booked and a week before... There was a mishap and we figured out that they couldn't play anymore. So we had a week to figure out who we were going to book. I started scouring the internet, checking out artists' date schedules and stuff like that. And by some stroke of luck, Ben Clock didn't have a show on a Saturday night in December, which is insane. and we dropped his agent a line and they really liked the idea of playing unannounced. Um, so he came through and he played unannounced. And I think people were like, what on earth is going on? That's Ben clock. He's just, it was a minute ago. It was too bad mice. Um, how is Ben clock now playing? And yeah, he, you know, he did his thing. It was nice seeing him, seeing him in a room of that size, which I'm sure doesn't happen very often nowadays. And, uh, yeah, he was, he was great. He was really good. Nice one. Thanks for joining us. Thank you very much. Thanks to Ryan and Aaron. Next up, we'll take you inside the rave, sharing highlights from a conversation recorded six or seven hours in to the 24-hour party with Steffi, one member of Manchester crew Meat Free. Here's Steffi, interviewed by RA contributor Soraya Brewer. Are there any concrete tips that you would give? What can people proactively do to make their parties more inclusive without it being like tokenism? If it is a group of, like, four white guys promoting a party, they have to tread a lot more carefully because, obviously, anything that they can do is going to be magnified if they make a wrong choice or whatnot. But, obviously, you have to do your research and, ultimately, if the sort of genre of the party that's being booked, you can only... There's only men. who are playing that genre and there's literally no women, then obviously he's going to fall in that direction. So I don't think we should be quick to always jump on people where there is just men on the line-up. But obviously it has to be, you know, if that's all they're doing all the time, then they're fucking up a little bit. Because, you know, there's always going to be women that can fit on that line-up. Yeah, I just think you have to tread really carefully just book women because you think that will fix the solution. So I think Basically, I think the core principle is just to have cohesiveness. That's all your lineups need to flow. The night needs to flow correctly, you know, from start to finish. About cohesiveness, I would like to rewind from gender balance to genre balance. Because earlier on you were mentioning, obviously it's like leaning towards techno, but yourself, you are a very versatile DJ. Sure. You play a lot of different stuff. How do you find this balancing, not only in your own sets, but also throughout the whole night? What constitutes a good line-up for you from Meat Free? Sorry, now I'm going off track with really long-winded questions. And, like, Other Nights as well. What is a good line-up to you? I think, like, to not just have, like, you know, just using the example of, like, if you're going to get three sort of techno, like, Burgoyne techno DJs that all play the same vibe, obviously it's just going to be a bit... I mean It does actually depend on the length of the party because, you know, like in places like Scotland where the, you know, literally all they have is like three hours to go mad. So three or four hours for a night or whatnot. So, you know, I think you can maybe put on two DJs of the same genre. But I guess Manchester, we're blessed a little bit because, you know, you can do like 11 till 7, 11 till 8. So we sort of just like to... I mean, ultimately now we are doing more techno, just out-and-out techno. We've stopped experimenting as much just in the last 12 months. But with the exception of last year, we did Eris Drew. She did the warm-up. And then we had Chem and then DVS1. So I think, obviously, just start things off a little bit. I think you can always do... fruitier stuff at the start and what will you say would be like one or two other things that you face as a promoter over the years and what can you tell people to do to kind of avoid said challenge yeah i think one of the big things is that it's um in the uk it's a very special scene um for me i feel like it's the most hate this word but it's the vibiest scene um everyone go like everyone gets it obviously like everyone sort of interacts differently on the dance floor i always find particularly i can speak from experience in manchester that's the same That's the way things go for us at For Meat Free. But the difficulty is when you're sort of booking European artists is that a lot of these European agents don't understand that it's a real struggle. It's like we have the best crowds, but it's like few and far between. So it's like trying to get people that are like, trying to get the European agents who don't and have not grown up in the UK to understand that we can't. you know £4,000 for a 300 cap venue for an artist who yeah he's good but he's not that good you know like So, yeah, I'm not prepared to, like, miss a payment on my rent to, like, you know... Well, yeah, my rent doesn't cost that much, but a contribution. But, yeah, so I think it's... Yeah, that's a battle trying to get agents to sort of understand the scene in the UK and, you know, sort of get them to realise that, yeah, we can't pay that much, but they will come and they will have a really good time. and they will have people reacting to the sets. Because when you go... I think when I've played in Berlin and stuff, people really do feel the music more internally. People just really close their eyes and get into it and maybe don't scream and shout and go, come on! Like they would at Meet Free, like, oh, fuck off! That's a term of endearment in Manchester. So, like, it actually is like... really different so yeah you just need to try and yeah I think you need to be persuasive with how you speak with agents and you know luckily we're in that position where you know we've we've proved ourselves now but for up and coming promoters I think it's yeah you need to be persuasive and don't take no for an answer like keep you know sometimes you have to keep going back to them they'll be like no they're not playing for it and you're like well you know nobody else has offered to pay for them or you know bring them sorry so yeah you have to like be like a salesman in some respects sell your party and why they should play and even if we take one step back where does one even start if someone's thinking I want to promote a party I want to organize a party with some mates I want to book a DJ what's the first step that someone should take It's really difficult. I think literally you need to hold out for the right venue. Like, okay, if you're cutting your teeth and you're doing a few residence parties, do them in, you know, I think we all have those places in our respective cities where you're like, don't, like, I would never go to that club. Like, it's not, they've just... like the fallen off or the sort of curations not in line with your party it doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad club in general but for what you're pushing if it's like you know you know it's like a sort of more of a student club then stay away from it don't you know just hold out it's you know it's easier said than done and I respect that but you know yeah ultimately hold out for that good place where you know that your music's going to be come across to the right crowd because like once somebody has a good time at your party that one party then they're more inclined to come to the next one but I think it is definitely goes deeper than just a party you have to have an ethos and it has to be you know I think we were definitely, like, it was a bit of a fluke with Meat Free as well. Like, we definitely came together at a time where there was more sort of rhetoric about women in music. So we were sort of, like, definitely have been sort of flavour of the month for a few months, more than we should have done. So I also respect that. But, yeah, I think just being very careful about where you put on your party and you do need to have, like, your... You know, you've just got to really know that if you... You know, it's so sad when I see and hear promoters say that they've lost, like, a couple of grand and they've pulled, you know, 20, 30 people, but it's also... Yeah, you do have to make the... mistakes but you shouldn't be making them more than two or three times. You've got Manchester Unlocked, what can you advise people who want to foster a community of... I don't want to say punters, but visitors, guests, like, what tips can you give to upcoming promoters to create a community around them if people want to go to their party and come back again and again? I think you have to also remove, like, because, like, some brands can be pretty, like, faceless. So, like, and that really says a lot because I think, like, even though, like, everybody sort of knows. who we are in Manchester they know us from some facet because like we're all like heavily involved in the scene through DJing promoting like Alice who after parties yeah after parties are a really good way to sort of actually probably one of yeah one of the best ways actually is always to if you're I think if you want to sort of be you want to have a presence in the scene, it's definitely important to, you do have to go to these after parties or at least turn up to the parties of other promoters because you won't get anywhere if you haven't got the support of the other promoters in the city so that's one huge sort of like Tash actually started up Manchester Techno Promoters Group, does what it says on the tin it's just for all the techno promoters in Manchester But it was sort of a way to reduce clashes amongst everybody. It was pretty much the first time that somebody had done that and sort of got everybody chatting. So it was like we weren't all against each other. We were all just trying to like... survive in this like competitive market but yeah if you want to get people to like to sort of be into what you're doing you need to go and spend time and pay for a ticket going to their party chat with them you know you'll quickly become friends because you're all there for the same reason um yeah i think that's really important just sort of get out there meet people from your own scene Putting on parties. How many people, you say the optimal amount of people behind a party would be, like, how many people would you need? And even numbers, probably good, just because then if there's, like, if it's, like, two against two, like, in meet three, like, we love each other, but we do wind each other up somewhat chronic sometimes. And it is hilarious. We all get on brilliantly, and we all realise that we've all got very important roles. So I think, yeah, it can be extremely difficult because if one person's got like... If there's one person with a very strong idea, then it can be quite difficult. So I even think, do it on your own, because then nobody can take it. Everything relies on you to do that. And I think, I know Neighbourhood, Tasha over there, she's a one-man band and she's been doing it. Like, Sasha. So I would say that's a very good example of, like, doing it on your own and because, you know, she's got her own vision and she wants to do it her way. But then again, obviously, Meat Free came together and I genuinely don't think Meat Free would be a success if it wasn't for all four of us because we've all really got those strengths, all different strengths. sorry. So, yeah, I think you just have to, you have to sort of foresee that, like, you're not always going to get on. So whoever you enter into, like, a party with. you need to either be prepared that you're going to have fallings out and you're going to sort of disagree, but then you have to realise that as long as your visions are all the same and one of you is just not trying to sabotage it, like it does happen, then yeah, you should be good, but it's either, yeah, just... tread very carefully and within the group how do you divide roles and responsibilities who does what Tash is the most organised so she's like the finance patrol No penny gets past Tash. And then, like, to be fair, like, some of us are, like, more involved than others, but it really works that way. Like, Lucy's, like, on the night, like, Lucy, as I mentioned, she's, like, operations manager at School of Electronic Music, was, like, the equivalent of Point Blank. And, like, she's, like, she's really great at, like, solving... in tech issues so like during the set up like we just let her set everything up She pretty much stays out of it the rest of the time, puts her in, puts her in, but she's always there when we need her. And then obviously me and Tash also do curation and then Alice looks after more like, you know, sorting out social media and sorting out artwork and stuff like that and also has a range of brilliant ideas of things that we should be doing, like really that we know we wouldn't think... about like Alice has done such a brilliant thing called under one roof and it's pretty much one of the first raves for learning disabled and she's rolled it out she's done incredible she's rolled it out across the whole of the UK and so like she sort of gives us more of a yeah she helps us with the cultural aspects of things and how you know how we should be participating in in the scene in Manchester, not just for our little section of society, but the wider community. That's actually a really interesting thing. What can promoters do to give back to the community? I think... Like, initially, like, with Alice, it did start as a meat-free thing under one roof, but she spearheaded it. But, yeah, DJ, like, you know, if you get asked to do things for charity and stuff, like, don't, you know, make sure you do it. Like, if it's warranted, you know, if it's for a legit cause, sort of, I think, also, you know, make sure you're supporting, like, you know... your local just make sure you're going out and attending the parties that you know make up your scene or supporting in any way you can you need to do a lot of like cross promotion for other parties like you know we often share like posts for other parties that are happening in Manchester at the on you know over a weekend we'll you know just give them a push because we've got um you know we've like lucky that we've I've got quite a big, relatively big social media following and stuff like that. So yeah, any little thing that you can do to show that you're supporting the wider scene. Yeah, I mean, we do like, we've been asked to do, have sort of spearheaded some DJ classes for women and stuff like that. So when you... can give your expertise then definitely try and give them and don't ever you know if you've got someone that's like younger than you or not even younger than you but just somebody that wants to get into djing or just know a little bit more just make sure you give people the time to uh like learn from you it's not obviously we're always really busy but when people ask and they really want to learn you should definitely be prepared to just give away 10 20 minutes of your time and go through things. Just in case there's any aspiring female identifying DJs in the crowd who are like, oh, I really want to play Meat Free. What can they do to read? you literally the most important thing to do is make sure that the mix you send to whoever the prospective promoter is that you want to play for is just make sure that your music aligns with the brand because 90% of things that we get sent just don't and it's just crazy like you know people send like really chill sort of like balleric type vibe mixes for like a full throttle techno party and that is I think you know it's like lounge music I'm like well what am I going to do with this like I want to put you on I want to support but it sounds like I'm in a lift So I think people really need to be, you need to hone in on what the parties you're playing, what's going to, the mix just needs to be something that this party would, an artist that this party would book. So number one bit of advice I think for me, because every time we get a mix, we're just tearing our hair out. Like, you know, just nothing to... It's, like, completely the opposite of what we would book. So, yeah, and it's a shame because we do want to support more people. We'd love people to send in a mix and it to be absolute fire and for us to be able to, you know, to put them on. That would be a dream, actually. Steffi had a question from the audience about... how to cultivate a network of engaged ravers who actively participate in a scene that's in its infancy. Yeah, it's definitely trial and error. And I think we went through that where you go through that period and you're like, oh God, like literally nobody's getting it. I think you have to just take, it's really hard, but I always say start small and that's what we did. So like start with the pay what you want to wear. maybe you just get a residence vibe going and people like people just used to come for for like a cheap residence party for us and then off the back of it we just sort of like built we were able to then like take a risk and people followed and I know that it's like not one size or one cap doesn't fit all, like, do you know what I mean? It's, like, difficult. But I would definitely start small, particularly for, like, a small scene like York. It might just be that, you know, there's always going to be that competition from Manchester. People could just get to Manchester as easily as they can from, you know, to York. Sorry, easier to get to Manchester than to go to York. And I would, I think if that was me, I'd focus more on like a resident, smaller artist vibe and get it going. And then, you know, maybe if that was what you want you to do, you could, you know, branch out and maybe move to a bigger city if you felt like the art, because like ultimately you don't want to be fighting a losing battle. Like it's, you know, like maybe booking, like I know Chester doesn't, for example, Chester doesn't have like the There's not a big scene for techno there. Also, to book a big DJ just wouldn't commercially be viable. It's not always about that, so I think it would be best to build it from the ground up. Make it about the residents and, you know, people that you could book for, like, £200 or £300. That would be so buzzing and grateful to play the party, which would ultimately, like, contribute to the party and what you're about. I think it would never be, you know, you could probably never, until, like, the scene fully develops, maybe go for, like, bigger headliners for now. Yeah, that would be my... sort of advice on that one the audience asked for Steffi's favourite venue White Hotel definitely yeah have to like rep it hard otherwise I won't get any dates next year It's true. It's like gold dust around there. Yeah, definitely. But Soup Kitchen's also sick. It's a really good space. And then Hidden is... It has a different vibe, Hidden, but it's still good for what it does, definitely. It's literally a five-minute walk down the road, if that, from... from the White Hotel. So that's definitely like a bit of a bigger scale venue. But yeah, we're struggling. We're struggling for venues in Manchester. Like there needs to be something else. Like I actually just really love the in-house curation at the White Hotel because the guy who does it, Jacob, he runs the Project 13 parties. And yeah, he like his curation's on point. So yeah, any time I've like... gone out it's usually always at the white hotel it's sad to say but um yeah in manchester it's always been project 13 for me that i've been you know that are still around actually there's not many parties sorry in manchester that have been around for so long and uh yeah they are one of them and me and jacob are pretty close actually so i have a lot of respect for what he's done with the white hotel because he's took it from this like just outlandish space which didn't really have any rules and still doesn't today as much but he's sort of refined it and made it viable actually for a club to sort of weather the storm in Manchester like they've done is really impressive so I'll always have nothing but respect for them. Apart from that, other parties in the UK would be like Chapter 10, which I had the chance to play at and it's just genuinely one of the best vibes. And House of God in Birmingham, which is the, I would say, the longest running techno party in the world, actually. It's 27 years going strong and we were lucky to play for it two times. And it's just, like, everybody's there. Like, people that go have been there from the day off. It's, like, sometimes not a full set of teeth in the house, like, because there's a few, like, a few dodgy ones at the back. But, yeah, it's an absolutely incredible party. I love it. And that has got to be probably one of the best parties in the UK for me. I hope you enjoyed hearing from Steffi about how she runs Meat Free. We're diving deeper into the 24-hour party now to hear a conversation between Debonair and LB about Pirate Radio and London. Hello. Well, come on, come on through. It's all right to be late, but it's eight hours into the rave, so everyone's getting a little bit wavy, maybe. Yeah, today we're going to talk about, have a little chat about something that's very closely related to the underground UK rave scene, and that is Pirate Radio. In this context, it refers to illegally hijacking a frequency on a traditional transistor radio. It first occurred in the 1960s, but it was the 80s when pirate radio became heavily associated with underground music by emerging from and serving hyper-local scenes. guide us through this journey than one of the most important and enduring legends from the time it's LB what's up guys blessed to come in to thank you for those that don't know who the hell I am yeah and you just come along anyway and thank you for those that do know who I am and you came to check me out because I'm actually here so my relationship to pirate radio is probably not the best person to talk to as far as being integrated But mine's a nice one where it's different. It's a different perspective. It served a different use for me as a producer. So don't forget, LB's a producer. I get DJing work off of the back of the records that I produce. So first and foremost, I'm a producer. So what that meant was I didn't have to run after the pirate. radio stations to get my name up. What pirate radio was to me was, I suppose the best way to describe it was like a beacon. Do you know what I mean? It was like a beacon showing me how well my tracks were doing. When they hit the road, who was playing them. what stations were playing them. So that's where it was important to me. It was like a beacon as to my progress out there. It was like some kind of indication as to how well we were doing, if I'd have actually started at all, really. Because I was aware of pirate radio stations from a young age. I had my first record out when I was 15. That is young. Been busy. Yeah, so I'm fully aware of radio stations and didn't really have any need or want to revolve around them or be on a radio station by the time my first record hit the road. So that's what it was for me before. That's all it was to me before my records started coming out. So how did radio start off? Did you listen to radio when you were growing up? Yeah, it was really essential to me. Getting into music young, if it weren't for radio, if it weren't for... What did I used to listen to? Colin Dale. I used to be big into techno. Colin Dale was in charge in the UK here. It was Colin Dale and Colin... favor on Kiss FM in the mid 90s and techno wasn't all Jeff Mills and like you know it was more constructive it was more groovy it was more like the US house stuff If you know artists like Felix the House Cat and stuff like that, it was more like that. Not so aggro, not so noisy. Jeff Mills hadn't even come around at the time. So it was, you know, you could go to a techno rave, there's plenty of women there. It wasn't all grungy and sweaty and dark and dungeon-y. It wasn't like that at all. Okay, and when did you first start listening to Pirates? Like, at what point? Were you already making There was Colin on Kiss. There was Trevor, the older brother. There was a fantastic producer that kind of befriended my dad and they got really techy together. Then there was the younger brother, Mark, who was my age. We started hanging around and he got me into the DJing thing and stuff. And then I suppose I came on my first record. To get my first record out, my route was basically in a nutshell, take demo tapes around. Give demo tapes to the most high-powered person I could reach. Groove Rider. I had drum and bass. I was doing some drum and bass. I was doing some techno. Give one to Groove Rider. Go down to Metalheads. Give them out to the guys and stuff. Give one to Goldie. I was lucky enough to know Goldie personally because a good friend of mine is his keyboard player from the band back in the day, Justina Curtis. So she took me into the studio when he was making the Mother album. Got to meet Rob Playfield. David Bowie was there in the booth smoking 100 cigarettes and shit. It was crazy. So all of this was like, connected me with the family, but they were not accepting my demo tapes at all. It was literally a case of, yeah, nice one, Elle. I'll check it out in the car. I'll give it a listen later. That's the end of it. That's all you would hear. That's all you would hear. So it's really useless, especially nowadays. worse trying to suck up to guys we used to call it kissing ass back in the day i used to call it liaising you know i'm saying whatever you want to call it it had to be done to a certain degree back in the day i suppose you've got to reach out connect to everybody you can nowadays but it's not the way to get things done you've got to start your own smoke you've got to start your own smoke where there's smoke there's fire you've got to start your own flame you've got to get even if your eventual destination is a major record label, they need to see that they can put a pound into you and make back free. That means that you've developed your own fan base, something they can invest in a commodity to them. artist development deals no more and that shit there. So that's that one in a nutshell. So I had to really kind of create my own smoke. So the demo thing weren't going. I gave demo tapes to everybody in the techno side, everybody on the drum and bass side. And people used to tell me the same thing. El, when you find your sound, when you find your sound, you'll be all right. You'll be rolling. I used to think, what the fuck does that mean? Find my own. sound. Has anybody, everybody ever heard that? When you find your sound. Do you know what I'm saying? It's a fucked up thing because you can't help but make music like you. You pick up a paintbrush, you're going to paint like you. No one does what you do and vice versa. So you find your sound, you have your sound before you even start to produce your first ever track. You can only... create your sound. You can't have someone else's sound. It's impossible. Everybody has their own sound. So it's just a matter of self-development. It's a matter of self-development. When we get to the point where you get your technique in the bag, where you can deliver good, sharp... production that's effective with hands tied behind your back, blindfolded. Do you know what I'm saying? It just becomes habit. You know what's needed. As a builder knows what's needed to keep a house up. If you don't have this, it's going to fall down after a couple of years. Simple. Do you know what I mean? So same thing. But yeah, back to the pirates now. So the first track's been released. I've teamed up someone by the name of Noodles. I hate to... I hate to give him props by saying his name because we on a massive like Break up like we've since we broke up. We hate each other. It's one of them ones Do you know I'm saying so he's not looking to give me any any promotion I'm not looking to give him any but he was the guy that took my demo tape and said listen What you've got on here is trash, but if we just make a few tweaks here and there yeah I reckon I can get some of this shit signed and we can make some money together. So we teamed up. We teamed up and it was great while it lasted. He taught me everything that I needed to know about outside of the studio. The marketing and the branding. So yeah, that was the first track that came out, Groove Chronicles. So now I'm paying attention to the radio stations. That's bringing it back to the pirates now. Now I'm paying attention to the pirate radio stations. Now I need them. Yeah, okay. And which were the popular ones? in your area? South. I'm from South. Always been around Clapham, Brixton, Streatham, Stockwell, Ballam, you know, that borough. route. So there's never really been anyone that knows, old enough to remember, will agree that there was never really been that many stations broadcasting from South. As influential as South producers and DJs are, we had one in Crystal Palace, which is one of the... rare occasions I actually ran into a pirate radio station and there wasn't many that I knew about men even to this day most of them are in east a lot of them used to be in west back in the day yeah so were you coming up east to you know listen to that radio and also try and get on there like get your tracks on there Well, I mean, no, I mean, there wasn't much we didn't pick up in South. Okay. Yeah, being quite good. I mean, anyone that was above the river broadcasting, they were like here in this area. They were literally just above the river, not too far. So we were catching everything in South. Okay, you were still catching it. Yeah, unless you were in a really hilly area. That's all you had to worry about back in the day was being in a hilly area. You stations in certain areas. We picked up everything. I remember a bunch of them. You know what I mean? So I was listening to the first radio station I ever remember hearing was Sunrise. It was a station called Sunrise. It was London's first major station that brought dance music in 1988, 89. to the streets, to everyone's attention, way before the first breakbeats came into it, and you had the phrase hardcore, it was named hardcore, stuff like that. So from '88, '89, it was the Rat Pack that kind of ruled that station, Sunrise. And then... I don't know, if we shoot forward a few years, you had Cool FM. Yeah, so Cool's one of the big ones. Cool FM was the main one in London that came. I think they were broadcasting out east as well. That was a massive impact for the drum and bass scene. And then Garage Days now, shoot forward a few more years, and you had stations like Girls FM, which was like really solid. quality, great DJs, clear broadcasting, constantly there and reliable all the time. 100% devoted to house and garage, if I'm not wrong. That was really good. Solidly run for like two to three years and then all of a sudden just stopped. And at what point did Rinse come in? Was Rinse important in terms of repping the sound? No, this was before Rinse. Groups like 4Hero were like doing big things back then. I'd be surprised if anyone, you know, in their 20s or early 30s knows who 4Hero is now. That's probably just because they were so talented and they've got to have that respect that goes on for years, but they've been out of action for years. So I'm just trying to give you a... a time of when this was. What was the first time you got your tracks on the radio? I had a massive shock one day. It got to that point where I know we've got Me and Noodles, Groove Chronicles, we've got our first white label on the street. I know it's going around. I know it's at the distributors. I know it's gone to the record shops. So it's retailing at the moment. So I'm just waiting. I'm waiting to hear something. I'm waiting for someone to text me. Yo, your tune's playing. I'm waiting to turn on a radio station and hear it. Then all of a sudden, I'm walking through like a really posh area in Chelsea. And like a 60 grand Mercedes, summertime, sun's blazing, everyone's out, you know, people act in this country when the sun comes out. And it's 60 grand like Mercs just cruises past me with a roof down. And it's thumping the new 12, it's thumping the track extra fucking loud. And he's just feeling extra nice about himself, you know what I'm saying? There's me, I'm about three years away from even being old enough to own a driving license. Do you know what I'm saying? So it's that that hits hard like a sledgehammer. It's like, wow. And it's a weird one because that as well is like what you see from here. is like your eventual goal. Well, not to have materialistic things, but one of like financially comfortable, shall we say. So your eventual goal is to get financially comfortable and you're sitting there without £10 in your pocket. This guy comes down Chelsea, blasting your track and there's no one around to witness this. And it's what you've been working for for so long. It's been your dream. It's the stage one in your dream. All right. we're rolling now you know what I mean this is like you know that feeling you get when I don't know you might aim a can into a bin from the other side of the room and bang it goes straight in and stuff that feeling that when you've put effort into doing something and it actually fucking works you know what I mean like wow It is possible. Do you know what I'm saying? At that point, it becomes material, not just up here. Like, we can do this. Do you know what I'm saying? So that's the impact. That moment was massive for me. And I knew it was coming. I'd just been waiting to see it. And were there certain DJs that you were giving, at what point did they start taking your dubs? Because you said at first... Straight away. Straight away. I did not come into this music game to be any guy. I did not come into this music game to camouflage. I came in to be, to bring my personality as it's always been since a small child, the type to stand on top of the table and not care. I don't embarrass easy. I want to stand out. I want to be loud, colorful. I want to be the best at what I do. Do you know what I'm saying? apart from the egotistical side of it, I want to bring something to the music scene. That was the most of it. I want to bring something. It's like when someone comes up to me in a club and says, oh my God, Stone Cold, man, that tune for me and this and that, and whatever track it was that done it for them at that moment, the sparks and memories off when they hear it. I say, no, bless, bro, because that's what, first and foremost, I do when people come and say that shit, it gives me a warm feeling, you know what I mean? That's why we do this shit, man. To be quality, to be known as quality producers. I mean, I think we can all say Stone Cold is our favourite song, surely. Absolutely like legendary, legendary business. Well, just quickly, like, as an artist, painter, tiler, chippy, whatever you do as a craft. I think you would be the last person to stand there and say, look at my work, and I'm fucking talented. You shouldn't be saying that shit, but the Stone Cold is probably one of the only pieces of work that I can say I really enjoy it as if I never made it. What about the mainstream stations, like the traditional ones? Were you getting support there? Mainstream stations, yeah, never had no problem. with support. Music's been embraced by I'm so lucky. Right, so now comes a different chapter in my life, skeeting off from the radio station thing real quick, whereas I've moved from producer, getting DJ work from the production. Through doing DJ work, I've learned about the club scene. Now I find myself putting on my own nights, successfully as well. So it's like... I'm lucky, so lucky that in curating these. nights I have a massive plethora of artists that are influenced by my music that I can ring up and say let's talk about you coming down to my night and playing a set this is the reason for me having such a wide range of DJs on my night if you check out the night South Circular next one's 28th of February Lightbox And when was the first time you appeared on a pirate station? I've never DJed on a pirate radio station before. Oh, really? Wow. Yeah. So, like I said, not the best person to talk to about pirate radio stations, but one with a different perspective. You know what I mean? Do you think pirates are still important today, even with... the internet coming through and obviously streaming platforms. Yeah, when the internet came around, I was there to watch it from nothing to something. So you had the phone, you take the phone plug. the same, remember, do you remember internet when you had to plug it into the phone plug in the wall and sit there for days waiting for a JPEG to download, got to cross the screen like this. So I remember it from early days and when it came through for time I was like yes and then when iTunes put a little thing on there where you could like access internet radio stations across the globe 24 hours a day even if they were just on podcasts it's a massive thing man it was great I mean I'm not sure if anyone bothers to fucking check it out but you can go on there and just listen to like favela funk all day like you're just like tapping straight into Brazilian radio stations man that don't have that status chart that you have to compete with. It's crazy. You just lock on to any of them South American stations, some of them African stations, man, and they're just banging some beats. That's how I keep the music 3D. Never listen to dance music in the house. LB does not listen to dance music in the house. That's how I keep my dance music production with more depth. I listen to jazz music. I listen to salsa. to live band stuff and loads of vocal, loads of hip-hop that samples from Rare Groove, Motown, you know what I'm saying? Don't listen to electronic music. - No dance music in the house. - No, no, no electronic music in the house. No, it's not a rule. It's something that's not going to... It's like, okay, I threw my TV out the window. I threw my Croydon Bryant acquired TV out the fucking window about three years ago. And life's been good ever since. So now I choose my viewing. So when you choose your own viewing, your choice is, right, do I veg out? Or do I choose my time to learn something? And it's the same in my music. It's the same in the music. It's the same in the music. When I'm listening to music in my casual time, I want to learn something at the same time. I want to be enlightened. I want my vibration in my body to be altered in the right way. Do you know what I'm saying? I don't want to be running at 44 hertz and shit and getting sick. So I listen to some Frank Ocean. And a huge part of radio is community, of course. I think in all the situations where I've been part of a station, the levels of community come out of that. And also, I think radio is very much a place where you can belong even if you haven't belonged to other places. It's true. It just shows how reflective just pirate radio stations is on everything. Look, I remember the day it was a joke, yeah? It was a joke back in the day, this thing called Delight FM. To me, what it was was a bunch of little ragga kids from around South, close to me somewhere, grew up on the bass line, the early ghost stuff that we put together because Garage was too flossy and chocolate boy and flowers for them, as it was for me. That's why I'd done heard it, they was like, oh shit, we can lay some bars on this. And hence Grime was kind of born. So now you've got this Delight FM thing on a Sunday. They used to do this, a live phone in, unrehearsed, unbarred, no beeps. So anyone can call in and say whatever you want. If you want to ring in and go, you're all shit blood, get off the air. You can say that. That was the whole point of the Sunday calling. And these were a bunch of kids called So Solid. And no one ever heard of these motherfuckers. And it was a joke. It was a proper joke. But the station was so raw because people were ringing up and just going, you lot are all crap. Get off the air. And they were like, all right, thanks for the calling. Next. And they weren't retaliating. They weren't responding. They were just embracing everything, playing good music. And once again a free, raw, to-the-point beacon of what the public thought of them. Because all they were doing was blasting their music. And now look at them. Do you know what I'm saying? So it's like instant feedback. Yeah, now they're flag flyers for British culture. Do you know what I'm saying? So, like, that's how bloody important it is. Pirate radio stations. Thanks to all our contributors on this month's edition of The Hour.
