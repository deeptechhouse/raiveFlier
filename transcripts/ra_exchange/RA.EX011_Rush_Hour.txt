Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Christine Kakari and I work for RA Tickets. Christiane MacDonald and Antal Heitlager started Rush Hour as a mail order business in 1996. In three short years it had grown into a shop, a distribution network and a network, and a record label. Perhaps best known for its label arm these days, Rush Hour this year released records from the varied likes of Rick Wilhite, Tom Trago, Recluse, and Cosmin TRG. I met recently with McDonald in Amsterdam to talk about the early years of Rush Hour, how it's coping with the uncertain future of the record business, and much more. you Amsterdam and I guess the Netherlands in general has always kind of struck me as being kind of unusual in terms of the amount of people making interesting music and the amount of labels and distributors kind of compared to the actual population. What do you think is the reason behind that? Right, well first of all you have the aspect of Amsterdam being known as a liberal city so always ever since the 60s you know, hippies and drugs and hookers and whatnot, everything that's, you know, prohibited by God is ever-present, you know, in the city. When you're trying to... pinpoint more towards electronic music. I think that in the late 80s there was a connection between, a tight connection between London and Amsterdam in the sense that people from London came to Amsterdam just after Summer of Love which was 88 where when house music became really trendy or like a fashion thing in London. or cultural thing anyway and those people came to play in Amsterdam so and then you had the club called the Roxy which started I think in 87 88 I don't know it was before my time anyway but that club its first two years it really struggled because the new wave kids weren't having it but then Summer of Love happened in London and then I think in 89, 90 Roxy was the place to go. And what drew these people to Amsterdam from the UK? I don't know, maybe personal connections or maybe they came to Amsterdam maybe prior to that and because Amsterdam was always a liberal city. So maybe they made personal connections and decided, okay, we do this stuff in the UK now. And they were invited to Amsterdam or they wanted to go to Amsterdam. Besides Rox, you had another guy who started Beat Club. And I thought that was it. And in the Beat Club, I think... There was this girl from the UK who started to live in Amsterdam and she got all these UK guys over, something like that. And then when his club Roxy was running for a few years, they had this guy called Dimitri. He had his Thursday night running and he was really into Detroit and Chicago music. And he started having over all these DJs from Detroit. So I think, you know... Derek May came to play here, I think, Underground Resistance did one of their first live shows in the Roxy, so there was this close connection. Amsterdam and Detroit and I think you know Richie Holland did one of his first +8 tours in Holland and he also went to Rotterdam and then Speedy J was on that label so there was you know gradually building a little scene. And did you come up in that scene? Me? I started going out in '92, but I was just a young country boy. You know, going to the big city and skipping school and smoking weed and doing a little bit of skateboarding and graffiti and then a friend of mine introduced me to house music and then you had a record store in Amsterdam called Outland where I started picking up my first records and I think it was a coincidence that these records came from Detroit because they, I think... was also buying for the store so he was putting a lot of Detroit music in the shelves. So that was definitely important for forming my taste. And was there one particular record or artist or label that prompted you and Antal to kind of start this mail order business in the beginning? At the time we were really inspired by a new generation from Detroit which was Moody Man and Theo Parish. They came up in the mid 90s and started to put out records themselves in 97, 98. I remember those records coming in at the other store where I was working in really small quantities and we had a little group of people coming in and they were really looking for those records but then all we ever got in was 10 copies and that was it. And we really were intrigued by that sound, it was kind of like... more of a disco approach but then the Detroit way so it was a fuse between disco and techno and that's something that earlier on in the in the in the start of the 90s uh Carl Craig was a big influence I mean he already did that I mean the whole Pavecliffe people thing was you know Disco so when we started Rush Hour like I said you know it was really a mix of music from Detroit, music from Chicago, music from New York as well and then some some stuff from the UK and Germany and then some local bits you know like we have this guy became known later on as New World Aquarium. But he did stuff under 154. And then there were other people still around when we started Russia, like Steve Rachmuth and those kind of people that also inspired us. where we were instrumental in with Rochelle was merging the house and techno crowd with more R&B hip-hop crowd you know yeah because when we started was very separate worlds and because of the people maybe we knew sort of you know there were people coming in from all different you know worlds and there were buying back records from you know their opposite culture or whatever and so like late 90s early 2000s Amsterdam really became a melting pot of styles, you know, and one of those examples production-wise was Red Nose District, for instance. You had this one guy coming from a house background and one guy coming from a hip-hop background. And I think Amsterdam More than any other city, except for maybe London or Bristol, you know, we're really merging all those different music influences. So I would definitely say that's an Amsterdam day. you Yeah, we started the mail order in I think '97. I was working at a local record store at the time and that's where I met my partner. And he was sort of dealing records on the side, you know, he was studying. And then I was, I think, fired from the store because I couldn't, you know... get along with one of their DJs. And so we decided to do something together. And we started as a mail order from his house. pretty much and uh but then sometimes we would get people in to visit us and you know they would spend like two hours or three hours and leaving with one record and we're like all right you know this has to stop so so then we're like okay you know You know what, we just started a store and we went out in the city and tried to find a space and found this clothing store and they had a basement unused so we made a deal with them and then we were selling records out of their basement. We were only open for three days, from Thursday to Saturday. And that sort of kicked off. off and you know it sort of grew beyond our expectations and so about you know a year or two later we moved down the street to you know a place of our own it's the same spot that we currently had still. So that was about 2000, I guess. And we found out when we opened the store that all these people came, you know, DJs, but also people who run labels and, you know, producers and stuff. So at the time there were a few local labels like Delson who were struggling with their distribution at the time. So we were like, okay, you know, if we're buying... records from overseas, you know, from distributors and wholesalers, why not sell records to them as well, you know, do a little trade. And we decided to take on, I think Delsim was one of the first labels, and so that way we started our distribution or export, if you will. Having set up that we were like okay well we can might as well start a label of our own you know and for the local producers who came into the store and were offering us demos so you know we started the label I think 99 or 2000. So we basically set up you know the three main, how do you call it, pillars or you know, around the millennium and we also did parties and ever since then we spent time in developing all those areas. And here we are, what, 13 years later, and we're still running. Yeah. Did you think you'd still be here at this stage? Yeah. I mean, it's a business, but it's also a lifestyle. It sounds a bit corny, but it's true. So we've always had... you know, the passion to, you know, keep our dream alive, you know, even through the tougher times, so to speak. And yeah, so I mean, all our actions and decisions were based on our gut, on our belief. it's easier to maintain then. Sure. Yeah. And when you first started out with the distribution and the label, what were the artists or releases that, stores that you were dealing with outside of the Netherlands, what were the ones that they were responding to at that time? Do you remember? We didn't have a lot to offer. We started out really small with no commercial knowledge of the market at all. put out stuff that we were enjoying ourselves and we were like, okay, if we sell 500 copies, that's cool, you know. But I think one of the artists that was close to us was one of the first to sort of... get an international recognition with Aardvark. Bye. you Because he was doing stuff on our label, he was doing stuff on Delsin, there was this other label he was co-running called Music for Speakers. So he was one of the first. Then there was this guy called MOS, Roy D. So he was another one. And then there were people like Mike Barr, it was more like a house sound. So yeah, there were like, you know, a few artists popping up and as we were going, you know, their reputation grew with our reputation. And you said that at the beginning, kind of the commercial side of it wasn't so much of a factor. But I would imagine that after... 13 years and expanding and having all the different offshoots for the label, that that's kind of factoring into it a little bit more these days, yeah? I don't know. It's not the first decision on our mind, you know? But maybe after all those years, you approach the business in a different way, you know, just out of experience. you get more insight of how things are running. But musically, we haven't changed our way of operating at all. It's still about putting out music that's close to our heart. And sure, we try to package it nice and try to market it a little bit. But that's about it, really. And I think people... people notice that and that's how we create our fanbase. It's a very loyal fanbase of people who also are in it for the long haul and because they really like the music they're not trying to you know be trendy or anything like that so you know over the years that we might have become a bit more trendier but that's you know due to market circumstances not us trying to respond to market circumstances you know so you know I think The music we're releasing is an international language and although it's niche, we get fans from all over the world. It's not regulated to certain territories at all. Especially with the internet now, accessibility has... has improved for everybody. That's a good thing. But I guess also with the positives about the internet, particularly working in music and distribution. of the internet downloading legally or otherwise. Around when did that start to become something you started to notice or something that you realized could potentially be an issue? I would say never. Never? No. I mean, I know that people are illegally downloading music. I mean, I do it myself. Really? Sure, yeah. But then... I don't necessarily see it as a negative. I see it as a way for people to get acquainted with our music or music in general. And if that music is of a certain interest to those people, they will probably get... back to it and maybe start buying it. So I don't necessarily see it as a bad thing. Not at all. Do you do downloads? No, we don't. It's just distribution? We sell a lot of records. We sell some CDs and merchandise and whatnot in the store as well as wholesaler or distribution. And we've never... really decided to go digital because it wasn't our core business. I remember that people were approaching us, you know, you can buy a backend for a download store, it's 50,000 euros. We were like, hmm, that's a lot of money, you have to really sell a lot of downloads to make that. And then the next year was... 20,000 and then it was 10 and then it was free you know so uh we're like okay we're glad we never done it first time around and then by that time there were like a lot of stores already you know focusing on it really so for us the necessity wasn't there you know and We just developed the physical side of the market. And I think we're known as a place where you can get good records in... you know, physical format. So, I mean, that has always been our core business. And by really focusing on that aspect of the industry, if you will, we've become renowned for it. And the label side of it has, it seems like there's been a bit of a shift in focus, maybe. The last couple of years, the amount of reissues that you're doing. it's been pretty incredible. So yeah, it just talked me through the early days of the label and how it's kind of moved towards working with labels like Trax. In the formative years of rush hour, me and my partner were sort of two captains on a ship trying to do everything and then later on we decided okay this this isn't the best way to do things so we you know my partner Antal is kind of you know managing the whole company and I'm managing the label so by shifting our focuses we became stronger on each side of the business so when I decided to put my attention to the label, the label became more active and started putting out more music. And one of the things... This was about a couple of years back when we decided to do that, two or three years ago. By that time it was like 2008, so it was like 20 years since House came about. My belief is that everything goes in cycles of about 20 years, so it was a good time to... put attention to the roots of house or techno music. Of course you have a lot of kids coming up who never were there first time around. So a lot of good music was there but it wasn't put to their attention. So that was the reason to... start dedicating some of my time to those reissues. And I mean for me the label is a platform to bring my view or my love for... the music and so the reissue side is sort of what I experienced when I just started and what I loved at that time. We first started with I think Kenny Larkin's series was one of the first. And why did you start with him? Why did I start with him? I was just thinking about that. Because he was one of the second wave Detroit producers, which I really liked, especially. a project he did called PLD and a lot of his stuff was never re-released. I mean you had Kevin Solneson and Derek May and Carl Craig and Warren Atkins, they did a lot of repressings of their music. over the years, but somehow maybe because Kenny didn't have his own label or whatever and did a lot of stuff on other labels his material wasn't available for a while. So I remember he was in Amsterdam once and I talked him through that. situation he was like yeah cool let's let's let's do it you know let's do a reissue of a series of my earlier work so we did that and that that did well and then i think what Then we did one with Daniel Wang because at the time I think house was becoming more popular again and we were always doing house but then I said Daniel, you know... Bally who has been out of the loop for a while, you know, let's put your music back on the market. And he was cool with it. Same with Anthony Shakir. What else is there? The tracks thing. I just, I mean, there's a lot of track stuff that's been reissued over the years, but it's always the same 20 hits. And I had quite an extensive track. collection and I was listening to a lot of records, little tracks that weren't available at all. So I started digesting the whole catalogue and I came up with a list and then I found out who was controlling the rights and I approached them and said: I have this idea to do a series with a more obscure part of the catalogue and they were cool with it. Was that an easy process though? Because it seems like the tracks back catalogue is always kind of mired in confusion and conflicting stories. So what was that like? It's always been a bit of a mess. but then there's also conflicting stories. A lot of the artists that put out music on tracks, I think, were young and ignorant at the time. And all they wanted was to become famous or get acknowledged in some way, somehow. So there was this... you know, maybe shrewd business guy. He started out, from what I heard, with his own sort of rock band. This is Larry Sherman? Yeah. Or he was more in a rock direction anyway. But that didn't work and then he was in the middle of all these young black guys who were doing house and I think he was approached by some of them, maybe Marshall Jefferson or something, I don't know exactly. Anyhow, it ended up that he started pressing up records for these guys. And I guess he offered them pretty shitty contracts, but they were signing them for most of it. I don't know, I don't want to go too much into detail about it because I don't know the full story. But the good thing, one of the good things that came about that is we reissued the Virgo album. Thank you. And I actually got in touch with one of those guys over the internet somehow. and they were quite pleased to see their album being reissued. And they were actually pretty cool with Larry Sherman, so they were fine with it. And I was happy to meet them because I could ask them if they had any unreleased music from that time, because they only put out two or three records. They said: "Yeah, we've got tons of four-track tapes just lying around." So then I thought: "Okay, I'll go to Chicago and come and check it out." So we went through their library for about two weeks and so early next year we're gonna drop a compilation with 30 of these tracks. which they did from '84 to maybe '89 or '90. So it's gonna be good. So you went to Chicago because they told you they had some unreleased four tracks. Have you done that for any other artists? Is there any other artists that you've dropped everything? As far as library searches go, on the same trip I went to Gene Hunt in Chicago. And he was the protege of Ron Hardy in the 80s. And he was like a 15, 16 year old kid DJing at all these parties. and he befriended John Hardy and at the time a lot of local producers gave demos to him on Reel to Reel and a lot of that stuff didn't come out at the time due to politics or I don't know there were only a few labels in Chicago that were doing it. properly. So a lot of that music didn't ever see light of day. So he's, I guess, one of the few people who got those real tutorials in the first place, but also kept them really well. And he just had them? Yeah, he had them. I mean he hadn't approached anybody or... No, I was a bit surprised but then he did a release with us on a sub-level Our House Your Rush which is more geared towards the original Chicago house answers. speak so um he never yeah he sat on those tapes for 20 25 years and um i mean some of them are in better condition than others but uh we decided you know to work together and make uh do a project to make those recordings available for the first time so uh that will come out next year as well it's going to be Chicago dance tracks is what it's going to be called. Which is locally, dance tracks is you know, drum tracks. Like, you know, club tracks. So, and a lot of it is, you know, drum tracks, you know. young guys banging on their drum machines you know but we have all those legendary schuyl guys are going to be included on that compilation with unreleased material so that's going to be exciting and and he also kept all the flyers and posters from you know back in the day so we got also got a lot of images that we're going to use so it's going to be a nice package yeah for sure And with the Our House is Your Rush label, I think it's kind of interesting that kind of looking through the releases, you have people who are kind of, I guess, more revivalists like Kink and Snuff Crew and even somebody like Tivo Howard. And to kind of include in that same sub-label these kind of lost tapes of Ron Hardy and Gene Hunt. When did that imprint come about? The new kind of, well, it's not so new, but when did Our House is Your Rush come about? I think in 2008. I started with King and Neville Watson. And the sound was like you say very traditional Chicago house sound. It was like okay it's a bit different from what So we normally release, let's give it a nice classic feel and start a little subsidiary for it. So we had that out and then they came with another one, so that was the second release. And then we had Snuff Crew, I think, was the third, with a remix from Kink and Neville. And then I think Tifa Howard approached, or I approached Tifa Howard, I don't remember. And then so we had some Chicago guys on the label as well and then it grew. So, yeah. And you've had other sub-labels throughout the years as well. I know that Kindred Spirit is still kind of ticking over for you guys. But from what I understand, it's Cinnamon who's basically kind of looking after the A&R side of things. No, that's a bit different. Kindred Spirit came about... I think in 2001 or 2002. We have a friend of us, Casey the Funkaholic. He's always been a bit of an inspiration to us. one generation up. And so as a DJ, when I was younger, he really inspired me. And he was one of our early customers when we just started the store. And he's also a programmer at Paradiso, one of the well-known clubs. I mean, it's not really a club, it's more like a... Like a venue. Yeah. And he... He gave us a night in Paradiso because we wanted to do a night, a house night. 98 this was. So that's how we got acquainted. And then a few years down the line he had an idea to, because he was a big Sun Ra fan and he wanted to do a dedication release Sun Ra because it was... how many years he died or 50 years after this, I don't know, whatever. Some memorial thing anyway. And he wanted to have contemporary artists who he knew were inspired by Sun Ra to do covers or inspirations. So we were looking at labels outside Rush Hour because we weren't really into the whole jazz. to fund this project and put it out and we couldn't really find one and then we decided to start a separate label, a label of our own. So, Kinnu Spirits was started by Rush Hour and this guy, Case. And that label focuses more on jazz and a bit of soul and a bit of hip-hop and black music. Oh, well, let's... But Cinnamon is... maybe that's where the confusion comes. He looks after the instrumental hip-hop side, which is called 'not-navigators', the beat stuff. He also did the beat dimensions, which then came out on Rush Hour. I mean, over the years we did a few sub- subsidiaries just you know to fill out things and try to go through different directions and all of them are no longer active so you know sometimes you try stuff And then you decide, maybe it's not working the way you thought it would. And then you abandon it and go on. So there always has to be room for trial and error. Yeah, sure. So you told me a lot about the... kind of reissues that you've been doing um but obviously local Amsterdam and Dutch artists and labels have been really important yeah to the development of Russia always um so yeah tell me about that tell me about the artists that you've been working with from the beginning and the new artists that are kind of exciting you on the scene um well I just mentioned earlier artwork was uh in early days really uh You know, somebody who really inspired me and still does. Then we had somebody like Kid Sublime, who was really a subliminal kid. You know, he was really young when he started out. You know, coming from a hip-hop background and then going on into more house stuff. So he was really out there. And I mean, we haven't heard so much of him recently, but I'm sure he'll come back and submerge and give us great music. And then recently I've been working a lot with Tom Trago, also coming from a hip-hop background. And then partly being inspired by Rush Hour, going more into a house direction. He came out with his Voyage Direct project about, was it last year or two years ago, where he is sort of... his quest into disco and house and stuff. Currently we're working on his new album which comprises all of his musical tastes. So it's a more diverse album. But he's really creating his own sound now. This album will really be... creating a signature sound so I'm really excited about that. So you said you told me earlier that you're you've kind of stepped back from the day to day operations of the business and you're pretty much focusing just on A&R. What I'm just curious to know back on the reissues topic again What proportion of that is sourcing the rare stuff that you love and what proportion of it is finding new artists? I mean, going back to the days before the label as a store, the way we started out was... The reason why we started the store was we were trying to... fill a void that was left behind by the stores of Amsterdam at the time because in the late 90s house music got really commercial. And I think Holland is famous for its trance music and its progressive music and its handbag house, which is like a commercial house. And a lot of the stores had labels and so they were really going that direction. The music we loved was the music from Detroit, Chicago, New York. Also some stuff from England, some stuff from Germany. And also some stuff from Holland, because in the early 90s you had a really vibrant techno movement here. I mean, Holland was really leading in the early 90s. But that all sort of died down a little bit. was overtaken by the more commercial aspect of things. So all those stores started selling what was selling easy, which was that sound that we didn't really appreciate. So as a store, we were, like I just said, trying to fill that void and bring in the releases that sort of were being ignored by these other stores. And that was... new music as well as old music. There was a lot of older music that never was available here or wasn't really picked up on. So in the store we were trying to offer the music we thought is good, quality music. I mean it's a subjective thing but we didn't really care about it being new or old. That approach I also put forth. towards the label business. So maybe next year it's 50/50, I don't know, and then maybe after that we'll go full stop into the future. But I mean, we also created a series called Direct Current, which is a sort of series on Rush Hour, which... reflects on all the new hybrids that are going on. In the 80s you had post-punk, I think now you have this interesting scene, I'll call it post-dubstep. Young kids who, when they were even younger, were listening to dubstep, like I was listening to rave when I was younger, and are now becoming a bit older and trying to... mix that sort of dubstep way of producing with more classic house and techno. So it's four floor but with a new feel or new approach of programming beats and stuff. So we have people like Fawlty DL and Cosmic TRG. We're also doing a release with Hyde Park and I've got this new guy from New York, Policy, who will be releasing some stuff next year and this guy called Benjamin. New guys who are sort of offering something that is new but also... has its traditions, its roots in what was already there. So I really appreciate that mix between new and old. In the time that you've had the shop and you've been up... operating within the Amsterdam scene. What are the things that you're excited about, particularly in the city, and what are the things that are maybe changing that you miss? - Let me start with things that I miss, but that's also maybe because I'm growing a little older and there's always things you get a bit moody on or whatever. I grew up in the 90s when I started going out. Like I told you earlier, Amsterdam is becoming a bit more strict and less experimental. Whenever a city develops economically, there's less room for creativity in a way. But having said that, I mean, creativity can also adapt to its surroundings. I mean, luckily so, because then, you know, there's always progression, right? Fortunately, so... But I do miss the sort of... experimentalism and the sort of fire that was there in the earlier days and seems that it's all a bit more you know pre-programmed and you know sort of calculated a bit more but there are still young people coming up and doing things out of that early drive. So there is new stuff happening in Amsterdam, for sure. And what about on the kind of record store level? I mean, I'm sure after 13 years you've seen a lot of changes. What does the landscape look like now for Music Retail in Amsterdam? In Amsterdam? Well, I mean there's only a few stores left. There's us. There's us and there's us. There is one store which is a one-stop for all genres of music, which has been around since the 60s, Concerto. They're still around. I think they do well because they know their crowd and have a very wide selection of music. I think. There is a store that's called Distortion which is really focusing on indie music. But other than that, there's not a lot happening. Which is, for us, it's a good thing and a bad thing. Whenever a business side of things is in decay, it's a sign. And that's not a good sign. Because then it means that culture is dying out a little bit, in this case vinyl culture. On the other hand, without having it planned we've become a bit of a monopolist. So a lot of people that are still buying records or CDs, they have no other option. but to God to us. So in that sense, it's good. But of course, there's plenty of... mail orders around and I'm sure there's a lot of local people who are buying their music from abroad through mail orders or whatever. But if you want my thoughts on the future, I think there's going to be maybe a handful, say ten, maybe two handfuls, maybe three handfuls. of institutions if you will, worldwide that will be surfing this niche quote-unquote market. And that will be companies like ourselves who are A a store, B a label and C a distribution. and they eventually will divide the global pie. And who do you think those other remaining outlets are going to be? aside from Russia? Let's see, let's make a short list. Well, in Holland other than us there's KLON and they have their own sound. There's Hardworks in Berlin. I like what Soul Jazz is doing. They have their store, Soul of the Universe, and their label, Soul Jazz. Who else is there? What are they called? They do these 14 tracks. Boomcat. Boomcat, yeah. Because there are people like us. really trade of you know gut and and um and uh and instinct and and whatnot they're they're not there for i mean they have a business everybody who has a business has to you know do business in order to survive but they their approach is really for the love of music yeah so You think that the future of shops like yourselves and Hardwax and Boomcat, that curational aspect of it... Yeah, curators, that's a good word. You feel that there's optimism there? Yeah, for sure. Because they are the ones who will actually inspire people. And as long as you can inspire people, there's always room for you to... be there, you know, to fulfill a place in society, if you will. And if you do it well enough, you can create a business out of it for yourself. So, I mean, we talked about this earlier, but you have your Junos and your Beatports and your iTunes. But they're, I mean, they're doing a great job, but they're sort of more of a... Or like I said, more of a supermarket. And it's like we offer everything. And it's up for grabs and you can buy whatever you want with us, you know. And they're trying to become more editorial and, you know. try to promote certain things within their ever-growing database of music. But it's more like a convenience store. Their strength is to offer everything. So, I mean, that's good. they're definitely fulfilling in you. But I think it's important that both coexist. . you
