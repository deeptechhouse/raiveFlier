You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour! This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour, RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. I'm Martha, producer of The Hour, here to guide you through this month's episode. So on the show this month, you will hear my conversation with Alberto Guarini, also known as Gabba Eleganza. We discuss the importance of archiving, the aesthetic of hardcore and the construction of his live show. First up, though, I'm handing over to RA contributor Gabriel Satin, who spent some time interviewing the minds behind the film, A Sonic Pulse. A sonic pulse follows three people with varying levels of hearing impairment as they navigate making music and absorbing music in live environments. Gabriel is partially deaf as a result of noise exposure in his teenage years. He speaks to the filmmaker Dorothy Allen-Picard and director Antoine Maronneau, who is also hearing impaired. They discuss the challenges of representing deafness on screen, as well as their personal experiences and the wider trends of discrimination facing the deaf community. I'm Dorothy and I'm a filmmaker. So we made a short documentary called A Sonic Pulse which looks at how deaf people experience electronic music. I'm Antoine. I'm a graphic designer originally and we've been working on this one for the first time as a director. I think for this one we wanted to sort of step away from the classic, sort of classic scene, like music scene or geographical scene of electronic music, to focus on something which has a different stand, a different view. People experience music in more this. Originally it came from first my deafness, which is obviously a sort of awareness towards these kind of issues. sound and perception of music and also this very nice exhibition that I saw once at like installation video installation at the V&A which was called tonotopia or something it was about people experiencing sound in general after having their cochlear fitted or something the person was explaining her experience of going through a festival which was Field Day and having a failure in her equipment and experiencing music and the whole event without perceiving any music and therefore focusing much more on visuals and the crowd and emotions and I thought it was really It's interesting, I've actually had that experience a few times, which we can get onto in a minute, but we should really focus on you first. Tell us about your experience. It might be, sorry? I want to hear your experience. They're varied and weird, but they also kind of, quite like the film, they end with a weird sense of understanding and knowing. I'm quite at ease when it happens. Now that I've gone through it once or twice, it puts me like... in a state of almost like you've got to roll with the punches. Like if something's happened to my ears at a festival or if I'm on the job, I can't really write about it and it's happened a few times. So I just have to see it as, well, this is going to be a half day where my senses are completely out of whack. So I might as well kind of go through the motions with it and enjoy it rather than like being scared of it. We'll get onto that in a minute. What happened to your ears? I'd lost my entire high end overnight when I was 19. So I have lyrics built in hearing aids that I toggle with a... magnet which means that I can like deliberately turn my ears off at festivals which is really fun to do sometimes especially if people are a little gone throughout the day and everyone's chatting in my ear I literally just shut them out and focus on the music instead which is why I'm doing this interview with you but You've got firstly a deep knowledge of electronic music and also an uncommon hearing problem and I wondered a if that was genetic from birth or if that developed and b how your taste in music might have changed as you kind of got into this second stage mode where your hearing was not as it was. I had an accident when I was 21 and I lost almost completely the left. Yeah, like the... I believe... Hearing. Yeah, hearing from the left, yeah. Which actually doesn't really affect much my experience of music. Since, I mean, before doing this documentary, maybe I wasn't aware of it. that much but now maybe I'll maybe focus more or try to be a bit more sensitive to what I'm actually feeling rather than just hearing but I think I still have a very like a very normally functioning hearing on the other side which means I've never really focused that much on this disability or this hearing loss that much. Did you listen to electronic music before you were 21? Yeah, I was. I mean, actually, I had an accident after going out in the club. So I was definitely partying right before having this accident and losing my ear. So yeah, I was very into music before and I'm still, what actually makes me think now is I'm definitely much more aware of the fragility of hearing and I'm definitely more, you know, I value it more and I guess I got a better understanding on how to preserve my ear and make sure that I want to keep this. gem for as long as I can. When you two were conducting interviews for the film, how did that awareness of the fragility kind of manifest and how did it grow? Were you speaking to dozens of people or was it just the three protagonists that we see on screen? Were they the ones guiding you and how it meant to have like a sensory experience rather than a hearing experience? Do you have a wide cast net or just zone in on them? So we just had the three and we actually found them really randomly and it's one of those things that you look back on and you're like that actually worked really really well because it's very different experiences. So the three interviewees, Helen Oakley has a cochlea and started severely losing her hearing when she was 19 and quite soon after that got a cochlear implant. One of the first times she made music was she had the cochlear turned on so suddenly your whole hearing kind of changes and you get it essentially updated so then again you hear it, you know, it's constantly changing the way you hear. heard a thunderstorm on this kind of she was in the attic loft room heard the thunderstorm and it you know it's like surround sound all these different frequencies and really atmospheric and she started making electronic music in response to that and you can kind of imagine why she was drawn to electronic music as a way of in some way mirroring it and then troy lee so we i just i put a thing out on instagram or something saying we're doing this um i think i was actually looking for crew but then my friend rain's mum messaged me being like i just met this amazing woman helen and found what she had to say fascinating speak with her. So that was Helen. And she, Helen was kind of very open to having any conversation and I don't feel like she particularly tried to direct it in one way or another. Troy however is, he's kind of like the core of the Deaf Rave community so he runs and organises this night, Deaf Rave. It was actually really interesting because I was going to ask them all similar questions and before we went to do the interview, he basically said, this isn't going to be another interview about how is it that you hear music, you're deaf, you know, he gets asked these questions and does these kind of quite generic interviews all the time and it just becomes an emotional element. It's kind of an interesting thing of like, but you can't hear and music is based on hearing, how does it work? Like, yeah, I can imagine he's probably sick of that over 15 years. plus years of running it, it seems like a dinner party thing that you should get out of the way or maybe just like... had the foresight not to ask a deaf person that. Yeah. And so he, and I wasn't going to ask him that, but the way that he, he also said, I don't want to talk about deaf politics, which I actually didn't know much about, but you know, which he eventually did. Yeah. Which actually in the end he spoke loads about, but so he, before we sat down for the interview, you just in our little exchange I was like okay he's been any obvious question that comes into my head scrap that anything that feels too basic and actually make it much more about his specific taste in music and how his experience of growing up in Hackney has made that so diverse and yeah center it on something very personal but I was it was one of those things where I was like I really want this to be an interesting and kind of fruitful experience for him and I hope he walks away with something, you know, with with something valuable, but he might not. This might just be a generic thing. And actually, he's responded really, really positively to the film and loves it. And at the end of the day was like, that was wicked. Thanks, guys. And then Richard France, who's the other guy, he I mean, I could ask him, like, how are you? And he would come up with the most elaborate. like bonkers amazing imaginative response. He's just like... He's the older man. He's the older guy, yeah. He certainly seemed to be more, if not more articulate, his answers, as you say, were more kind of like spawning all across the map. It was Troy definitely, but by proxy of being like a... flag bearer for the deaf community has his set answers and then obviously because he has to represent people it would fall on him if he was misrepresenting them whereas the other two definitely felt a little less scripted and maybe a bit more charismatic in that way they came across it was also it's interesting when you're for those listening to the podcast who may not have watched it You can listen to it without subtitles and it is naturally subtitled but the difference in speech is there's like a massive fall off which is really interesting. I don't know whether that came up in your interviews but articulation is something that people that are born deaf struggle with massively because they have no perception of what speech sounds like. in the same way that normal people do. And I found that interesting that you had two people who were rather articulate and then a third who was speaking much more laboured. Which was Richard's. I don't know whether that's just... Yeah. Well, Troy said that his mum used to pray every single time he would... Mispronounce isn't even a word because it's just a different pronunciation, right? But every time he would... I think he was just having two hours every single day, two hours of pronunciation work with her mum because she knew how important it was for him to be in both worlds, even though you are never part of both worlds at the same time, but you can still be. And that's actually what we found out about Helen, the fact that she was... hearing before fully means that she speaks quite perfectly and therefore she doesn't she never really felt the need to actually and that's that's deafness deaf politics she never felt the need to actually learn sign language and therefore When she became deaf, she wasn't able to communicate with the deaf community in general, but was becoming a bit out of the box from the general, not the general, but the hearing community, so she ended up being a bit halfway in between. There's a part where they speak about not being let into a pub because they're using sign language in the queue. and that that denigration is felt more keenly and that kind of spurred Troy Lee, I think, on to form something to serve the deaf community. And that might not be held by someone with only partially damaged hearing because they're not using sign language in the same way. You need to create space and community on your own. to compensate the fact that you are not a part of something else, I guess. So I guess your level of disability in that sense makes you more in need to actually be implicated. Implicated? Involved. Yeah. And it's definitely about visibility, I think. That thing of passing or not passing. I found some of Troy Lee's experiences, and I was reading up on him, interesting because he speaks about walking around his local town, listening to Public Enemy cassettes when he's 14, and speaks about that kind of like... Eureka moment of going to a rave and having that sliding doors in his life where after that nothing was the same and that was the experience you want to hold on to and those kind of things are familiar to millions. And it shows that his hearing is not an impediment to sharing those experiences of having a life altered at a rave. But he was lucky enough to have that. And I think when he saw more and more people of his kind shut out, he felt that like spur to widen the access for them so that they wouldn't be denied what he was lucky enough to have as a child, which is quite a noble thing to do. Obviously, it's just life's work, but you do often need that one person to spur on the start of progress. Otherwise, people just kind of get stuck in a rut. And there will be architects, there will be club programmers and people who run spaces, you know, even in London, in any city, where they're not thinking about making that space accessible. It wouldn't even be on people's radars, how do we make a social space such as a club accessible for deaf people? And I think even in, yeah, Troy's doing an amazing job of raising awareness around that and actually... It's this idea that you're only as disabled as your environment makes you is so crucial. Potentially there are lots of interesting ways in which you can actually change the architecture or the function of a club so that it is fully accessible for everyone and everyone can experience it. a statistic the Guardian had last year saying that in the UK's live music consensus in February, this will be February 2018, found that only 30% of surveyed venues had dedicated disabled actors. areas and only 7% had a policy to provide PA for people that are hearing impaired yet there's been a 70% rise in disabled access ticket sales in 2016 to 2017 so it feels like the two lines on a graph are overlapping slightly and that obviously needs a correction so that they dovetail together. access is available for all rather than it being seen as a venue. Often I feel the venues only subject to pressure when they have to, when there's been a public outcry, where there's been one case that has been... really shameful and then they get their act into gear where it should be really them taking progressive approaches to make sure that no one's excluded in the same way. I think we had that with actually on a different topic but all different level we had that with the festival that have shown how film and during the screening the film other film during the night weren't subtitled. which means that we were tackling a subject about accessibility to something, or to sound, or to film, and the other films were not accessible to the people that we have been involving in the project, and I found that. quite surprising and that shows that even organisations with the best will can sometimes don't have that. A blind spot for that kind of thing. Yeah, definitely. And it always, you know, the thing is it always falls to deaf people to constantly, or disabled people in general, to be talking about. accessibility when actually it's something that we should all be aware of and because that in itself is you know it's long every time you meet someone or go somewhere to have to be like have you thought of this this that do you tick these boxes I think for music in general based on our research and stuff there's been a lot of improvement as you said in terms of accessibility and new new exploration for for giving access to people through a different spectrum of equipment whether it's the the jackets like the vibrational jacket or lighting systems that actually make you feel the music or perceive the music differently than just by hearing it so i think and and just like live bsl with with live music and i don't know if you can actually do that for electronic music if there is no lyrics but maybe maybe there is a way and so they are like there are still loads of new um Yeah, new... Kind of inventions. Inventions and just like, yeah, raising awareness and therefore technological responses to that. Dorothy, when it comes to bringing these quite tangible and human concerns about like sensory feeling of sound and vibrations, when it comes to portraying that on a screen, How do you go about it? Because your work, especially The Mess, which is great, which for those who are listening to this, I encourage you to see, articulated by polarity. by way of someone's life falling down and then kind of raising back up. But this is something completely different because bipolarity is rooted in emotions and perceptions, whereas here we're in a sensory realm where people are often denied an entire sense. I don't know how you can get that across on a screen in six or seven minutes. Kind of why I love film though is because you can break down all of the different senses. So it's obviously visual and the visuals move. So it's a time-based medium. And then there's sound, which has dialogue, but also you break it down in sound design. And then also the score. There's like so many. So that's like all these different elements that are deconstructed. And I guess if you break it down in terms of human, how you experience sound or music, you think about all of the different senses. So feeling and the vibrational thing and the sound and how you might visualize that. And one really, I mean, I think it came to us straight away, the idea, quite an obvious visualization of... of sound and frequencies and sort of beats is through the semantics so I thought it was particularly effective with the water it just looked really good but we spent four hours shooting sand and it didn't work that well. Oh right, sand, yeah. We spent like ten hours in a room in our living room which we turned into a little studio, blocked out the windows put some lights so it got really hot. And we just slightly lost the plot watching sand bounce and filming it on 16mm and on digital. And we have something like... five hours of that. But the semantics with water and with different grains and different elements is just this amazing visualisation through patterns of frequencies and it's really fun to play with that and so we wanted the musical score to... relate to these visualisations we created. I think the sound was very important and actually listening to Richard's friends music you probably haven't came came across his music but it's really experimental and really he captured some environment and tweaked them and distilled them and created a whole new realm of music and sound and I think listening to his music was very important and made us feel like the need to connect his approach to music and his creation to a more abstract visuals. and therefore very close up, you know, semantic close up and juggling between the two or actually echoing the two together. But the sound was very important in that sense, I guess. And yeah, I just wanted to make it the more immersive possible. And his ambient noise and sound is really strong for that. actually goes very well with the close-up when it gets a bit less obvious that it's actually patterns forming or water moving, but sometimes it's just bubbles and some, you know, and the edit was also very important to make it even more abstract and more... What I thought was interesting, I think it's in the first minute or maybe the second, when you go to people with instruments and a sound speaker, and the first thing we hear is such a common... phrase when a DJ is clanging a mix of a galloping horse and the fact that that was transmittable just through the air vibrations is incredible to me that that is a reference point that I slip into conversation five or six times a week when out of a club and the fact that that's transmutable through air shows that really there isn't that much difference between having full hearing and no hearing when you have like a the perceptiveness to reach the kind of analogies and similes in that way it immediately broke down the barrier and she doesn't need to hear that at all she can feel it it was a really like nice way to bed into those people's worlds very quickly so well done I guess The other thing I really liked when we had the group shot is the close-up on people's fingers because so much of the film is rooted in sign language, which the average viewer probably isn't going to see day-to-day on the street. And you had a lot of hands moving in correlation with the speech and then close-up of people's fingertips touching instruments. It felt very tactile and intimate and personal. Yeah, it was nice. Thank you. Yeah, the music workshop was also like one way of just breaking down. So it's basically finding a group of deaf people who don't know that much about music and haven't created music before. So we're doing it in this very responsive and kind of open way and talking about their experience. That felt like a really good way of, rather than saying to a deaf person, how do you experience music? getting them to experience music and learn about it and create it themselves and so us as an audience, they don't have to explain it verbally or whatever, but us as an audience can just, you know, can just kind of follow that learning process and what it is when you break down music and put it back up and really feel it. I think it's also a way to involve people who otherwise wouldn't feel very legitimate. to talk about or to be involved in music because the first question she asked during the workshop which is not in the edit is what's your experience about music and everybody's sort of almost awkwardly embarrassed because no one has ever had an experience and whether it's creating music or listening to music that much so I guess it was a very important thing as well to implicate like to involve people who don't really relate to music in that sense. It's something that I guess is a correlated effect of... being lost in one's own head, especially if you have impaired or fully deaf hearing, that you are by proxy really isolated from the world outside, both in the macro and the micro. You lack the ability to communicate in an unlaboured way with someone. In a show off on the tube, it creates a natural barrier. And I thought that the community aspect... of raving was probably the most important takeaway I had from the short. I've read another statistic about depression rates and deaf people being extremely high because of that isolating factor. And so as well as there being this kind of smile-inducing takeaway that you're seeing people experience music in a way other than their own or adding an extra sensory... heft to it. You've got a sense that these community events are vital because they provide human interaction which is often denied to people. Such a common trope of when you talk about raving altogether, and that's something that we probably all take for granted, that you don't need a rave to hang out with friends or be kind of in concert with other people and their bodies and their emotions. But a space that is swamped with sounds, swamped with vibrations, for these people, really is like the absolute... best place that they can experience those connections which should drive the government or civic bodies to create more of them because you probably could break a lot of the pressure of even suicidal rates amongst deaf people simply by getting them all in one place and giving them a good time. And also breaking the boundaries between the two worlds as well and Troy was talking about building bridges between communities and that's actually one footage it's a subtitle, it's like an archival footage. from Death Rave and the guy is I think he's saying we are all partying together in here and I think it's really important as well that you know those spaces and music is here as well to make that happen like you know building bridges between death world and hearing world. And it's interesting how the moment music has lyrics or even we use dialogue we think of that as you know the form of communication that brings us together and actually it's not actually like the common language that we all do speak feel know is actually like a musical one and one that's I guess much more kind of I want to avoid using the word pure but just really basic like fundamental a thing about yeah about particles and the way that we actually feel sounds and how music brings people together across boundaries of hearing non-hearing *Dramatic music* Thanks to Gabriel, Dorothy and Antoine for sharing their insight. You can take in the film A Sonic Pulse at residentadvisor.net where you can also find a transcription of that interview. Gabba Eleganza started out as a blog and has grown to encompass a research platform, live performance and even a book celebrating hardcore culture. I sat down with the artist behind the alias, Alberto Guarini, earlier this year at the LNCC store. Today I'll be spending some time getting to know an artist, a DJ, a live performer, a curator. Hello, Alberto. Ciao. So you're also known as Gabo Eleganza. Yeah. Thank you for spending some time with us this evening. Thank you. You grew up in Italy. I want to know what is your earliest music memory? I think some just cartoon stuff. I think Mary Poppins was a five. This is my first. But if you think about rave music, I think I was 10. Some cozy tape from like a bootleg of a bootleg of a bootleg tape passed by hand by hand, you know, old style stuff. The first time that I listened to high BPM stuff was on the Daily Food Market. A style that was selling music bootleg and I was 10, I think. And it was hardcore on the speakers during the day with the old lady buying chicken and fresh fruits, something like that. And I was 10. I was 96. These ones are the first memories about music, rave music also. Okay. So with that first memory about rave music, what was it that stood out to you in those sounds? What were you drawn to? Of course, the rhythm. It was like something that was very alien, especially if you're 10, you come from a countryside, nothing to do. You spend time in the afternoon listening to Norman Standard Radio. One day after you're jumping in this world of alien music, it's completely out of your world. The only thing that I remember was this kind of frenetic beat that brings me into another level. So that's probably the pill that's actually never left me. So from being 10 years old all the way through to 2011 and starting Gabriella Ganzo as a blog, What was your relationship to hardcore music from that period? In Italy, maybe the rave scene, as we think about a commercial rave scene, never exploded, like in the UK or in Germany or in Benelux. but was something similar to relate to club, to the big discotheque. We have probably the most number of discotheques in all Europe and the biggest architecture stuff, you know, thousands of people capacity, something like that. So there was a moment that hardcore was already into the big clubs. in Italy, especially close to my area, Bergamo and Brescia, in the north Italy, Lombardy. When you grow up in that place, the only two kind of music you can grow up, hardcore and metal, actually. So it was like working class music in that area. After a year, when I started to go to college, I discovered Gabbers. That, for me, wasn't another, I never heard about. I was already listening to hardcore, but... Gabba style arrived later to me and was a new alien thing to approach because hardcore style and aesthetic for young kids or the tribe was very flesh, very fluid and wasn't style for me. So when I saw the first Gabba on the street, for me it was, okay, another alien, I like it. So it was completely different and out of world. So that was around 2000, in the moment of, you know, the big crisis of rave music and the rave system. So I started to dig in so much. in this kind of tribe and style because it was for me a way of life, of course. When you are young and you discover your tribe, you do everything for them, you know. It's passionate. I think it's a dedication, like every kind of street subculture. And in that moment for me was to discover the original sound of hardcore. So I discovered Gabber Static. in the 2000, 2001, but for me was looking into the past. because it was already a big stuff in Holland in the mid of 19. So I was listen old hardcore in the early 2000s. So I was already listen ghost, already archivist, something like that in really natural way. And so just the passion remain and in organic ways it's become this project that I have now. So it's called Gabriela Gans. Were you going raving as well? Yeah, yeah, of course. It wasn't proper rave like in UK style, but it was like a big discotheque. It was a number one club. It's still open in activity. It was Florida. It's also still, you know, this kind of big place with a big room. You can find one room, it was trance, one hard trance, one hardcore, something like that. And of course raving when I grow up, that's mostly like a free party. And of course when I become 18, my parents give me possibility to visit and discover Holland. Of course in the Thunderdome, an old big hardcore rave party. And I discover a new world that actually wasn't really me. I preferred like a do-it-yourself and underground style. Holland is like too much well-organized. You understand what I mean? You can lose the feeling of the roughness. When you started Gabriella Ganza, it was like a Tumblr page, a blog. What did it look like? Like a Tumblr infinite scroll. Actually, it's still like that. It's not changed so much, the graphic. I just bought 10 pounds. design page and I still use it actually so now I have my website but there is an archive that actually open a tumblr so I like it so why not you know it's I think it's pragmatic very simple and I'm not so much technologic so for me it's perfect to use it in what way would you say tumblr has impacted your career and your music journey I don't know. For me, it's very, as I said, very organic. I still do. Of course, now is my job. But back in the days, I still do archive because I feel it. I feel it just because I feel it. I do whatever I want to do. So if I want to tomorrow stop the blog. I will stop the blog because I don't need to say nothing else. I still have this kind of ungriness to say, okay, there is something that we can discover, we can talk about, we can show to the people. I open for... revaluated and misunderstanding between hardcore rave and GABA culture, GABA subculture, and post-rave phenomenon that sometimes, you know, they use like not serious things. Let's try to push in another level that is not just about a cliche and music. Let's try to use like a UK rave culture, bring rave in all kind of genre and spectra in the new dimension. It is not just about music or Yacht Phenomenon, but let's try to push. outer boundaries. That could be art, that could be social environment phenomenon, and that could be, of course, music, but in a progressive way, in a new way. Just use something that we have from the past and we use it to describe and to create something new. So was that kind of your intention when you started the blog? No, no, no, no, no. It was very naive at the start, just sharing stuff that I like. Of course, in not a very serious way. Of course, the name also is not like the most serious and pretentious name, of course, is a bit funny name, of course, not a paradox. So they started a little bit like very naive, very natural. Maybe it's better, very natural. to use a picture that I collected, and I still collect it in digital and physical archive. to publish material that nobody sees. Because in the past, it was very frustrating to check in on Google. And if you're looking for gabbers, you have this kind of cliche with bell heads that do it like tongue out of tongue. And, you know, it's just so much, I think, I respect because I discovered a side. like an insider that other people can understand. So I try to push stuff that nobody saw it, mixing. video and material from artists that maybe work with the gaba subculture or rave subculture so that's the idea to open to not just relate only hardcore stuff so the idea of hardcore continuum to use all UK stuff also in the moment that I discovered Ewan Spencer's stuff and now we made a book together So for me, connect me to the new world. So I was very open, no boundaries, just publish whatever I want. We'll get onto the book soon, but what was it about the visual side of kind of hardcore culture, like the aesthetic? What is it that stands out to you about that? Why are you drawn to that? You know, when you grow up with something, when you have a teen, you start to be a part of subculture. This kind of thing remains with you forever because it was a part of your life for a few years, especially in the years where you're growing up. So stay with you. And I think that's... you know, the hardcore aesthetic is very close to metal and a side of hardcore is also close to punk aesthetic, do-it-yourself, but of course the mostly one is very like horror movie, monsters, powerful, you know, what's very, very shocking aesthetic. That's, of course, when you have 14, 15, it's the only things that you're looking for. for a male in Italy, was very attractive, of course, because it was like discovering a new world. It was a mixing of comics aesthetic with horror movie and all this kind of name, Hellraisers, Nightmare in Rotterdam, Thunderdome, Stormcore, you know, was pretty charming. And back in the days was very... And now probably, you know, people are still looking to something that is pretty exotic, especially in the world and the world of now that everything is very policy and polite. You pay very attention to what you say. It's kind of aggressive. clean aggressive is still charming for people, especially the people that work with visual, of course. So I try to push the visual side because a lot of other forums talk about music side, so nobody uses the visual side. For me, it was... not like a strategy just because I liked it. I collected the visual side of the things, posters. I'm not a collector, but I try to just collect the things that I like it. And so the Charming Things was this kind of very colorful world, but the same times was a labyrinth of nightmares. with the candy at the corner, something like that. So it's like a video game, actually. It sounds like being in a video game, the hardcore aesthetic. And as the site grew, what percentage or what balance would you say it was, like an archive versus like a documentation of more the social side of culture? Archive is the biggest part, but of course with your archive and your direction you can push the sensitive of the people to understand there is something more. I'm not an archivist because sometimes a guy told me that if you are a real archivist, you need to show everything, also the bad things of a scene. That's actually what archivists do. You can do everything. Actually, so I'm starting to talk about the Tumblr also is like an artist curator archive. It's more than just an archive because... I just selected what I want and remixing in my own way to push my vision. I sort of, you know, how's Mark Leckie in For Rich Maybe Hardcore, the ghost of the past. That's exactly the same attitude. To use something from the past that was me was very... but remix in my own way. So sometimes people call me the ambassador of Gabber and say, come on, that's very ridiculous. Because it's not true. I just talk my vision that is very different to the vision. That is just someone that remix in something and they do it their own. So that's, I think, the biggest percentage is archive, of course, but it's most like related to visual, graphic and arts. But this kind of sensitivity can push people to understand also the social environment because if you show... For example, I work at and I show a lot of posts about an artist called Filippo Minelli in Italy with this project called Padania Classi. Padania is the north side of Italy. It's a field that's come from Milan to Venice. And you have this long highway. It's the most polluted. area in Europe, one of the biggest in the world from Milan to Venice and is the richest part of Italy and you have most polluted, most industrial environment and on highway for 30 kilometers you can see only warehouse and work, work, work, work, work, you know, this kind of environment I grew up there. So I show my environment through another artist. Of course, it's not really too hardcore. But in this way, you put another ingredient to the story. It's not like a social text because I'm not good to... Sorry, my English maybe is not the best one. But I'm not good also to write. I'm not good. So I work with the visual and with the music. So I use also other stuff like a curator to show also the social side of the phenomenon. Well, you built something up from a Tumblr page to like a respected curatorial body. How important is it to you to be in the world? of like art and exhibitions and galleries it's not the world that i'm looking for but of course it's fascinating and i met a lot of people that i respect and it's not my environment i'm feeling more like a musician like more like a dj this is like my natural place But of course, I think that this kind of sensitive, that's cool work also with art. So I'm very open to discover it. I'm a very open mind. So everything is not like, as I told, organic. So if I can work with the artwork, I'm very open. It's not door closed for me. So it's not that I'm looking for. I feel more comfortable in the music because it's just what I like to do. But why not? So I'm open. Well, we'll talk more about your music later on. But I wanted to ask about... Like the t-shirts and the merchandise that you've created. Why does that come in as an important element to you? It's a natural step also that we'll start like a joke, I think, and become... and become part of the job. You know, as a do-it-yourself project, merchandise is an important thing now for the bands and the artists to support your hearts. You don't sell music anymore, so merchandise helps you to do other stuff. So with the merchandise... I invest money to do book. And that's a step by step, you know, do yourself style things. You know, I'm an independent, so I work alone. And merchandise start very, as I say, like a joke and become part now of the project. And now it's become a sort of another binary that can evolve in other things. I'm starting to work also with a designer. Jewelry is a top secret project. But for a unique piece, you know, I'm starting to work very open-minded. I don't want to be like just the guy that talk about Gabber, you know. So I use this one to remix my work and still remix my work. I'm still continued. I'm not just stepping in these things. Would you describe for us your favorite piece of merchandise that you've made? It's a patch that's never going out, made on butcher PVC with a picture that we want to use on the bomber jacket, but it was so hard to fix it. It's a prototype. Actually, I like all the t-shirts that I made. I like all the designs. There is no one that I'm ashamed of, no one that I love, because it's come from me. I like everything. I'm proud of everything that I made. Also, the things that don't sell it or are the ones that sell so much. I'm still proud of everything that I made. You love them all equally. Yeah, exactly. Okay, let's get into talking about the book. So it's called Hardcore Soul, came out this year. Why did you want to do a book? Because it was a moment to do a new step and it was the moment to open a label, Never Sleep. And that's with my heritage. in the do-it-yourself world that was already published, a lot of fancy, was a natural step to do a book. So the idea is to open a multimedia label doing book and publication and music. So the first thing is, what, let's do a book. For me, it's more easy to do records. And so I made a book with a collaboration of a photographer, a UK photographer, Ewan Spencer. And I proposed to him to do a sort of curatorial project, not just a picture, just let's mix two unpublished stuff from Happy Heart or Scene. and Northern Seoul, Seoul we can understand in the UK. And so the idea is to create this kind of coexistence of two worlds that look so much different, but actually come from the same roughness and the same social environment and the same attitude and without chronological order. So just mixing the picture. and with additional elements from Jack Mills and Turner Prize Mark Leckie, because he was sort of the father of the whole project, sort of that gave me the seeds to start the things. and with a mixtape by me that I just cut all the kick drum from a happy hardcore sound doing a sort of limbo for 20 minutes of candyness and synthesizers so the idea is to create this kind of limbo the still the idea of the ghost from the past that you can't really touch it it's a little bit like a plasma And so that's the idea. Now we're working on the music. End of the year, next year, I'm going to publish the first EP by a UK artist called Elidziski. So it will be the first EP of the label. And so, of course, now we start. I'm planning a new book next year, probably end of the next year. Only by me. And I want to do also publishing other stuff, material, just like a publisher. And I already plan like a five release from the label. Big plans. So if you do a new book, will you take photos yourself for it? No, no. It's mostly like a creator. It's like a creator stuff, like a blog. Put it, it's more like a researcher. And going back to Hardcore Soul, do you remember the first time that you saw you and Spencer's photos and how did they make you feel when you first saw them? The first one I realized later that was him, was like I think was from the streets. album original paramaterial the inside was like i bought that album like 2005 2006 the vinyl and was him that were playing at the pool and later i discovered so that's the first time but i discovered later but the first time that i published his stuff was 2012 and i saw just picture of ukg i think He was working on some series from old days, or something like that. And I found so much intense picture, but at the same time very respectful. It wasn't a voyeur touch, but was more like, I am the guy that have fun with you, but just make a picture. So everybody look like so much free that I like this kind of vibes. It is not like, you know, give me a pose or there was like just... an outsider invisible eye and that i like that kind of style so that's was the moment like seven six seven six years ago is there a particular photograph that really really speaks to you that is published in the book i love all the all the pictures we know you love everything yeah come on and A couple of pictures I just deleted because it was pretty similar to the other one. I like the happy hardcore black and white, of course. It's not me. But the tree guy with the whistle that I used also for one of the t-shirts, that's pretty good. I made a big one meter from meter in my studio. And there is three guys that look into the camera and one has a whistle. And you can see so much the sweat. You can smell it. And I like this kind of... Because it's real. It's an honest picture, you know? It's not pretentious. I like this kind of honestly. And I think it's very respectful. In that case, it was a little bit posed, but it was very respectful. At the same time, it wasn't a cliche or just, you know, too much. You know, sometimes photographers are looking for the aggressive things. You know, now we call it the beat click because you need to be, you know, shocking people. I like this kind of... respectful as muteness style of his style. And you mentioned Mark Leckie as a sort of godfather of the whole thing. What was it like to work with him on the book? Actually, Ewan worked with him because it's a very busy man, artist. And we chatted, we talked about it. He invited me to NTS to do an interview. So it was a good occasion to spend a couple of hours with him, chilling. We talked about himself, what he does. So for me, he was a legend, a hero. was some you know sometimes when you when you meet one of your hero is not the coolest day of your life because you realize is so normal that's uh that actually is cool at the same time but uh after he was very busy because now he have a he launched an exhibition at Tate in these days actually. So at the start he was doing, I asked him, you can do a preface, but he was too busy with the school and this were, so at the end we decided to work on a dialogue between him and Ewan that they were ready to work on another project. together and I asked them, you need to talk about what is for you dance, just about dance, what you discover dance, why for you is important or you are ashamed to dance, something very personal, like how is the soul, you know, like hardcore soul come from the soul. something that was related to dance, like in the book. The sweatiness, this kind of things. And that's a good interesting point, Howard, from my interview. That's Jack Mills helped me to edit and put into the book. So that is a good point that Mark Leckie talked about. how the Midlands people, especially, you know, classic male working class guy, very rude. That's for the society need to be classic macho. And they discover the dance. So the grateful and the graceful to dancing move. So actually is... they help to discover a new kind of man themselves inside. So actually the dance helped also UK culture to open to other things, to be progressive. And that is a very interesting point. And is that something you felt like you related to as well? Of course. I'm not the good... dancer but you know I'm like it also a bit let's talk about your relationship to DJing so had you DJ'd prior to Gabriella Gunza Before Gabba Eleganza I was already DJing with other moniker but other name was called Pigger on Sofa actually is like lazy boy on sofa that's pretty paradox with Never Sleep and serotonin hardcore sound but It was just a funny name. I don't remember actually what. But I started to buy records when I was 16, 17, hardcore stuff. I just changed, evolved. I discovered Half Extreme that play hardcore in another way. So let's buy the kind of things to try, discover black horror and this kind of genre. Give me this kind of hybrid. that I think I have with Gabba Leganza. People think, okay, Gabba, you play hardcore. It's not really true. Of course, Akecho, I play hardcore, but DJ set. I play whatever I want. It could be techno, could be breakcore, could be jungle, UK, hardcore, continuing stuff. And hardcore, of course, mixing and hybrid, everything. DJing with this name become later, of course, because Lorenzo Sani asked me once, I want to invite you, not as a pigro, but I want to ask you to play music with Gabriele Ganza. And I said, I don't know, I don't know. For me, it was just a side project in my life. And I wasn't really thinking to become a sort of artist project. I said, no, no, you know, when someone encourages you, you say, maybe I have something to say, you know. He said, "We found the best place for you." And Hungar Bikok is like to play a DJ set at the Tate, you know, something like that, for another artist called Karsten Uller. It was a sound clash between Africa and Europe. It was me and an Africa band, a big, you know, 10 elements on the other. It was a sound clash actually. So I say, well, what I can do, me and with the 10 people that dancing, so let's bring some gabbers. So it was a sort of big clash and was the first moment. And I say, that's crazy. I feel it, the energy as in the past. I lost this kind of energy. I refill it now, rely, relieve. Let me take the music when I grow up and remix it after 15 years of new music. So I'm starting to do a DJ set. And is that where the inspiration for the Hacker Show came from? Exactly. It was the first night. Actually, that night was very, very organic. Just say, let's do it something, not planet, and works. Step by step we planned it a bit better. So now we have different dancers. Actually, the hockey show is growing up now and I want to add something new to the hockey show. I call it a performance because it actually is a performance. Bring the dancer. And I play for the dancers. I not play for the crowd. I play because I wanted the people, especially from outside Harko world, that they don't know hake moves. Hake is a classic Dutch gabber's dance move. They can't keep the energy and the sweatness. of this dance so it's a sort of update folklore so let's bring something like you know like a pagan mask you know in stone age something like that let's bring something that was like 20 years ago in the contextualization it's a sort of pay respect of course but sometimes let's keep the new things let's Let's try to push to the new crowd that maybe can take it to some piece and do themselves remix. Mino? I don't know. It's Atom in Milan. I think. Now Mino is one of the is the host of the hockey show. He's a big boy, altitude. Actually he's the only one that is not a true gabber. He's mostly he's a kind of disturber host that I add to the show to jump into the crowd. He's a sort of Keith Fleet rip from the prodigy Italian style. sort of this kind of aggressive looking guy, but he's so much tender and so much sweet. But it's a perfect glue with a little bit of entertainment, wild punk entertainment, we can call it. So what could you expect if you came to see the Haka show? Fast Haka beats. I'm covered. You can see me. I want to be in the shadow. I don't want to be like the characters of the show. You come and you can see dancers. that's going wild because they feel it. All these people are gathered still. raving from young kids from 20 from the old guy from Rotterdam to 32 and they sweat they really sweat on stage and I don't want to do like a fancy because it's not like that the hardcore is a roughness it's very primitive intensity so that's the idea of the hockey show now I'm also working to do a sort of a special act show with a chapter a sort of theater attitude to try to talk about not only about the music but also about the aesthetic and social environment but this is a new chapter that i'm still working on it but this could be the new progression and evolution of a hockey show. As a DJ, how does your approach have to differ playing to a regular crowd and playing to the people that you bring with you on the stage at that show? I usually play for an hybrid crowd. I'm not playing strictly in a hardcore crowd. And I really like to play for naive people because they have not targeted you. They just try to enjoy the music. And I like it because in that moment you can teach something. And I like this kind of DJ needs to be a teacher. I like these kind of things. But sometimes, of course, some hardcore heads come, some gabbers, and I like this kind of clash. And you're about to premiere a new show, a new audiovisual show. How is that different and what can we expect from seeing that? I'm still working. I think there's a lot of work to do, but this could be a new chapter. not just for the hockey show, but probably doing something live with my music. And this could be the first step to doing live for me, actually, because I'm also still working with dancers. I like so much this kind of energy. In the electronic world, from my side, sometimes performance is very boring. The visual side, especially audiovisual, sometimes is very pretentious. And I like... when everything is very simple and very physical. So lasers in a good way, light in a good way, dance moves. I like these kind of things that actually push the boundaries. I like these kind of things. So I think that I really want to work on dancers that could be not only hockey dancers, but could be like professional dancers. And visual, of course, that could be work that's not visual like VJ, but also visual like cinema, more like storytelling. So I have a lot of ideas that I just need to mix. Is it the same for the label over the next few months? Can we expect releases on the way? Yeah, releases. As I said, the first one is from Liziski. And it's an interesting release because it's a mix of post-rave attitude and early days of harsh techno. And I like this kind of analogic experimental side. And so the label have no targets. Of course, we'll be very rave, but in experimental way, not only hardcore related. Hardcore is only the attitude. of the things. It's not only the music. I don't want a category or general definition that defines me because I have already my name that's not helped me. But I'm very open. So it will be mixing of new artists that never release with also reissues. of things that I like it and I'm very glad to work it and that on publication that I will publish on artists that for me were legends. So the idea is to bring the vinyl side of the label. It will be more like an EP concept and DJ, of course, for the DJ and electronic harsh lover. And I want to publish, of course, books. This could be a fanzine or a proper book. And also tapes, that probably will be the funny things, like an edition of 50 that could be like a live recording. I'm working on a project that is a big concept, it's a sort of evolution of Hardcore Soul, where I'm cutting and sampling all the advertising about a Raven hardcore compilation in Italy, in Italian, that nobody can understand. or Italian people, but it's a sort of researching and archive stuff. So this could be published. It's a very multimedia open platform. Yeah, it's amazing how you always have so many different things going on at any one time. It's very impressive. Schizophrenic. Do you have aspirations for more of your own productions? Yeah, that is my low point. I'm not defining myself as a producer. So probably it's easy to say artist because for me, I need to work on the concept of specific things. For the EP that I published on Presto, let's say I need to close this EP with these three tracks. I don't want to work on 10 tracks and I choose three. I really specific. things and concepts. So now I'm working on a revp with a collaboration with a South African guy called HD Mirror that will be published soon. And I work on remixes from the godfather of hardcore, Marco Caripane, The Mover, that will be published next year with Delirio, another Italian guy. And so next year I want to work on my own stuff that could be similar to... I want to do something a little bit more like an abstract, like on Presto. We can call it, I don't know, progressive hardcore or something like that. And so using the hardcore sound, but in a new way. But I want to also still have fun. So let's do some proper rave banger. Well, I feel like we've been brought into the world of Gabriele Ganza. So Alberto, thank you so much. Grazie mille a voi. Thanks to all of our contributors on this month's edition of The Hour and thank you for listening. We're back next time with more documentaries, interviews and discussion. you
