Thank you. You've got a personal problem. Yes, you do. It's just the way you act. And the things you do. It's very obvious to see The way you're treating me With the words you use You're really hurting me You've got a personal problem Yes you do you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling, and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. So on this week's exchange, we have a slice of house music history from Chicago's Mike Dunn. If you know Dunn's work, your mind will probably drift to tracks like So Let It Be House and Freaky MF. But beyond these classics, he has a long history of activity in the Chicago scene. The chat between Don and R.A.'s staff writer Matt McDermott is full of the sort of anecdotes that could only come from a true insider. As Matt mentions in his written intro to the interview, We should feel enormously grateful that guys like Don are still around to share their thoughts and feelings on the origins of this music. You can hear our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.com. and follow us on SoundCloud at r8-exchange. The exchange with Mike Dunn is up next. You really hurt me. You got a personal problem. Yes, you do. And if you keep it up, I'm gonna have to cut you. Yeah. Same old thing, man. Same way. Tripping about nothing. So, Mike, first of all, I wanted to thank you for appearing on R.A.'s Exchange. And, you know, it's a pleasure to have you. It's an honor to have you on the podcast. Oh, thank you, man. Absolutely. I mean, you're bringing a lot of history to the table. I understand you grew up in the south side of Chicago. Yes. That was in the Robert Taylor context. And can you tell me a little bit about your musical life growing up? What was some of the first music you heard in the neighborhood? And I understand your mother was a pretty big influence in terms of records and music as well. Yeah, my dad had a wide musical range. He listened to anything from rock to jazz to blues to... Whatever it was, it was, you know, I just heard everything in the house. But my mom was the one I would always go with her and she would go get the disco version. of songs, like the 12 inches, the extended mixes and things like that. So, you know, my dad, he went shopping alone and brought back whatever. And it was just, you know, like I said, we, he was all over the place with music, you know, from Motown. Chick Corea to, you know, I heard everything in the house. So my mom, that's, I was mama's boy. To put it mildly, I was a mom's boy because. I had five sisters, and I was the only boy, and the eldest of them. But, you know, my mom always kept me around her. We would go shopping, and she would just, you know, the lady would pick out a stack of records, and, you know, she would ask what's new. She'd come back with it. She'd, I like this, I don't like that. So as a kid, you're watching that. But you're also, you know, as a kid, you're a sponge. So I was kind of taking all that in. I was like, yeah, I like, you know. After all these years, I can remember vividly just going in the store with her, you know, as a kid and picking out, you know, watching her pick records out and the type of records she wants. So she kind of instilled in me that disco feel. The stuff that she liked, my dad didn't like. Like, you know, she was going to get the Donna Summers and, you know, the Anita Ward 12-inch ring my bell and all that. So, you know, my mom liked the dancing. My dad was more just chill, laid back. He want to... hear the music in it because we're the only one in the, you know, the projects that really had a top-end system. We had like Bose 901 speakers, the ones that look like... the home plate that you put in the corner had the eight tweeters in the back and the one in front and for the bass and we the revoc reel to reel we had you know we the sansuis and the dinoco amps and i can remember the steel dial i wish i would have kept that But yeah, you know, we had the best system. We lived on the 13th floor. And if my dad turned it up halfway, you could hear it downstairs in the playground clear. I went with him one time to this store, this high-end store that just sold, like, crazy amps and, you know, turntables. had the Gerard turntable, then he switched to the thorn. That part of it, I got from him. But the musical aspect of it, I got from my mom. So it was kind of half and half, like the... technical part of how things are supposed to sound and I got from my dad but my mom was basically she was the music program. It's pretty interesting because so she was buying stuff like Tom Moulton edits and that sort of thing. And then so when you would hear, say, like a Ron Hardy edit, it already made sense to you like what he was doing with the song. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It was, you know, it was like second nature. When I first got into editing, it wasn't. You know, because that's the thing to say. Ron Hardy. That wasn't my case. For me, the person that made me want to edit was Mickey Mix and Oliver from the Hot Mix 5. Because he would chop up records and do things with them that I was like, okay, how's he doing this? Like, I was interested in like Stars on 45, you know, the Big Apple edits and all the things like that. So I've been digging for ages, man. Since before you can remember almost? Yeah. What was the first record that you picked out for yourself? it was Michael Jackson. And it was the Michael album. It had the Dear Michael on there and just one more. One more thing. Yeah, so that for me was my first one because that was the first thing that I could buy with my money. Like the technical end, and this is what I, you know, like all the guys who came up under me and all the guys that still come to me, I'm more so into why it works this way, more so than turning it on. and go, I have to understand why the thing works the way that it works. Because then once you know that, you can basically do anything with it. So like for Christmas, my grandma bought me a... Back in the day, it was called a component set because it was just everything all in one. I took it apart before I even started playing with it. I completely took the turntable up out of the thing, the needle off of it. She was pretty pissed, called my dad, like, this boy done took... So those are the things that I used to get for Christmas, chemistry sets and things. I could tell you some stories about my chemistry. What I used to catch in the house and dissect. So other people that were growing up in Englewood, it was Tyree Cooper as well, and then Hugo Hutchinson. And as a trio. You know, you were producers sort of from a different part of town and almost lifelong friends, like starting to learn about dance music together. Is that correct? Actually, Hugo was the one from a different area when my grandma used to stay with her brother. Because my grandpa passed when I was like maybe two years old. And when he passed, her brother moved with her. So that was my uncle, my Uncle Steve. And when he passed, she was going to be in the house by herself. So they asked all the grandkids who wanted to go over there and stay with. I chose to go over there and stay with her. So that's how I moved to Englewood, because we were actually living on 55th South Side at the time. And then, you know, we were gone from. Robert Taylors by the time that, you know, like my second year of high school, we were gone from. Robert Taylor's. So I moved with my grandmother and she was in Englewood. And then that's when I met Tyree and everybody like that. Hugo was from 43rd. He was over that way. How he and Tyree met is through KKC radio. and doing parties like that. And then Ty would bring him around, and then I got to meet Hugo. You know, we became friends through Tyreek. And were you involved in the radio station as well? This is sort of early, mid-80s. You were beginning to DJ right then? Yeah, well, I've always been a street guy, in the streets with it. Hugo was on KKC, and Tyree would do guest mixes. I ended up doing some guest mixes on there. I would do this thing every week called the courtyard. And at first we were doing it in Ogden Park, which is on the south side of Inglewood. And we were doing things there. I was doing some DJing for my friend King George. And he couldn't mix, but he had all the equipment and everything. And he saw me and I was mixing. He was like, man. I want you to come play with me at parties and things like that. So that's basically how I started doing that. And we would do this thing every week called the courtyard. And the courtyard was actually the rec center of a church called St. Stephen's, and it was right across the street. So every week we did a party there with Mr. Raven, Miss Raven. And we would do, you know, just never know where your blessings come from because that tuned me into being a resident DJ. you know I got to like the warehouse and things like that I already knew how to play a whole night without running out of stuff to play like most DJs you know Now they don't have residencies, so they're basically hired to spend an hour or two hours. So they come in and play all the best stuff, and basically if it goes past two hours, some, not all, if it goes past two hours, then it gets kind of shaky there. And what were those initial parties like? What were you dropping then? A lot of the stuff that I was making, I mean, it's crazy. People call me today. You know, I do a radio show on Soul. That's one of the other stations in Chicago. It's like we have two. Like one is the other station, and then it's us. So they called in. Oh, Mike, I remember you, man. I remember you used to walk in the party with two reel-to-reels, and I know they're not lying because I used to walk in the party with two bags with two Pioneer 707s in the back. So I was going from back to forth, from edit to my tracks, from edits to my, you know, we couldn't afford acetates and things like that back then. So we was just putting the stuff on a cassette deck and bringing them in with the pitch. That's how it started at first for me. It was just the pitch decks. At first, it wasn't a pitch on the deck. It was just like. Okay, speed the record up to where you know the track's going to be and then just bring the song in. But then when they started coming out with the pitch decks, then we pitch decked and then the reel-to-reels came in last after we saw Frankie and Ronnie playing with the reels. It's just much easier. It's just like a record, just rocking it back and forth. pausing it, bringing it in. That's why our intros to tracks were so long. when we were putting them out is because we were making up the time that we could get the track in on a pitch deck. And then about time we caught up and got it in, those eight beats would be, you know, those eight bars would be gone. And now you're bringing it in like you really want to bring it in. And that's why when you hit tracks and we got long intros and the kick just going for a long time and then it finally started coming in, that's why those things were done like that. You were making edits and you were making your own tracks, but was it more about rocking the party as a DJ? Were you thinking about making records at that point? Or were you thinking of yourself as a... producer or these are just tools to get people moving at first it was just to make tracks something to play on your own because you know you heard Frankie playing the Jamie principle and the you know some tracks that Frankie was doing or some tracks that Craig Loftus was doing like my thing was I brought what the kids too young to go downtown and hear and see and feel. I brought that into the neighborhood. And downtown sort of off the West Loop, that was where the clubs were, like in terms of the warehouse and the music box. And you had a different scene going at the time. So my scene was basically for the kids. The high school kids and kids that could come outside and stay outside for a couple hours. So it's pretty funny. A lot of the music that you ended up making is pretty sort of sexed up stuff. So it started with playing for teenagers who were maybe kind of horny or something like that. I was always, once in a morning, everything that I was making was some freaky type stuff. You know, I had the Dance Your Mother, and actually, you know, when Dance Your Mother came out, it was redone because that wasn't the original version of it. The original version was... Excuse my French, y'all, but it was going, dance, you mother, you mother. But behind it, it was going, dance, motherfucker, dance, dance, dance, motherfucker, dance, dance, dance, motherfucker. So the one that you hear, or the one that came out on Westbrook Records. Oh, I was so upset because I couldn't put out the raw version because I know that's the version everybody wanted. Bam wanted it more polished and reverbs and put the acid and the things. stuff behind that and I was fighting that and I was like okay you can do whatever you want to do just give me a version and that's how it had all that big reverb and stuff on the kick I mean on one track that he did that that turned out good dance mother I just wanted it really I wanted it raw in its rawest essence just in its truest form I didn't want to touch it it'd be you know because a lot of stuff as a DJ I know I act like a producer but I think like a DJ so my thing was that a lot of the stuff that came out us as DJs that were waiting years and years for it, when it finally came out, we was like, no, this ain't the version, man. This ain't the one we want. Oh, they done messed it up. Oh, my God. You know, we couldn't understand and look at a, as one of my old friends would say, Donnie Cologne, it's like. he would always say to us, it's bigger than the neighborhood. It's bigger than the neighborhood, Mike. It's bigger than the neighborhood. So as youngsters, you couldn't think about bigger than the neighborhood. Man, this for my neighborhood, right? I don't care what else is going on outside here. But at that time, and maybe you can tell me a little bit about how you hooked up with Bam Bam as well, because Dance Your Mother was your debut as well. And he had already sort of developed a sense of how is this track going to work elsewhere? Right. No, he heard it on KKC. And he heard it. Farley heard it. Farley was trying to do what Farley do. And Tyree was like, no, no, no, no. No, that's my man track. You can't mess with that. So Bam ended up here and is like, man, I want to. So Tyree called me like, man, Bam Bam want to put this out. I was like, who is Bam Bam? He's like, man, Bam Bam, he do records. He got this record label, Westbrook Records. Okay. So I went to meet with him, and we sat down, talked, chatted, and I was like, cool, all right, let's do it. And he had his studio set up in his bedroom. He was living at his mom's at the time. So we actually did that record in his bedroom at his mom's house. And he was teamed up with Sherman Burks. So Sherman was the one that put the money behind the project so that the record could get out. And Bam's parents. So you were saying that you were playing it off the reel-to-reel prior to that, and then you went into his studio and did a version for the record. Right. It was on cassette and reel, but... It wasn't pressed up or anything. It was just me always playing it. At that time when Dance Your Mother was made, then Tyree and I were at a place called High Society on the south side. That was on Holstead, like 77th, 76th and Holstead. That was Sam Chapman's night, and he had Tyree and I spending there. So Magic Feet came out not that long after that as well, right? That was a pretty quick follow-up and obviously a track that is enduring. I know that the late DJ Rashad kind of would speak about that track a lot. I've heard an interesting story about that track as well. Like, I mean, I know that it samples Lil Lewis, but I've also heard that there was a drum machine that was going around at the time, like that was sort of being passed around. Can you speak about that? The one that Lewis was playing all the time was the one that we wanted. We could never get it. So we did our own versions. And the version that Lewis was playing. and put out and put his name on it wasn't Lewis. That was Marshall Jefferson. So Marshall Jefferson is the one that actually did video Clash. Lewis asked him could he play it and play it at the Bismarck and things like that. And he ended up putting it out, and Marshall got no credit or nothing like that. I know I'll probably hear from Lewis, but yeah. You know, that's the truth. That wasn't Lewis' track. That was Marshall Jefferson did that track. And there was another track that was pretty similar as well, the Hells Franciscan track, like the Hells track or something. Yeah, I mean, it was so many versions of that because I wouldn't give it out my version. Ty wasn't giving out his version. It hurts who did theirs wasn't giving out theirs. So you could walk in any part of the South Side or the West Side. You know, they said it was the South Side, but the West Side had a scene on the house as well. It's just the South Side was bigger because all of us, you know, Marshall was from the West Side. You know, everybody thought Marshall was from the South Side, but... When Marshall was producing all of that stuff, his apartment was on the south side. There's photos floating around of Marshall got all this equipment set up. That was his apartment out west. So that's where we went and was trying to get stuff from Marshall that he was making before he was making it. Now, the drum machine story is. It wasn't floating around. It's only one Tyree, me, and Hugo had had it. But we just kept giving balls to the runaround. Like, Tyree got it. Tyree, oh, I have it. And then he'll call Tyree and Tyree will say, Hugo got it. Hugo, I know I have it. Mike got it. So we were trying to, we weren't trying to take the machine from him. You know, he let me use the 808 and it just, we just. I mean, we kept that going. I'm sorry, MJ. We kept that going for like about five, six months. I mean, I guess I see things like that happen to this day. You know, like it's like I want to get that back and the person suddenly goes dark or something like that. It sort of gets to another thing that I wanted to talk about, you know, with tracks like. Pressure Cooker, which is obviously inspired by Percolator, and a lot of the flips you did as QX1 as well, and Tyree's known for this as well, in terms of versions of Larry Hurd tracks and stuff like this. What you're saying is that it comes out of DJing and having a special version, and then eventually these tracks get out there and they maybe tell a story of a certain time. Right. I know for me, Tyree, Hugo had a lot of great stuff. Hugo's sometimes hard to deal with. So he wants things. done that way and that's why if you hear the Freaky MF track, I say, everybody thought I was saying, it's a Michael thing. I was actually saying it's a Mygo thing. And Mygo was something that me and Hugo came up with that was, we were difficult with women. If you couldn't deal with the Migo thing, then you wouldn't understand. So Migo was actually M-I for Mike and G-O for Hugo. So it became Migo. It's a Migo thing. So that's the thing. They would always, you know, it was like, if you can deal with us, then you good. I'm with you 100%. But, you know, Hugo had, back to the story, Hugo had a lot of nice tracks. And I was going through old tape, cassette tapes. I got a couple bins that I posted up on my Facebook. I found a ton of all the old stuff. A lot of old Armando, a lot of old Mike Dunn, Unreleased, Hugo, Unreleased, Tyree, Marshall Jefferson, Tin City. You know, I found tons of that stuff. Lil Lewis. I found mixes of I Need a New Dance Beat that were never released on that, like I played one last night at the party. You can expect to hear from... 100 labels after this exchange interview comes out, I think. It's more about music, baby. It's more about music. Me and Mark Potts, baby. 100%. Absolutely. It's been great dealing with them as well on this. But you brought up Armando, and I know that you were very, very close with him. Do you want to speak a little bit about how you got to know him? Yeah, Armando was doing parties. I thought Mondo was like, Mondo made records. But Armando was more of like a super promoter on the parties. So, like when we met, it was further his career for us on the putting out records. Land of Confusion, the baseline was actually a baseline that was already in the... in the 303. He borrowed Hula Mahone's, he borrowed that 303, and the bass line was in there. And he pulled it out. He's like, oh, man, I'm going to use this. So that's basically how the 303 bass line came about. The bass line was actually programmed by Hula Mahone. Armando just, you know, but back then we were just, we were borrowing each other's stuff because nobody had a complete studio. It was like. I got a 707. He got an 808. He got a TB-303. He got a keyboard. He got a sequencer. So it was like, man, let me see your sequencer so I can do this, or let me see your... You're 303, so I can do that. So we were basically passing equipment around each other, you know, until we were able to get up to where we had enough stuff to not do that anymore. You know, Mondo basically did tracks and a lot of the stuff, Mondo would just be like. Armando was the mastermind behind it. He was like, okay, I want to track the sounds like Todd Terry. So that's when I did the 100% dissing. But Todd took it as though we were dissing him. We weren't dissing him. It was just the sample that I picked out of there. Lolita was like, I'm going to diss you right now. So that's why we was calling it 100% Dish You, not because we were trying to dish. Todd by doing the same sound that he was doing. So, because him and Armando were about to fight and win a music conference, you know, they saw each other and Todd was not happy. Like, man, you trying to diss me on the... Armando, man, you know what, man? What you talking about, man? I ain't trying to... You know, it got real thick. But as he explained to him, he was like, man, we wasn't trying to diss you. We was. We loved that, you know, check this out. You know, that's crazy. So basically it was more of like when we did things, we weren't doing things to diss people. We were doing them to big up them. Like it was like. Some people get in your ear and start pumping you up. Like, oh, man, they trying to, they trying to. So, you know, you get a little swole. But that's as far as it went. They squashed it and the whole nine like that. But it wasn't ever. Do you hear me, guys? Ever a diss toward Todd Terry. It was more of us being, you know, Armando said he wanted something to sound like the Todd Terry joint because the joint was huge. So Armando being the promoter he is, or he was, he wanted something to come out. On his EP, that sounded like that. Glad we got that cleared up. Yeah. So at this point, you know, you're starting to be internationally recognized. It's gone beyond the neighborhood at this point. Like, when did it get to that stage where you were beginning to travel, where you were? We're hearing the tracks out. I mean, when Tyree and them went overseas, I'm like, man, they over there selling our records like crazy, man. Because we didn't know nothing about it. We didn't know. When Tyree and Eddie and them went over there to do the tour, they came back like, man, they ripping us off, dog. Like, what? Yeah, man, our records are selling like crazy. We big over there, man. Like, I love them to death, so I don't want to seem like I'm dissing them, but Rocky and them would never let us know what was going on over there. We were shielded from that. So the only way that the guys and gals... from Europe knew how to get in touch with us was through the labels. There wasn't any faces to us yet. It was just names. And boom, they'd run into a big brick wall right there. So we didn't know anything about it until Tyree and them went over there and started touring that. Man, we like rock stars. Like, what, huh? Yeah, man. When the record store, records is, you know, at that time, it wasn't consolidated. It wasn't a euro. Everybody had still their own money, you know. He's like, yeah, man. When Germany is this much, when in the... London, there was these many pounds. I'm like, wow. So we started trying to figure out how to get in touch with those people. That led directly to starting your own label as well? Yeah, that was the kickoff. Who helped us with that vision was Ray Barney. One stop? Yeah. So Ray Barney had a one stop. And his dad, before he turned it over completely to Ray Jr., you know, that's how Byron and Marshall and all them got to put their records out. with the Bright Star and the things like that. And then we ended up like, man, we want to have our own labels. So Ray Barney was... the one who facilitated that and gave us, you know, where we could do our own labels and press it up for us and things like that. We just couldn't trust tracks, you know, not only for the business end, but the pressing because... You know, you would get records that were moving side to side, and you're like, hold on, is my turntable? What the fuck? You see the needle. You're like, what the fuck is wrong with this record? You look at it like, hold on, is that some paper? Sorry to be cursing, but you know, it was like, you fight with a track record. it was incredible it was like man and I saw it with my own two eyes. This ain't nothing I heard. This ain't nothing somebody told me. No, I saw it with my own two. I saw records getting broke up. I saw the stacks of K-Tail records. I saw the stacks of all the records getting ready to be broken down to be, you know. Melted down and did re it's like God. No, we can't do nothing. Oh, yeah You started your own label with Armando and you had music with Armando and then you had your own label as well, correct? Yeah, see Warehouse was Armando's dance mother was mine and music was ours so We kind of had it like that way because that distance story probably never been told or if it's been told, it's been told not the right way. And what happened was, the reason we separated them like that after a while is because Armando brought French Kiss to me. It's like, man, I'm going to put this out, man. I'm going to put this out, man. It's cold. And I was like, man, I can't hate that record, man. That record sucks, man. No, man, we're not putting that record out, man. He's like, man, no, the record's good. The record's good. I was like, no, man. Look at it, man. It's slowing down. What is... that? I'm snapping just because of my little thing with Louis that I'm not thinking with a business head. I'm thinking with my heart. And lo and behold. So Louis ended up putting that himself. Epic licensed it? Or it just used incredibly massive right now? Right. I mean, like, that's the one thing. My music career that, I mean, everything happened for a reason, but just looking back, I was like, oh, no, that wasn't a good decision, Mike. That was the one that got away. Right. And away it got. So one of the things that you said was, you know, on those first trips to Europe, Tyree was beginning to understand that the shops, the culture. They knew how to get Chicago records, but they didn't really know who you guys were. And, you know, you didn't exactly make it easy for people either because, you know, you're known as Funky Brother. All right. The Jazzman. The MD Connection. The MD3. MDZ. The Rhythm Composers. QX1. Funky People. Why were you just making a ton of music then? Was it sort of a neighborhood thing in terms of nicknames? Yeah, I was just all, and still to this day I do it, and I don't know why, but still to this day I do it. I got the green tea and the house and the HD, that's me and Terry. It's just I was always in love with aliases. That was the way that I could do a whole lot of different music and be somebody else. Mike Dunn didn't have the same sound as MD3. And MD3 didn't have the same sound as the rhythm composer. I could be whoever I wanted to be when I changed my name to that pseudo. You know what I'm saying? I was whoever I wanted to be. And still to this day. More psychological with me than... but it's just when I want to change. Like, Mr. 69, that was, it's like a movie, and it's like an actor getting into character. So, for me, that's how I got into character. to produce songs. You know, this was my role. Okay, cool. That's who I got to be now. So let's talk a little bit about that then, because the projects do have a specific sound. So what were you going for with, say, the QX1 records that just got reissued? Because it seems like that's a really deep, sort of pad-heavy sound. Right. The QX1 was more like Marshall Jefferson. because Marshall Jefferson used to use the Yamaha QX1 sequencer. So that's how that project got that name. QX1 was more of the Marshall Jefferson sound. Well, then now you've got to tell me about bowel movements. Yeah, but somebody said that. I don't know what the hell that is. I never made a track called Vowel Woman, man. I mean, I've done some raunchy tracks, but Vowel Woman is not a name I'm going to come up with. So I don't know who did that. Somebody just tagged my name on that, and I have nothing to do with it. I guess it's sort of a scavenger hunt sometimes. People are looking all over the place. Do you feel like people had trouble keeping up sometimes as opposed to— Tyree, Tyree's going to be Tyree, whether he's doing Hip House, whether he's whatever project he's doing is going to be Tyree, Tyree Cooper. Right. But the thing with that is you get labeled. So my longevity in the game was that I never got labeled because you couldn't catch up with what I was doing. Like, OK, who is this? That's Mike Nunn. OK, who is that? That's Mike Nunn. that that's like under about time that you don't or do like it it's too late it's already it's me so you can't come up with these preconceived notions about I don't like to try because I don't like Mike Dunn or No, you just gonna like it or not like it because it's good or it's not good. Not because I did it. And at the time, it's sort of really purple period of early to mid 90s. You were making a ton of music. That's when your only LP as Mike Dunn came out as well, correct? What was your sort of touring schedule like at the time? It was crazy, by the way. I was born to be house, that album. That was a rush disaster, man. But anyway, yeah, I mean, the schedule was, me and Armando, we were, like, all over the place. And it was, you know, we were doing the Radical Fear tours. It was me, Felix, Roy Davis, Armando. We were staying in Germany, and we stayed in Germany for over a month just touring. That's one of the reasons I had pulled back some because it was just so much on the body. Getting on the plane, getting off the plane, getting on the plane, getting off the plane. You know, sometimes it just got to a point where I felt like, I don't know if other DJs, U.S. DJs were going through this, but I just felt that it was a time that I wasn't being respected enough. I would be sitting at the airport waiting for somebody to pick me up for an hour, hour and a half. Or they would put me on flights that would take me 14 hours to get there, seven hours here, layover three hours here, take that over there, then take that train. No, I felt like, you know, I had put so much into the game. That's when I started doing my hip-hop stuff with Puff. So once that deal went through, I basically shut down. My last gig in Europe was, before I came back to do a little thing with DJ Deep, my last gig was in Germany. What year was that? I think I got the bad boy deal in 2000. It's been like 15 years. And so this was when Puff Daddy signed a deal with Dunn Ruffin Entertainment. Can you speak about how that came about? Yeah, I had rappers. I was producing. It was really only had one artist. And then I pulled other artists in. I had to start a swing, and we were doing stuff together. And my manager at the time, Eric the Wiz, he took some stuff out to New York. And somehow... Demo left the hands of who Wiz gave it to and got into the hands of the guy who took it to Puff, which was Craig Boogie. And Craig Boogie was, like, from Mount Vernon, so he was, you know, he was Tyson's boy, Mike Tyson's boy, Heavy D, all the new Craig Boogie. And then, you know. Boogie was tight with Puff, so he took it over to Puff, and Puff heard him and was like, man, I need to talk to them guys, man. And we got a call, and it was like, yo, first we got a call from Craig Boogie. He hunted us down, and then the next thing you know, phone rings. Man, yo, what's up, Playboy? Man, it's Puff. Hello? I'm like, yeah, what's up, man? Yeah, hey, Flip, I'm in a meeting right now. I'm doing some things, but hold on tight. Don't go nowhere, Flip, boy. I'm going to hit you back. It's like, cool, Puff. All right, cool. Doof! running around the whole studio. Man, the fluff is just on the phone. Get out of here, man. I felt like this was an episode of, I mean, not an episode, but a scene from the Coming to America. Oh, man, you don't know no more. I looked at the cane. You know, I was like, man, that was fluff on the phone. Called back, and there you have it, man. It was... It was just that simple, but then things got haywire because that was the same time he was going through the trial with the shooting and Jennifer and Sean and the whole show. It just got all discombobulated. There was a couple of things that I could have done differently that should have been done differently that would have probably kept the deal. But, hey. tough game, major label rap production. Hey, man. And now the way this sounds now, that's what made me like, okay, man. I need to go back home. Right there, I was like, okay. I don't need a ton of money, man. I just need to be comfortable. That was the turning point of me coming back. to house it was just like just want to be comfortable and happy Happy and comfortable, in that order. So what was it about that world that made you feel uncomfortable, that made you feel like you weren't at home? Just all of the BS that come with it, man. You know, you'll hear tons of stories and see tons of stories and people will be posting kind of wild, little Bill Hickup stuff, but I gave up. And I gave up because I felt like I had made this money and I had all this jewelry and I had all this, you know, big fancy car and all that and clothes and things. I made all that under. you know, basically false pretenses. I was doing something I really didn't love. I was doing it because I just want the money. I could do both, you know. Technically, I can produce hip-hop, R&B, and all that. You know, I had success in it. So I could do it, but there's a difference. I'm doing that to pay the bills and live the lavish life and all that. How else I do it? Because I love it. I don't care if I make a dime off it. You know what I'm saying? Like, that's real talk. At the same time, I got a whole lot of money, but I ain't happy. House, I ain't got a whole lot of money, but I'm happy. So as you get older, you're like, okay, what's more important? You know, as you're younger, you ask that question, and you're going to be like, man, I have money. But when you get some meat on your head and you get some miles up under your feet, you realize that happiness is what's most important to me in my life, whether I'm super rich or... super broke the happiness falls first you know so that's what i'm happy now i'm in the studio i'm happy i'm i produce like i'm a youngin again you know i'm in there i'm inspired like a lot of stuff i hear today i'm I'm inspired. Like, there's a lot of stuff that I hear that the younger cats are doing, and a lot of the stuff they're doing is the stuff that they look up to me and others, like, for making. So it's funny. how the clock works. You know, the clock is a powerful thing. So me looking up to Frank, which is Frankie, Frankie Knuckles, and, you know what I'm saying, for me looking up to Frank, and now that he's gone, now there's kids looking up to me like I was looking up to Frank. And that's what I mean by the clock. The clock is powerful because, you know, when they tell you, young guys, that time waits for no one, please believe that. No one waits for no one. I think we should end on that note. Thank you so much for coming in, Mike. Really appreciate talking to you and appreciate the insight and sort of true testimonial as well of the Chicago House. Man, it's, hey, that's why they call me the truth, baby, I guess, because I got to speak it, baby. I got to speak my mind. I got to speak the truth. And I try to give as much knowledge. as I can't. I want to leave like the younger cats coming up in the game with this. Someone's trying to give you knowledge on the game. Let them give you knowledge on the game because you don't want to be an artist or producer or DJ or anything like that that's being spoon fed. And what I mean by that is you have to wait on somebody else to make moves for you. You don't ever want to put yourself in that position. For me, I sat around Marshall. I sat around Tyree. I sat around, you know, whether good or bad, I sat around a lot of people. for the knowledge because as the word says you know I can give you this fish and you'll eat for a day or I can teach you how to fish And you can eat for a lifetime. So knowledge always reigns supreme. Get the knowledge. Do what you do. Stay true to yourself. If that's what you believe in, then you go for it. Eventually, somebody's going to hear it. The way that you hear it. You know, don't feel like you got to run with the pack. You've got to produce the pack in order to get heard or be heard or be seen or get gigs. Do you. And that's what people always tell me. I know when it's a Mike Dunn track because you've got a different sound. I'm always thinking of something different. And basically how you come up with your own sounds is you just take a little bit from everybody that you like. Basically, there ain't no science to it. Oh, man, I just came up with this. No, you haven't. The wheel was built a whole long time ago, though. It ain't nothing you got to do with the wheel. So basically, you just do, you know, you take a little bit of what you like from every artist and you implement that into your production. Just make sure that your end of it is more prevalent than the other ends that you're taking. But I can't help myself I don't wanna be afraid But I can't help myself I don't wanna be afraid But I can't help myself I don't wanna be afraid I don't wanna be afraid, but I can't help myself. But I can't help myself I don't wanna be a freak But I can't help myself I don't wanna be a freak But I can't help myself you
