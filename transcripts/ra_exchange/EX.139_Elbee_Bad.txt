Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling, and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. L.B. Badd became the latest subject of Rush Hour's ongoing re-release series late last year, and out of all of the producers they've covered so far, this one felt the most necessary. Lamont Booker was a respected and prolific figure on New York's house scene in the late 80s and early 90s, but his name was never written into the history books in the prominent... place he perhaps deserved. Booker made an unplanned move to Berlin at the start of the 90s after being invited to the city by the guys behind Hardwax. He recorded with Basic Channel in their formative years, although only one of the tracks from those sessions ever saw the light of day. Booker has remained active in Berlin ever since, and it was there late last month that we met up to discuss early news. your club culture, his work in radio and his recent return to the limelight. you I'd read that you were quite the musician when you were growing up. I'd read that there were a multitude of instruments and areas of interest for you when you were growing up. I wondered if we could start with that. Sure thing. Drummer is my original claim to fame. my original love, which indeed started banging on pots and pans. My brother was a bassist and I took that and from there it went to guitar to keyboards. So you were playing in bands or? We started off the two of us and as we grew older and tighter a set of brothers, also a drummer and a guitar player, and that became my first band. And for years, we played. Okay, and are we still in kind of childhood here? Teenager. I moved to Long Island about 13, and by 14, I was in the band. It was... Semi-professional at that age. Semi-professional. So you were playing, you were releasing records? No, no, no. In a way, performance, live performances. We were doing shows, weddings, parties. And yeah, people paid. I see. Not that it's all about the money, but just for that age and that time, it was kind of amazing. And how would you describe the style, the type of music? For today's year, I would say soul music. We played soul and danceable soul. So you grew up predominantly in Long Island. The Bronx was the childhood and teenage years off to Long Island, luckily. And how would you describe your upbringing? My upbringing? Close family. From that, I jumped straight to no racial discrimination. Growing up in the Bronx, it had to be that way. It was such a mix of people. And yeah, a lot of love, a lot of music. So going back to the band situation and the type of gigs you were playing, what eventually became of that project? We have the name Platinum Enterprise and it's stuck for years. And to show you... Our level talent in our high school years, and I say years, actually their high school years, I was in junior high, but we used to do high school talent shows, and they were prizes given. We weren't allowed to get a prize or to even take place in that. Because they said we were too good. So we were like the last act, a show. Which was fair, unfair. But it was great. It was that high. So did you kind of have big aspirations around that time? Do you guys think you were? Going to the top? Not to the top. Never thought about the top. But I actually used to vision albums with this band. And my brother, an artist himself, he made a cover. And yeah, it's still not out. But one day, I'm seriously going to do it as the band. So nothing got committed to wax then? Not yet. All right, same. Not yet. But the band, as they were all older, this story, it's quite amazing because it works many ways, but the musical way, I'll tell you, first anyway. As they grew older and started to recognize the realities of life after high school. me still younger was not seeing it that way and they actually were saying the band has to stop just because of college, university. And it was a strange thing to see dreams die so early. I mean, could you kind of comprehend where they were coming from? No, because it was a local. They were all going very local. And even if they had, which they did, had rooms on campus, they were still close to home and always home. weekends home. So I didn't understand it, but it was deeper, and of course I couldn't understand it. Today I get it. Yeah, to have a dream, age 17, 18, and to think life starts, or the adult life starts, so my dreams, they just diminished. And because, well, now it's time to get serious. The love. the dream, it wasn't serious. I mean did you come around to their line of thinking? I mean did stuff become more serious for you? Only in a way of understanding because for me the dream state, it was always my dream to just play music and eat from it. Simple. So is that side of things always stuck with you, that initial spark or dream, however you'd like to describe it? Unconsciously, yes, because I never thought about it. I just was doing my thing. Often through the years, literally crying for my brother. Whatever he touches with me is that much better. Till today. And then the music side, what happened, I had to find something to do musically to entertain people. that the dj thing it was around the same time zone and djs were all not always but they were around already but in a different let's just say the early days even before mixing really they're just a sense of time that we're talking like 80s 70s late 70s um Mid 70s. I would say 75, 76. six it had to be around this time maybe even early actually um so that would have been the initial engagement with dj exactly this is what i mean this was actually before because it wasn't really mixing yet um my first time to acknowledge a dj my band was at a wedding and uh it was a wedding that i had negotiated uh i don't it was a few hundred dollars we got and we had uh rented a sound system, a PA, and it was kind of nice, and we had our own, so we had like two. We bought in, poof, very big wedding. And then they had a DJ also, and we played first. And I'll never forget this DJ. He, after we played, and it was loud, you know, people were dancing, it was the beginning, so it was a party. Started a party, it's a black thing. party. He turned on his sound and it was like, heard it louder than my bass drum. Wow. And the first song was Summer Madness, Cool in the Game. It was so powerful, so loud. I remember he had bass bottoms. They were bigger than my bass drum. You know what I mean? Everything was just big. And the sound is what really took me. Being near the speaker and seeing the turntable far on the other side of the room, I couldn't understand. In a way, it was like the sound is so incredible and it's coming from that tiny needle way over there. Nothing like home stereo. You know what I mean? I have a record player. We know the needle. But this was just, it was another dimension. If you know this song, it comes in, I think it's first drums and then like horn string, big operatic type thing. And then it just dropped. And it was like, it blew me away. I was like, I want to play behind that. I want that power. It was so just loud and powerful. It was, I have no word for that. You know, life-changing moment. Boom. That's when I knew headphones, you know what I mean? Turntables. So obviously the band was still on, but as they windled, it was kind of the natural progression. What can I do alone and still perform? Because that was my love, performance. And, yeah, it was a smooth, slow transition. When I decided, I know it was still, I was in school, I mean, during school time, and in the summer. My first summer job, it was all about turntables. That was my point for working. And see, working for the dream from the start. And I saved up all my money. And, yeah, two turntables. I couldn't afford the mixer for some reason. And, yeah, for Christmas, this was summer, then that Christmas came, my mother bought my mixer. It was on. I was already mixing somehow, friends, parties, somehow I was in it, and I was buying records. But, yeah, that next winter, Christmas time, never stopped. And my first time mixing on my own stuff, I couldn't mix. It was incredible. So what were some of your first public exploits as a DJ? North Babylon, North Babylon. That's the town I'm from. And there, it's a party town. It's a hip-hop town. The roots of hip-hop, a lot of it comes from my area. And when I say my area, Wine Dance and North Babylon sit side by side. I won't go too deep into it, but there's a long list of rappers that the common person knows. They're from that area. So it's party time. And when I say party time, this is hip-hop. We had no prejudice against beats per minutes. from slow to very fast, including that aggressive soul. We searched for underground music, whatever that meant, something different. That's what moved people. And this party thing, yeah, back to my beginning exploits, I slipped in for the love. You know, it was like, yo, I want to mix. And there was a place in Wine Dance itself in the summertime. Saturdays, block parties, it was normal. And think of the Jamaican sound system type deal, and people party 12 to 12. And that's when the cops would come, stop, lights out, you know, stop the power. it was pretty peaceful and non-stop underground music from Kraftwerk to Point and Sisters to Serone, fast disco to slow hip-hop beats and you know with both Kame MCs. And that's when the rap industry grew out of that New York party vibe. And yeah, there I was, looking, dancing. And on the smaller parties, which in Cloquet, we lived in suburbia. And in suburbia, you can have a party in your backyard anytime you want. And every DJ would set up, usually on Saturdays and Sundays. And we'd have, like, little parties. It depends. You know, people would come as they came. No announcement, no anything like that. People hear the music, you know, party's at his house today. And, yeah, small, but it was all about dancing. And we would dance and people would mix all day. And in that, it was a friendly competition. where if you bought records, you could play. And even if you didn't bring records, you could play, pretty much. It was like that. You know, it was among friends. This is the neighborhood, the hood. And yeah, we all played. When I say we all, it was like a fad where everybody did it, which is the same, I think, it happened all over the world years later. You know, like the average kid. I'm a DJ. I want to be. So that was 70s. I wonder when house music kind of first registered on your radar. That's a very difficult question. I left New York in 1980. When I left New York, we had, I would say, the closest thing that you could call house. It was Latin. It was freestyle. Noel, Silent Morning, Deez Time. In that environment, Latin hip-hop, again, referring to what we called hip-hop, the big scale. So they took and added that it had Latin flavor, but hip-hop, nothing to do with rap. It fit. That became freestyle. Somehow, somewhere in there, okay, even though I left New York, I wrote the story. before, well that was '88, but the story was evolving at this time. As we danced and partied to what we called hip-hop. It did branch out at a time. And I remember from a DJ point of view, it started to go, you guys blend and you guys cut. And that was one avenue that it changed. So blend being housey disco, cut being hip hop. Right, exactly. And so this also was a slow change. And me, I like both. and I would never stop. I couldn't understand, but I did prefer this newer music because the sounds were more extravagant, so to say. Techno, that's the word. Electro. Yeah, also electro was already around before all of that, even the word. And from back again, as it broke off... People who were unaware called, said club music. Not even dance music, club music, because it was played in a club. Now, the best club, Paradise Garage. We said garage music. Years later, UK took over that, and there was also the rock garage, so that didn't go far. But the style, and this is the record, The True Story of House, the style, even as it got 4-4, we didn't have a name because it was like new disco. We didn't name it. This is New York. We didn't name anything. We didn't care. You know what I mean? Here's a category, hip-hop, all of that. That's it, whatever. And people went for it, eclectic. Years later, everything got categorized. Blame it on the salespersons and managers and marketing strategists. Anyway, yeah, so this shift, musically, it was always around. and it was dance music be i would say in my life still pre-club we had centers and not you know clubs i mean dances at night but not clubbing yet um halls and stuff the rented things um your raves years later we were doing it as teenagers and As the music shifted, the best way I could describe anything that had like, let's say it was kind of over one, somewhere around 110, 112 BPMs was kind of. somehow a split and of course there was many in the middle electro as a whole but that split is what became house versus other for the sake of this interview um yeah it's that word club music Even on the radio, they would say club music, and then the number one club was Paradise Garage. So the name Garage Music for the insiders. That sound moved to Chicago, you know. Same thing. The club, what club? Clubhouse. House music. They play house music. That's the word. So it's, yeah, that's, to me, that's the real evolution. And, you know, I can't say, even, let me go back. New York didn't name things. Chicago did label it, which had a lot to do with tracks, the record label. But the sound, yeah. as we had and we played music from everywhere with no prejudice. This was the point, you know what I mean, of not labeling it. So, for example, in the garage where garage music was played, Larry could, would drop E2, E4, run DMC. I've heard soccer emcees and whatever's on the flip side, the more popular one, electoral thing, in the garage. And people, you know, screaming. And then, of course, normal house, Jamie Principle. And underground, whatever, whatever, sounds, you know. So, yeah, that was the whole thing. Speaking on the garage, it was like walking into a radio. And, I mean, a very big radio, and you're just in it. Sound, like, wow. You know, the old box, if you could walk in it. That was, yeah, more people should have that. Was the system as good as people make out? Best in the world, still today. I have not heard better. Ministry of Sound London, close. Really, I have not heard better. Why did you decide to start making this club music? No one's ever asked me that. Why did I start making club music? I think it had to do with, as a drummer, I first used to just play, chop up. bring up my skills and then I remember I used to play on on records play the record and it would start light and then I would say okay go detail you're gonna get every roll every snap every every you're gonna hit it when they hit it and I got kind of good at that copying and from then that shift went into it had to be something else. And that something else was, yeah, okay, now you have to make something solid. Because, okay, as a drummer, when you're making up these beats, I never thought to record. anything just wasn't you know any idea we acted i don't think we ever recorded our band i don't think we ever recorded okay on video yeah but anyway um so to to have that that uh process from just playing out of your head without anything from anybody, just me. I didn't have lessons in the early days. And yeah, then to copy what's on record, especially records I like, and I mean, I went for some not easy records. And as the band... Simmered out at the same time Drum machines I think were first to come into my house. I think I wanted to buy a drum machine before synth I think I bought my first 303 before I bought synth. Yeah, anyway, so it was like yeah, okay make your own drum sounds and from there My beats I would call it hip-hop today instrumental hip-hop and yeah kind of aggressive So, meaning not so slow as far as aggression. But it would be like, yeah, breakbeats. But I don't want it because breakbeats is too fast. So it would be House without the 4-4. Kind of like a lot of my tracks today, as I think about it. But maybe not as fast somehow. I was in that 116, 118, maybe you hit 120, I think. My first record, Just Don't Stop the Dance, I believe that's 114 or something like this. And yeah, it's a perfect example. That's what came out of that. Those beats. It's not 4-4, but you wouldn't say it's hip hop. So in today's genre, it's either, I wouldn't say acid jazz. I would say hip hop, instrumental hip hop, to have an understanding of categories. And what did you feel like you were looking to add to this club music conversation? Something different. Always. That was my thing. I wanted to hear or make what I haven't heard. That's the end of the equation. Creating your own plus copying others, getting it, equals making stuff you've never heard. Because you're satisfied with both. You know what I mean? Yeah, that makes sense. That's the equation. You started your own label quite quickly. Is that correct? quite quickly because my first record deal i got ripped off so i said the second one i'll do it myself um i was sitting at the time in unique distribution which was selling 12 inches all over the world so i even had the hot seat to do it and it was a question of money which i'm not I hold no grudges. I don't say their names, but the record company offered me, in contract, signed, $1,000 when the song was finished. The song was finished, and in the studio, they both were, and, oh, we don't have, and, and, and, and I started singing. There was no singing on this track. I was talking and then they just started singing. I was like, yo, nah, I'm not leaving until I'll just be in here. And when I leave, you might not be here. So who knows what happens? So they said, okay, okay, okay. We'll muster up some money. And they mustered up five. First he said, I'll write you a check, actually. I was like, come on, nah. After he said he didn't have money, I write you a check. And then it went down to, they came up with 500 cash, gave it to me, and that was it from the finance. And so for me, I was like, well, I might as well do it myself. The only thing they did was somehow manufacture. I can find out how. So I did. Boom. Leron Records. Two at once. And the hardest thing for me was to find money, which came from a friend. It was the deal. Two for one. My sons want to do a record. We know you're producing a bit. I will give you money because he had heard, you know, I put the word out. I need some cash. And his sons. They started working with me, and we made a hip-hop record, and I made This Dream Is Real. And as an engineer, I had no clue what I was doing. And to explain myself... Hearing music in the garage or any big club has a boom to it. Naive little me took that boom sound and I said, I want my records or my songs to sound like this because I like it. what I'm hearing in the club. It's the best thing you can hear. Boom. You know what I mean? Boom. And in the studio, when you play a drum machine, it's not boom. It's whatever. So reverb. Boom. And I boomed both these records. Yeah, I thought it sounded great. I really did. And, of course, I didn't have a chance or have the knowledge to try it out in the club. Yeah, tonight I'll try it out in the club. No, there was no try it out in the club. It was nothing like that. And it was even home stereos. We're listening to this stuff on. We're making it on. So, yeah, everybody seemed it was okay. Nobody knew, you know what I mean, including the executive producer. He had no idea. The hip-hop record was just as boomy. Not as boomy, actually. It was a little bit quieter. And yeah, Minds, I boomed it out and took the money, manufactured two records. engineer who mastered it he was like asking questions he was the first one he's like it was a Jamaican guy yeah blood but take you got too much echo and things down you know I can't tune it down And yeah, it was like that. I was like, no, no, that's how we want it. And he was like, hmm. He said, I could imagine him like he's more dubby than King Tubby. Lord forgive him for he know not what he do. I didn't. But it's a good thing and it's a bad thing. On one side, especially the UK, these DJs who bought LeBron 26, this stream is real, they loved it, they played it, it charted. I was shocked. Not because of that, but just the fact. Hey, I just put this record out. There's no promotion. You know what I mean? And it's in England. It's like kicking. Wow. Thousands gone. call that success. The rap record, I think I sold maybe 400 out of a thousand. But over the years, people still are asking for that record. So yeah, let's see what happens. And what would you kind of deem to be the level of success you felt you achieved through your house production? around the early 90s? Did you feel like you were doing well for yourself? Are you carving a niche? Not at all. I didn't... Not at all. Here's new group records. I'm in the office. Frankie Bones. He's off to London. Comes back. A few weeks later, I happen to be in the office. Here's Frankie. He's off to London. Third time it happens, he says, yo, every time I go to London, these promoters, they're always asking about you. What? Yeah. They're asking about you. They love your track. The promoters are asking about me. But you're over there spinning. I don't get it. Later on, I got it. I was told. We, the London Underground, didn't know you were a DJ, which had a lot to do with the sound of my records. It didn't sound like a DJ, a DJ's record, and there was no anything pointing at DJ. It was just like a record, which in my view, that's what I wanted, because this was the time. Early raves. This is 88. And at this time, it's all brand new, just starting. Me, as I made my first record, I was like, graduation. I'm not a DJ. I'm an artist or producer or something. And I dropped DJ out of my name. And so no one knew, which even till today, I think that's my greatest skill. DJ, mixing. Producer, I wouldn't say pat on my back or anything. Writer, okay, I can write some nice music. But as far as if I was to say talent, I'd say he's a talented DJ or mixer. That's, yeah, my look on myself. And you ended up on the radio, that's correct. You were hosting on a New York station for quite a few years. Studied radio and TV. I could be a disc jockey, really. Live on air. I don't know about the TV thing. I'm not so handsome. I'm not so, in general, looking for the GP. But anyway, studied radio and TV. I used to speak very clear and very well English. Over the years, something happened. I don't know. In New York, after school, I started with this AM station and it was an oldie station. Made sense. Music all day. And yeah, it started as an engineer and it was a guy, actually pretty famous, Ken Spiderweb. He used to work for New York's best soul station, R&B station. Americans don't say black music. At least they used to not. They did not used to say this, and it's a terrible thing. But anyway, so BLS, soul music station, top. And he was the morning guy. And I don't even know, I think the hookup was from school. I'm not sure. Or from the neighborhood, because he lived not far from us. He lived in the, let's say, rich section of Wyandanch, where hip-hop was born, from a Long Island. And, yeah, he needed an engineer for his radio show. which was a jazz show. And I got that job. I know I got that job. And as the engineer, I was like in. And then I got to know the people who worked at the station in general because he didn't work at that station. He worked on a major station, but he had a jazz show late nights, something like this. And he wasn't even there. It was just tapes. So that's why he needed the engineer. which was great. I used to pick up tapes every week, you know what I mean? Go to his house and go to my house and get my radio show together, put his radio show, boom, boom, boom. It ended up, the guys liked me. They tried, they said, okay, we're going to try you on the air. And I was doing all these show. And for me, it was, it was, it was very interesting. Another learning moment. 60s music, 50s music, rock and roll. Very good knowledge of rock and roll. Okay, if you work at a radio station, you should. And I don't mean about the artists, their lives. No, but just music. I heard a lot. I listened. I grooved. You know what I mean? I have some favorites till today. And actually, I'm thinking about dropping something in a club just to see. Because you can play... Swing, Swing House. It's kind of big. But have you ever heard someone drop an original swing record? See? But it's like, to me, I think it could work because if the people are open for that, and some do have enough sample, you hear the original. So I'm like, one day I think I'm going to have enough kahunas to really drop something. And I mean, for me... The memory, I haven't even heard what I'm thinking of, but the memory of like, yo, you know what I mean? I'm sitting there at the radio station like, ooh, first step. When I was looking over the history of Florent, I was only able to kind of acquire like a potted history or like discography of what was going on. So during the 90s, were you kind of winding down operations or what was the story? The story was that there was a time with no releases, was the time of shift. from actually New York to Europe. Once I came here, it took a few years to get started, I think. And also the interest. I wasn't really trying to release. I wasn't thinking. I was kind of starting a life, you know what I mean? Or ending, starting, ending. It's the same. So what got you from New York to Europe? Hard wax records. The man used to call me and ask, he first, it was a nice request. Hey, I'll be bad. We really want you to come over and play. And I used to get calls from this guy I'm trying to think, and I think two others who are still in the business. And understand my mindset. As I'm making these records, I'm not with a family called The Record Company. It's a 12-inch. You make it. You hope for the best. Nobody's promoting. You don't have these meetings around what we're going to do, set up this, we got to do that. There was nothing. 0.0, the next time I saw them was if I have a new track that I have interest for this label. So there was no connections. But as these records went out without promotion, I started getting phone calls from Englanders. Asking about the records or me. Never come over. And I seriously didn't believe this. I was like, who the fuck is this playing? And I did this, I think, to this guy, Richie. Richard, I can't think of his name, but I think I did this to him once or twice. Because I really thought, because my friends are clowns, you know what I mean? And, you know, it's like anything could happen, and that's something that would happen from a clown friend. And, for example, I got a chart, and this dream is real was number whatever. And, you know, it's from England, and we And so then the phone call would ring that night. Hello, mate. Yeah, you know, my friends. Then it was real once or twice. And I was like, yeah, yeah, you're right. But when Hardwax called, his accent, the Berlin, it was not a friend of mine. I knew this. So, yeah, he simply said, yeah, you should come over and we love your music. Play. As a DJ. Now for me as a DJ, I wasn't doing anything that had anything to do with my records. Those records... creations as a dj i was playing dance music for a lot of black people and a lot of uh weddings parties would know how to spin my productions not really interested and never thought about spinning my productions you know i mean no but that was the core And, yeah, he called more than a few times. And at this time, I was working at, oh, here's the deal. I got fired from a distribution company. I was on my honeymoon. Dogs. Unbelievable. I quit. Started actually a distribution company with a Daryl Payne. You know Cinnamon? I need you now. He co-produced or produced that. Anyway, me, him, and George Morrell, we worked together for a short time. Saunderson. Kevin Saunderson's first hit. And actually we had it exclusive in New York. And it would have opened up our doors to some serious business, I believe. But the song got picked up by England. And they said he couldn't release the 12-inch. Well, it didn't kill our business, but our business never got the boom-bang, and some months later, it closed. Some months after that, I found myself working at another one, played again Sam Records, a distribution company called Wynn. And there, as I sat, Mark was doing business with him, so again, we would talk. And after a few, I would say months, I think, he talked me into it where one day he called. And I remember I was sitting in the office. My manager was stressing me for some reason. He called and it was like, yeah, man, I'll come. Fuck this. I'll come. And I didn't know what that meant because it was like, I have to take time off from here. Two weeks. It was a 10-day trip. Whatever. You know what I mean? Whatever. It was dangerous territory. Now, in this point, my brother, who took me to the airport, he felt something. He felt very strange. I'm a crybaby. My brother's not. He was crying. And I was like, yo, man, come on, 10 days, don't trip. This plane is not going to fly down or nobody's going to hide it. Because that's the only thing I could think of. I never came back. Not two years, or maybe a year later, I stayed. And I didn't want to. It was no plan. One thing led to another. So the story of your involvement in music over the, I guess it was 20 years ago you first got here. Is that right? The music was before that. Yeah, no, sorry. I mean, specifically your involvement in music in Berlin. No, even from day one, it started. Let's say the Hardwax crew, the Basic Channel crew, I've done recordings with them maybe even before they released. I'm not sure because I don't know the first years when they really came out. But that was one of the reasons. why I was asked to come is to get in the studio with these guys and yeah we made some interesting stuff I believe it was offered to Trezor but it was too gentle too sweet so I don't know what else happened but the tracks still haven't been released I released one I think yeah I released one Sweet record. I slept with her but didn't sleep with her. It's the name of the song. It's sweet and it's a true story. I did and I didn't. I didn't want to. I changed my mind. But anyway, yeah, we made some beautiful music. And I was in studios quite often when I first got here and just making tracks, not songs. We was making sounds and tracks. A few got released. There's B-Flat. That came out. No, that was Brooklyn. But I think I met this guy in the studio. There's a song, Smile, I made with a guy, Roland3000. I believe that's his artist name. Yeah, I was in and out of school. studios man and uh just making stuff and at the same time I was actually once I was here and you know new I started to build the studio which even my own which also yeah it was like okay don't release and during this time I was offered one really commercial project And actually, I did record it. And when I heard it, I was like, nah, man. I don't want, I can't. Even with a different name, it's bullshit. You know it, I know it. He liked it, though. But that never came out. Yeah, I don't regret it. Could have been big, but not with my name and I'm not behind it, so there's no need for big. I'd rather stay small. How would you say that your appreciation and involvement with house music has changed over the years you've been in Berlin? You know what? With that... much thought to it, I'm going to say I start to see what I've inspired come to front. Meaning, or saying it another way, it's a lot of full circles. And it took that long, that many years. Those who loved or liked or were inspired by what I did, they took it. to the world. As they took it to the world, they kind of took a piece of me. Do you feel in a way that the Rush Hour compilation was a form of this coming full circle? Oh, for sure. That was the banger. And it's very weird and lovely because at the same time that, or a few seconds after, here comes Boiler Room. And it was like, okay, here's Rush putting it out and here's Boiler showing what you do or part of what you do. So for me, it was just, again, synchronicity in a lovely way because since then, things are moving. It's moving in a good way and still in control. How did the compilation come about? I would say... The history, it goes back years ago. I did one time in my desperate search for distribution over the years. I called up Rush and I got to speak to Christian. I knew of Rush, obviously, but I didn't know any details. And I was like, hey, dude, I need a distribution deal. I'm looking for a distribution deal. And we talked for about a half hour and basically not interested. So he said, well, it's what he said. But he did show appreciation to some stuff I did. Four or five years later, maybe more, I'm not sure. I think something came across Holland, which was this record called House that I did with Gerd. And I guess, actually Gerd, I think he was working or is working in a Rush office for his own. And so the record was in his face somehow. And yeah, he called me out the blue. He said, hey, I have interest to release this. I said, what's this? He said, all your stuff. And I was like, really? And I was really kind of hesitant and just not thrilled at first. I didn't get it. I've been through this before. Gigolo was the first. And yeah, it didn't happen. And as it doesn't happen... You know, at the time, again, in the future, you see this is why this didn't happen or this could be why. And thank God this didn't happen. But at the time, it's that frustrated artist. Here I am as a yeah, as an artist, just making record after record after record after record. over years and years and years, but no full album. It was like, whoa. And it wasn't even a goal. After a while, I was like, okay, so what? No album. Who cares? People have said, you need a CD in today's society for people to take you serious. I said, that's bullshit. A CD doesn't make me. A record doesn't make me. So I don't feel that. But for people to see, it has to be packaged. And Rush did a great job. And I will say this. Rush did such a great job. In the future, that album will have a big impact, more than it will in this space. I know this. What makes you say that? I saw it. the best way to explain it. I saw it without going into details because first, as a seer, my idea doesn't matter. My thought doesn't matter. It's just, it's like you see a picture. I didn't make the picture. I saw the picture. And speaking on it, when someone can't fully understand that, it would sound probably a bit arrogant, what I saw. But again, I just saw it. It will happen. It's amazing. There was a word that kept getting thrown around. about the time of the release of the compilation, which was underappreciated. Have you felt underappreciated as an artist down the years? Musically, no. Successfully, financially, yes. And the deal, people who bought my first record, they probably bought the Rush album. They've always been there listening and supporting. So for me, and these people, many of them are dance music business leaders. That's what I know. And just even if you started DJing two years ago, somehow my music touches people who are very mature listeners. Nothing to do with age. So I have no problems. You know what I mean? It's like I understand it is a bit weird. It is a bit strange. It is a bit different. Those who like it a bit weird, strange, and different, you my peoples. You know what I mean? Because it's the same mindset. Now I see that mindset is growing, and it's growing bigger and bigger, and that has a lot to do with many things. So from that point of view, yeah, I have. it's cool. It's really cool with me. And then on the other side, I give you example when the rent is due. You know what I mean? And at this moment, it's like, even when you have money to pay, that's it. You know what I mean? That's all I have. I don't mean even if you have three times, 10 times over, I'm like, that's all I got. I have to be worried about rent and this and that. From that point of underappreciated, I'm like, because I know. It's not that my music was left out. Somebody else is living large from my work. See, that's the difference. If it was just the people who like it, me and you, cool. But when other people are sitting fat and you're not, and it's time to pay. What's next for you? I think it's going to be a shift into the DJ concert world. where it's something I've always done without knowing, and I think it very much has to be separated from club night, normal, but then again, not. Here's the deal. Where I'm going, more and more people are pushing mics to my face, please, which means, okay, vocal. with the vocal it's like uh yeah i'm a musician not a studio musician i'm a musician who plays so to actually play my songs because again most of my stuff hands-on could i do that for six minutes i never tried But it's coming. This is what I see. There's the pod orchestra. Do you know about that? Quartet. And it started a dream because I just love strings. Always loved strings. And years ago, the saxophone with the DJ, the singer with the DJ. Crankin' up, way up dimensions Bring a small orchestra I got f- Four lovely ladies. Four lovely ladies. Cello between the legs. Two of them. And two on violin. We're coming out. And it's going to be hot. I'm telling you. I like to move.
