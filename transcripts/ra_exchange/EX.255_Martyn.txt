Bye. Bye. Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Andrew Rice, and I'm the North American editor at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Martin. a Dutch producer who's been at it for 20 years now. He's been a key figure in Drum and Bass, Dubstep, and more recently, House and Techno, where he's known as a killer DJ and an adventurous producer. In a world often obsessed with subgenres and categories, Martin's draw is his diversity. When we met in Boston this past May for Together Festival, we talked about that, how to stay relevant in dance music, becoming a parent and moving to America. You can find a full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net or over at our SoundCloud at ra-exchange. Up next is an RA exchange with Martin. you The first thing I wanted to ask you is you moved to the US four years ago, or five years ago now, correct? A bit longer even, I think. Yeah, six, I think six years ago. It's a pretty unusual move to make for a dance music producer to move from Europe to the US. Why did you do that? It actually had nothing to do with music. Well, it has a little bit to do with music. Basically... I grew up in a place called Eindhoven in Holland and lived in Rotterdam for a little while and I met an American girl and we had a we have a relationship and she lived with me for a while and I just got really bored of Holland for some reason it also had a little bit to do with you know my DJing and I was traveling a lot more outside of the country and it just became a little bit too cramped for me. I was ready for something else and I traveled quite a bit in the US. and kind of liked it and decided to move here. What did you like about it? The space. Holland is very small and like literally in a lot of ways, you know, it's obviously a tiny little country with a lot of people inhabiting very small space. Basically, you know, if you would be on the train, in Holland there would not be a single minute where you wouldn't see something man-made, you know, because it was just full. I think also if you look at sort of Dutch inventions, for instance, there are always inventions for small things. You know, a Dutch person would invent something like a... something that would make, I don't know, a toilet roll holder, you know, more practical or something like that. You know, very small sort of ideas, good ideas, but they're always kind of small. And I think that has something to do with the country or with the space and the use of space as well. And also, Holland is also very flat. And it's really strange, but you don't really see a lot of depth in the countryside. You know, there's no mountains in the background. So you only see maybe a few miles away. You have no idea if it's 10 or 20 or 50, you know. So I came to the U.S. and I came to Virginia next to D.C. Obviously, I've seen mountains before, but... I saw mountains and much more room for things. There's all these people that are semi-hippies that have their own little thing going on somewhere in the mountains or whatever. And I was like, wow, this is pretty cool. That's something that you don't see that much in Holland because everything's so organized and so structured. I thought that was kind of inspiring, just to live in that area. And even though, you know, D.C. is also super corporate and, you know, government people and lots of defense and militaries. stuff and so you know it's not it's not the most sort of free-floating hippie place in the US but for me it was you know it was kind of inspiring just to see a completely different environment and obviously I still was traveling a lot to back and forth to Europe for gigs and stuff so it wasn't like I was really saying goodbye to Europe and never coming back you know I was there almost every month. So for me, it was just a nice sort of place to live and kind of chill away from sort of techno, just with people that do something completely different than me, you know? Not only moving to the US, but moving to a place like DC or near DC, which isn't like the usual place people would go and make music. Were you worried about how it might affect your career at all at first? No, because even when you live in Holland, you're kind of on the periphery of things as well. I mean, obviously Europe is quite a small space, but outside of London and Berlin... and maybe Paris or something, you know, those are the centers and everything else in Europe is basically also sort of on the outside, if you want to call it that, you know. So I was always on the outside. I was never in that center. So, you know, whether you are in D.C. or in Eindhoven, for me that didn't really make much of a difference. And, you know, to run a label and things like that, you know, that's where you have the internet for. So for those sort of things, you can do that anywhere in the world, you know. Do you feel like you're a part of the local scene in D.C. or do you kind of stay out of it? Originally, I stayed out of it also because I lived in the suburbs and sort of my commute to the airport was much more frequent than sort of the commute into the city. I am sort of trying to be of some sort of importance, you know, or to help out or do things, you know, like I play at U Street Music Hall in D.C. And, you know, I'm friends with a couple people there, you know, producers and people that run labels and a record shop. stuff like that. So I mean, I do try to sort of be involved as much as I can, you know, for a non-DC person. Do you feel like there's a healthy scene there for dance music? Yeah, and not just for dance music, but I think music in general, you know, it has a really vast history of mostly punk rock and things like that, and go-go. But yeah, there's always lots of bands playing and yeah, also on the electronic side, you know, you have Future Times and you have Thievery Corporation from way back. And there's just a bunch of, you know, producers that do stuff and a few labels popping up. So it's pretty cool. Has there been a change in the way you take in or absorb other dance music since you moved out of Europe? Listen to other music, you mean different styles? No, not that much. I think, I mean, nowadays, I think most people source their music on the internet. You don't really have that sort of... local music in that sense anymore. I mean, obviously you have local scenes, but it's not like there is music that you can only find in DC and you can only buy those records there. I think that's over. I mean, I always listen to quite a lot of different music anyway. And I think that just sort of, maybe it's a little bit broader, but I don't really think it had anything to do with my move. And you don't mind the schedule of going to Europe regularly? It's hard sometimes. But I mean, I have a daughter now, so it just makes it even more difficult. But for me, it's still worth it, although sometimes it doesn't make sense. But it's fine. Like I said, I think the quality of life is nice here and the sort of peace and quiet that I get while working here. I think, weighs up to, you know, moving back. Your daughter was born relatively recently, correct? Yeah, yeah. So how do you keep up the lifestyle of staying up late and DJing at parties and being a parent? Just no sleep. Just eliminate sleep altogether. Yeah, basically, that's it, you know. It's even when I'm making music and just working in the studio, I try to keep a really rigid schedule as well. So even before she was born, I already got up at 7. you know, make breakfast and just get in the studio, turn everything on and just work, work, work till four or something and just do that day after day after day. Yeah, and then when I go to Europe, actually, I'm never jet lagged because, you know, you just sort of move the schedule up six hours and that's when you're in Europe playing gigs. And then when you come back, you're back in your regular schedule again, you know. And, yeah, with a daughter, obviously, there is no sleeping in, or it doesn't exist anymore, you know? But it's, like I said, I mean, it's really worth it. There's really no other way for me. So, I mean, it's hard to not sleep maybe sometimes, but, you know, you'll have time for that later, to sleep. So you think you can be a good parent and still be like a world traveling party DJ? Yeah, yeah, I think but there's there's more people that you know, it's not just me I mean, there's plenty of people that that manage you, you know to find a way to do it or I mean It's I must say if we would have a support system here in the US it would be easier. You know, like a lot of people rely on family and obviously all my family is in Holland. So that's a bit of a problem sometimes. Apart from that, you just make it work or try and make it work. You mentioned staying up late. Obviously, you're used to staying up late. You've been DJing for well over 15, 20 years now. How do you keep yourself interested in DJing for so long? Just music and records. It's just so simple. But I also sort of quit. smoking and drinking and drugs and everything and basically I'm just sort of you know relying on music and just always being interested in finding new music and hearing really good DJs you know rock a party and also I'm also interested in the people that go to the party you know just to be able to provide them with something that's not just hands in the air all night long, but that they can walk away with something that... they've not heard before or you know a sort of exceptional experience of sorts you know that i could assist in i guess just things like that you know just that make it that makes it worth doing i think and it's and it's also super addicting djing for me just um every time i do it And every time I sort of stop, I'm just sort of thinking about the next gig. You know, I just always want to play more gigs. That's why I also prefer to play quite long, just to sort of space out my music a little bit more. Yeah, it's really addicting. How much do you plan your sets in advance? Nothing. I guess you do have a sort of a routine. Like my record bag is sort of an evolving story, you know, where I take things out that I... bored with and I put new things in there but you know there's also a core that sort of stays there for a while and so it's not like you know every set is completely random and I start all over again but it's not like I actually plan things but you have stuff in your head obviously especially if you play a lot of sets in a row then you know you have your sort of safety records you know, stuff that can sort of save you whenever you go a wrong direction or whatever, or whenever you see that people are just totally, you know, not feeling it, you know, so you have a couple of those, and you have a couple records that you want to keep till the end, you have a couple records that are good to sort of... pace yourself. I mean there's different types of records that you sort of classify in your head I guess. And I guess some people organize their bags like that as well you know. And yeah and that way you can without too much thinking you can just play for quite a while and it's not really pre-planned that way but... It's still, you know, you have a routine, obviously. What are some of your safety records, or is that a secret? No, it's not really a secret. Safety records are usually things that are, yeah, like sort of just nice techno records or nice house records, you know, that aren't too difficult or that don't really try something very new. Like a lot of the Trevino stuff that I put out on the label. I mean, because safety records, it sounds like it's kind of negative, you know, like it's sort of just an easy one, you know. But it's not like that at all. I mean, safety records can be really intelligent and really good too. But it's usually stuff that has a nice pace that doesn't really-- switch up too much, like a lot of Mr. G stuff I would classify as safety records or Trevino, like DJ Gregory or that Point G stuff. It's kind of not too much happening, good to sort of get away with something difficult and you just drop something like that after that. So it's definitely not a, it sounds kind of negative, I know, but... It's not really, yeah, it's actually a really smart record, you know. I would never be able to make my own safety records because I'm just way too ADD in the studio to produce music like that, you know, to just sort of pace it for 10 minutes. I would not be able to do that. So I guess it's a talent as well. or a skill. - I haven't seen you DJ in a while. Are you using vinyl now or CDJ still or what's your setup like? - Just vinyl and USB sticks, yeah. I used Serato for a long time, for about maybe six years. I started using it when I came-- to the US first because I was too scared to travel with records. And in the beginning, you know, I didn't have a visa and I wasn't like very pro about everything. So I just took my laptop. And that's how I crossed the border. So that's really the reason why I started using Serato. And I just stuck to it. And I did like the feeling of having so many different records with me at one time. And you can sort of move around. You can go every direction you want. You can play long without having issues or whatever. So I always sort of saw it as an advantage. But after a couple of years, the sound started to annoy me a little bit, especially playing before or after people that were just playing vinyl. It just sounded thinner and it's just a little bit different, I guess. And then the other thing that started to annoy me a tiny bit was that Serato itself didn't really develop as much. It always stayed... this sort of idea of taking a laptop into the club. While for instance Pioneer with their CDJs and their USB sticks or SD cards, they basically almost do the same thing as Serato now. And I was always hoping for sort of an iPad version of Serato or just something that makes it easier to not have that stupid laptop there where you have to sort of look on all the time like you're checking your email or something like that. So I really started to hate that part of DJing, you know? Because all the times you look at the screen, you're not actually looking into the crowd or you're not actually looking at your records. So yeah, after a while, I just gave it up. I was like, maybe it's just time to stop. And at that time also, a lot of music came out that was just vinyl only. And I started buying more and more records again. And obviously, I had to sort of restart my collecting. in the US. So I started buying more records again and then instead of ripping them and then putting them in my laptop, I just started carrying the records again, you know? And one thing led to another and now I'm just sort of back at vinyl. Did going back to vinyl change the way you approach sets? Yeah. Yes, a lot, because like I said, I'm quite sort of an ADD type person, and I think with too much choice, I also was maybe in some sets a little bit too random. Because there's so much music to choose from and just the possibility of going everywhere doesn't necessarily mean you have to go everywhere. And sometimes I did that. Sometimes it's like, oh, I have this African record. It needs to be played too because I have it. And it's actually not necessary. And when I started playing vinyl again, you actually... limit your choice to you know what is what is it 50 records or 80 or however many you take with you and it actually makes your sets maybe a little bit more focused and the other thing I like about playing vinyl is that you really have to plan ahead when you go to a gig you know it's like okay i go to middlesex lounge i know what this place looks like i know kind of what the vibe is but you never really know until you actually get there you know so what am i going to bring and with serato i never did that you know because you always have the same laptop same stuff there's a lot of stuff but you know there was no focus and i think being a little bit more conscious about what you bring to the club and what you're gonna play at the club I think it makes you a little bit better DJ you know and I actually like learning and I like trying to become better even even though I've been doing this for a long time you know just selection wise you can always become better I think yeah it sort of rekindled my my love for djing as well i think just bringing good old records you know and enjoying myself the other thing also is that um With Serato, I always had like 20 minutes of stress before the gig because you get there and it's like, okay, where do I put my laptop? Where's the power outlet? How am I going to sort out these cables while the other guy is playing? It's all this sort of like, it has nothing to do with music, but you're sort of trying to get everything sorted for yourself and then the first mix is always like, oh. I hope nothing crashes or the needles don't skip or maybe my records are dirty. There's all these little sort of things in your head and you're like, hey, you're supposed to be here to play tunes. With bringing records, I basically show up, I just listen to the music and then when the guy's done, I take my first record, I put it on and that's it. It's so much less stress than using something like Serato. I know I'm completely slating Serato now, but it's... Obviously, this is also a personal choice. For me, it was a good time to stop that and start something else. So vinyl, for me, is now a really nice and inspirational medium, I guess. And then the USB stick is sort of an extra handy thing for new music, stuff that's not out yet. Things that are still in the mail. You've also played live sets in the past. Yeah. What was that experience like for you? Completely different from DJing. First of all, because it's all my own music. And usually when I DJ, I don't really play that much of my own stuff. Usually I'm just more excited by other people's music. obviously live it's all the focuses on your own stuff and it's kind of interesting because I think Like a lot of my music has a certain atmosphere or a certain vibe and also a certain energy level. But if you play an hour of that, it's kind of boring if you have the sort of same energy level, you know. So you have to figure out ways to have sort of a tension curve or something, you know. You have to build it up to a sort of climax or something. It actually changed a little bit the way I make music as well because you need different songs for different parts of your life set, basically. So it ended up being another sort of learning experience, I guess. And I still play live once every while. I try to sort of keep it a little bit separate from the DJing side of things because it's very confusing playing DJ and live sets, you know, one after another because it's such a different thing. And yeah, it's not easy, you know, DJing on Friday, playing live on Saturday and then DJing again on Sunday. It's really the sort of, yeah, mindset is very different. So I tried to sort of keep it separate and do like a live tour, you know, play 10 gigs of live sets or something like that. Do you like playing live? I mean, in the beginning, I didn't because, you know, I was very sort of self-conscious about my own music and how it sounded and, you know. But now it's kind of fun. It also had to do with you have to find a right setup. works for you, you know, that it sort of leaves a little bit to chance so you can freestyle in your lifestyle but it also has a little bit of stability so, you know, if you sort of lose your way then at least you can just press one button to get back into the groove, you know. But once you find a nice way of working, that gives you a bit of freedom. Yeah, it's actually quite fun. On the subject of productions, your last album featured quite a few collaborations and you've also done the project with Steffi. But it seems like in the past you haven't done that many collaborations. What changed? I guess it also has to do with being self-conscious about your music. When I started making music, I didn't really think it was all that... amazing you know it was usually other people that would tell me okay you know you should put this out on a record or i was never really that sure about it and then i think i was also quite protective about my music even to the point that i was like well you know if i collaborate with people it just feels like they're invading my space you know and maybe also my ideas in a way. And I was like, you know, I kind of like my own ideas and, you know, maybe to have someone else in the studio and sort of see how I do it. I don't know. I didn't feel, it didn't feel right. And then I think something changed when I sort of hung out with the sort of brain feeder lot, Flying Lotus and people like that. And they were always like, okay, collaborate, collaborate, collaborate, because everything you do together with other people, they bring energy into the story. You give them energy to sort of exchange that. is just really healthy, you know, and it's very, it will actually help you instead of, you know, it's not like people are stealing your skills or whatever and then running off with them and then making all your stuff. You know, it's not like that at all. It's basically... you know, if you share this experience with people, it'll actually help both sides, you know. Even though I saw, you know, people like Fly Low just collaborate with everyone and actually bring really good results as well. I was still not really sure, but, you know, I just thought I'd give it a go and try it out and see what happens. So I did one for the last album, I did a thing with Fortet and I worked with... with Inga Copeland and then I worked with Steffi, which it's three really different people and also the sort of studio dynamic is very, very different from each other. But yeah, everything just felt like it added something to my knowledge and my inspiration and I hope it did that for them as well. I think it did. So yeah, that's really... what collaborating should be about, I guess. And I'm still not a huge advocate of it because I also think a lot of collaborations are more like sort of, you know, you just add up. the numbers and then you get something else and it's not, it not, not always works. Like there's plenty of collaborations that sound really amazing on paper, but then if you would actually hear the result, you're like, yeah, it's all right. It's not, you know, it's not actually a sum of the parts. So, so I still think it's, you have to choose very carefully who you work with and, you know, also be really strict about. If it doesn't work, I just stop it and just not do it. But yeah, I must say that the last few things that I've actually collaborated on... And sort of open myself up as well, you know, not be too protective of my own music and just, you know, give them stuff. They give me stuff and we work together. And yeah, that works really well. With Steffi, you've released an EP and I hear you have more on the way. What makes her such a good partner for you? Well, maybe it's, there's probably sort of a cultural aspect to it. Because we're both Dutch, and so we speak the same mother tongue, and it just makes it a little bit faster to communicate, I guess. She's even from the same area as me, so we even have the same dialect. So that's kind of one thing. The other thing is also that she has a really good work ethic. while I sort of free float a little bit sometimes in the studio and also waste time. Well, I don't know if I actually waste time, but some days I don't do anything useful and other days I do a lot. but she's much more sort of steady. Every day she does sketches, she makes beats, she does things. So I like that steadiness to it. It's like she keeps me awake in a way. So it's a good way. And then the other thing is also that we're so different in making music. I started with... just a laptop and quite software oriented and slowly moved towards more analog equipment. But she is pretty old school when it comes to making techno. You know, there's a big studio. It has the classic drum machines. It has the classic synths. That's how we do it, you know. And for me, a lot of that stuff is brand new. I mean, I know how a drummer... machine works but yeah there's a lot of things that I have no idea about you know running a full-on analog studio so and then there's also things that I do in software that she's never seen before so it's kind of cool to you know show each other these things and and yeah and I think both are sort of rooted in Detroit techno and in that sort of sound that's when we started listening to music to electronic music. So we have those roots and so it's kind of easy to talk to each other about what we want because we have the same references. It strikes me that you haven't released much of your own music on your own label in a long time. Why is that? I don't know. Well, I... I started the label to just release my own music, basically, because I signed stuff to other people, and when you sign a record to another label, even though you might think it's really urgent that this record will be in the record shops, a lot of people just do things their own way. So I always got sort of pissed off with... labels because they took so long and you know they always had a schedule and you have to wait for the next release and then you have to come after so it was always pain in the ass basically and I thought you know if I start my own label at least you know when I finish the track I can send it to mastering tomorrow in two months it's in the shop that was the original intent of the label and that worked really well for a while and then I think I was maybe lured away a little bit by other labels and people wanted me to do things for them, remixes or an album like Brainfeeder or Ninja Tune. It's kind of nice working just as a musician and not as a label owner. and just having other people taking care of everything and just be a musician, just spend time in the studio and just be flaky or whatever when you want to. So I did like, I thought that was appealing and I think that's also a reason why I work. with a lot of other labels. I always try to sort of be careful about which labels, you know, would be only labels that I really enjoy its output or the people behind it or, so I never really regretted any choices or anything like that. After a while, 3024 became much more of an outlet for people that I thought were interesting or people that did maybe something different. I think that was a really healthy period of the label when we put out records by Mosca, Jacques Green, John Convex. First Trevino record, that sort of stuff. Because those people really were trying to do something different or trying to make something especially for the label. And I think those records, I'm really proud of all those records. They're all really good still, I think. And then I was at another point in the label's history where I was like, well, I can do... two things i can make this label much bigger and do albums and you know become sort of like a hyperdup style label with a bunch of artists and a roster and label nights and things like that but um i just didn't really feel like me either you know i'm just maybe not too organized enough for it so Now the label is kind of weird. It's kind of a mix of collaborations, some stuff that's hard to find for people that I reissued. I have a couple sort of new people on there, like Leon Vinal, who's done really well last year. So yeah, it's kind of freestyle now. There's not really a good concept behind the label at the moment. But I'm always like, well, as long as it's all high-quality records, then I'm going to be okay, you know? So you're not worried about the label not really having that much of an identity anymore? I think it still has an identity. is me and that you know everything that I like is on the label there's not really any sort of rush to release stuff just to stay relevant or to to sort of you know vibe with a certain sound that's trendy at the moment or you know there's none of that it's just all music that I'm behind music that I like to play out and that's basically the the identity I think Yeah, but at the same time, it's quite freestyle at the moment. Is there a reason the releases have slowed down on the label at all? Or has there been a slowdown, or am I just imagining that? It's probably, yeah, it's a bit slow, but that's, yeah, if I don't find anything that I like, then I'm just really not that bothered about putting anything out. You know, I don't want to be one of those labels that has to put a record out every month or because that just seemed really boring. So yeah, if there's no good music out, then I'm not doing anything. I don't know, it's kind of random, to be honest. I quite like just having a... It's kind of like a nice side project. It's a thing that I can work on when I want to and when I feel like it. Sometimes I don't. I just go in my own little musician bubble or in my DJ bubble and then not really that bothered with it, I guess. I would say like... Five or six years ago, you were kind of at the crossroads of dubstep and techno, and you're at the head of a certain movement. And at this point, you have kind of settled into your own Martin sound, Martin bubble. Do you worry about staying relevant? Or are you comfortable where you are? I think I'd be lying if I would never think about that. But maybe that has more to do with age or with how long you're sort of in a certain scene, you know? And I mean, not that I want to call myself a veteran or an old guy or whatever, but... I have been doing this for quite a while. I started DJing in 1995 and production in 2003 or 2004 or something. So it's been a while. And I guess a lot of the music that I've made... has also been significantly placed in certain scenes and genres and things like that. Although I never really see it that way myself, I guess when you're a little bit older, you sort of look back and you're like, oh yeah, the dubstep days, I did this and this and this. Not that I was really doing that at that time, because I was just making tunes. But if you look back at it, it's actually, you sort of believe your own sort of history or people like you make this, write this history down and then it's there. So yeah, I do look back and I guess relevance, what's relevance? let's just call it by name, you know, if there's like the heyday of dubstep and you make a couple big tunes and you get a lot of hype and you get a lot of press and you play all these festivals and blah blah blah, but is that relevant? Is that relevant? I don't know, you're sort of on a hype and maybe your name is on everyone's lips or whatever, but I think relevance, you can only sort of talk about that maybe five years after the fact, you know? Like if I look back at dubstep now, there's maybe four or five people that I think really shaped the music. And the rest of those relevant people, they weren't really that relevant. And I think that goes for most genres. It was the same in drum and bass, and it's the same in whatever. So yeah, so I think relevant is very... subjective, I guess. And I think nowadays I just like to make music that I like and I know that I can represent. And I think the relevance of it will maybe show through in five years or not. Do you ever get nostalgic about the drum and bass days or the dubstep days? Not about dubstep because... For me, I wasn't really in that world. I mean, the music, like I said earlier, the music that I made was sort of classified as. And it was only after it was classified as that I got to play nights like Forward or DMZ. So I was actually injected into it. quite late, you know, while the people that actually shaped it, you know, the Malas or Scream or Hatcher, you know, those sort of people, I can imagine them thinking back about, you know, the early days of dubstep or whatever. For drum and bass, it's a little bit different for me because I was actually there relatively early, although I was very much sort of based in Holland and I started doing just drum and bass events before I DJed at them. And yeah, I'm nostalgic about the events and about sort of the experience of, I don't know, having Goldie play at my night or those sort of things, like real memories. So yeah, for me, that's completely different from dubstep. I've noticed a lot of artists playing old school DJ sets, either for... or Drum and Bass through Jungle, is that something you've ever considered or interested in? - No, no. Purely for the reason that, yeah, I think every DJ set, I mean, I do play a lot of old music, but I don't think it's good to sort of limit yourself and do an old school set, 'cause you also automatically label yourself as an old person. Not that I'm fighting the old age, but it's much more that... No, it's not interested. interesting for me is I just want to do new things you know and play new music and that sort of that was always sort of the the common thread you know in all my music I think and in everything I've ever done is like okay I want to show people new stuff you know so it would just be really weird to you know go dig in my old drum and bass records and then you know play a 2002 set or or a 1995 set, it's weird. - As someone who was kind of injected into Dubstep, you moved to the US right around the time that Dubstep exploded into EDM and then EDM exploded. - To what? - I just exploded. I noticed in an interview last year, you said that you felt like EDM had moved out of the clubs into festivals and so that clubs in the U.S. were good again or were getting better. Yeah. and kind of left that realm. Can you expand on that at all? Yeah, because when I moved to the US, I got to play a lot of dubstep, in quotation marks, nights. And some of these nights were really great, and I would play with people coming from the UK, and we would have really amazing nights. But more and more... I ended up warming up for people that would play proto-EDM or something that's now, it was then called Brostep. Yeah, so I would play these nights and I just got really depressed because I would play for two hours, try and do all these new things, play like hot new 2-5-6-2 records and all that. And people enjoyed it. They were like, yeah, this is great. And then the first record the next guy would play would be like this sort of enormous wobbly bass explosion. with horror samples and build-ups and all that. And it just sort of completely takes away the effect of whatever I had been doing the two hours before that. And yeah, it's like, why am I here doing this? So I actually stopped playing gigs for a while in the US or be very selective with gigs because... I was like, you know, I don't really want to do that. Like we were talking about this earlier, I played this Detroit music festival, and I played, and then Aftermuse Excision from Canada. And it's the same thing, you know, like my face when that guy started his first track. It was like amazing. I'd never heard about him before. So I was like, well, what is this, you know? So yeah, after a while I was like, this is just not right. This is not what I want to do. I'd rather just fly a little bit more to Europe and just play nice gigs in Europe. So I really had a rough time. And then, yeah, I think EDM got bigger and bigger and bigger. And it actually, I said that before as well once, it actually became sort of rave music, you know, much more so for outdoor festivals. And I sort of compared it to the new metal. wave of music maybe 10, 15 years earlier. The sort of Limp Bizkit and that Linkin Park and all that sort of kind of emo-y metal stuff that a lot of college kids liked. EDM sort of took that place now. And that actually freed the clubs up to go back to just, you know, quality club nights. And I also think that the last few years there's been a lot of new clubs coming up and a lot of people taking, promoting more serious and getting good talent in. So I think, yeah, there's a lot of, it's actually improving a lot at the moment. As someone who works as an electrician, electronic music artist in the US. Do you feel like EDM in general has changed the way the general population thinks about electronic music? - Yeah, yeah, a little bit. Although, I must say, Europe is not that much better. I mean, the difference, I think, is that if in Europe you walk into a Mango, or, you know, like a clothing store, like a Zara or something, you'll hear electronic music, while if you do that in the US, you won't. You know, you'll hear rock music. So the basis of that sort of mainstream... sound you hear in the street is different. But I mean, in Holland there's plenty of people that if you go in a taxi and you're like, oh yeah, I'm a DJ, they're like, oh, you're famous like Tiesto. And I guess that's the same in the US now. That sort of taxi level, that's here now as well. Which is kind of funny. Maybe a big difference is that... In Holland or in Europe, they would ask what kind of music you play, and here they ask Are you famous? So there is a sort of cultural difference. What's important? What kind of music? Or if you actually make lots of money with it. So it has changed a little bit over the years, I think. And people here, people that have nothing to do with electronic music, they now recognize that there is something like electronic music with all the good and bad things that come with it. What are some of your favorite places to play in the US? Boston. Aside from Boston. New York. Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, Miami, and Canada. Most cities in Canada are nice. Have you gotten less selective with your gigs? It depends. It depends a lot on what the offers are. Sometimes you get a lot of stuff and you can turn down things. other times you're you know you have a lot less going on it depends a lot on like you know if you have an album there's a lot more people that want to get you so you can be selective and you can choose the right places. Now I'm sort of in between albums and now it's basically just writing and working with promoters that I always play for, that I play for regularly. Like here or in Miami, for instance, I come back. a couple times a year. So you just sort of keep a lower profile for a while until there's another album and then you just crank it up again. Do you feel like at this point you're pressured to be constantly putting out music in order to get more gigs? Or can you subside without releasing anything for a while? I mean, I'm quite slow. in general. You know, if I sort of see my own Discogs list, you know, the first couple years I did lots of 12 inches and then I did albums and it just slowed down a lot. But I don't know, I am actually sort of working on getting a bit more sort of regular schedule just because I'm also making music a lot more now. It's actually fun to just do 12 inches again. Albums are really big projects and they usually are very taxing. So you work on something for maybe eight months or whatever. That's usually sort of how long I'm in the studio for something. And then after those eight months, there's about six months of preparation before the actual release. Then there's a tour. So it's quite a long... stretch you know it's maybe 15 months that you're actually working on one project and um you know 12 inches are so much easier you know it's basically a couple weeks in the studio and when you're happy you put out the record and that's it and you go on to the next so at the moment i'm i'm actually on that tip a little bit where where i'm like well you know i do shorter projects and uh It's more fun. It's also easier to manage now, you know, with family situation and things like that to just do these little things until I'm ready again for an album. So you've been DJing. for 20 years producing for over a decade and you have like your schedule down to like a night if I work day yeah are you gonna keep making music kind of boring isn't it I got it all down it's done but do you think you'll keep doing it for the rest of your life I don't know you know besides all this you know there's much more to me than just you know the music side of things I guess you know I studied something completely different like literature and I wrote a little bit and you know now I'm studying again political science this is a completely different thing and I don't know I always like this sort of renaissance man idea you know where You do different things and you're trying to be good at everything. So maybe after a while I'll find something that crosses over from music or from something cultural to something political or something social. I have a few sort of social issues that I work with. that I try to support and yeah I think you know just in order to sort of give back a little bit as well you know I think that's really important in being an artist that whatever you acquire you also do something useful well do something beautiful with it for one but also do something useful with you know try and sort of give back to people in one way or another whether it being you know supporting young artists with your sort of experience or your knowledge you know charity or lectures or you know classes like like this sort of initiative you know i think those things are really interesting to do and i think it's also kind of the time for it now what are the social issues you work with or work for? Like, I raise money for an initiative in Baltimore. It's called Holistic Life. Basically, they, in short, they teach yoga to kids. from sort of those areas that have been in the news the last few weeks. So things like that. And also I'm sort of interested in political issues and international relations, things like that. Like I said, I think it's really important to... yeah, to do something with what you have acquired and I wish more people would sort of, you know, forget about the selfies a little bit and that sort of thing and consider other options of what to do with your experience and your traveling. Do you think electronic music is lacking in social awareness or political awareness at all? Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think a lot of the culture is about, you know, ego or about the people that make the music or the DJs. And I think it's not really, it's more about the people in the room, I think. and what they do and what they think and what their daily issues are, for instance, you know, and why they're at the club and what you can provide. And that's actually a much more interesting thought. I think then, you know, pictures of airports and that sort of thing. Although, you know, I have made pictures of airports myself. So I admit that. But yeah, you know, it's sometimes if I look at my sort of Twitter or Facebook or whatever and you see all these DJs doing all the same lifestyle and I mean it's... maybe from the outside it's maybe sort of cool but you know it's really only cool for a couple weeks you know and then after that it's just a lifestyle you know so yeah so I wish I wish more people would sort of stand up do something you know like I play at Panorama Bar quite regularly now and They also have a sort of social component to the club. And, you know, they actually raise money for a lot of really good things. And they do benefit nights and stuff like that. And I think that's, you know, that's amazing. That's the direction that I think we should go into. I'll be dreaming because We are vanity, separate man from the devil inside, is this inside? Nerves bound heart like a frequent recollection, personality, us deceiving, parasitical nature is the human savior, an imitation, fumbling and fussing as we fake behavior, we imitate, mad, we know the jar, we are superhuman, superhuman. Unlocking the code is our only chance. Do you believe in me?
