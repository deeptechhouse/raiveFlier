you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Today we'll be taking stock of the year that was with an all-star cast of music nerds at our Critics' Roundtable home in Berlin, Man Made Mastering. First up, I'm joined by RA Associate Editor Ryan Keeling, who is currently in town from our London office. Ryan, how are you finding Berlin? It's pretty cold, and it's also pretty German. Thank you for that very brief response. And Philip, you will soon not be in Berlin. Philip Sherburn, sorry, RA, freelancer extraordinaire. Where are you heading off to? That's right, Todd. I'm headed to Barcelona next week. After four years in Berlin, the time has come to say fairly well. Can't even say that in German. So yeah, back to Barcelona and see what happens next. And we're also joined by Will Lynch, who's our news editor. Will, where are you going to be spending the holidays this year? I'm going back to Boston. to enjoy the exact same combination of frozen rain, sleet, and black slush, things like that. Well, sounds like everything's coming up Sherburn this year. As part of our Critics Roundtable at the end of the year, we basically go through some of the same polls that we go through on the site at the end of the year, looking at some of the top DJs, albums, labels, etc. We were going to go ahead and get started with DJs, I think. And Ryan, when we sent around an email... Trying to sort of get some discussion topics, one of the DJs that you picked out that I found really interesting was Lee Burridge. Why was he at the top of your list as someone to talk about in 2012? Well, maybe it's helpful to point out at the beginning that Lee came in at number 39 this year, and I think he's pretty much been within the top. 100 since we've been doing this thing without going into the specifics just yet um i think what i've always found pretty fascinating about lee is that he kind of exists in this place outside of the um like traditional channels of pr and press like it's very it's very infrequently that you you see the name lee burridge in your inbox you have nobody really hassling you over his records and I just don't think he's a guy who's ever been hustling in that way. He's almost done it by himself in that he's built up this network of parties and promoters around the world. And he's not necessarily playing at all the kicking clubs in any given city, but he's just elevated himself to this position that people just seem to gravitate towards him. The thing that I find so interesting, at least about the last couple of years, is that it's what he's done is... just super mellow. The all day I dream of parties are at least in my mind typified by this like not quite, not as hard as inner visions almost, which is like saying something. Yeah, I'd be slightly cautious of taking that as a kind of statement on him as a DJ. I mean, obviously that party is pretty heavy, conceptually driven. But I think the reason that he immediately sprang to mind, it was actually one of the first DJ sets I saw of the year. It was at BPM Festival. It was in Mexico. It was in Mexico, yeah. It was the first time I'd seen him for a couple of years. And it was certainly the first time I'd been to one of these All Day Our Dream parties. So I think they've just been Brooklyn and LA based up until now. He's kind of taking it on the road. But I mean, from the very beginning of the afternoon, it was a free beach party, but it was very clear that they thought very, very deeply about the way they were going to present this thing. There were like lanterns and like lots of low hanging drapes all over the beach. He told me that they'd shipped in like lots of production. They had a small team working on it. And, I mean, not only that, most importantly, the music felt very much in line with what you would have expected when they set out to do this thing. I think he said at the very beginning, when we ran a news piece about the Labour and the party, that they were looking to push beautiful, melancholic house music. That was exactly what you got. Now, that in itself, maybe you'd say, wasn't particularly impressive. But I think Lee was the only DJ I saw at the entire festival who was actually playing to their surroundings. It wasn't like you go to see a certain DJ, you know what they were going to bring and they bought it. He was actually reacting to his surroundings in a way that the set was mirroring what the sun was doing. Now it got to, I don't know, the sun was maybe setting about eight o'clock and it just went down to the drip of a kick drum. Like it was almost the opposite approach that you'd expect. Maybe you're expecting lots of color around sunset, but they took it down to this. So they kept reducing the tempo and reducing the tempo and just took it down to this steady drip of a kick drum and then just slowly built it back up again over the next two hours. I just think for me, seeing a DJ react in that way would kind of... I don't know. It just speaks to the number of years that he's been doing it, I think, and how deeply he's thinking about these things. And I think with these concept parties, they're very often going off message, so it's really nice to see a concept that actually delivers. Will, you're a DJ. It's a duo, I guess, of a trio. Pangea and Pearson Sound are the two guys you picked. Why did you pick them out of everyone? Well, I guess I thought it'd be a good opportunity to sort of like give them a nod because neither one of them ended up in our top 100 poll, which I sort of see as kind of a fluke of how that sort of thing works because Ben UFO was 21. Ben UFO also runs Hassel Audio. So Ben UFO, Pangea, and Pearson Sound are a trio in a couple of different ways. They run the label together. As far as I know, they all sort of share responsibility in the label. And they often DJ together. And one of my best DJ sets of the year, maybe the best, I don't know. was the three of them doing sort of an extended back-to-back at free rotation. I guess I just feel like all three of them are really cut from the same cloth. They all have a pretty similar level of music knowledge and technical skill. And at the same time, they all bring something a little bit different. I feel like Ben UFO is the most esoteric, or he'll play kind of the sort of weird curveballs. And Pearson Sound is, from what I've seen, sort of has the best ability to deliver in a party sense. Like that night he did this, you know, really outrageous spin back on some old Speed Garrosh track. And then Panjay is kind of like... weirdest one as far as I know. Maybe they all swap on different nights or something. But in any case, I just think the fact that Ben UFO was all the way up at 21 and the other two weren't even on it, it's kind of interesting to me. I mean, it's a shame because in my opinion, there's just no doubt that those other two are some of the best. They're within that bracket of the top 100 DJs of the world. But I don't know. I guess it just makes me wonder what is it that makes when you have these DJs that are kind of all in a group together, what makes one of them stand out so much next to the other two? Strangely enough, in my own top five, Ben UFO is my number one, and the other two weren't in my top five. So you're the problem. Yeah, so it's like whatever this kind of weird phenomenon is, I am an example of it. I wonder if it's just a constant sort of... beating of the drum of Ben UFO is the DJ and he only DJs. Right. And so even when you see him DJ, you're like yeah he's just a dj yeah right that that alone kind of causes you to think of him as the real virtuoso of the of the trio which i don't think is necessarily true you know like i said i think they're all kind of on a similar level but yeah i think pearson sound um and panjay you know their production so well that i don't know yeah i mean i don't know how much bearing it would have on the readership necessarily but um ben's usually the one who helms their rinse show so he's doing been doing that on the most frequent basis yeah um that's and that's probably the thing that made him my number one just because he was a he was a consistent presence in my life you know i saw pearson sound and panjaya once over the whole year and i only saw it well i saw him twice i guess but i heard him dj pretty often Another thing that I thought was interesting was the announcement for his fabric mix came out. The mix was announced the day before the polls opened. I guess I just wonder if that alone could have had a significant impact on the whole thing. his name being fresh in everyone's mind that you know news stories on the home page at the same time as a story about you know vote for your favorite DJ I know I think it's interesting to think about so PR companies next year take note right around November is when you want to be announcing your mix CD Bye. you The DJ I picked was Fatima Al-Qadiri, who I saw at Unsound Festival this year. I think for me, and I assume this is something that's along the same lines of everyone here, you go to a party and you sort of know who you want to see as a music writer. You're sort of like, okay, I'm going to go see this person. And I know kind of what I'm going to get, but I'm ready for a good time. And she was the one person that I completely didn't know about, wasn't prepared to see, had no preconceptions, and went into it and had my mind basically blown. The surroundings helped, which was this old sort of abandoned, basically, hotel in Poland that was opened for the first time in 10 years for this party. So that was part of it. Context, certainly. But the... The sound of the set especially seemed like the realization of what I had heard on an earlier mix this past year by Bok Bok from Night Slugs, who did this really amazing online mix which put together, you know, LaVon Vincent, Grime tracks, House tracks, and... in my mind I was sort of like well this is amazing to listen to but I can't imagine just dancing to it for you know 70 minutes straight like it was just kind of you know all over the place but somehow fitting together and things that felt maybe a little bit too abstract, but somehow just she kept it in. And I was really amazed the entire time. I think for me, though, the big point of her set more than anything else was context. If you get the right night at the right place with the right DJ, it really doesn't matter what they're playing as long as it just fits together in the right way. And continually, every single year, my favorite DJ set of the year is usually something that I wasn't expecting going in at all. Todd, did you know a lot of the tracks that she was playing? Because I tend to think of her as kind of representing the scene, you know, the DIS or DIS magazine scene, you know, and the kind of high-def stuff. I get the sense of it's kind of a little world apart, you know? It's like 140 BPM sometimes, but it's kind of own parallel universe to a lot of other things going on. Yeah. I was curious if... what she played intersected with kind of other scenes. It felt like stuff that I should know what it was. And it felt like stuff that was, in my mind at least, was not Night Slugs but sounded related to it. Fade to mind maybe? Yeah, exactly. And then she threw in grime tracks and house tracks sped up and it was just, it was one of those things where it was the perfect tempo to throw all these different things in and for it to completely not tear you away from, you know, what was going on. She's quite a, you know, I've read some interviews with her and she's quite conceptual and talks a lot about genres and trying to, you know, decontextualize them or recontextualize them, depending on where you're coming from. and it could have been a very academic exercise, but it very much wasn't, and I think that was also a really big part of it. It spoke to a lot of music nerd pleasure centers, basically. Your pick, Philip, for the DJ was also an unsound this year, I think, unless you saw him in a different place. Yeah, my pick was from Unsound. It was Theo Parrish. And I'm not going to tell you all anything you probably don't know already. I'm late jumping on the Theo Parrish is the best DJ in the world bandwagon, but I'd never gotten to see him play before this. And I'd heard lots about Theo as a DJ in terms of he has off nights, he can be kind of cantankerous. A lot of people going into this were like, oh, you never know with Theo. He's going to be... You know, he could just play like slow jam, R&B slow jams all night long and clear the floor. And again, it was at Unsound. It was in this like communist era hotel with like a low wooden ceiling. The room was fantastic. It was a low ceiling, long kind of lobby space, carpeted. I thought it was going to be terrible sound. And it was whatever they did to the place was amazing. And he played, I think I caught him for three or three and a half hours. I don't know what time exactly it started, maybe three. And I was dancing till 6.30 in the morning. I came in when he was playing, I think, The Choice off of KMS. And that's just one of my all-time favorites. So I was super excited about that. And then over the course of his set, I just, I mean, it was everything that I kind of hoped I would get out of one of his sets. You know, it was playing tons of soul and disco. There seemed to be very little quantized music in there. I mean, very little with a drum machine that I heard. It seemed to be mostly live band stuff, and yet the mixes were so seamless, I had no idea when things were beginning and ending. uh he really leaned hard on the eq um i mean he loves that thing you know and so like when there'd be like a sax solo or a good vocal or something he just like filter it all the way up so it's just a little bit of shit and then kind of bang it back in i think he uses his own isolators yeah exactly and so i mean he he worked those really hard during the course of the night i recognized almost nothing he he played um outcasts Spotty, Oddy, Dopealicious, which is also one of my favorite songs in the entire world and a song I can't remember ever hearing a DJ play. And I just lost my mind. It was just one of those moments where you're like, oh, my God, this DJ knows me. And then later in the night, he played what I believe is a Robert Glasper experiment or Robert Glasper experience. cover version of Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit. And I'd read that Theo was playing this Smells Like Teen Spirit cover, and I'd thought to myself, reading forums, you know, that sounds like a terrible idea. And it was so compelling, and it worked so well. And in context, you had no, there was not a doubt in your mind that that was exactly the best song to hear in the world at that moment, which for me is what... a good DJ should do, you know? I mean, he just, he had me in his, the palm of his hand. How long did he play for in total that evening? I mean, it had to be three or three and a half hours because I came in, I think around three in the morning and. I don't think he finished until about 6.30. And by the end, I was stone cold sober. I was dying to go to the bathroom. But there was just no way I was going to leave the dance floor to either get a beer or go take a whiz. So I was just like there, like rooted to the dance floor. I mean, it's kind of testament to the regard in which he's held that they would give him that long a festival. Yeah, yeah, totally. I mean, he had the closing slot for the room one. And I think he was running a little late start or they were running a little bit late starting. But yeah, I mean, in my recollection, he closed out about 630 in the morning and I stumbled out into the fog of Krakow, just kind of. disoriented out of my mind. I should add that the fog of Krakow, like after you left this hotel, it was kind of wondrous to just like literally leave this place and be plunged into mist and just be like, I can't see anything. You could barely see your hand in front of you. And there was this white hot air balloon that's like a tourist attraction. that was anchored on the banks of the river. And so as you walked out of this hotel, the hot air balloon was just kind of floating in the mist in front of you. It was very surreal, especially for a sober experience, just like, where am I? A group that actually Philip and I both saw, I think, at Unsound, but that Ryan wanted to talk about as we move on to live acts, is Reim. And I think I saw them at the same place in London that he saw them by accident this year, which was the Henry Purcell Room, right? Tell me about that performance. Yeah, so we hosted Reim as part of our evening at ETHER Festival. As you say, they were playing in the Purcell room. We did a kind of two-section show that evening, and we had them in early. And then before them, we had Echo Clef and Bass Clef doing their Echo Clef thing. So it was kind of like lots of guitar pedals. I think Ralph was playing trombone as well that night. So it set the stage in a kind of off-key manner, but they were debuting their new audio-visual show that evening, so we'd managed to get the full projector screen up for them. So you're talking about a seated 250 capacity space. Having spent a bit of time with them... and the label Black is Ever Black that they're with. I have to say I was, although they were very enthusiastic about the performance beforehand and the type of environment they were presenting it in, I was skeptical, I have to say. It was early evening, I was thinking more of grimy spaces and what that might feel like to stand in a nightclub. But I think it was one of those rare occasions in which the visual element was just as important as the musical element. They set it up so that they were very much in the background of what was going on. It was very, very dark. They were stood, their heads were just poking above the bottom of the... of the projection screen and um i don't think i heard anybody move for the hour that they played that people felt strapped to their seats aside from me coming in yes after the first song um so the visuals themselves they i believe they sent someone a brief to lisbon for three days i think they did three days in an evening and the premise was they were in a kind of derelict building and they had i believe it's a modern like semi-famous like modern dancer they employed but um they were slowing things down to the point which i mean i've never seen slow-mo go so slow um so it was based on like the kind of dancer like contorting his body and like dust seemed to be a recurring theme and it was all in black and white except for when some dude set a building on fire you know and everything got really sinister but I think speaking to them a little bit it's clear that they think very very closely about what they're doing I mean you interviewed them for the playing favorites feature and I think that was something that definitely came through but They, I mean, everything from the visuals through to the way that they were, the lighting and the entire presentation, it felt kind of planned down to the millisecond. It was really interesting to see them at Unsound as well. It was in this engineering museum, which is this enormous hall, which has... capacity of what a thousand yeah i would say maybe and everyone's standing and the stage is enormous so the visuals almost got lost behind them and it was not this sort of you know the way that you describe and the ceiling was a little bit too high type of thing and it felt It just didn't quite hit in the same way as when I saw them at the Purcell room. I mean, not to toot our own horn too much, but I did actually think at the time, I wonder if it will get any better than this. Again, it goes back to what you were saying at the outset. It just was like, this is the perfect context. What about Juju and Jordache? Philip, where did you see them? Juju and Jordache, another of my unsound highlights, actually. In fact, they played in the same room as Theo did, just a few sets before him. And again, I hadn't seen them perform live before. I've been following their recordings for years. You know, big fans of what they do on record. And I was really curious to see what they would do in a live context. I mean, what I knew of Juju and Jordache was that they are, you know, a truly live act in the sense that, you know, they're not using computers. They're up there with hardware. They later told me after the show that, I mean, they're going up there basically with like blank. So, you know, they don't have pre-programmed sequences. You know, everything that you hear is basically being done live on stage. And yeah, they had a handful of machines. At one point, I think it was Juju was playing guitar. They had some sort of noisemakers, like a microphone with, I don't know, some pickups on it or something that would kind of be like smacking on the table to get percussive sounds. Could you see them doing this as they were doing it? I mean, was it important almost? I mean, there were certain things you could see that I think was important, like the smacking of the microphone was actually one of the few things that I didn't think worked because it was slightly off time. And it was a bit jarring, but I appreciated being able to see that kind of cause-effect relationship. um obviously with the guitar i mean at one point jordash was chanting something And he later said that it was Hebrew for 15 miles from Auschwitz, which was like their little jab at Poland. But I mean, it was just, it was a completely engaging, you know, for something, a performance where they're going up there with empty machines, you know, it could go any number of different directions. I mean, it's improv. It's straight up improv. but it developed naturally. What I liked, one of the things I liked was the sense that, I mean, you know, one of them would kind of be like programming an arpeggio and the other one would be kind of like fiddling on a keyboard. They have to, there's a division of labor, right? They have to sort of layer what they're doing because they only have four hands between them. But I thought they did that in a really convincing way. I mean, I was just rapt the whole time. What about Shackleton, Will? Where did you see him? I also saw him at free rotation. But yeah, Shackleton, for some reason, I guess I was... of slow to like start truly liking Shackleton like I always thought he was cool but seeing him live a few times was what really made me appreciate what he was doing I always thought he had this interesting way of sort of he'll play in a situation that will be a nightclub or there'll be DJs before and after him but he kind of takes it just to the line of if this was any more sort of strange or if the rhythm was any harder to follow, this would just be totally inappropriate. You know, people wouldn't really know how to move to it, but he kind of approaches that line and then just pulls it back at the right moment. And then meanwhile, I think the same thing is true for just the overall mood of the whole thing. You know, at least in my opinion, it's extremely dark and a lot of it's quite menacing and everything. But that said, after I saw him at Free Rotation, later that morning, I had this kind of strange, I ran into him and we had this bizarre conversation. It was kind of surreal, like we were out. on the campsites were kind of in this like empty grassy field and he was wearing these goofy orange sunglasses. It sort of disrupted his, I don't know what you think of Shackleton as. And, um, I told him this like idea I had had that whenever he's playing, um, or when I'm listening to his records, I picture this, I feel like it's the soundtrack to. like all the horrors of the world or something. Like I picture this montage of just like terrible, you know, like wars and genocides and things like that. And he said, he was like, really, that's what, that's what it makes you think of. And he said, I think of it as just the opposite. Like I think the entire thing is just a complete celebration. It's, you know, this is celebratory music. It's meant to be quite positive. Which, you know, at face value is pretty hard to, you know, sorry, go ahead. I just remember him putting it in those terms, but in relation to like a Cameroonian Day of the Dead ceremony where everybody got dug up and they made the bones dance. So I think the tree is maybe somewhere. Yeah, that's perfect. But I don't know. The idea of listening to one of his performances and thinking this is all positive, this is a celebration of life or something. It's just amazing the perspective gap between the artist and the performer, I guess. But yeah, celebration of the dead dancing with the living, I guess, is a little easier to accept. It's funny because I saw Shackleton at Unsound and I've seen him quite a few times before this and I'm a fan of his records. And I also tend to think of him as fairly dark and kind of coppery, metallic sounds, kind of sooty. And I mean, of course, like the way we receive him and respond to him has a lot to do with... titles, you know, and the cover art and, you know, Woe to the Septic Heart is not exactly a, you know, happy-go-lucky name. But the performance in Unsound, I was really struck by how light it felt and I wonder how much of this it had. to do with the room which was carpeted which had just the most impressive sound ever but melodies yeah like I was I was kind of like did he get married recently there's definitely light being drawn in but I should very quickly add I was near the mixing desk as in relation to the sound and Monolake was the guy on the mixing desk. No kidding. Like gleefully sort of like. bopping up and down. I'm not buying that as a theory. No, of course not. But it's a little detail I needed to get out there into the public domain. I'm curious to see him again just to see if he kind of continues in this vein or was that just a strange one-off? Well, we all saw him at Plastic People a couple weeks ago and there was some of that but I wasn't like... I wasn't quite as shocked almost. I've never heard what you're describing. Yeah. I just, one thing I want to add about this, cause I, I had a conversation quite recently about it. I think what keeps me going to see him is that he makes me dance in a way that no other act does. And I'll gladly go and see him like seven or eight times a year because I know that I'm pulling the dance moves that I only do when I go to see him. It's the very like heads low, like side to side, my hands are up here somewhere. Yeah. No, I think that's really true, actually. I mean, the kind of syncopations he's using, the kind of like layerings and voicings he's using. I found myself as well dancing in a very different way than I was accustomed to. He's not on a 4-4 for lots of it also. But it's not even just that. I mean, because it's not, you know, you could make the distinction between 4-4 and dubstep. But, I mean, it's something else. It's about his voicings and these, like, kind of braided lines that go through there. Also, I remember hearing something in, like, the African tradition of rhythm more specific than that, of course, but I can't remember exactly what it was, but is creating a rhythm where there are two different sort of tempos you can be reacting to. And you see that sometimes even at, you know, dubstep stuff or just you know drum and bass you look around the crowd and some people are reacting to a really fast beat and some are reacting to a very slow beat you can sort of pick out what you want and dance to it that was always the half step I was always going on the slow beat yeah I'm a slow guy for sure Moving on to the albums poll, one of the albums that actually didn't make the poll that I was basically furious about was iCubed's Megamix, which I think is probably one of my favorite albums of the year. in which we also gave it a review on RA that was 3.5. So, you know, it's partly my fault and our fault. I can see you already ready to pounce on that. Basically, I just thought it was absolutely wonderful to see this producer who's producing so many different types of dance music. So much fun, straight up. Transpiration, which is like the raviest of the ravey tunes of the year, in my opinion. The thing about the album that I think is just so absolutely genius is that it's like you can't hear all the tracks in full. So basically he's created this situation where he can continue to release 12 inches from it as long as he wants, if he wanted to do so. And I know, at least in my opinion, like waiting, if I had to wait for Transpiration, one of the best songs on that album to come out on 12-inch, I would have been absolutely like, you know, chomping at the bit for this thing to come out. But I thought it was a really nice like way of just sort of taking the album format and saying, you know what, this thing is dead. Let's make this absolutely complete. vital again and basically make it a mix. You have to listen to this to hear certain tunes that you may not get to hear anywhere else, also anywhere else in full ever, and it's chock full of amazing tunes just straight up. I'm always just amazed at how much time I have for versatile and iCube in general, or iCube specifically. almost every release that they put out is absolutely excellent. It's really the only album that I can think of that felt, I mean, M. Megamix, the title of it, I mean, it went back to, you know, Megamixes, like the Master Mix series, whatever, from the early 90s. But it felt more than anything like an album that was actually influenced by podcasts. I mean, it felt like an album that kind of took its form from the way we consume music now, which is we just download tons of mixes from SoundCloud or listen on Mixcloud or whatever. But without... Without losing anything in the process. I mean, I was really struck by the fact that it was so classic in its feel I mean transpiration is in many ways a big throwback rave tune, but it never felt retro It didn't feel like it was trying too hard, you know I mean he was using these tropes because they worked they put a smile on your face But you know, it was mixed together. So expertly it never felt like an exercise Why don't we talk about also, I think, a big surprise, which is the Barker and Baumecker album on Oscar Ton. It made our list, but I think the one thing, at least in my mind, Ryan, you picked this. I was just not expecting it to be. It's funny you say that because the first word I have written down here is surprising. I guess what they were doing prior to the album, I had kind of mixed feelings towards. There were certainly some bits that I was picking up on, but I kind of went into it with reservations. I guess I straight up didn't know what to expect. But I mean, I was hooked from the second or third track. I think something that's come to light better over time as we ran the Machine Love feature with them, but the production values on it. I mean, this is something that I'm, yeah, ashamedly thinking about. It was kind of, I think there was a point made that Jordan made in the piece was that it sounded like it wasn't made on hardware because of the arrangements were somehow too complicated to program in this way. But I mean, if you're listening to the type of synth lines that were throwing up as lead. like it was absolutely undoubted um it's just some of the textures they were using as leads also they they would execute them in such a way that they were very coarse but they were never too grating it was going back to that thing where they were doing everything up until the point where this is just like almost too full-on and then pulling it back a little bit I think also having like something as an Anthem because crows and an absolute killer final track. this thing overall yeah this album keep coming back to as well um the way it kind of sat in the oscar discography was kind of refreshing like it was a bit of maybe much needed like bombast among the more straight face techno offerings i think i think we can owe that to bell mecker probably yeah yeah perhaps I think as well when they kind of try to do so because you wouldn't necessarily or I wouldn't necessarily label it as a straight techno album I think when they were absorbing influences from a little further afield they kind of put some interesting spins on it There was a kind of garage track that they managed to pull off and everything was swung in such a way that we weren't just going on the kicks. But yeah, again, surprising. Somewhere, something. What about the Public Lover album, Will? That's one album that you wanted to flag up. Yeah, actually kind of in a similar spirit to my... thing about Pearson Sound and Pangea because this one just completely flew under the radar, didn't really get much recognition at all. And I think it's kind of interesting or it's kind of curious why it didn't. So basically Public Lover is Bruno Pensado and Ninkalise, who is his girlfriend. The album is sort of a more pop-inspired version of sort of what Bruno does on his own and kind of a more sound design-focused version of what Nicolese is on her own. You know, a bit like old Matthew Herbert stuff. It has a kind of sultry, soulful side with Nicolese's vocals, but at the same time is, you know... there's a lot to admire in the production. It's very deep and very atmospheric. And I know that it's kind of interesting to see because the two of them were very excited about it. I think Bruno thought it was one of the better things he'd done in a long time. And it came not very long after his own solo album, which I think did surprisingly well. you know, even had a bit of crossover appeal, getting a really strong review on Pitchfork and everything. And, um, kind of instead of riding the crest of that wave, uh, it's sort of the opposite happened. Like, you know, coming not long after this critically acclaimed album from Bruno, this one just sort of fell on deaf ears. And, um, yeah, no, I think it's kind of a shame. Um, it's just kind of. again, just shows how this sort of thing can be a bit, I don't know, arbitrary, I guess, or at least in my opinion. In the same way that you're talking about that, I think you listen to someone like Lucid Philip, and a lot of people want to lump him in with actress, but of course actress seems to be way more acclaimed. in a way, and I wonder if that's sort of part and parcel of something else, or whether it's simply just the music. The Actress album comes out in Honest Johns, and it's sort of... Like, ooh, Honest Johns has given it the seal of approval. Yeah, it's funny that because, I mean, obviously they've been doing things together for years. I mean, they've recorded together as Thriller before in the past. They certainly have very similar aesthetics, kind of the grain, you know, the hiss, the haziness. And I don't know why it is that actress has kind of gotten a higher profile than Luke it has. Like you say, the Honest John's connection may have something to do with it. I mean, I have a lot of time and patience for that kind of hazy, smeary, digitally. distorted striated kind of stuff that's been a good year for you then yeah it sure has but i also at the same time having said that i also have a very low tolerance for the crap and i feel like especially a few years into this sort of trend i really you know like i know what i think is good and the rest of it i have i have no time for at all have you been hearing much crap this year i just um I mean, I feel like there's always stuff like that and I just kind of tune it out immediately. I mean, Lukewit, I've been a big fan of actually all of his albums. What is it about this album specifically that really hit for you? I think the sounds are really compelling. The rhythms are really compelling. I mean, it's rare that I get tracks like his or tracks from that sort of... end of the sonic universe in my head and i mean right now i have one of his loops just kind of going through my mind yeah the same with me actually the manchester thing with the boom boom boom exactly that's the one do do do do do do and and and actually i spent the the subway ride over here trying to figure out if it was in three four time or four four i couldn't figure out if i was trying to mix that thing and that's your beat it must be three four then but um Yeah, I mean, his sound design really works. His ideas are interesting. I think like Actress, you get the sense that he's somebody who's really... sitting in his studio and kind of fine tuning these things without killing them off, but really finding the essence of what he's trying to do with the track. I also, I mean, I've liked Luka for all of his records so far, but I thought it was really interesting how he finally kind of moved away from the sort of more hip hop, dabry, Dilla sort of things he was doing on his first couple of records. I mean, the last couple 12 inches he's done on the Glum label, I also thought were really fascinating, much more of like a kind of a harder, faster club tracks mode. I just thought it was really beautiful. And in the same vein, I thought the Austin Cezaire, I guess is how you say his name. I'm not really sure. I thought that was a stunning. I think it was a debut. It was on the Public Information label. Something you didn't hear about quite as much as, for instance, The Vessel, which I also thought was a really strong album. Actually, The Vessel was really the only thing on Triangle that I have rated yet because most of the Triangle stuff, just for me, it's a little too mopey, a little too one note. And I thought The Vessel was more interesting. But the Austin Cezaire record, just again, it For me, it did that kind of grainy, hazy, indistinct, like samples that have been mushed up so many times you don't know what they are anymore, but it still had. a center of gravity and it still had a sense of purpose something i did find quite endearing about that album it it definitely felt like his first record but there was almost a his first full length sorry but there was almost a sense of like not naivety but there was just it was quite brittle in places it was just something i warmed to for whatever reason And apparently I'm hearing reports that his live show, I think based out of San Francisco, and Matt Dryhurst was saying his live show the other night was just stellar. So I'm very eager to see where he goes from here. Let's move on to labels and Ryan to keep on with the watchword of surprising. Turbo was on your list and I think if I had asked you at the beginning of the year, would Turbo, Tiga's label be on your list, you probably would have laughed at me. No, I don't think so. Okay. I haven't been following the label super closely for the last few years, but I think when I do the little bits of DJing that I do, I'm always trying to pick those tracks out from labels like Turbo, have someone come up to me and say, dude, what the hell is this? I'm like, yeah, this is on Turbo. So there's been countless occasions with that this year. I think it's interesting because Teague has talked for many years about his love of techno and how he can't make techno for whatever reason. So it's almost like he's living vicariously through this roster that he's now built up. But yeah, there was the Nujak. techno compilation with a focus on kind of Canadian artists but bringing in people like Lockroof who was a kind of exciting newcomer this year. It was interesting and something that was definitely noted in the review we ran that although these felt very much like 2012 techno tracks they weren't looking too closely at Berlin. there was a kind of rough around the edges that I guess it would be comparable to stuff that Blauern was doing a year or so ago before he headed so militantly down the industrial route. But yeah, I mean, these tracks just kicked most of the compilation. I mean, it was over an hour of bloody-minded club tool techno. There were just enough... Sorry. No, I was just going to say there were just enough spins on the formula. So I think now what Tiga's ended up with is this rather amazing roster. They've released a shit ton of records this year. I think it's also important to point out that, you know, among this stuff, they were still releasing some of their staple artists. So it's not just like they're now a techno label. But yeah, between the Cloud stuff and the Lock Groove and the Nautilus, yeah, I think they probably had their best year ever for my taste. Yeah, I also wanted to add, I recently saw Gingham Bordello DJing and a lot of, one of the guys, Brian, was playing a ton of really in-your-face, way high-energy techno. but still with kind of like a party friendly attitude and just some really outrageous acid lines and everything. And, um, I guess pretty much all of it was just from his friends in Toronto. So. there is kind of, it seems like there's sort of like a vein of, you know, techno music, that sort of tone thing going on out there. I mean, I think the word fun's quite important here, and I don't know if it's just because this is framed by a label that Tiga helms, but if someone can inject a sense of fun into techno now, again, I'm kind of all for it. Yeah, I mean, I feel like the, for me, my favorite track on that compilation is the Gingham Bordello one, the Iron and Water. And it's kind of, there's something about it that's like sort of obvious in a refreshing way. Just, you know, the way the drop works in the beginning, I feel like most Berlin producers would just be over that kind of thing. But that doesn't mean that it's... you know not cool or doesn't sound good or something yeah i was skeptical i was kind of amused by who did the track uh those cracks in your face do they hurt that was clouds and i was amused by somebody riffing i think on the ra forums something like those blow on references in your track do they hurt or something because it was i mean to me that was such a blah one-esque track and right down to the title you know which really to me uh sounded a lot like why they had their bodies under my garage i mean do you wonder i mean i know you said they're not looking to berlin no they're looking to the uk right now and i wonder if Is that a stumbling block? I mean, do they need something extra to kind of push them over into having their own thing? I don't know. I'm always really hesitant at putting things in line with when they came out kind of thing because we don't know that Kyle's record wasn't made before the Blanton record. True. It's a point, but... I just think for me, and I have to actually agree with you on this point, because it's like, okay, well, you made a Blown record or a Randomer record, like, well done. But I think the deal was sealed for me on that particular track when we were playing it in the RA office and, like, just pretty much everybody leant over to the screen, like, okay, what in the hell is this? So, sorry. No, no, I mean, there's something to be said for a track that has immediate visceral appeal. It doesn't, like you say, it doesn't matter what came first. Yeah, and I think any time I was really engaging with this label was when I was playing this music rather than listening. The Nautilus tracks were amazing to play. The Alpha, I think it was, was just... always a winner. What else, Phillip, for you? year was a winner label wise um i mean for me there were there were two i mean there were lots of things but one of them and and a label that i don't feel you get see talked very much was deckman tell and and i can't even say that i followed them super super closely i mean they they got on my list in part just because of the juju and jordash album which I guess I'm kind of a stan for J&J, but I thought it was a phenomenal record. I mean, it's the kind of thing that as many times as I've listened to it, I still have barely begun to figure it out. I mean, it's just sprawling and massive. But then they also put out, they had this series, it was the DecMetal Anniversary series, and I think they compiled the tracks on a CD, but then there were four, five, 12 inches. And several of those cuts I just ended up playing every time I played out, every time I made a mixtape or something. There was the Hooney cut. There was the Macam, who I don't even know who that is, with a Funkin' Even remix. And it was basically just kind of an acid edit of Me and You. Is that it, Cassie? Some R&B, you know. Just really, really cheeky, but super well done. And I mean, with a really fun acid line, the Funkin' Even remix was even better. And then the Hoonie, there were others in that series that also worked just as well for me. I mean, and also lovely, great graphic design on that thing. And I don't know, I'm just surprised that I don't hear more about Duck Mantell. Maybe they're sort of overshadowed by their... Amsterdam brethren. Well, it stems from, if I'm not mistaken, from a party in Amsterdam that I also... I've never really heard of, you know, like it's something like ADE or whatever. Actually, no, I think this year they had a pretty big event, but it is kind of like a very organic local affair in Amsterdam. It's like an underground Amsterdam phenomenon. Yeah, I mean, I haven't been to one of the parties in Amsterdam, but just looking at it on paper, they're definitely putting on some of the most interesting lives in the city on a semi-regular basis. basis, I'd say. Yeah. And it kind of mirrors the style of the label, like has a sort of experimental edge pretty much every time. Yeah. I mean, that's what that series felt like to me. I mean, like proper dance music, party tracks, but with an experimental edge, you know, a slightly almost psychedelic edge in a way. That's what I'm looking for. I mean, I recently pulled out Deckman Tell 001, which was a Juju and Jordache track from, I think and I've started playing that again, and it sounds as fresh as it ever did. This is the Deep Blue Meanings. Yeah. Yeah, I remember seeing you play it at Horst and asking you what it was. Sounded familiar in my defense. And I guess the other labels that I would just quickly shout out are the Trilogy Tapes and Hinge Finger, just because for me they made some of the best tracks this year. I mean, back to talking about Blahwan, why they hide their bodies under my garage, I thought was just... I mean, my girlfriend loves that track. I love that track. Whenever it came on in the house, it was like kind of... party time you know and and i just i love the idea that that's such a It's such a dark nasty menacing track, but it also has I think this really hilarious sense of humor to it as well I mean you can't it's so over so overboard you almost can't take it seriously, but it's totally compelling I need to spotted the sample actually last week. Yeah, yeah, but um, yeah is interesting I remember some someone on Twitter like bloggers It seemed to have this reaction to that track that it was somehow morally questionable or like the idea of dancing to a line like that was, you know, out of step with the spirit of dance music or something. They were wrong. Yeah. But it's funny because like you said, the line is from a Fugees track. And I feel like in hip hop, I don't know, somehow it just works to throw these things in that can be kind of like. you know, dark or depressing if you really think about it. Well, it's actually edited in such a way. I mean, the original line doesn't say specifically. why they hide their bodies under my garage. The why seems to be somehow superimposed. Yeah, the why is from, it's like, I think it's the next syllable in the original phrase. And so it becomes the first syllable in this loop. It's like, they hide their bodies under my garage. Why lie? But it still is interesting that, okay, so the score is a hip hop pop crossover album. first track there's that line bodies under my garage you know it doesn't even make you know you don't think twice about it and then there's um like a techno track with the same lyric and um it gets everyone's attention right away i don't know just you know it's kind of interesting i i thought it was also just a really funny line because i mean there's this kind of schizophrenic thing going on there like they're not hiding their bodies under your garage. You're the one doing that. You know, and every time I hear that track, I have that sort of frisson, that kind of like, you know, something's out of whack and you can't quite put your finger on it, which I think really, it's an example for me of a vocal sample. that works really well. I mean, dude, there's too many records out there now that are just like, hey, we'll take some dumbass sample and throw it over in a loop and make it sound menacing. But this one, for whatever reason, it's the right words for the right track. even if you can't say why. Yeah, in a way it almost reminds me of the Steve Reich, like, let the bruised blood come out to show them or something, where the more the line repeats, the more you're just thinking like, what the hell are they actually talking about here? You know, you realize how nonsensical the line really is. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And then everything else they did as well was, I mean, obviously Ellipsis, Joy Orwiston's Ellipsis, which was a huge track since like on YouTube since like January 2011. But, you know, still an amazing, an amazing tune. I'm actually having trouble thinking. There's the Matteo. There's the Matteo. And there was something else just, oh, and the Willie Burns on the trilogy tapes as well, which the Willie Burns, again, every track is just a killer. And it was funny because a couple of times I played out and I was intending to play like the. A1, whatever the big track is, and then it wouldn't really be fitting in the set and so I would just kind of grab something else and that would become like one of the highlight tracks of the set, one of these tunes you don't even really know what it sounds like or expect anything from and I don't know it's just a really great record. Will, you highlighted two labels in your list. One of them was Pan, which I think was also one of the big surprises of the year for a lot of people. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I guess the... thing that really got my attention with pan was semi-recent was uh just the lee gamble records but i was aware of it and i you know had heard some of the other stuff but that was what really drove it home this is a really interesting label and um i did an interview with lee gamble surrounding his um the actual full length but We were talking about his kind of history as an artist, which the long story short was he was really into jungle. And then he quite abruptly got really involved in extremely avant-garde computer music, you know, something that is sort of more just sound art or, you know, it was literally experimental, like seeing what you could do with just writing code. how you could, you know, make that musical in some way. And then he sort of went back in the other direction. And he said that it was, he was introduced to people like Tim Hecker was the example he gave. And he thought like, you know, these are intelligent guys that sort of know what they're talking about and, you know, in terms of sound and music and everything. And they're making really sort of out there avant-garde stuff. But at the same time, I don't know, kind of like they're not being dicks about it. Like it's not boring and academic. You know, this is pleasurable music to listen to. Probably a good strap line for the label. Yeah, not being a dick about it. But to me, that's kind of what Pan is. I mean, a lot of the stuff is way out there, but something about the overall delivery is sort of unpretentious and cool. I don't know, it's for something that's so strange, it's pretty easy to get into, basically. I guess that just really speaks to my taste and clearly struck a chord with a lot of people. And I'm just sort of impressed by it. how much they released and how much it was really good. You know, there was a lot of overlooked stuff like, God, this guy's name. Reaching for his notebook. HK something. Yeah, well, it actually, it seems to use Cyrillic letters, like it's Co-hey or something at the end. Oh, wait, actually, now that I actually pronounced that, that looks like his first name. His name is Kuhei Matsunaga, whatever. Anyway, this guy's name is difficult to pronounce. Intentionally, so it's, you know, but the dance classics one and two, you know, is killer. And basically. The second one, I didn't really see get that much hype, but I thought it was absolutely fantastic. I just thought it was cool. This label kind of came out of nowhere, put out a ton of records. A lot of them were really good, and at the same time, all pretty strange. The other label that you have down only put out two records this year. I think some of that was due to other factors. You picked out The Corner, which is Anthony Parasol's new label. Yeah, that's kind of the opposite. My explanation for why I like The Corner is sort of the opposite of why I like Pan. The Corner, I just think is... There are dicks about it. No, no, no, no. There's just not as... much to say it's it's more just that i think it's a badass label um you know the first record was djq and some kind of unknown artist named nor'easter and i think djq is sort of the hook or you know this is this is the track that would make djs by the ep just sort of this weird smoky um ultra deep house or techno track that appeared on levon vincent's fabric mix and um it's great tracks, great DJQ track, but then the Nor'easter tracks were sort of, um, I guess once you had the record sort of the more interesting part. They're both hip hop. One is instrumental. The other one has, you know, words, but just kind of came out of nowhere. You know, in a way, this sort of hip hop, not hip hop stuff has been a little bit of a trend, but this seems to exist totally outside of that. You know, it just doesn't feel like it. The whole thing feels very sort of. raw and streetwise and everything um it's just cool and um also i um the artwork is all really cool Basically just... Artwork's really stunning. Yeah, yeah, it really jumps out at you. It's even packaged kind of funny, like it's, you know... What do they look like? It's like a single card. No, like a... It's a folded card that the record falls into vertically inside a plastic sleeve. And the first one has a picture of someone's mugshot. I actually heard who it is. It's a famous mugshot, but I don't know who it is. And the second one is This kind of like really high contrast street scene at night and it all kind of has this bleak References New York and kind of a bleak way like the first record on the label has a picture of a burning car and it says New York is a nice place to visit and then the new one by Anthony parasol who runs the label and this other guy film Mafa It's called Atlantic Ave. Basically just the whole thing has kind of like an in-your-face New York side to it. But yeah, just a cool label overall. Atlantic Ave was crazy because it sounds like, to me, it sounded like Vancouver or something. with a really deeply aquatic kind of techno pushed almost to the point of ambience, but with this really heavy New York thing, New York vibe. And it was funny because I reviewed the Atlantic Ave for Resident Advisor and Hurricane Sandy was just on the way. And I wanted to make some joke in my review about like, yeah, this sounds, I mean, I don't know Brooklyn super well, but I know Atlantic Avenue is there. And I wanted to say like. yeah, this sounds like Atlantic Avenue underneath the floodwaters. And then I was like, you know, maybe that's a bad idea because maybe this will actually be a really big hurricane. And lo and behold, it was a really big hurricane. And a lot of stuff in New York was underwater. And I was emailing with Anthony afterwards. And I told him that. And he's like, wow, that's really weird. Look at the cover art that we wanted to use for it. And it was this, or maybe it was the cover art they did use for it. And it was this underwater, this underwater subway car, which in retrospect was kind of uncanny because it was like, that was exactly the vibe that I got off this record was this kind of urban Atlantis thing. Yeah, and also, I mean, that second record, too, I thought sort of had the same kind of ballsiness of the first one. The same way the first one has these weird hip-hop tracks sort of dominating most of the EP, the second one is just so, so spacey. You know, a lot of it's just kind of... a kick drum with i guess sort of like a sub bass line i don't think i heard like a greater volume of sub content in a record this year just like how did you get this bass on a record like and it's one of those things too is sort of like um i don't know small basic channel stuff sorry phil moffa is actually like a recording engineer and he like basically all analog shows people how to use these machines. I think Moffa might be... Moffa's the... He writes for us. But yeah, it's just one of those records where it's like there's, at the same time, there's so little going on and there's so much going on at the same time. You know, it's sort of stripped down, but at the same time, like super overwhelming at points, but it's a great record. Let's move on to official mixes. The first one I wanted to talk about was Untold, chapter one. And I just wanted to flag it up because I thought it was a brave, brave decision on Untold's part to do a... label only mix where he was trying to mix all the tracks from his wildly diverse BPM wise imprint Hemlock. and basically try to fit that all into 60 minutes. I think he did a really amazing job with it, and it kind of showcased exactly how of a ridiculous catalog that that label has had over the past couple years. Hemlock is not always kind of seems to be talked about in the same breath as Hessel Audio for whatever reason. And I think looking over that label and that mix especially, I think they might, they should be probably. The next mix, though, that we wanted to mention is something that Ryan and I absolutely agreed on in a lot of different ways. The Daniel Avery Fabric Live mix. Yeah, I think it's because we're contrary. And in a weird way, this mix felt kind of contrary. and we ran a feature with Daniel Avery and the point was made that what he was doing was very much going against the grain of what was currently popular. I think for me, there was a kind of a hint of nostalgia in what he does and what he did on this mix in that it reminded me a time of when people were far less squeamish over hearing sawtooth waves in their tracks and like big lines and big bass lines and big drums. And it felt very much in the lineage of DJs like Errol Alkin. and Andrew Weatherall, who's been a big champion. They both put out excellent mixes this year, but somehow for me, this one felt more vibrant in a way. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah, I mean, I think that the indie background thing was something that kind of appealed to me on this one. I think Weatherall himself described it as something like gimmick. free machine driven funk madness or something. I don't think it was better summed up by that. I think in the piece also, it was quite interesting. Is this kind of, I almost feel like it's a little known fact, but he's a fabric resident. Like that's not something I knew about. Admittedly, I did come later. to his work but um it was talking a lot about the style of djing where it's kind of like more about the contrast the mixing is not particularly showy but it's just about what you're putting next to the next thing and also the interesting flourish was having it um just drop to complete silence in the middle Yeah, I was gonna bring that quote up because I thought it was like, when is the last time you've heard a DJ say, I want to do this mixed CD, I want to bring it all the way down to the bottom, halfway through, and then start again. It just seems like a, you're not... of this time right now yeah and i think the next track he he brought in was one of his own i think it was sleazy and he kind of introduced the broken beat into that and it's like okay there's a immediate statement of intent and then there was just couple of the other transitions there was the um i think it was his taste that went into that forward strategy group record which definitely wasn't something i was expecting but that particular transition just yeah those tracks rubbing up against one another really worked for me Bye. Maya Jane Coles is someone who is on the mixes list this year, unlike Daniel Avery. Philip, you highlighted her mix as one that you wanted to talk a little bit about. Yeah, I was really taken with... Mya Jankos DJ Kix mix. I think I listened probably of all the mixes, official mixes I listened to this year, I listened to that one the most, maybe alongside the LaVon Vincent. I was really impressed with the fact, I mean, it's a very eclectic mix in the sense that it covers a lot of ground. I mean, A, there's some really phenomenal standout tracks, single tracks in there. I discovered the last Magpie track. I can't remember the name of it, but no more stories. Something hyper-colored? Something. Losing Suki, yeah. I discovered that from that. I mean, she had that in the mix. before it was out commercially and it was the first time in a while that I've heard something in a mix and been like, oh God, I really need to get this. It doesn't exist, no. But I mean, it's such a cliche, but I felt like she really told a compelling story with that mix. She started somewhere and she took me kind of on a winding little road and I ended up very far from where I kind of had expected to end up and from where I started out. I like the fact that her mixes are not super precious. And I mean, she's, you know, she's kind of shoehorning things together, but they never feel too jumbled. And yet they're also always in key. There's always some transition element that's kind of guiding you through. So it's never really easy to tell exactly what's ending and what's beginning. I just thought it was a really, really skillful mix and it was really expertly sequenced and just listenable. I didn't get bored of it halfway through. It was like she kind of had me going the whole time. The one you mentioned earlier that you listened to the most was the LaVon Vincent, and that's our number one mix of the year. Which is almost like the opposite kind of mix, no? I mean, the LaVon Vincent, I would have a really hard time telling you what tracks are on it or what any of them individually sound like. I mean, it's just a mix I put on. I let it go. It's almost like ambient music for me except that there's a beat to it, you know, but it's so streamlined. and so very controlled. I mean, just, you know, sonically rich and lush. And to me, it's just such a perfect statement of intent for that whole scene around LaVon Vincent and all of those guys. And I don't think anybody else is making music like they are right now. I don't think anybody really has. I mean, for being very classic techno in house and techno in many aspects, I mean, they've really hit on... Sound it's it's a kind of it's not even a regional thing It's like they're seen and they own it and and I thought it was a fantastic mix for the way it showed that off I mean I think it's interesting that nobody's been able to quite define what that spin is that they put on a house and take no not really Yeah, and we're talking about this group of artists, but we're not talking about in audio terms. No, it's not like But there is a common thread that I think is sort of hard to put your finger on. And LaVon said that in talking about the fabric mix, that you see the track list and you immediately think, well, this is just him and all his friends. And he said that it wasn't like he was trying to hype up his friends. He, it was more like, who else am I going to put on this mix? Like, you know, we're all, you know, so, so very much sort of going after this, not the same thing, but they all kind of occupy the same weird corner, you know, this weird sound. And so it was almost like he had no choice. Like there was, there were no which I think in a way is sort of, I don't know, that's the most interesting kind of mix when it sort of is, you know, welcome to my world kind of thing. I appreciated it too, almost as like a primer of how to play those records. Like I've bought so many records off of those associated labels and yet I find myself reaching for them very little just because like, I don't know where or when to play them. I can't quite fit them into other things. And yet. he made it sound so effortless. It was like, oh, well, how else would you play them? Yeah, it's interesting you say that because I was having a conversation with October, who's someone who I kind of associate with being a European connection. to this sound somehow and he was talking about this very thing trying to compose a mix with this group of tracks and like maybe the European guys are kind of putting a spin on it but it just took him an age and to slot these things together in a way that made total sense and yeah I mean I don't think it I think it's a coincidence yeah is So let's talk about compilations. Ron and I have been having a debate as to whether the dope Jams compilation is a compilation or an official mix and I guess it's just the way it was presented. It was presented as separate tracks and it was presented as a mix and I first heard it as a mix and that's how I fell in love with it. Why did you fall in love with the Dope Jams thing? I fell in love with it initially because it reminded me very much of a time when I didn't know anything about house music. And I was listening to a lot of records on labels like Subliminal around the turn of the millennium. And it made me think about the time when hearing a saxophone... in a record or some wailing diva was no bad thing. And in a way, those kind of tropes still really do it for me. And I just feel like I'm biding my time until that shit comes back into it. I mean, I was sitting around the feature with those guys and they offered up an extremely... music anecdote as to how it came about because obviously the mix is based on the um king street Back catalogue, now in the kind of spirit of the way these Dope Jams guys do things, they put together the mix and then I think the quote was, here, put this fucking thing out. Definitely not got the accent for it. The best thing about that anecdote, though, is that they went to the label because they were so angry. the compilations that they'd been putting out as though it was a misrepresentation of what they thought the legacy of this label should be. Yeah, and they were kind of extending that to some of the other big New York, classic New York house labels also. But it's just the spirit of, okay, well, you guys are doing kind of a shitty job, so here you go. Like, what do you make of it? How do you like them apples? And I think that's kind of what I liked about the mix so much specifically is that they were DJing it in a way that I hadn't heard that music played for a long time. So because... I go out to European nightclubs a little bit more now than I do U.S. nightclubs. But even in the U.S., there's long... Beautiful mixes and the mixes that they were doing on this mix CD were just like rough ready and well Yeah, I mean I didn't straight out and for me hearing that I was just sort of like ah, yes Yes, I ain't fast play it hard. Yeah, I mean I do definitely buy into what you're saying But I was almost even hoping for some more like when they were talking about slamming tracks together hip-hop style the feature I was almost hoping the transitions were rougher and were more ready and they were playing more records but yeah I just felt that whole thing just deeply refreshing One of the compilations that I feel like unfortunately maybe slipped under the radar a little bit was a reissue of a lot of different tracks from an Italian prog group. called Sensations Fix. It was put out by the Revenge label in New York City and basically Sensations Fix is sort of the brainchild of this guy, I believe it's Franco Falsini. Basically it's this group from early 70s where they're playing progressive rock but there's a moog underneath it sort of coloring everything and there's just these wonderful little sketches of three four minutes where you just kind of get entered into this world and then sort of taken out I think one of the most interesting things to me about the compilation specifically was the way that it basically took some of a record and basically did alternate mixes and also just put together a bunch of other songs in there. And I think that's a really interesting idea nowadays. cherry-picking people's legacy, officially cherry-picking people's legacy and just sort of saying, okay, if you look at it like this, or if you look at these songs, oh, well, actually these guys are remarkably forward-thinking, or actually these guys have a remarkable connection to this other thing that you might never... think about otherwise because of whatever happened at the original moment that it was released. I wish labels would do more of this sort of thing, sort of recontextualizing things and putting them in different ways. One of the things that was our number one compilation of the year actually was Trevor Jackson's "Metal Dance." I thought that was an amazing situation where Having Trevor Jackson sort of say, okay, you know, these things link together because of, you know, because I say so, was a wonderful contextualization of something. Thank you. Will, you had a compilation you wanted to speak about. I think Ryan also put it down. The Honest John's Schengen Shake? Yeah, I just thought basically it was a really unconventional compilation to have this sort of... really strange kind of music as the common thread between this extremely diverse cast of artists. It's just kind of a strange idea that I think worked out really, really well. I thought all those EPs, while they were coming out, I was sort of tempted to buy every single one. And it was just great that I could, you know, get them all in one place. But I remember reading a line, I think it was in an RA review years ago before I worked on the site or something that was like, the thing about compilations is they're like, compilations are like group photos. Someone's always got their eyes closed. which I guess you could say on this one, maybe it's Phil Lobos and Max Loderbauer who kind of just did their normal thing with these, you know, African vocals poking in every now and then. But, but overall I thought, you know, it was a really long compilation with, you know, such a weirdly eclectic group of artists from Hype Williams to MMM and whatnot. And everything on it is just killer. Everyone took a completely different route with, you know, this really unconventional source material Just fascinating to listen to from beginning to end. It ended up being almost like a snapshot of spectrum of all these different sort of relevant artists at this time, just electronic artists of all stripes from, you know, clubby stuff to sort of weird experimental stuff. And yeah, it's just solid front to back. Another compilation, I think, that brought together a lot of different artists, Philip, was the American Noise thing on lies. Yeah, the American Noise on lies. I mean, I've been following... To be honest, I don't really remember even being aware of them before this year. I might have been, but, you know, somehow... I think the Sark Lego Vault... came out last year and it was on our singles list but that was also like near the end of the last year it seemed like oh and then yeah just going on all of a sudden you know and and i guess you know ron was sending me tracks and i and i was buying records as well and and it took me a while to you know i mean certainly i i don't love every single record that comes out i mean they put out something like 20 records this year or not to say that i don't love it but like For DJing purposes, some of them don't necessarily, they're hard to play or they can be hard to play. I mean, they're lo-fi, they're sort of crotchety, they're strange, you know. But I really appreciated the compilation because it kind of cherry-picked the best of the catalog and I think some unreleased stuff as well in a way that I can just listen to, you know, and just... I mean, it made sense. That's not necessarily a lot of records that I would have kind of expected to make sense in a compilation format at all. But I thought that the, especially at a double CD length that gave them the chance to really stretch out with a quieter, more sort of. downbeat, ambient, whatever you want to call it, you know, and also the pure noise. Just an amazing snapshot of, if it's a group photo of lies, it's like they've all got their eyes closed and they're like flipping the bird and yet it totally works. Nice job. Bring it back to the photo metaphor. I mean, and Lies, I'm intrigued too because I've seen so much love for that label in a similar way that I'm seen for Pond and for Spectrum Spools, although Lies is definitely the most kind of dance floor oriented of any of those three. But at the end of 2012, I mean... I think they were in Facts List. I know they were high on Juno's list. Tons of DJs and writer types love Lies, which I'm thrilled about. But I'm also kind of surprised because they're a pretty weird label. And I do wonder how many... people, listeners, are actually buying these records and playing them out. I'm curious to see, I mean, is it, and this is not to disparage Lies at all, because again, I think they're a phenomenal label. They gave me kind of more joy than most labels did this year. But I wonder if to a certain extent, it's kind of like a music nerd bubble that we're inside and everybody's like, oh, yeah, lies, lies, lies. It's an echo chamber. Yeah. Or to what extent, you know, that that's kind of going that attitude is going to permeate sort of more broadly. I guess we'll see. I mean, I don't really care. It's a great label. And as long as they keep putting out records, I'm happy. I know and you know it's true that this love is really, really true and I know and you know it's true Last but not least, most of my listening, at least throughout the year, comes in the form of mixes, to be honest, and I'm listening to online mixes all day. Obviously there are tons and tons and tons of online mix series that bear mentioning, and we did finally this year in our compilation mixes poll. but we didn't pick any of the RA podcasts. So I wanted to just go around and maybe have each of you guys pick one that really stood out for you this year. Will, what was your RA mix of the year in your mind? So my favorite mix, my favorite RA mix was Vessel, and my feeling on it kind of dovetails with something Philip said earlier. which was that the triangle sound is normally a bit too mopey for you. I guess I didn't really like Vessel's album that much. I liked it. I listened to it, you know, a few times, but it didn't, I didn't have the response that I know a lot of other people had with it. And anyway. With his RA mix, I felt it was just totally mopey. He's mopey as hell. But it was the first time I really understood that or felt compelled by that, I guess. despite being quite bleak, it was also kind of colorful and lush and had a lot of variety. It was very dynamic. Different shades of mope. Yeah, different shades of gray. But I also just thought it was cool to hear someone getting so involved in a mix like that. You know, like there was that sort of weird part with The Cure. I think it's Charlotte sometimes. And I know... a fairly well-known DJ who like cut that out and made an edit of it and like plays it in clubs. And I don't know, just to have something original enough in, you know, free online mix, you know, in a way, I guess you could say it sort of shows just how much of an asset, you know, a good podcast can be that an artist would sit down with a free mix for that long. put that much effort into it because parts of it sort of you know certainly uh you could you know he at least does light remixing or light editing or something um which i think not long ago would have been just way too much work for something that people just download for free um but yeah and it was also sort of uh when i put it on i was in our tokyo office And it was, Ryan kind of mentioned this phenomenon earlier when you have one of those moments where everyone in the room is sort of individually asking you what this is. This is very individual and very original. I thought it was a great mix. Philip, what about you? For me, it was the Michael Meyer. And the Michael Meyer was something of a surprise. To be honest, it's been quite a few years since I've seen him DJ. I've always been a fan of his style of DJing. I was not super taken with his album this year on Compact. First album in seven years, I think. And I just, it didn't really grab me. And then the mix, I listened to it quite a lot, kind of on a loop. And it was before the track listing was all sort of put together, you know, and I couldn't believe whatever the Herbert remix was, which turned out to be the DJ Kosei remix, which, you know, and I was trying to figure out what that was. And then there was another track, and it was really the high point of the mix. And I shazammed it, which is something I very rarely do. And lo and behold, it was a song from Michael Myers' new album. And in the context of It just, you know, I never even heard it. It just didn't connect with me at all. And in the context of the mix, it was like, this is the most amazing song ever. What is this? And it just really brought home to me the power of a good DJ set, you know, that. that in the context of a set, a song or a track can sound completely different than it would on its own. And again, Michael Meyer being the kind of DJ who really knows how to sequence things, he mixes in key, he's not a fussy DJ. I mean, he kind of lets things run out. I mean, he's not like sweating the transitions, but it just flowed really naturally and it was just a really nice... Mixed to kind of leave on while I was doing things around the house and loop endlessly For me I'm gonna cheat a little bit mention a couple of other mixes that I feel bare mentioning. A. Sagittarian's podcast I thought was phenomenal. Sort of brought together a lot of different things and had four different parts and had a distinct techno part that like built up, came down, and you were just like, yeah. Of course, you know, no problem. 20 minutes of techno and we're back to ambient music. And also the DJ Rum podcast. I really, really enjoyed quite a bit. And he's another person who put an enormous amount of effort into his mix and sort of. putting together a lot of ambient music and all sorts of different things. He called it a... I think it was a theme to an imaginary film or something. Which is the worst sort of cheesy. You want to not hear that, but it's definitely worth your time if you can track it down. The mix, though, I guess I found the most interesting this year was the Danny Days mix, which I think most people knowing me would probably not pick that out as the one I'd highlight necessarily. But I think it's a really good example of someone who I thought I knew. I thought I knew what they did. I thought I knew who they were, and they basically just played a bunch of tracks. that I didn't know and was surprised to hear them play. I am not as familiar as I guess I should be with Danny Days, but he basically indulged his electro side quite a bit with this mix that he made for us. Basically, it shined a light on another side of his musical personality that I just didn't realize was there. He obviously seemed to do it in a way to kind of introduce another project. that he's working on with Maceo Plex, which is Jupiter Jazz, even though I don't think there was a track from them on it, if I'm not mistaken. But basically sort of setting the table for people to basically get ready for, I think, what's going to come next year with that project and sort of that sound. And I think a lot of people got on board with it. I think it was really well received and people were ready for it. I felt like a lot of people thought that they'd had him pegged up until that point and he definitely shifted some perceptions of that mix. Yeah. I think Pac... Podcasts are an amazing way of being able to kind of subtly sort of say, no, no, no, here's some other things I'm into, like really, really into. And you did a great job of that. Ryan, what was your mix of the year? My mix of the year was Floating Points, who I think recorded a mix for us. point around the middle of the year I think for me I just had a great year with Floating Points as a DJ firstly I saw him DJing alongside thought at Plastic People in London and it kind of felt in the lineage of a DJ Philip was talking about, Theo Parish, where these guys were very much, well it wasn't the same kind of cut and throw mixing style and they weren't really as heavy on the EQs, they were very willing to bring all facets of their taste to the table and kind of make that work in a club context somehow. And then I saw him play a extremely Theo Parrish-like set at Dimensions where he was all over the EQs and was slamming things in. And again, he was pulling off transitions that I just didn't know were possible. But to the RA mix, it was certainly, for whatever reason, one I listened to the most this year. I felt like it was a mix that people kept wanting to put on. and it just did so many different things. I appreciated the way he kind of sectioned it off and then just glued over between these sections. I mean, you had the start, there was the disco, there was the funk, there was the soul. He somehow managed to get to a Mike Dennett record from there and played something. and Soul Capsule in there in the middle was kind of an undeniable peak and then brought it back down with some more like feel-good disco. I just think, I've just come to the conclusion he's an excellent DJ and I really feel proud that we put that mix out and just showcase him in the best possible manner. you
