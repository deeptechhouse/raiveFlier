you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Yousef got his DJing break in a way that these days would be inconceivable. He won a mixtape competition in a print magazine. Back in 1998, he claimed the Bedroom Bedlam Prize in the now-folded music magazine. and went on to simultaneously hold residencies at Renaissance, Ministry of Sound and Cream, which at the time were three of the UK's biggest clubbing brands. Cream in particular was a big deal for Youssef. He'd attended the club in his hometown of Liverpool since the early 90s, and he likened the experience of playing there to stepping out at Anfield for the city's football team. Across a whirlwind few years, he also became a presenter on the UK's Radio One and started his own party, Circus. Twelve years later, and Circus is still at the heart of everything Yousef does, from its label offshoot to the regular club nights he stages in Liverpool and London. I caught up with him in London recently to reflect on his journey to becoming one of the UK's enduring dance music figures. So you had a pretty non-standard entry into this whole thing. Because in 1998 you won a competition in Music Magazine which is called Bedroom Bedlam, is that right? That's right. Do you remember much about your winning entry? Yeah, I remember everything about it to be honest because it was my second or third attempt. Obviously at the time I'd been a DJ in Liverpool for a couple of years and I'd been maybe six or seven years one of those guys practicing 12 hours a day and all these things. So that tape... Even now, it's on my Soundcloud if anyone wants to go and have a check it out. But it's still one of the best mixes I've ever done. From a musical perspective, it sounds really fresh. It's still really current now. When I completed it, and obviously it was recorded in one take on Dex, you're playing and recording a cassette player. That's how long ago it was. I was confident, or very happy with the mix. Ironically, maybe later on we'll talk about my connection with Lottie and people like that, but it was Lottie that picked it out, and the guys from Basement Jacks and Ben Turner from Music Magazine. So yeah, they were very supportive at the time. Do you remember some of the key tracks on the mix? I can remember it opened with this rascal dub of To Be In Love. by masters of work and it's just this loopy weird nonsense and you know one one thing i remember But before I started that mix, I had some tracks by Moody Man and tracks on F-Com and stuff like that. But before I started that mix, I said to myself, okay, don't piss about. Just get in there and let's get the energy flowing straight from the off rather than build up to a crescendo and get people's attention. Just let's get on with it. And I think that was the difference with that mix compared to the previous mixes because it kind of built. Up to like maybe 30, 40 minutes in, it was going somewhere. But this one, it was like, okay, and we're off. And what was the prize? The prize, the first thing that I won was I got a phone call the same day the magazine came out. And I was given a set at Ministry of Sound, which again was incredible for a bedroom DJ to be playing in one of the world's most famous clubs, especially back then when it was... you know, it was a different kettle of fish than what it is now, I would say. But it was amazing. It was amazing. So off the back of the mix, you got that call, didn't you? They called me literally on the day and said, look, you know, the prize is you can come down and play Ministry of Sounds and you can warm up in the box, which was, you know, one of the best sounding rooms in the world. And that was cool, and it went pretty well. And then a couple of weeks later, I don't know if I became in favour with the guys at Music Magazine, but they gave me a gig at Pasha in Ibiza, and that's when things really changed. I mean, it seems almost inconceivable these days that a DJ could launch a career off the back of winning a competition. But I guess things were like really different back then. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, back then it was just, you know, turntables and your mixtape. There were no social media. And of course, I mean, you obviously know James Sabila did exactly the same thing. He won a couple of months after me or maybe a year after me or something. So he's another one that's kind of gone on from what was a really kind of well regarded. uh mixtape competition probably the biggest one in the world at the time with like 2000 entries like a month which is a lot to get through but yeah so it is compared to now it's just as crazy so at the time just to kind of clarify the the currency very much would have been like the perfect cassette recorded mix and that being put in the hands of the right person Is that right? That's exactly right. Okay. And were you kind of like hustling on the mixtape scene before that? Yeah, of course. I mean, you know, I've never been one to wait for things to come to me. I've always kind of thought, okay, how is this guy doing it? I'll have a look or I'll contact a lot of the clubs or whatever to send. tapes off and just get myself around and in particular in Liverpool playing a place like Bar Bar and Eden which ironically now is the same venue we do circus in as one of the first places I've got a residency in but you know just being just having a hustle and especially with the guys at Cream you know we'll probably get onto that shortly but they knew that I was DJing Liverpool by they had a little no say in the matter because every week when I went to the club there'd be a new mixtape and it'd be in the hands of one of the DJs maybe Junior Sanchez or Roger Sanchez or Derek Hart or the guys behind the scenes or even Faf Phil Cooper would get a mixtape and I think they could see a kind of natural progression with my musical taste, my skills, all these things. So yeah, when the music magazine came out, I think it picked up the ears of the guys at Kareem. I mean, again, it seems almost inconceivable that there would be DJs of the nature that you're describing who would be... you know, constantly listening and have the time to listen to sort of speculative mixes. But I guess people were open to this kind of thing at that point. I guess so. I mean, who knows? I mean, who knows if they were even listening, but they were definitely getting the tapes. There is that. But I mean, I speak to Junior Sanchez regularly when I see him at these events around the world. And he always says, oh, yo, yo, man. you were that DJ that used to come in the booth. I don't know how he used to get in the DJ booth. And we saw his black all the way in and kind of pass on the mixtape while my friends were raiding the minibar. That was the routine. It really was. I mean, you know, this was before my Cream career because I was on the dance floors of Cream right from the very beginning. And, you know, the difference between... what it is now compared to then is it's night and day. When was the very beginning for Cream? It was October 1992. You got it down to the month and everything. If my memory serves me right, yeah, it was that date. And it was very important for the city. Culturally, it was a complete shift. from um candy kind of hardcore acid house which it got from being like an underground movement acid house to going on the radios to being a little bit of a thing that you would avoid and cream would a complete antidote to that they started with a real authentic New York house like Frankie Knuckles and Tony Humphries and these people and bringing them to Liverpool for the first time even though James Martin was doing it already and another club called 051 but he brought the ethos of instead of a dressed down clubber and your baggy raver clothes and your dummy and all the glow sticks and all that nonsense he introduced a sophisticated sound in a sophisticated room people would dress up rather than dress down And he brought a whole new ethos to Liverpool for the first time. So in terms of those DJs you mentioned, would you say that they were very much like, you know, influential and they were kind of you know in your formative days is this kind of who you were modeling yourself after in a way yeah absolutely i mean definitely uh derrick carter and roger s as he was known then roger sanchez particularly from a skills perspective because i was always my what drives me the heartbeat of what everything i'm interested in is his house music So those guys were coming along. Cream at the time would have Judge Jules in one room and Okaford in another. But then Roger Sanchez and Derek Carter in another, and that's where I'd be. And they would have three decks going, instead of just blending the end of a tune into another. they were really taking like battle style DJ into a whole new perspective for me. And I was like, okay, I'd literally watch Roger Sanchez play and he would be cutting up two tunes and kind of half beating things and making his own crescendos. And Roger, it's got to be said, he's one of the most skillful DJs of all time. He genuinely is. Whether you're into his music or what he's doing right now, then. he was untouchable he really really was so I would see what he was doing I'd patiently look over the DJ booth trying to figure out what is this guy doing? Go home, buy two copies of a record and think, okay, I'm going to figure this out. And I would sit in my bedroom trying to figure out how to do a double beat trick. You know, you slip a record half a beat behind so it gets a crescendo. That's what Roger was doing and I didn't know. So I got home and then I would do it for 12 hours until I could figure out what I could And that was my routine. I think, okay, how can I do this? I'd get it and then I'd nail it. And that's how I kind of honed my skills. I mean, do you feel like on a general level, house DJs were playing quite differently back then? Yeah. I mean, I'd say it was a lot more vocal. If you like, it wasn't as... as drum led until later on when people like onions and halo and hippie kind of, uh, appeared on the scene, so to speak. But, um, yeah, it was, it was more musical. It was a more broad, more New York, very, uh, disco and soul based as in, you know, it was born out of that era. So, uh, and people like, like obviously Dave Morales and. that's who used to come to cream but then things change when techno was introduced to cream and in terms of uh technique do you think like people were just i mean some of the um like the the beat um juggling technique that you were describing like i i just don't see people doing that anymore i mean were people like handling records differently do you think Yeah, well, I'd say, you know, a very small percentage of the DJs I go and watch were handling records very differently, as in they were controlling the record. They would choose what part of the record they were going to play rather than, like, play a record from start to finish, which is just as fine. You know, DJing will always be about music and selection and, you know, that's it. Skills conferred. it's always great to watch and it's always cool to be in control. So there was, like I say, Roger and Derek and then Carl Cox. So these were the 3D days that were just in charge. And that's what I wanted to be. So I guess by the end of the 90s, Cream had kind of established itself as like one of the world's like foremost clubbing brands, if you like. Was there a time at which you could sort of see that happening? Like when did Cream become this kind of world known clubbing institution? I can remember Cream just... kind of exploding very, very quickly. And because, like I mentioned earlier on, because it was the antithesis of everything that had become a little bit candy raver. And it was cool and it was new and it was fresh. And it went from literally 200 or 300 people. to be in sold out capacity very, very quickly. But I would say after two years of Cream being weekly, it became phenomenal. It really did. In fact, you must have seen that famous photograph that Jamie, Jamie, I can't remember the second name, Jamie took a photograph of when Sasha played for the first time. And it was a roadblock. I mean, it was crazy. It looked like... People were about to go to a World Cup match or something. It was crazy. At that point, I think James must have understood that things were changing. I think James, by his own, James Barton, sorry, for the owner of Cream, always wanted to make Cream into a global phenomenon, a global brand, in his words, like Pepsi or Coca-Cola. And at that time, he was pretty much there, wasn't he? He really was. I mean, who else? Can you imagine selling out a club week in, week out? in a small city in England for 3,000 people every week with underground DJs. It's quite incredible. So then your involvement, how did this come about? I mean, obviously you were attending for many years and I assume you were getting to know some of the people down there. Yeah, I mean, this, what I'm going to tell you now, probably sounds... Well, just like a horse shit. There's no way to put it. Let's just put it that bluntly. But I used to lie in my bed before I'd go to sleep at night worrying about how I was going to play a cream. And what I mean by that is they renovated the club and it went from kind of just decks and a mixer just on a, you know, a plank of water, wherever it was, just a regular DJ booth. to introducing this whole new Steve Dash sound system, which was, even to this day, is one of the greats. But they had floated turntables and a Yori mixer and a crossover. So I used to sit in my room, in my bedroom before I go to bed, or even with my eyes closed, worrying, how am I going to cope playing on these decks? And this was years before my residency at Green came about. It wasn't like during. I kind of had this belief that this was going to happen. And I was insistent upon myself that one day, sooner or later, they were going to come and ask me to be resident. And you were already figuring out the permeability? and the obstacles maybe and the difficulties you might experience in playing there. Yeah, yeah. Like three years, three years before, maybe even more. But anyway, one day after I won the competition and I was already resident at Ministry of Sound and Renaissance and that was great. You know, bear in mind that I'd gone from working in Littlewoods to being resident at Ministry. In fact, I was actually still working in Littlewoods. I didn't want to leave and I got made redundant and that was the reason that I left. Can you tell people what Littlewoods is? Sorry. You aren't from the UK. Yeah, sorry, sorry. Littlewoods is a clothing catalogue, which actually it's a full catalogue that sells TVs and everything that you would get. And I used to work there as an assistant buyer. And I didn't really want to leave because I'm like, okay, we'll ever leave now. I'm going to put myself in the lines then and I'm going to have to become a full-time DJ. But they may be redundant, unfortunately. But fortunately. Yeah, okay. And I never left. back but anyway what i was going to say about cream was one day there i was in liverpool i bumped into jim king and james martin the two directors of cream just down one of the streets in a bar and he just come to me and said would you like to be residents of cream and i was just like yes you know i was so happy but even then respectfully the first thing i did was phone up ministry and Renaissance and say, look guys, this has come in. You know, this is what I've been after since I was a kid. It would be like, you know, when Michael Owen got to play for Liverpool when he'd been going through and that's what he wanted to do. But they were really cool about it. In fact, they didn't even really revoke my residencies from ministry. There was a point when I was playing cream 10 till 12 and then I'd get in the car and play ministry four till And that was my routine pretty much every week until I started doing six hour sets in the annex and then I had to just commit to cream. I mean, you mentioned that you were running kind of simultaneously three residencies, which again seems like something from a lost era almost. do you think we'd ever go back to that model? Do you think that's something that could still work? I really don't think so. And I'll tell you, well, maybe at my level then, you know, because I was only a very entry-level young kid, even though I had some visibility because of Music Magazine, I wasn't any sort of, I wouldn't say I had a fan base. I probably had quite a deal of curiosity. And maybe the club owners from Renaissance Cream and Ministry could see a little bit of promise in me, so to speak. But I don't know. I really don't know. I don't know because everybody is... trying to do their own thing these days. Yes, so the model of a weekly residency maybe doesn't lend itself to a kind of more globalised scene now or something? Yeah, maybe not, but I think it would be a great thing to do for a DJ. There's nothing that cuts your teeth more as a DJ than playing weekend. week out in fact i would strongly recommend that anybody any dj that's really thinking of trying to do it to get in even if it's not um the the gig the pinnacle gig where you want to be learning your craft that that's what it's all about how would you kind of describe your sound around the sort of peak era cream time for you um it was just a blend of house and techno um very influenced by chicago in one way i'm very influenced by by the new influx of the west coast sound which was halo and hippie and onions and joeski and and the siesta record label sounds and i was quite instrumental in introducing that to the uk in a lot of ways because um i would book them at circuit sorry book them a cream let's not get that far we'll get to that I booked them a cream in the annex with me. I think the only other place that they might have been playing in the UK was, I don't even know, actually. So they were very supportive because at the time, because of all this action with me, I got given a Radio 1 show. So playing these super underground tracks on Radio 1 was just unheard of. So they were massively supportive of me. Yeah, I mean, I know you kind of mentioned that you're introducing people to this sound. And I think for me, this is personally true. I mean, I remember the Mixmount cover mount you did in like 2000 or 2001 that featured a bunch of these dudes. Yeah. I mean, would you say that this particular sound, because it was very based around a sort of small group of West Coast producers, wasn't it? That's right. Did it ever gain any real traction in the UK? I mean, did it become a thing, so to speak? Yeah, it did for a while. I mean, definitely Halo and Hippie became legendary in places like Fabric and Pressure in Glasgow. Onions and Joesky had some great tracks on their labels, Electric Soul and Mayer, but I'm not too sure if they kind of finally kicked off, but I'd say the sounds became massively popular. And like you mentioned before about the... 2001 Mixmag CD which was a Coverman CD that I did for them a lot of the tracks were on there and because Mixmag was selling a lot more back then that CD became in most club and households around the UK very very quickly so a lot of these tracks were flying out from all the record labels sorry all the record shops in England They were selling endless amounts of these tracks because of that CD. I was getting phone calls from a lot of other record shops in Glasgow and London and Nottingham saying, oh, thanks so much, man, for putting this track on the album. And I didn't think of it like that. I don't think in a forward way. I'm just like, I love this record. It's going on the mix. That's it. And how did the Radio 1 gig come about? Yeah, it was bizarre. I mean, it really was strange because I think I was getting a lot of, like I said, a lot of visibility through the residencies and through Music Magazine gave me a weekly, a monthly column, which was cool. So I had to kind of write what I was up to every month. I would seem to be playing a lot of gigs around the UK and I was getting, like I said, visibility, but they, they invited me in for, to do a pilot. which was in a room like this. And he said, have you ever done radio before? And I was like, no, I mean, literally never done radio at all. So it was like, okay. So I did a pilot on a Thursday and then he phoned me up the next day and said, would you like to do, um, like a super sub show? And you're sitting for, I think it was Danny Ramplin at the time, occasionally Pete, I think, I think Seb Fontaine was doing it then you can play your own music, don't worry about that, it's 100% your own playlist. I was like, you know, in for a penny, let's just do it, you know, that's no problem. But I was okay. I think by the end of my kind of three-year stint, because I would say I did a show about a month, maybe sometimes more, sometimes a bit less, it depended. I was a lot more of a confident broadcaster, if you like. But my first I wouldn't want to listen back to it. I really wouldn't because obviously just having that rhythm of how to broadcast, it's different than just playing tunes. But, you know, fair play to Radio 1 for taking a chance. But it was crazy that my first show was live on a Saturday night on Radio 1 and a couple of weeks before, I'd never done radio. And we're not talking about small numbers either. This is like prime Saturday night. And I guess if you were covering for Danny Rampley, it would have been like seven in the evening or something. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. I mean, do you even remember anything? Yeah, I do. I mean, they literally put me in the hot seat and just get on with it. And I had a producer. and they would kind of help me man the desk, and they would write a bit of a script out for me, and I'd try to kind of mumble through it. And even then, I'd say I probably spoke with more of a heavy Scouse accent, Liverpool accent, and I spoke probably faster, and I was a bit more nervous. and I was younger and I didn't know what I was doing. So, I mean, just the recipe has been honest, but it was good. And, you know, again, it did a lot for me and I was able to support, you know, a lot of great brand new underground music. maybe show off my djing a little bit and um yeah it was good fun i do remember one show though where me and dave beer from back to basics had to i had to interview dave beer and like i just mentioned about my uh broader accent back then and dave dave dave beer's broad accent now he's he can't really understand them at the best of times yeah yeah so it was i had to interview him live on air It didn't go well. It really didn't go well. But anyway, I think that was a fun time. I think by the end of it, I would have liked to have really got my teeth into it and maybe become a bit of a broadcaster. And I've recently started my own radio show now, so it would have been fun to maybe take it to the next level. But at the same time, being tarred at the time with the Radio 1 brush, when you're kind of doing music which is the opposite of mainstream, you know, the balance was uncomfortable for some people to kind of understand. I see. Okay, so do you think there were almost preconceptions over what you did as a DJ? due to the fact that you were on Radio 1. Yeah, exactly, yeah. That maybe weren't even based on the music that you were pushing on the show. Yeah, yeah, because some people would book me. It was mainly for a lot of UK gigs, but I would say Radio 1 in brackets next to my name. And then I'd get there and kind of just do my West Coast, Chicago, Jack in three-deck action. And people would be like, what's going on here? You know, which is okay. And, you know, like I say, my main criteria being a DJ is to rock the crowds. So I would always try and do my best. But yeah, I think I was misunderstood briefly. So with Cream kind of being your, you know, boyhood fantasy, if you like, your playing for Liverpool, Mike Lowe moment. you actually brought that to a close after a number of years. And how long were you with Cream? I was there about four years, about four years. Okay. And what were the kind of circumstances that led to you sort of thinking, okay, now's the time to move on and do something new? Well, it was, what happened was I was in the annex and I was playing six hour sets and I was introducing a lot of these names I mentioned earlier on. to Liverpool that was cool but the music in the other room was so different and not to my personal taste not what I was representing and it was like it was really going from you know more handbag commercial house to trance to pop trance to hard house and I'm in the other room kind of trying to get some grooves going and that's cool But I said to the guys at Cream, look, I don't think this is appropriate anymore. How about I start my own night? And they were like, okay, yeah, really behind the idea, and that's great, let's go on with it. So we agreed we were going to start my own night at Cream called Circus. And then subsequently, when I was off away organising the lineups and the artwork and the logos and all these things and really kind of getting excited about having my own night in Liverpool for the first time, they shut the doors of Cream. and cream closed before its 10th birthday because of financial reasons. The club was kind of... not doing great, if you like. What had gone from 3,000 a week was maybe down to 1,000 a week. And instead of closing all three rooms, they were trying to go against the grain. Instead of taking a step back and going forward, which was my advice at the time, it's like, look, let's start again. Let's bring it back. But they didn't want to do that. Anyway, they shut the doors. So Richard McGuinness, who is one of my really good friends, people might know Richard as the book of Warehouse, Global Gathering, Shibuku. But before that, he was one of my good friends and a really big supporter of me. In fact, Richard McGuinness was the first person to hear that music tape you mentioned earlier on. I give me a gig in Ireland, which was the first gig I ever got on a plane to go to. So he suggested, why don't you start Circus at this other place called The Mask, which is just up the road, and me and you will go in together. And I was like, okay, let's just do it. And so we did that on September the 14th, 2002. Expecting 200 people, we got like 450. So we were like, okay, people in Liverpool, one house music. house and techno and what we do and and you know we literally have a look back i mean is the would you say that the scene was in um kind of a strange place at that time i mean um i'm guessing this is um around the time period where the um if you like super club and superstar dj had kind of imploded I mean, was it kind of, did you feel as though you were the, you know, like the dawn of a new style of clubbing or something? Because as you say, we'd gone from 3,000 people going to Cream each week and, you know, the numbers just kind of fell off like really quickly. I think that the reason the numbers fell off for Cream, in my opinion, is because Cream used to, like I said before, used to be Derek Carter and Tony Humphries. in one room and then there was a mix but then they introduced Bugged Out to the same venue and Bugged Out took all the really interesting great fresh new music and techno and Cream never had any left, really. So I think from that, I believe that people wanted to hear fresh music in Liverpool still. We wanted to start small and honest, and that's exactly what we did. And like I say, the club scene imploded across the whole of the UK. And because it was rinsed, you know, it really was. I mean, I think, you know, similar to what's happened in America with EDM now, the same model happened in the UK a long, long time ago. And that is on the verge of, I don't know if it's going to implode as much out there because there's so much infrastructure and investment out there. But nevertheless, I think that the passion for it. will wane if you shove it down people's throats too much. Because it did happen pretty quickly in the UK, didn't it? Yeah, yeah, it certainly did. Around the turn of the millennium. Yeah, yeah. So kind of as a promoter, did you have like, you know, a mission statement or was it like a defining thing that you wanted to like offer to Liverpool? Yeah, I mean, and it's still the same. It's entertainment and enlightenment. And what I mean by that... is, you know, it's going to have a good time, but we're going to listen to new music. And I think I used to have these banners put up and that said serious music, fun times. And it's like fresh new music, but it's okay to just come and have a laugh. You know, it's not chin-strokery. It's not too serious. It's what clubbing is meant to be about. It's a type of club. well, I've tried to instill in people where you can come by yourself. That's the whole point. You can come and have fun and listen to great new music. you will leave with the friends even if you came with none. That's kind of the ethos behind it. I mean, have there been like defining nights for you at Circus? Endless. Really, really endless. I mean, I think even the first night when 400 people came and we were expecting like two, I was like, okay, this is incredible. And then of course... the first birthday when I finally got my hero, Derek Carter, to come and play. He's now one of my good friends and releases music on my label and all these things, which is bizarre. But yeah, and Derek played for us and it was an amazing experience to sell out way in advance. Had Derek playing in the club and it was such a good party. The first time Laurent Garnier played for us, which was a kind of a real shift for us because we took a chance. at the time a predominantly just house club not playing too much techno sometimes but lauron came in and we kind of quite bravely said he said what you want me to play and he's playing he's playing five a five hour set from start to finish in the main room the theater and we just said to do whatever you want and he goes okay you sure and we're like yeah yeah and the circus crowd i've never heard kind of dub reggae up through disco to house to techno to epic to a full lauren set but they lost their minds for it. And it was my birthday as well, I never forget. But yeah, and then obviously the 500th Essential Mix, which was amazing. A few years later when BBC Radio 1 asked us to host the 500th Essential Mix, which could have been any club in the whole world. And they come to us and said, look, we can get this. Here's Pete. Go and speak to your DJ mates. Let's see who can get in. It's like, okay, so we asked Richie Horton and Sasha and then the public voted for Aeroplane and it was incredible. It really was incredible. It was one of the best parties we've ever done and particularly because it was around the time of that Ash Cloud a few years ago when maybe at seven o'clock on the day of the gig, we didn't know if anyone was coming and it was going to be broadcast live and all these... things and we didn't know if any DJ could actually get through and land in England and then one by one but then between seven and eight o'clock everyone made it. It could have gone seriously wrong. It could have gone so many cancelled flights that weekend. I know and I think we were one of the only clubs in the UK that didn't get affected and everything just came together. What else? I think When I play longer sets in the theatre, when I play from start to finish, they seem to kind of go down really well because the funny thing is about the theatre, which is Circus' main room in Liverpool. It's one of the best rooms you'll ever see to play in. You know, it's literally a 200-year-old theatre, 220 years old. Charles Dickens has spoken on the stage. There used to be autopsies in that room. It's got real history in that room, but it's one of the hardest places to really nail it. If you can nail it in a theatre... Why is that? I don't know. I think it's because it's an amphitheatre-style vibe. It goes up and up and up, and that's great. And you can see everyone's faces, but just trying to get that. full-on barbaric connection, which is what I love. You know, it doesn't have to be fast or hard or aggressive or anything, but just getting that movement where everyone's kind of locked into the zone. It's quite hard to do in that room. Laurent's done it, Coxie's done it, Carola's done it, Dice has done it. fortunately get to do quite a lot and it's one of the great rooms. So in running your parties in Liverpool, because you've become like a real stalwart of the scene there, I mean, has it been important to you down the years to kind of support the scene in Liverpool? Is that something you've thought quite closely about? Yeah, of course. I mean, I really go out of my way to do it really because you know, not just because I was supported in the past by other clubs and, you know, cream and, um, venues in Liverpool, but just because I think it's great to find new talents. Um, for years at circus football, we've done something as simple as doing, doing it. DJ competition well I want to say simple it's a bit of a ball ape because it takes me ages to go through every single mix because I genuinely go through every single mix so it can take me a while but I've found some great talent through those DJ competitions more recently with the label I'm able to find like remix competitions where you can find fresh new talent and now again with the label finding um really kind of accomplished artists brand new beat makers liverpool seems to have an abundance of them at the moment and um in terms of liverpool how would you say that it compares to other uk cities for going out is that they're kind of like defining characteristics of a liverpool crowd um yeah in a lot of ways it's i think it can be very working class for, in, in, in a lot of good ways, you know, people genuinely graft all week and they come out for the weekend and they just, to coin a phrase, they just want to go for it. You know, they want to have it. They want to have a, they want to have a good time. And, you know, they want to, listen to music, they want to feel like they've got the money's worth out of United. They really let rip, but at the same time, they're a really clued-up city when it comes to music. Obviously, historically speaking, Liverpool's always had a really buoyant music scene. But at the moment, in Liverpool, from a house and techno perspective, it's never been better. It's just underground party after underground party after underground party. No matter where you go, people genuinely go for it. I wanted to ask you about Carl Cox. As you've been resident at his parties in Ibiza over a number of years, it seems to be in one of your key gigs in the last decade. Would you say that he's kind of acted as a kind of mentor figure in a way? I mean, is there stuff that you've learned in particular from him? Yeah, I mean, I don't think he's gone out of... He's been a mentor on purpose. I think through spending so much time with him. And we're on the same agency. And obviously we play a lot of gigs together. Just, just listening to the way he plays and the way he is with people. And he takes. From a DJ perspective, Coxie makes sure he nails every single gig. And I think that's one thing I've took from him. Because even though I always know that the important thing about being a DJ is to entertain and enlighten, like I said before, but you really are there to rock the club. Coxie, you know, subconsciously instilled that into me. I've never seen him not nail it, but I must have seen him play a hundred times. And whether you're into all of his music or not, he will nail that. He'll make you dance. And that's what he does. And Carl was one of the first DJ mixtapes I ever, I ever had. And that really made me want to be a DJ. In fact, it was this mixtape called Amnesia House in 1991. And it was a three deck mix in. like rave tape but like again like I mentioned before most of the DJs were kind of blending the end of the tracks Coxie was in charge cutting three decks up like loops of bits just cutting and just making things really complicated but with the funk It was just totally different. But yeah, again, you know, just listen to Carl from then to progressing through the years. What I neglected to say before was Coxey at Circus for the first time was like a big deal for me. And just seeing him nail the theatre. And then when we played back-to-back at Circus another time, that was a really, really big deal for me. But again, just seeing the effort that he puts into smashing the crowd. The way he is with people, he gives everyone a moment of his time. He's very respectful. He's seen everything. He doesn't get flustered at all, really. And he can play all the way from disco right through to nosebleed techno. which for me, that's what a DJ should be able to do. So when you talk about his consistency and kind of like nailing it each time, do you think that simply comes from like an intense amount of focus on each gig? Like how does he pull that off? Well, you better ask Carl that question, but I mean, I think from, you know... What I do is you genuinely feel the vibe of the room and you can just feel how much energy is required to be spent. Last week I played in Amnesia at Milan and I knew as soon as I came into the room that they wanted it more fierce, they wanted a bit of techno, but I think that's the... That's the real skill of being a DJ is kind of approaching each gig. As soon as you arrive into the booth, you're feeling the vibe of which way to take it, which is why I worry about a lot of laptop guys who are just playing their live sets and things like that, and they don't have flexibility. But maybe we'll get to that shortly. So from under the umbrella of Carl's Ibiza parties, you did the first circus shows, dedicated shows in Ibiza this year. But was it kind of a strange summer for you? Because there were some problems, wasn't there, at Boom, which was the club you were hosting at? No, no, let me explain. With Coxie, I was resident for years. And then this summer, I was offered to do Boom, which seemed like a good idea at the time. So unbelievably, I had to leave space for a year. I'm going to go back and play again this year, which is great. But last year we were offered by Danny Whittle and Mark Netto, who used to be the top guys at Pasha. And they came over to Boom, showed me this exciting new club with these guys, which are two of the most respected people in Ibiza, full stop. And it seemed very, very, you know, appealing at the time. And even though... Something inside me was like, I don't know about this, you know. But we got out there. I was given a month to book everything, to get everything organised, the artwork, all the lineups. And considering we had such a short space of time, the lineups were fantastic. But I don't really want to give you too much of the back details on Boom, but I can just let you say we did our absolute best. And it went better than we all agreed on what we were going to do first year, second year, third year. But the back room, boom, weren't pulling the weight, if you can say that. And even now, the mess still hasn't been mopped up. it's very uh it's very very complicated situation i mean it's got to be a difficult market to enter into as a new offering right yeah it was nothing i i i think the fact that we're not going to go back next year to boom um or this year is nothing to do with kind of a success rate and it like that i'm not trying to say we did really great it was okay it wasn't wasn't too bad But I think we were given the awkward playing field to work upon. So kind of the backdrop to all of this has been your productions. You've released on some really notable labels, like Cocoon, Saved to Seal, Defected, InTech. Do you feel, though, as though people have seen you, first and foremost, as a DJ down the years? Do you think the productions has kind of been like something that has been a little bit more background in your story? Yeah, yeah, I'd say that's fair comment. I mean, because that's where I am, first and foremost. You know, I practice most of being a DJ. and practice second most at being a producer. So I think that's why maybe it's kind of, it's kid brother at the moment. Well, not at the moment. It's really like getting there, you know. Well, once I get there, like you say, I've released on some great labels, new stuff coming on Desolat, signed to Warner Brothers, you know. So I do a lot of broader music as well, but maybe. Maybe it could have been a little bit more buoyant, but during those cream days, you know, I was probably more interested in getting leathered than I was in making music. But that's fine. You know, I am where I am. I'd say these days I'm fairly reasonably accomplished as a producer. You know, I make all my own music, write my songs. lyrically, which is good. And, you know, more recently a track called Float Away seems to have done really well. And another one on Defected I see, and like I say, I've just been signed to Desolat as well. So yeah, music's going really well and particularly on my label. But there's one thing, up until maybe the past couple of years, I never really had the same love for making music that I did for DJing. But now it's kind of equal, you know, and I'm really, I'm in my studio every single day, even when I'm on the road, you know, I'll sit there kind of sketching out tracks and ideas. And that's what I'm really passionate about these days. Was it kind of difficult in a way to come from an era where there maybe was more focus on the pure art of DJing? And then when the kind of market changed, there was all this additional pressure, if you like, to then put a production hat on and, you know, have these simultaneous... careers in a way yeah yeah i'd say it was quite a jump but again um maybe the passion just wasn't there for me particularly like it was you know i was i heard of derrick hart and roger mainly because not just because of cream but because i was buying their records so I wouldn't say I was lazy, but maybe I could have been a bit more forthcoming. But, you know, my natural abilities for passion just come naturally. So whenever... That said, I'd been making music for 12 years. The first track I did was with Paul Wolford, which was great, and I was signed to Junior. So it was a long, long time ago, but now... I'm really confident in the studio. I've got a nice, nice setup and things seem to be progressing in a quite a, quite a nice rate. Was there a moment at which, or a time at which it just kind of like clicked for you and just started to make a bit more sense and you sort of started to naturally more enjoy it and want to be in the studio? Yeah, I'd say when I did my last, well, no, I was going to say it was. During the time when I did my first album, about five years ago, four or five years ago, I was making track to track and I kind of pieced together a bit of an album. But I realised I was sitting down and making music every day and I was really enjoying it. And particularly when I made Come Home, which was on Cocoon, which was like probably my favourite track I've ever done, even now. I think I kind of let go as such. I didn't want to make just this sound or that sound. It was the first moment when I was wanting to make what naturally came out, which is what I've been doing ever since, which is why if you look at my catalogue since then, some tracks are kind of quite blistering techno, others are super deep, others are not even house. But I just sit down and just make what I feel is, you know, come inside me, for want of a better phrase. Are there guys that you kind of look to at the moment? Are you particularly influenced by particular producers in the studio? No, not really. I mean, I listen to a lot of a wide range of music. You know, believe it or not, I stick on a lot of black music at home and just jazz FM or I listen to song structure. And even when I make just a beat track, I want it to have a beginning, middle and end and not because I want... I want every track I make to have a story and to matter to me. So, you know, that said, you know, when a DJ out, I'm quite happy with just loops. So maybe even now there's a bit of confusion of what I do as a DJ and what I do as a, as a producer, because I make a kind of super deep song like it on the one last one defective, which is called I see. which is a really poignant, melancholy, full song I wrote in Ibiza six years ago. And then I made it into this track and then you hear me play and it's bang out tech now. I think it might be confusing for people, but I just love both. So that's, I think that's where I'm at. Now I've got a broader palette. Again, it just points to these market forces, doesn't it? Where the productions are supposed to be like a, you know, a calling card and everyone like hears it and then wants to go and hear the reflection of that in the club or something. Well, the way I see it is, you know, I'm there to rock a club. as a DJ, but as a producer and someone who makes music, I'm here to tell a story, so to speak. And, you know, when all is dust, there's going to be me and my music and I want to be proud of every track. I don't want to make it mean like I've made a track that it works in that particular situation. I like to do them too and that's fine. But I really, you know, want to look back at every single record I've made and be proud of So it's been roughly five years since you started the Circus label. Like as a label boss, are there particular things you're looking for? Are there particular things you find yourself going towards in terms of the stuff that you sign and release? Yeah, in a lot of ways. the music to be firstly well made. I want it to sit anywhere in the electronic spectrum if you like. Have personality and originality if you can. Or if not smash the dance floor. That's cool. DJ tools are just as good for me. But again, like I said before, I want every record to be colourful, to matter. And the label's progressing at such a... Especially in the last year, it seems to have taken a nice shape, particularly since the Bigger Than Prince record. So I've managed to kind of get the record label really organised now and I've got releases lined up until... maybe the end of the summer already. So it's like every month, but a proper package. And similar to the way I do circus, the idea behind it is it's not just every lineup must matter or it must be as unmissable as possible. That's kind of the ethos behind it. But even though I'm signing people up, like Green Velvet, and then rebooting Carcox. Most of it was pushing people like Kai Kreider and Kaidas and other people that you may have never, ever heard of. It's all about balance, similar to Circus. There's always DJ Big Balls in the top. me in the middle and then a fresh name and that's the way it works and that's similar with the record label it's all about pushing what you can but making getting I go back to this word visibility because it's so hard to sell records at the moment but again it's It was a label of love, but now it seems to have turned the corner. Yeah. So did you invite Green Velvet to record something or how did that come about? Well, it was Circus 10-Year Anniversary Party or leading up to it. So I thought to myself, okay, the record label's doing solidly, it's doing all right, but I've got all these guys that have been playing for me for a long, long time. Why not just ask them to make me a brand new track? Um, it's like, okay, so one by one, I went to Coxie and went to Nick Curley, Gooty, um, asked loads of people that I've been. playing for me for a long time. Can you make a track for the Circus X album? And the response was so amazing that I ended up having to do two with Laurent Garnier, It's Everything, David Escalachi. So I've got 20 amazing artists that have all done tracks for Circus recordings, but one of them was Bigger Than Prints. So I took Green Velvet to do a circus tour with me in Indonesia. And we did like a full four or five gig tour out there. We do circus tours there occasionally. And I was explaining to him about, look, Circus X album volume one, it's got nine tracks, but there's one space left. I told him about the list of people who were in. Would you like to be involved? And he's like, yeah, man. you know, he's like, and really like kind of positive about the idea. And he, and he was straight in. So we gave, he gave me a date and it was December 14th last year. And he said he would have me attract by that date. And he did. And he gave me the original version of bigger than Prince. And I was like, yes, that's, that's great. That's great. So when we released, the album I made an album only which meant you have to you have to buy the whole album if you want that particular track because I knew this is going to be a single so I waited spoke to a few of my friends Hot and Titty 2 got in touch with me said yo I love this track you know what's going on so obviously I asked him does he want to remix it then I asked the Martyners brothers did they want to remix it and both of them said yeah instantly and then obviously the rest is history bigger than Prince went absolutely bananas still is definitely the biggest underground cut in Ibiza this summer and it's still growing and who knows what's going to happen with that record. I know a lot of the majors really want to sign it. Sony are really interested. Atlantic were, but then they kind of got cold feet for some reason, but we'll see. So you could have a pop hit on your hands then? Possibly, yeah. But I mean, it's going to be, if you have a pop hit, it's going to be... just an edit of the original version, it's not going to be polluted in any way, shape or form. So you've got Circus, the club night, obviously, Circus, the label, and then you've included the word Circus in many of the remixes you've turned in down the years. Why has it been so important to you to have this kind of like branded approach down the years? Have you thought much about that? No, no, not at all. I haven't thought about it at all. I just started my party and then I was going to, when I wanted to start a record label about six years ago, five years ago, I was going to call it something else and I had the artwork done and everything. And then my manager at the time was like, why are you changing, trying to put another brand this five or six years history of this club with all these people playing for you why not just go down that route I said okay but before that it was always the remixes were always called Yousef Circus Reworks because I was making them for the Dance Floors at Circus ten years I've been doing those now which is cool But yeah, I mean, it's not kind of a full-on brand approach. It was never meant to be like that. But now, 10 years in, it seems to be going down that route. But again, it's all about quality. It's all about bringing fresh names in. I mean, even the club, you know, it was always about bringing fresh names in. People like... Like Loco Dice, for example, I gave him his first UK gig. As far as I understand, he was like 200 quid. Same with Seth. Same with a lot of these guys. So it's always about bringing things forward as well as having an interesting start in the first place. So what's next for you? What's next for me? Randomly, I've just finished making a track for the World Cup album. which is a bit weird. I've never seen that one coming out of the dark. What's the World Cup album? Well, Fatboy Slim, Norman, is the official DJ of the World Cup. And he has been asked to get 10 of his DJ mates or maybe more to all make a track for the official FIFA World Cup album. And the idea is we get given free reign of the Universal Music Catalogue, the Brazilian one, and then we can kind of make a track. So I was a bit kind of concerned about bastardising Brazilian music. So fortunately, I happened to be in Brazil. at the time and then somebody gave me some really great advice as to not make it too obvious or not do like a candy version of Brazilian music which we might think is cool but the Brazilians might find offensive so with all this in mind I came back and then I went up to Liverpool and recorded Liverpool Samba School which are like a first-rate world-renowned samba band in this kind of really over, quite aggressive techno backing track I'd made with this Brazilian vocalist as well that I'd sampled from the Universal Music Catalogue and just pieced it all together. And it's come out really, really, I think it's come out quite well. All the project is complete, if you like. And Fatboy Slim signed it off yesterday. There's people like, as far as I understand, there's Diplo, there's Claude Von Stroke, there's all the way to the end of the scale, there's David Guetta, there's all these kind of random across-the-board DJs all making a track for this particular album. So it's nice to be asked to come and do one, and I did it to the best. of my imagination. And it's very kind of Latin. And one thing I learned from this Liverpool Samba band is some of the drums that you use together are regionally, you can't cross them over. So, for example, if one's from Salvador and another one's from Sao Paulo, for example, you can't cross them. They have to kind of be regionally correct as well as musically correct, which is really interesting. So, yeah, great project there. Really enjoy doing that. And then what else is going up? The Desolat thing. A new track on Circus Recordings called Believe in Love with Roy Davis Jr. But I'm up to all sorts all the time. you
