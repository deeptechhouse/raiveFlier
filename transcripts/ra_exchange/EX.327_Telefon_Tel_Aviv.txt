Thank you. ♪♪♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Joshua Eustace, who's a founding member of Telephone Tel Aviv. Originally hailing from New Orleans, Eustace and his childhood friend Charles Cooper crafted a bittersweet melodic IDM sound that resonated with audiences far beyond the Bayou. But tragically, their collaboration was cut short by Cooper's death in 2009. The years between now and then can be described as an adrift period for Eustace, albeit a prolific one. He continued to work with Nine Inch Nails, made an album as Sons of Magdalene, contributed to the Tropic of Cancer project, and dove back into glitchy drums with his second woman duo. In conversation with Matt McDermott, Eustace sheds a light on his history as a producer and fan of electronic music, before candidly addressing his choice to curtail the grieving process and return as Telephone Tel Aviv. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Joshua Eustace is up next. Thank you. We are here in Los Angeles with Josh Eustace, founding member of Telephone Tel Aviv, who's also taken part in a number of other projects, including Blackest Ever Black Act, Tropic of Cancer, Second Woman on Spectrum Spools, and a lot more that we'll speak about today. How are you, man? Good, man. How are you doing? I'm doing well. First of all, congratulations on... Getting back on the road with TTA and as well as the reissue, which contains some demos from that period. Embarrassingly enough, yeah. From what were, I can only imagine to be very meticulous, kind of painstaking sessions from that time, as was like the spirit of the times, would you say? Yeah, I mean, that was 98, 99 when Charlie and I started working together. And software really wasn't anywhere near where it is now. There wasn't really a way to do what we wanted to do. And the only way we could figure out how to do it was by making thousands of sounds and then arranging them by hand in the window in Pro Tools. So it was a ton of really meticulous work that was all done drunk. Seriously, we would go out every night and get... absolutely shit canned and then come back at like six in the morning and then work all morning and then sleep at, you know, two in the afternoon, one in the afternoon and wake up at eight, repeat, repeat, repeat. This went on pretty much all of. 1999 and that we ended up with the stuff that you hear in, um, archive 99 is essentially the demo that we sent to hefty. In fact, it is the demo we sent to hefty minus a couple of things. So, I mean, listening to it, first of all, I don't think you'd guess that to begin with, but I guess you guys were some pretty emotional drugs then. Yeah, I think. I think Charlie was known for being, well, let's just say an emotional drunk. And I'm an emotional drunk as well, which is why I don't really drink anymore. I mean, I might have a beer or a whiskey, but I definitely don't like to get fucked up anymore. Also, and then having to just correct all the work that you do when you're wasted the next day. It's like, God, this is a goddamn disaster. I have to pee. peel through all of these terrible edits and all this sloppy work. Anyway, we were, as you can hear, heavily indebted to, you know, Apex Twin and Autechre. And we're also simultaneously really into things like Pole and Oval. and Tortoise and the kind of thrill jockey world, the Chicago world was really interesting to us. Hefty Records was a big deal to us. The stuff that Slicker had done and Schematic was really cool. The stuff that Josh Kay and Romulo Del Castillo were doing was really cool. Scott Heron. Richie Devine, like this whole kind of, you know, almost American movement was a big influence to us. And we kind of wanted to like, oh, maybe we need to try to contribute to this kind of American sound of electronic music at the time. And that scene, which is loosely categorized as IDM, have you observed anything quite as vital as that since? Oh, I mean, vital little micro genres of music. There's tons of them. I mean, the whole grime thing isn't micro anymore. It's tremendous. And that's super vital, especially in the United Kingdom. But its influence kind of goes around the world. I mean, it turns up in all kinds of other places. That's just one example. I could do this all day. I mean, we could talk about dubstep and how it morphed and changed into this kind of, you know, big room sort of thing that sort of revolutionized what the world thinks about electronic music. But if you go back to its roots and look at things like Garage at the turn of the millennia, and you look at... you know that coming out of house music in a way but all but also kind of influenced by this kingston thing and then it sort of morphed in the mid aughts into this like burial uh you know post basic channel dub influences and stuff like this with these cut up vocals i mean it's ubiquitous now so there's all these tiny little micro genres of course that like sort of filter out into the world and become these like huge things that everybody is somehow aware of, even if they're not necessarily aware of Martin or Burial or somebody like that. I mean, IDM, I don't know if it was ever really vital. I mean, it's certainly vital to me. I mean, the music that I loved was often categorized as that. Well, I mean, your status as a complete music nerd is obviously not up for debate. But, you know, those sorts of movements that you're speaking of benefit from hyperconductivity. And in terms of grime, like sort of stateside equivalents like Rabbit or something like that, like come up through band camp and get out there that way. How did you at the time and even going back to your sort of rave days and discovering electronic music in New Orleans, like how did you guys all sort of find each other and form a network at the time? It's hard to say, but mostly it was by trying to get shows booked. You know, for what we were doing in New Orleans, it was like we could play little house parties and stuff like that or a little bar here and there and people would come. But it was never really more than 40 or 50 people in a tiny place. So eventually it came to. point of like you know in 1999 for example oh shit you know funksterung push button objects and uh you know the schematic guys are doing a party in miami let's go down there and like try to meet up with them or whatever and go to the show it'll be cool music and so we went down there and like I think before we went, I think Charlie sent an email to Josh K just saying like, hey, dude, we're big fans of what you guys are doing. We'd love to send you some music or whatever. And we sent him music and he was like, oh, cool. This is cool shit. Like, let's you come to Miami. Let's hang out. And then we meet. And then, you know, then that's when we met Seven from Chocolate Industries and Rom and Josh from Schematic. among other people. And then also at the same time, kind of became acquainted through similar thing of like going to Atlanta to play a show. We met Scott Heron and Richie Devine and kept in touch with him. And then it was basically just keeping in touch through email and sending tracks back and forth. Like, Hey dude, does this, does this suck? Or like, is this cool? Like, or, oh, here's my new shit. But it was all, we used to pass it around on CD-Rs when we'd see each other in Atlanta. It was like, you drop a CD-R on somebody. That was back in the days of CD burners, man. Scott Heron. I still have like a bunch of Scott Heron's CDRs that he gave me with his tag all over it, like with the Della Rosa and Aesora stuff just scribbled all over it. It's really cool. I mean, I know that that sort of feedback that you received from people that you respected was obviously invaluable at the time, but you and Charlie, rest in peace, were always kind of tough on each other. to begin with, right? And that's something that you've historically been a bit of a perfectionist or sort of unwilling to let things go out into the world without being absolutely sure or just being like, okay, I'm sick of this. We have to put it out at this point. Is that something that you'd say was always the case with you? It was, well, it's a little different than that. I think a more apt description would actually be that Charlie and I were both very hard on the music. He and I were never hard on each other musically. I mean, we would fight about other shit, but we never, ever fought about music or argued about music in the studio. Not once. But that just comes down to trust. You know, if he felt really strongly about something, then I trusted him enough to just go along with it, even if it seemed weird or not quite the right thing. And every time I did, I was happy that I did. And vice versa. If I felt really strongly about something being right or something being wrong, he would go along with it. So. Ultimately, that is done in service of the output of the music or whatever. And yeah, we would belabor things to a point ad nauseum, to a point where it was really pointless and we could have just worked on these songs forever. Technically, I feel like maybe we never should have released... Fahrenheit fair enough. And we should just, it should have just been a thing like whatever Kanye's doing with Life of Pablo, where it's just, it's up on Spotify, but it changes a little bit every day. You know, like I feel like Fahrenheit fair enough. We could still be working on that. I could still be like in OS 9 Pro Tools 5.1 or 5.0, whatever the fuck it was. Still just sliding little fucking sounds around and printing new effects. I mean. So in that way, yeah, we were perfectionists. And whenever a song was done was the point where both of us just looked at each other and said, well, fuck it. I mean, we could do this forever or we could just print it. So let's just print it. Leading up to... The reissue of the record, which contains some demos and unheard stuff from that period, was striking upon listening to it 15 years after it was released, 17 years after the sessions. Getting on two decades is how well it holds up. It sounds remarkably current. And I mean, there is the melodic core that really kind of holds everything together and just makes it appealing is on a technical level and an emotional level, just a general musical level. I know that you're a pretty humble guy, but what do you think set it, set the group apart and gave it such an impact at the time? You know, I really, I have no idea. Because to me, it sounds kind of funny. Like when I listen to it, I think of two 22-year-old kids. Like I was still living in my mom's house. I just finished college. Like zero shit going for me in life. Like I had a college degree that was really hard to get and in the end ultimately worthless outside of an incredible amount of knowledge. What was that degree in? It's a Bachelor of Music in Theory and Composition. It kind of gave me a good leg up into being able to write music and understanding harmony and all of that kind of stuff and understanding the history of music. And I wouldn't change that. I would still study music at the university if I had the choice again. What set it apart, I think, maybe was that we were so hyper-focused on melody and harmony. And electronic music at the time had a little bit of that, but it was really more about just the sound design or just the beats or whatever. And the two things that we wanted to change, at least for our own music, was that we wanted it to be super romantic and, you know, really melodic. strong emphasis on harmony and progression and these sorts of things. And we also wanted it to be rooted in African-American music and not rooted in just purely techno or just purely house, but rooted in a really broad kind of swath of African-American music or Black music, rap. hip-hop, R&B, a huge influence from day one. Of course house and techno, but more we wanted the beats to kind of not be so stiff, because there was a sort of kind of rigidity in electronic music at the time that was part of what made it cool, but we wanted to go away from that and make the beats a little more fluid and have things a little more funky or something. You've also mentioned bounce rap, which is built around two drum samples for the most part as sort of being formative. And this was just sort of unavoidable living in New Orleans at the time. Yeah, I mean, it was ever like the idea of twerking, like being in... relatively recent thing for the rest of the world is a patently absurd notion to anybody from New Orleans because we were saying twerk and talking about twerking in the early 90s and bounce rap reflected that and talked about it constantly it was a type of dancing that was done In New Orleans, it's certain types of parties, not done by white people. It is an invention of the African-American community of New Orleans, pure and simple. Don't argue with me. You'll lose. That's where it comes from. And you might even be able to say that it comes from C.J. Pete Housing Authority or St. Thomas. I couldn't tell you which one, but I know people that could know. Bounce rap was ubiquitous. Everybody listened to it. It was the music of the black culture of New Orleans, but everybody loved it. White people loved it. Any Latinos that were living there loved it. Everybody loved it. It's party music. There's nothing really negative about bounce rap. There were battles and diss tracks in bounce rap, but it was all kind of tongue-in-cheek and a little bit done, sort of nudge, nudge, wink, wink. It's party music. And super fun. And it will, I mean, I remember back in the 90s, if you put on any of those old songs at a party, it would just go off, completely off. Going back a little further to, or simultaneous, but before you got into the non-repetitive beats, like going back to 4-4 specifically, like from my understanding, like you guys down there were basically like mail ordering 12 inches, like house and techno 12 inches kind of blind. And like, it would sort of be like, oh, I have my store that I'm ordering from. Or, you know, can you can you speak about like the rave scene that, you know, you came up in to some extent? And how did you get involved with that? Yeah, the rave scene, I came into it just from dudes that I met in freshman year in college, you know, like 90. No, I mean, that's actually not true. I was kind of going to raves in high school. Well, what we call the raves, they were usually in clubs, but there was one big Then it happened at the State Palace Theater, and I would go to those, and they were fun, but I didn't really know much about the music at the time. Simultaneously, two things happened. I, when I was 17 and 18 going into college, had a job at a record store there that had an electronic music section. And I randomly picked out this compilation that looked cool, and it was the Trezor II compilation and had Maurizio and Jeff Mills and all this kind of stuff on it. Joey Beltram, I think, was even on there at the time. But it opened with the Domino remix, and that was really formative for me. And that's when I realized, like, wait, this is not what's playing at these raves that I go to. Like, this is way better. Like, I'm way more into this. Who are these Tresor guys? And I didn't meet anybody that could explain that to me until maybe 95. when I met this guy, Andre Gett, who was a couple years older than me and went to college and is literally the Matt Pinfield of techno. And nobody knows it because he's not a public DJ anymore. He doesn't really go around, but he literally taught me everything I know about techno in-house. And what did that look like? Were you going over to his house? Were you just getting on the decks? Almost every day going to his house. And he taught me how to DJ in like 95 and got me started and say like, okay, cool. Here's an Advent record. Okay, cool. Here's X-101 Atlantis. Match them up, motherfucker. Like, okay, cool. Like, oh, have you heard this? I remember when Surgeon basic tonal vocabulary came out. Was it like, what, 97, 98 or whatever? And he's like, dude, you got to come over today. We got a heater. And we like put it on and mind-blowing record. One of the records that I used a lot to kind of learn how to beat match was the... There was a, God, I don't remember the name of it, but there was a Surgeon 12-inch on Downwards, maybe a 95 or 96. I know it was also on a Claude Young DJ Kicks around 96. And it's like the classic Surgeon techno track. It's this tritone synth line, and it just absolutely destroys. And still holds up 20 years later. absolutely future-driven dance music. But yeah, Andre taught me how to do it. And he taught me a lot about, oh, you like Trezor? Oh, you need to check out all of this guy's shit. His name's Moritz von Oswald. Check out that. Look at this stuff. Look at this stuff. And then later it was Porter Ricks and Chain Reaction and all this kind of stuff. So I had a good mentor when it comes to dance music. Was the vault in Berlin. Was that something that you exoticized in New Orleans, which is like a very unique place in the U.S.? Or if, you know, you were picking up like Axis records or something like that. Did you see these records like played in public or like understand like the impact that they could have in a club setting at the time? No, man. In New Orleans, there were a bunch of DJs in New Orleans. Most of them played kind of trancy, progressive-y stuff. The only dudes, and I'm techno were Andre, me, and Dave Manick, who was the dad of all techno in New Orleans. He is the father of any kind of techno dudes that came out of New Orleans. Dave Manick. And Dave knew he knew the underground resistance dudes and would go up to Detroit every once in a while and plays older than I am. So he must be almost 50 now. But shredding classic Detroit techno guy. He also was sort of Andre's mentor in a way. So he sort of mentored me and Andre together. And that was it for techno in New Orleans. Nobody, and I mean nobody, even knew what the fuck it was. You'd go to a rave party and not hear one note. Not one. quarter note of techno. So, I mean, I guess in that sense, like you got lucky and learn what the real shit was. And when did it, when did it start to move away from DJing to, uh, you know, being the studio nerd that you've been for the last. 20 years. Well, I was already making electronic music. I first started making electronic music. I got my first, you know, kind of synthesizer scenario sequencer in maybe 93. And it was a Korg M1 and a borrowed Juno 106 from my... friend's older brother who didn't give a shit about the 106 anymore and um and it wasn't particularly a sought-after synth at the time so it was freely given and uh and a brother pdc 100 sequencer hardware sequencer what a piece of shit later in mmt8 later uh 95 it became a macbook 520 with studio vision doing the sequencing on it but that was You know, right around that time is when I started getting into techno. And with Andre and with another buddy named Ron Snyder, we started making records in like 95, 96. We started a label and we're putting out electro records. Like the first one was out in 96. I'm not going to say the name or who it is or what the label is. You can figure that shit out. But I have records, electro records out in the mid-90s. And those Sonic Groove kids bought them all up, man. We sent it to Dietrich Shaineman and he kind of smirked back at us and bought the whole stock. And I think they sold all of them. I don't know if they sold them, but he bought all of them. We did 300 of each issue. And Sonic Groove, they took him. Yeah. It was pretty killer, man. It's like the equivalent of walking into Hardwax today and having them buy you out or something like that. Yeah, I mean, we couldn't believe it. I was shaking talking to fucking Heather Hart on the phone. You know what I mean? I don't even think they would remember who we are. But, I mean, I have – Deidre Shandeman and I have mutual friends elsewhere through a totally different channel. But, yeah, maybe if you ask him, he could probably tell you the name of the release and when it came out and the name of the label. But you're not going to tell us. No. I mean, there's probably, like, already, like, some Romanian guy. Next time I see Dietrich, I haven't seen him in 13 or 14 years. Next time I see him, we're going to have a chuckle about it. Shout out Complete Mastering. Yeah, what's up? What's up how you're sort of bringing in traditionally black American genres like R&B, bounce rap, rap music in general. And, but... At some point, you're one of three people playing techno in New Orleans. You're starting to work on music, starting to look up to labels like Hefty and this sort of nascent, smart American scene of electronic music. You start to feel like Chicago's pool. But when a lot of people think about Chicago and IDM and Post Rock and everything that was going on there at the time. That almost feels like a white scene to some extent. And obviously there are people like Jeff Parker and like all these amazing people that draw these connections within that city's like legacy of like free jazz. But do you think that's like a silly thing to say? Or how do you like sort of reconcile that? You know, I never thought about it until now. And I think. largely that that scene is white or was. There are, of course, exceptions. Robert Ike Aubrey Lowe, as many people know as Likens, or under his own name, he's been around the Chicago scene since the 90s for sure. That's when I met him, maybe 2000, 2001. So Rob was a black man in Chicago making really out shit from day one. There are other guys, too. I mean, there's Jeff Wilson, who's one of the kind of local DJ hero and to a lot of us, older black dude who schooled everybody on music. He just fucking knows everything about all music. But with that said. the music that came out of that quote-unquote scene wasn't necessarily music that came out of a black culture. It was music that was in the same way that we were. It was music that was influenced by black culture but didn't come out of it. Telephone and television did not come out of black culture unless you think all music from New Orleans comes out of black culture. I'm not black. Charlie's Latino. I'm half Spanish and a whole bunch of other stuff. And we're essentially passing white dudes. And I think a lot of this was going on in Chicago in a similar kind of way where these guys were influenced by all of these African-American genres and these kinds of sounds and sort of morphed it into their own thing. So in a way, we're all extremely guilty of some horrible form of cultural appropriation. You could make that argument, maybe. Yeah. And I mean, I'm not going to. sort of get into that. But I was just curious, because this seemed like something that was very important to you. And then we're looking at this stuff in retrospect at this point. And obviously, some of the players, like Rob, still very active at this point. And a lot of RA readers might have heard of him now as well. And he makes beautiful music. So the record comes out on hefty in 2001 and when do you guys make the move to the Midwest? It happened in 2000, early 2001 or late 2000. I mean, signing to Hefty is why we moved to Chicago. John was like, God, you guys got to come up here, get out of that, get out of that fucking gumbo town, man. You're not, you're not going to be able to do anything down there. he was right because for the most part, aside from our friends, people didn't understand what the fuck we were doing or care about it. And I don't blame them. So, so we went to Chicago and met the whole world there. I mean, I've met friends that I still have, you know, 16 years, 17 years ago, whenever that was. But yeah, that was the move. It was because of Hefty. And it seemed like, oh, you know, we'll meet a lot of people that we can collaborate with and, you know, do remixes for friends and DJ out more because there's more of that kind of stuff going on there. And Charlie liked to play records too. And it just, it made sense for us. There was no reason to stay in New Orleans. And it worked out. I think so. Essentially, it worked out. I understand when you're young, you drive three or five hours just to attend a show, and there's something really beautiful about that. And then you move to a city like Chicago at the time, or New York, or Berlin or something, and somebody's playing right down the street, and it's like, ah. you know, we see this shit all the time. Like what was, what was going on in Chicago at the time? And was it an eyeopening experience? Was it just like a sort of plenitude of what you were into? I mean, every, almost every night of the week, something, something cool was happening. I mean, I remember like shortly after I moved there, Jim Magus opened a weekend records. which was like, that was another weekend records was a huge influence on me. Jim steered me in a million correct directions. Every time I walked in there, I spent a lot of money there and it's rest in peace to that record store. Jim's a great dude. Jim would have. I remember one day just walking down Division and there's like, oh, there's like sound coming out. There's an in-store going on at weekend. Oh my God, dude, that's fucking Marcus Pop. Like there's an Oval set. Holy shit, Casey Rice and the Tortoise dudes are all sitting over there on beanbag chairs listening to Oval in the middle of a day on a Sunday. Like everybody's outside drinking beers, that kind of shit all the time. All the time. I'm like hanging out at the bar at the empty bottle and Sam Prekop is going to do and is doing just an impromptu set. Just him and a guitar and a microphone. This kind of shit going on all the time. It was relentless. And then just the idea of like. Dude, Gramophone Records is in this city. We can go to Gramophone Records. We can go to Smart Bar and listen to techno and house music. Like here, any night of the week, we can go buy techno records in the city. Can you fucking believe this? Yeah. It was crazy. Did you feel immediately accepted? I mean, you had like a pretty hefty co-sign to like use the pun there. But I mean, like, did you feel immediately embraced by the scene? Or was it like, who are these guys from New Orleans? I mean, Chicago is notoriously no smiles. And it still is that way. But yeah, everybody was super cool, man. Chicago was, especially at that time, was all about everybody helping everybody out, man. John Herndon coming to play drums on a remix we were doing for somebody just like whatever man just it's cool buy me some beers you know it was yeah we were I felt very welcomed and what about nationally and internationally after the debut came out oh I mean that dude nationally and internationally it took so long for anybody to give a shit about Telephone Tel Aviv It was years before anybody knew who the fuck we were. There were like, of course, there was a small collection of heads or whatever that knew what was up and like other musicians were into it. But as far as like general public people giving a single shit about it, yeah, it was some years. We didn't make it to Europe for maybe two or three years after Fahrenheit came out. So it was pretty strictly BBS, zine. types like you know yeah yeah i mean we were doing we were we would do little tours and play in tiny little like weird houses or like college barns or we play for manny thener in pittsburgh who everybody's played for manny and you play on this fucking dirt floor of shed And it was like raining. It was like 30 people there. Front of house engineer didn't understand that he had to like hard pan the two channels I was sending him. Like, dude, you know, this went on for years before it was like, oh, we're like, somebody's actually flying us to go play a show in Berlin. Holy shit. This is amazing. cannot believe that we're discussing Manny Thiner in this RA podcast. I used to... Manny booked this in 2001. I used to work the door for Manny and... You're kidding me, dude. I probably met you back then. Yeah, I mean, but Millvale Industrial Theater, et cetera. Yeah, Millvale, that's the one. Dirt floor. It's a fucking dirt floor. This exchange is just for us at this point. When did the Euros catch on? And I mean, did the sound work over there as well? It immediately worked better in Europe. Immediately. And because the first show we ever did there was in Naples and there was like, oh shit, there's 500 people and it's sold out and it's in a theater. What? That's your first European show? Yeah. It was like, what the fuck is happening? Oh, this is like, it's a real thing here. Okay. I get it. We show up in Naples or whatever. and there's like a crew at the train station ready, because we flew into Rome and took the train down there. There's like a crew of dudes that carry... and gear and like homies like the retina guys uh leno monaco and nicole buono who had put a record out on hefty as well around the same time we did you know they showed up and that started a 16 year friendship that's still strong to this day and uh and then it was like it you know we felt like royalty over there It was crazy. It was an immediately tremendous difference of like the size of the shows were way bigger. The fees were way bigger. People were actually showing up and clapping and screaming and shit. It was wild, man. Like we didn't expect that. I guess it's what various people making electronic. music have experienced over the last three years. I don't think we were the first or the last to experience that. It's just ahead over there. What did the live show consist of at the time? It was a massive, massive pain in the ass to pull off. And it involved, you know, three laptops and a guitar and a bass and a Fender Rhodes and a fucking Space Echo and a million pedals. It was just so Byzantine to travel with it and to set it up. Unbelievable. And with no crew or anything, just kids trying to haul around this shit. Luckily, though, it was before the days of like crazy extra baggage fees. So we didn't really get crushed on that stuff too hard until a few years later. Wait, so you were borrowing a Rhodes in Europe or you brought a Rhodes from Chicago? Oh, no, we would backline. Yeah, of course. The rest of it we'd bring, man. Yeah. So how do you feel about the sort of performative live show in general if somebody's like, yeah, just bring the controller? the laptop because it's just too much of a pain in the ass to do anything else. I just bring the controller and the laptop because how the fuck am I going to play all this shit live anyway? How the hell am I going to? There's so many parts. It's not, and they don't come in loop style. It's not like, oh, one part it comes in and it loops and then another part comes in and it loops. If that's what it was, I would just bring a bass and a Rhodes Loop the bass part. Loop the Rhodes part. I mean, there's a couple songs that I could do that way, but on the whole, the whole catalog is musically broken up in such a way that that kind of solo performance would never work. There's only a handful of songs that would really allow that kind of performance to be done. I don't care what gear people are using when they play live. I've seen amazing shows with a guy behind a wall of keyboards or playing every instrument. And I've seen, you know, and I've seen somebody walk out there with a gigantic modular rig and nothing else. You know, Marshall Cantrell, I've seen him absolutely destroy before just using a modular synth in a microphone. And I've also seen, you know, live sets of dude just with a laptop absolutely annihilate a room. So the gear doesn't really matter. I never really give a shit about that. And people that are purist about that can just get fucked. I don't care. And I mean, to hop way forwards, would you say that Second Woman, your project with fellow New Orleans dude, Turk Dietrich. who I imagine you've known forever as well. Same time, yeah, since the 90s. Does that feel like sort of a throwback project in a way, just in terms of the complexity of the drum programming? Yeah, in a way. Well, it's the record that we kind of always wanted to make, but didn't have the skill or the tools to be able to do it until now, or, you know, more recently. It just scratches an itch for both of us to make purely super out electronic stuff. It's beat driven, rooted in dub music and rooted in, you know, dance music tropes, but primarily dub, but also takes it super left. That's fitting in on a label like John Elliott's Spectrum Spools. The additions may go sub-label. And fitting in there with Axe, Container, I think is on that label. These guys. Neil. Yeah, Steve Moore, a lot of Neil Comey-ish type stuff. Do you feel like... That sort of attention to detail, is that still something that's appreciated? Because you also play in a very sparse band as well, like Tropic of Cancer. I mean, that's completely skeletal compared to what you're doing. or what you've done in the past and what you're doing with second woman as well. I mean, second woman is, is not the kind of thing that really a lot of people are going to get into. You know, it's really demanding. It's tough to listen to for a lot of people. It's for electronic music heads. It's me and Turk making the record that we always wanted to make or something that we actually would want to listen to, even though after we finish it. I don't listen to it, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't either. But, yeah, I mean, I don't know if detail is a thing that is widely given a shit about. People, you know, widely, the public on the whole, they're looking for things to grab onto. And Second Woman really isn't going to give you a whole hell of a lot of that unless you're ahead. And that's not any kind of elitist statement at all because I – whatever. The proof's in the pudding with me, man. Like I love super sparse songwriting stuff and I love super weird post-electronic whatever music, whatever – Second Woman for example. So I don't know if people care about it. I do. I love it. You know, I listened to the new Autek or the recent Autek or four and a half hour thing and just I'm blown away by the amount of detail in there. But I know most people are probably like, oh, no, no, I don't know what it is or just I don't know. It's just who cares? It's like, well, it's not for you then. But for a period of time in America, like the sort of. general aesthetic had shifted so that this was more venerated for for a decent amount of time and still in within certain circles but like the palette had shifted over here at that during that period when the first telephone record came out and Yeah. The second as well. Yeah, the palette definitely shifted because it was like, oh, we want to use real instruments. We want to incorporate that. Scott Heron was doing this kind of thing too, especially with Della Rosa and Aesora and Savath and Savala stuff where he was like playing pianos and rhodes and there's violins and upright bass and crazy instrumentation, like physical instrumentation that then all just gets put through the meat grinder. That was the idea that we all kind of wanted to do. I guess in some cases, like, that sort of pastoral IDM sound in, like, the American sense often, like, could take on, like, a somewhat emo or, like, cloying feel as well. You guys sort of laid the groundwork for that, but I imagine that that wasn't exactly what you were trying to do ever. You were always trying to balance it out a little bit. Yeah. I mean, in that way, I look back at the early Telephone stuff, the first two records as a failure in a way, because we really were trying to make something emotional, but when it becomes maudlin is when I start to get put off by it. And I listen back to a lot of it, and some of And I think Charlie had a similar issue with a lot of it. To me, some of it holds up, but I get what you're saying about cloying. And especially, you know, if you look at a lot of sort of underground IDM stuff that's made now, you know, stuff that's like on the IDM forums and stuff like this, a lot of it really is just so purely, obviously emotionally manipulative. You know, I'm kind of turned off by that. And I wasn't referring to your music, by the way. No, but it's funny that you say that because I did always feel like, God, we're just laying it on a little too heavy. Like, I just want to lighten it up. Map was really a swing and a miss for both of us. And map of what is effortless. The second record. And the burden of this is laid squarely at me and Charlie's feet. I wouldn't dare drag Damon Aaron or Lindsay Anderson through the mud on this. They did awesome work on that record. I think it's really the only example of the Pitchfork getting a review correct. What did they say? They said, look, man, this production's great, but the songs are kind of, it's like overdressing. Like the songs aren't really up to par with the production. And part of that is that we didn't kind of pull off what we really wanted to pull off. We wanted to make this really dark, kind of sinister, sparse R&B record. And it just didn't come out that way. It came out being something else. We just kind of let it lead us. And maybe we let it lead us a little too much instead of grabbing it back by the reins and kind of bringing it back into darker territory where we wanted it to be. And a lot of that goes back to what you were saying about a melody being cloying or something. being sort of emotionally manipulative or a little too much. And I feel like a lot of the sort of problems that I have with that record are based in that problem. Jumping forwards to immolate yourself, by that standard, that's a triumph because there's a level of detachment and melody. The songwriting's there at that point, like in terms of, you know... fitting stuff into like like what is this exactly like is this is this a new take on elegantly detached new wave or like what's what's going on here like that that is almost like more traditional in a way but doesn't really sound like any of those other records either No, I mean, that record, you know, it's obviously influenced by New Wave and stuff like that. You know, we've always loved that kind of music. I've loved it since I was a kid, same as Charlie. But we did want to, we wanted to make it a lot crustier and a lot darker and more kind of sinister with detachment in it, I think is a good description. I think you understand it well if you think about detachment when you listen to that record. And then we still wanted it to have just touches of this kind of sculpted electronic stuff for the first few records. So there's bits and pieces of that in there, too. And at the end of the day, I mean, seven years later, well, we finished it in early 2008. We wrote it in 2007, and it was done early 2008. So it's a very old record for me now. I don't hate it. I mean, I don't love anything I've ever done. I'm always disappointed in retrospect at pretty much everything I've ever done. But I stand by that record, and I'm pretty sure if Charlie were alive, he would too. He was really happy with it when we finished it. We didn't hate it immediately upon finishing it, which we were looking forward to touring on it. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. Maybe that record holds up better for me than the other ones. I mean, your mileage may vary. I think fans disagree with me. That was probably one that I came in on fully and then... you know, sort of went back after that. But, you know, that's just because I'm a little bit younger. Are you really young or something? No, I'm not. I'm not that young. I'm pretty old. But I just wasn't that cool, you know, early. And we still aren't. I'm still not. Believe me, man. Neither am I. We talked about Manny Theiner. on this podcast. But there is, you know, like a listlessness to that record as well. And obviously preceded a pretty dark period. I can't imagine that the events of that time period, namely Charlie's death, the death of your father, sort of all hitting at the same time, you know, like your musical partner, your childhood friend, obviously the years after were extremely tough. And, you know, I can't even imagine myself, but was it, was it sort of dark leading into it as well? It was getting a little dark leading into it. I don't want to say too much about that, but suffice it to say that Yes, it was getting dark leading into that. You know, Charlie and his girlfriend were, let's just say they weren't getting along. And me and my girlfriend, we weren't really getting along. So in that kind of light way, yeah, there was relationship trouble, but there was other stuff too. It wasn't all good leading up to that. I was still, of course, totally shocked when Charlie turned up dead, but... I guess if I were paying attention, I could have seen it coming. You know? Yeah. It's such like a collaborative project. You've done things since then. You did things in the period before you recently brought the name back. But, you know, you have Sons of Magdalene. You know, you've done a lot of production work. You've played with Trent Reznor in Nine Inch Nails. But it's interesting, like when you say the telephone sound, is that always in your mind? you and Charlie. Yeah. You know, it's funny you say that. Cause you know, as I'm working on new stuff right now, I have quite a bit of it and it's all sort of at the point where I would hand it to Charlie and say, okay, can you take that? Just break this and bring it back. And like, Oh, I got this blue boy. I'll bring it back in a couple of days. Just, you know, and then he just burn one, you know, and, And like stay awake for 48 hours. Probably a little high. And, uh... bottle of wine and just shred on it and then bring it back to me and it would be a complete fucking mess but it would be a masterpiece and uh and then we'd work on it together to finish it so i'm in this weird headspace now of like looking at these songs or these pieces of music some of them aren't songs and going okay fuck uh what would he do right now to this I have to try to put myself inside his headspace to understand what he would do and why he would do it, because there was a reason for everything. At least I think there was. Maybe a lot of what he did was just chaos, and it was just a thing I didn't know about him. Because the result of a lot of it was chaos. But I know that he had very specific reasons for it. working the way he worked and doing the things that he did musically. I mean, I'm better qualified, I think, to understand what he was doing because the collaboration was such a long one. It was a 10-year collaboration. Well, you're the best qualified. The best qualified. But I don't think anybody could be perfectly qualified to understand how he worked or what he was doing because it was a pretty labyrinthine process. I think it was like legendary Ohio loudmouth David Thomas of like Perubu. Like when they were like rehearsing, he'd like draw a line down the center of the room and he'd say, OK, the synth and me, we're like the art part of the band and like rhythm section. You guys are just like, you know, you're just functionality or artillery. Like you guys are like just meat and potatoes and we're like going way out. there and what was the split between you and Charlie or like what are you trying to inhabit like where what is that like musical and mental space that you're trying to get to it was the division wasn't a very strict division of labor it was a division of methodology and my methodology was always order, construction, building, these sorts of things. And Charlie's methodology was chaos, entropy, burning, destruction, you know? So I have to kind of learn this new headspace. I have to learn this new way of... how can I break this? Which isn't something that I would typically think when writing music or working on music. I would think, how can I make this better? Or how can I improve this? Or can I think about this structurally or think about this architecturally? Or now I have to think about, okay, I need to take the sledgehammer to this. So that's the weird thing for me is I've never worked that way. And he came up with the name immolate yourself. We did. I think. Yeah, I think he did. We were joking. I mean, we came up, we were, it came up in a conversation. We were together. We were like, dude, we should just give that record like a totally like hilarious black metal or like early nineties, uh, RC records, death metal name. And he was like, dude, yeah. Like, like a fucking old cannibal corpse type, like, like hammer smashed face or like, you know, inverted meat hook sodomy or like immolate. yourself or some shit and I was like dude fuck yeah that's amazing But I mean, Immolate Yourself also ended up oddly being a pretty succinct summary of his creative method as well. Absolutely. It's weird because I think I'm drawn to work with artists like that. Greg Pucciato, who I work with on music all the time. He's a guy like that who's like, his thing, I remember, it was a conversation between me and Greg and Dominic Ferna. And Dominic was like, Greg, how do you do that every night? How do you, because I mean, I've been doing Prairie for a minute now and screaming every night and it gets tired. Like, how do you get ready for a show? Do you do warmups or whatever? Do you do anything like this? And Greg's like, no, man, I just For those of our listeners who don't know, obviously, Dominic is now an oscuton sort of techno guy, Purient, Vatican Shadow and everything. But Greg Pucciato has a project with Josh. The Black Queen, but he's also known for his group, the Dillinger Escape Plan, who are up there beyond completely destructive noise and hardcore acts, are probably one of the most ferocious yet technical live performances that you could really ever witness. It's savage. They just played the Regent the other night and, you know, dude jumped off the balcony, you know. I mean, he's unhinged. Greg is, he's a psychopath when it comes to stuff like that. But then on he's like this kind of mellow not sort of quiet dude like he's real chill and beta when he's not on stage and then on stage he's just the I don't even know And he's he's I've never seen anything like it. They're one of the best live bands I've ever seen. But I guess the thing that he has in common with Charlie is that he's like chaos. You know, he's just he's a little entropy ball everywhere he goes. He's the Tasmanian devil. You know, Charlie as a person wasn't like that. He was, you know, kind of polished and obliging, you could say. But musically, Charlie was the Tasmanian devil. You managed to sort of be around all these people because, you know, you're incredibly talented and technically apt yourself. You're sort of revealing like what you've learned. from these various people and how you've integrated that into your own methodology. But can you talk a little bit about your relationship with Trent Reznor and what you learned from him as a musician? or what you brought to his whole sphere as well. I don't know what I brought to him, but I can tell you what I learned from him is a level of perfectionism that I don't think anybody's got. He's got a set of ears on him that hears the slightest flaw and just sets off his enrage timer. And that's to be commended, I think. That level of perfectionism and attention to detail is a large part of why he is who he is and where he is. And, you know, I don't have that kind of attention to detail. Or, no, let me just brag a little bit. I definitely have that kind of attention to detail because I fucking hear the details, but I'm too lazy to do anything about it. And that's why I'm like kind of a slacker musician, because I just don't give a shit the way Trent gives a shit. But that's why he's Trent and now CEO of the fucking universe or whatever, Apple Music or whatever, you know, incredible composer. Production wise in the studio, he's a shredder, a physical musician. He's an amazing physical musician. And he'll say over and over again, I suck. I'm a shitty musician. I'm a shitty musician. But he's not. He's like an amazing keyboard player. He's a fantastic guitar player. He's really insanely hyper musically talented from just an innate kind of level. Not even a learned thing. It's just innate with him. It's like the dude that like, you know, I. I had to practice guitar forever to be able to just barely even get around on the damn thing. It's like when you're a little kid and you try to throw the football and it just fucking flies up in the air and it's wounded duck. Trent's like the dude that would just pick the football up and Doug Flutie it 40 yards, perfect spiral. He's like an innate musician. He just doesn't know how to suck. So what I learned is that I'm not that good. That's what I learned from Trent. For our listeners, you guys worked together on some level for a long time, obviously, with the remix of Even Deeper that appeared on the compilation from 2007. But can you talk about your time working with him and... both from a writing perspective and in the live band? Oh, I mean, dude, being in the studio with Trent is the shit. It's very different now than it was 16, 17 years ago when we first got in the studio with him, but it's awesome. He's like a, he's a, he's a try everything guy and I'm a try everything guy. And Charlie is a try everything guy. And you have to kind of explore those, those ideas. And so. ideas come out, he's like, cool, let's do it. He's never, he's not a studio neg guy. But of course, I can't really speak to how he is in the studio the same way that Atticus could talk about it or that Alan Mulder could talk about it. But... Trent's awesome to work with because ideas in the studio, there's no dumb ideas. I find that inspiring. I like to work that way. I don't like to throw ideas out. I do it all the time now. I try to neg people and they're like, dude, you're negging. Like, can we just try this? And I'm like, okay, you're right. We'll try it. Oh, you were right. Yeah, it's fucking great. Of course. I'm an idiot. Sorry man I don't want to do the work I just want to hang out and like pet my bunny not do anything was part of bringing the telephone project back I mean was it like I think I'm musically ready I think I'm emotionally ready or I'm ready to challenge myself when you did the announcement on, okay, there's going to be a reissue. There's going to be a tour. Tentatively, I'm going to say I'm going to release some new music under this name. And then sort of being taken aback by the response, were you sort of putting it out there and being like, okay, I need to motivate myself to do this? this. Yeah, it was, it was just, honestly, it was born out of a whole lot of just self-disgust, just being disgusted with how much of a slacker I am. And like, even if I'm working 60 hours a week and getting tons of shit done, which, you know, whatever, I've worked on a lot of music in the intervening time, just a disgust with me not working for myself. doing too much stuff with other people, which I love doing, and I'll continue to do it to some degree. Here's a way to say it. Sorry, I'm kind of trumping right now. I'm like, incomplete sentences, run-on sentences, subordinate clauses of indirect... Anyway. And Kanye West, I read this Kanye quote and it really stung when I read it. And he said, if you don't go out there and execute your vision, somebody else going to hire you to execute theirs. And that was like, oh, right in the fucking nuts, man. He's so right about that. And that kind of kind of stung. And it made me realize like, OK, dude, like you're you went through this shit and I'm super sad. Oh, your friend died. Your dad died and big John Hughes died and, and, and, and y'all are, you're all sad about that. And your butt hurt about the fucking bad cards that life dealt you. And so you're going to mope and play world of Warcraft and like, try to not work on music and try to run away from it all. Or you're going to do something about this. You know, like, what are you going to do about this? You're going to really like, just let your life's work just go away I don't know, man. I mean, that was like... a pretty, pretty defining moment when I started to realize like, nah, man, like I, why should I stop doing this? I got to at least try before stopping. I have to at least try and fail instead of just giving up and walking away from it without just because I'm scared to touch it or something like, yeah, the pan's going to be hot, but I'll put a little, you know, grab a towel and pick it up. It'll be all right.
