🎵 Hello and welcome. Welcome to another episode of the Resident Advisor Exchange. This week we're talking to Tom Hulkenberg, who's better known as Junkie XL. He's probably one of the most in-demand film composers working today, scoring everything from Hollywood films like Mad Max, Fury Road, and Deadpool, to video game franchises like FIFA and The Sims. But the Dutchman's roots lie in the electronic music of the 90s. It's easy to forget, given his success recently, that he toured as Junkie XL for over 20 years. So this conversation happened some time ago with RIA's Andrew Rice. And since then, Hulkenberg has sent us a little extra introduction to clarify the distance in time between when this interview was conducted and the current situation. You might have also seen his YouTube channel, which is remarkable for being a very complete documentation of how he works on his scoring projects. pretty rare for people doing this work to be so open with documenting their process and making it free for all to see. With all that being said, here comes the podcast with Junkie XL. Hey guys, this podcast was recorded six months ago or so, if I'm not mistaken, and the world was such a different place at that point. There was no coronavirus, we could still go out, we had all these amazing parties and the work was like in full swing. And also in my world, everything has turned like completely upside down. like everybody else's and we're just staying at home and we can't go out we can't have parties. As you guys know, I started in the dance scene many, many years ago. That's where I found myself as an artist. And I also laid the roots there as a composer in that same dance scene. And this has been a world that is so important to me for 30 plus years now. So it's heartbreaking to see that it's not functioning and not operating in that same classic way. It's also very heartening to see that there's so many online DJ gigs and online playlists that people are sharing. So there's a lot of good stuff happening as well. When I became a composer, the knowledge that I gathered from being an electronic musician, it's been so important to the rest of my career. So the foundation of what I am as a composer today really was created in the electronic scene. And it's a really magical place and it's vital for it to continue. So I really admire the efforts of Resident Advisor, save our scene, you know, to continue pushing that. And it's very motivating and very heartwarming to see that. And I know there's a lot of people out there that are really struggling and they're trying to survive. And I wish you all the best of luck. And I hope that music will be a very important factor in driving the week's months forward to really amazing creativity. So stay safe and take care. And again, thanks to Resident Advisor for all the efforts trying to save our scene. Hope you're well. Take care. So I just want to start with, how did you get into film scoring to begin with? I mean, I've always been like a touring artist. First I was playing in bands and then I started my Junkie XL career and toured for many, many years as an electronic musician. And so somewhere in the half 90s, I saw a film that was using one of my tracks in the film. And it was The Blade with Wesley Snipes. And I was like, man, it's so incredible how my music works to picture. And I never dreamed it would be something like that. And so... I got really interested in film because of that. And step by step, I got more and more involved in making films. I did a few bits here, a few bits there. Then I worked a little bit on Resident Evil. And then I worked a little bit on the Matrix movies, even though that never got me. used it got used in the video game and and some promotional stuff i did a track uh that was called blue bill red bill in uh in 2000 so that was a big club track that was you know from from the matrix and eventually i decided in 2002 to move to la and just really fully pursue uh film scoring Fast forward to 2012 where I finally then did my first film here in Hollywood, 300 Rise of an Empire. So it took me 10 years from, you know, coming here as an electronic musician, not knowing much about film scoring at all, and then eventually doing my first film. How did you find your way into the film industry here? It's pretty tough. It's also that there's a lot of people here in town that obviously want to get into the industry, and it's a very tough nut to crack. Music eventually has not all that much to do with it, I would almost say. which is obviously not true because it is a music profession. But there's so many other things that are potentially even more important. And it's the way that you're able to manage time, the way that you can manage expectations with studios, that you can manage a team because nowadays it's impossible to do a movie on your own. You need assistants to do it with. It's just too much work. So for a studio to say to you, oh, Tom, here is a $200 million movie. Why don't you make some music for that? They want to have like a security policy in place, if you will. And the security policy is that you've done it before. And that's what we, you know, you talk about who was first, the chicken or the egg. Because, you know. You need experience, but how do you get experience if you don't get the first job to get experience? So it's a really tough scenario and you just need to have a little bit of luck and you need to work really hard. You need to constantly network with people here in town and show up. for the right meetings and just try to work your way in. And it's definitely tough. What really helped me, obviously, was that I was assisting Hans Zimmer at a certain point in 2010 and 11, where I got to meet a lot of people from studios, directors and producers and to expand my network. And eventually that led to doing my own film. How did you get involved with Hans Zimmer? Actually, we knew each other way longer. In 2004 or 2005, he called me and he said, everybody tells me I should meet you, but I have no idea who you are. And so I went to his studio and we played some music that I did and he was really blown away by it. And from that point on, we kept seeing each other regularly for like once every year, once every half a year, until in 2010, we started working together. What did you learn from working with him? So what I primarily learned from him were some of the political aspects, you know, just like... how to deal with studios, how the politics works with studios versus directors versus producers, who are the more important people you should actually listen to, learning how to read messages in a message. So sometimes what people are telling you is actually not what they're trying to say. So these are very important parts in that. And the most important lesson I learned from him was when I then finally scored my own movie was he basically slapped me on the back and he said, you're going to be great at this. And so that seal of approval, that seal of like, oh, you can do this and you're going to be great at it. Your first experience of scoring a movie by yourself or your first time doing your own score, was it a tough process? Oh, it was very daunting because there was only four weeks. So this was a scenario where a composer got replaced. I was then eventually hired to do the film, but there was only four weeks left. So not only was it my first film, but it also needed to be done in four weeks. So it was a very powerful first experience where I learned so much and I had to just do it in four weeks. I've done that same thing a couple of times where I would replace another composer and there were only three, four weeks left to do the score. And it's certainly not ideal, but boy, does your adrenaline just go from zero to 10 and you're just like running four weeks straight. And then after that, you're like, what happened over the last month? How did you transition from being like a... club artists making electronic music to making like composing music for films like did you have to change the way you approached writing music or how did you like how did you go from doing one to the other I would say there's certain elements in film music that do not necessarily exist in the same form in electronic music but Nevertheless, there's a lot of things that are the same. I tried to look at the music that I did for dance releases for my own albums and my remixes. And I came up with the list. It's like, what is connecting all these tracks together? The very important part, obviously, there's always rhythm involved. The second thing is that I always had emotional undertones in my music. At the same time, it was also in the time that I was producing records, there were definitely one of the more aggressive ones in dance music out there, in energy and also in production. My dance music almost had like a rock and roll production, even though it was electronic music. Then at the same time, my music was very multi-layered. I was never able to make a track as simple as Daft Punk, Da Funk. I was a little jealous of that because these guys took a kick drum, a snare drum, and then one synth riff, and boom, the track is done. So my music was always multi-layered with things coming out and things coming in. So these were things that I definitely took into film scoring. Now, the thing in film scoring that's very normal that you have within one piece of music, all kinds of tempo changes and melodic changes and harmonic changes that you wouldn't do so easily in a dance track because you take away that aspect of it that is important, which is dancing. And for dancing, the tempo needs to be somewhat continuous. You can go halftime. There was a time period where we go from four on the floor and then we go to something like dubstep for like a minute and then back to four on the floor. That all works, but all kinds of different tempo changes within the song is not really successful for a dance track. And then obviously the extensive use of the orchestra, which is something that is tried in dance music, but has not been successfully tried in dance music. Maybe that's something to look at in the future, but not for now. You do use an orchestra in a lot of your scores, and you mix it with... electronic elements, why is it important to you to keep using a real orchestra? For a couple of reasons. One of the beautiful things working on film scores is that there are budgets to do this and it does make the final result better. It's very simple. An average orchestra is 200 people big. All of them. have 10,000 hours of experience. So you're talking 2 million hours of experience on the highest level possible in playing that instrument. So if you add that to something that you've done, it's just fantastic. And it really adds magic to it. the imperfection of live players that makes it so great. You know, you can program rock and roll completely with a computer if you wanted to, but it would take the soul out of it. And so very similar with classical music and with orchestral music. Yeah, you can program it and it sounds... pretty good, but to do it with live musicians is the next level of greatness. Besides that, the orchestra is one of those proven methods over the last hundred years of filmmaking that will stand the test of time, and you need to use it in a proper way. And if I use electronic elements, I tend not to use the electronic sounds that are hip today, because what is hip today is unhip tomorrow. And a movie takes up to four years to make. by the time you start creating the hip sounds of today, by the time the movie comes out, it feels like old news. So when it comes to electronic elements, I try to use stuff also that has been proven itself timeless at this point. So I take references from the 70s when it comes to the MOOCs. Sizer era, I take references from the 80s that have now been rehashed for almost 40 years, and people don't seem to get tired of it. And if you quote the 80s in the right way, it also feels timeless. And there are elements in the 90s and the 2000s as well, where you could really use a proper sound or a proper approach to... a piece of music that will not feel dated. For instance, if we compare two 80s scores from the 80s, one is Beverly Hills Cop by Harold Faltermeyer. and one is the original Blade Runner with Vangelis. So in my humble opinion, the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack feels now very dated and very fun to listen to, and in the time when it came out, it was definitely revolutionary, and it was really great to listen to, a full synthesizer approach to music. In that same category for me is Miami Vice, the TV shows with John Hammer. Also incredible music. But if you play it back right now, it feels very dated and that typical era. And what's interesting with the Vangelis score of Blade Runner, for me that stayed timeless. And there are a couple of bits in the score, the saxophone solos, that I can do without. But in general, the whole soundtrack feels very... very contemporary still. And in that same note, also the Brad Fidel score of the two Terminators. They still feel very relevant at this point. that's what you need to look at when you use electronic elements into your score or orchestral elements. And when you're incorporating these electronic elements, are you using like hardware or software or like, especially if you're using like an old synth sound, do you have the actual old synth at your studio or? Well, as most people know that spent some time on the internet and look for synth collections and stuff that I've been known to have, to be a hoarder, a synthesizer hoarder. And I've been so since the early 80s when I worked in a music store and started collecting all these. uh, since that were traded in for a little or no money. And, uh, I bought them all in that time period and I kept them all and I kept them really up to, up to date. And they're wonderful instruments. Um, But when people listen to some of the sounds that I use and they say, oh, you can clearly hear this is like an analog synth, and most of the time they're wrong. Most of the people that think sounds are analog, they're actually digital, whether it's derived by... the Eurorack cabinet with all its digital modules or plugins on the computer in Cubase. But I also use analog synthesizers, but they sound so harsh and aggressive that people are swearing that that is a digital plugin from the box. And that is actually a real analog synth. There's no right or wrong there. It really comes down to what quality you're really looking for. The film that I just finished, Terminator, is full of synth sounds and they come from everywhere. They come from hardware, they come from software. Sometimes these are jam sessions that I do on my own with the modular synth and then long-lived the assistants. One assistant will take those hours and hours long recordings and chop them up into different individual files and creates like a library for it. And I can just grab things from it that I need when I'm writing a piece of music. Hardware is absolutely fantastic. Software is absolutely fantastic. There's no right and wrong there. It just totally depends on what you're looking for. And so Terminator is the most recent or current thing you've done. It's coming out in November. November 1st, yeah. So would you say this is like your most prominent movie yet? Do you think movie score yet? For me? Yeah. I mean, that's what other people are supposed to say something about, not the composer himself. The way that I look at my music, I've always done that, is that when I'm done with it, I'm extremely happy with it. And it is at that point the best that I have in me. But you're not always as strong, you're not always as inspirational to get the right things out. always when I look back on all the things that I've done, I can now see like, oh, I should have done that over there. And I try to listen to the earlier things that I've done and learn from it and just take it into my next project. So when I was done with Terminator, I thought it was the best that I had in me at that specific point. point in time but my film scores also vary in in in character and quality so the electronic music people and the modern film score enthusiasts will absolutely love this score the people that are fans of John Williams they will hate this score because it's all controlled noise. And it's a massive homage to the original two scores by Brett Fidel with James Cameron. And also, this is the third. James Cameron installment as a producer and Tim Miller directed the movie that I did the first Deadpool with. So it's really like movie one, two and three and that's it. And so the music, it was important for me that there was a lot of echoes from the first two Terminator movies in this movie. What are they? What did you bring from the first two movies? Well, there's the iconic theme and there's like certain sounds and sounds approach. And so I know how Brett Fidel made his sounds. He was a very creative sampler enthusiast. And I have all those old boxes that he worked with as well. So we did a lot of sampling on our own and did that with these samplers. And you get the low degrading quality that comes with it. And then, you know, there's a lot of other musical instruments added to the score because this movie is taking place primarily in Mexico. So we're in a completely different part of the world. So you need to reflect that also in the music. How did you reflect the film taking place in Mexico in the music? I'm not allowed to say too much about it at this point. because people need to see it. But I found this really interesting mix between organic instruments that really underscore that we are in Mexico and that we're dealing with real people and real lives and real feelings and real emotions. And at the same time, we have these robots that are sent from the future. They have no emotions and they are on one mission and one mission only. So very mechanical. And so it was very interesting to look for a mix between all these things. You said the soundtrack was mostly controlled noise. What do you mean by that? Controlled noise is for me also what Mad Max is and some of the other scores that I've done. It's basically creating sounds with real instruments that if that were to happen in this room next to your head, you would really try to cover your ears because it's uncomfortable to listen to. And I like making sounds that make people uncomfortable. And especially doing that to a movie that's supposed to make you feel uncomfortable on the edge of the seat. Bring it on. That's what I'm... completely in my elements so you said like you know in electronic music including something like an orchestra has not really been done that well yet uh and you're someone who is really good at combining electronic and like the acoustic for whatever it sounds is is there like a key to it or like a secret or like how do you combine them the two things so well what i what i actually said or what i actually meant was there's been beautiful music being made of electronic music and orchestra combined i was talking about dance music or i meant dance music so when you combine an orchestra with electronic music and you create a dance party as insane as Chesto or Afrojack or Calvin Harris or, you know, any of those, Steve Aoki, Garnix, all those legends at this point. And that I haven't seen done successfully yet. It's different if you were... to organize something like Armin van Buuren in concert or something and do it with an orchestra, but that's not what I mean. I mean something that is like built up from the ground and that is what the sound of that act is and that becomes then popular and big and, you know, especially in the 90s, we had a lot of these... interesting bands that all ended up in the brackets of dance music but what they were actually doing was pretty interesting uh you know chemical brothers uh underworld prodigy orbital these were actually more bands than there were a dj uh spinning and they all had a very unique sound And it became very popular with it. And that's actually what I'm talking about, that somebody embraces the orchestra what it is with all its downsides and all its upsides and really uses that effectively to create a dance act that really lives on the merits of the orchestra. these elements combine together instead of, you know what I mean, within concerts, right? So they're technically all electronic hits by Armin van Buuren, but now you play them live with an orchestra. And yeah, people will enjoy that, but it's not really what I'm talking about. I would almost say people would enjoy it despite of, you know, because it's... Yeah, it's the songs they want to hear, but now they're played by an orchestra. Do you think that your career and experience in dance music informs the way you compose music for film, like dance music specifically? Absolutely. I think, you know, all the good DJs, they know how to create a very interesting arc over two, three hours. It's not necessarily the type of DJ sets that you would hear now on the main stage. where it's all like everything is at 10 constantly, and then each they play for an hour, and they play big hits, and I get all that. That's just the fun factor of playing in front of 100,000 people, 200,000 people. And I've been there before too. I'm talking more about the DJs and they're playing mostly in smaller clubs that are still making this really interesting build over like three hours and take the audience to like a peak. And then, you know, it's up to the next person. And I see that more or less as an arc of a film. You know, a film starts somewhere and musically it starts somewhere. You have all these different... uh, personalities, um, antagonists in this, in this film. And they all have their own stories. They have their relationships with one another and to underscore that musically. And then also create a narrative of like two and a half hours where you take your audience musically to that peak where the movie that is going to go. that is very much similar to what dance music is. When you started working on scoring your own films and working on creating this arc, did you find that it came naturally to you? Yes, I did. And there's a couple of other things that came naturally. Some of the aspects I mentioned earlier. managing people, managing expectations, be a good listener, working in a team environment, because that's what working in films is. You work in a team environment. And at the same time, really understanding what happens in the picture, what needs to happen musically. I thought it would be very hard for me, but it all just came very naturally. And it's also a profession that you're never too old to learn. And that's also something that's very appealing to me that, you know, you constantly work with different people with a different outlook on what a film needs to be and what it potentially musically needs to be. And it's never the same. Each movie is like different and very different actually. And so... I actually really like this environment. I can now see in retrospect, I can say in retrospect, I should actually never have been an artist. I should have been a film composer. But I would not be the film composer today if I didn't have that amazing past of being an artist and playing in front of so many incredible crowds all over the world. I mean, it just puts a smile on my face when I think back about that whole 15 years, 20 years, more than 20 years of... touring as as junkie xl and seeing all the outposts in the world from small clubs to really big stages so I would not be the same person today and also not the same film composer. Do you ever miss it? Yes, I do. I mean, every now and then. What's funny also is that 80% of my touring happens before the YouTube and Facebook days. So there's not a whole lot of footage online of me performing live. There's a good amount, but not like if... I were to start in 2006 and still playing now, then you would have so much more. And every now and then when I talk to my assistants, it's like, oh, grandpa, why don't you show us how things were back in the day? And then, you know, I just, I mean, I'm turning 52 this year. The average age of my assistants is between 22 and 27. So they could all virtually be my kids. So I sometimes Google things like Ultra Fast Miami or some shows I did in Europe, Fuji Rock in Japan or Coachella in 2005. yeah, it's really great to see it again. And then it's like, oh man, I miss that. But I mean, it, you know, it was that time period and it was really, really great. And now, uh, I'm just really happy to, to work in the studio environment and, and just really. work on this what I really really love to do so I'm I'm pretty happy and you can make music without having to tour all the time to make money well the thing is that with I would say to a certain extent the pressure is on one hand The pressure is higher on the artist's career because every track that you release needs to be the thing that's going to propel you further into your career, is going to propel you further into getting live gigs and festivals and such. With film scoring, once you're in the circle of scoring films, the only thing you really need to worry about is to make sure that your relationships with all the people that you work with stay intact and you keep delivering the best that you can. But it's not like... a public tribunal as it is as an artist that if you do a film score to a movie, the only person that needs to be ultimately happy with what I did is the director. So if there are people out there in the world that say, oh, it's a terrible film score and I would never have done that. I would have hired John Williams or whatever. There's always these discussions there and vice versa. When orchestral guys do a movie and they say, ah, they should have gotten Tom or they should have gotten that person. But that doesn't have any impact on the relationship that you have with the director because the composer and the director set out the musical course for that movie and whatever the people think out there doesn't really matter all that much. And that is quite different in the artist world because the people out there are the ones that are listening to you on Spotify that buy potentially your CD, whoever still buys your CD, or your vinyl records, or then determines to come and see you play live when you go on tour. So I would say on that end, it's more intense on the artist world. But in the film world, the work pressure is like from a whole different level than it ever was as an artist. I thought touring and making music for a living was pretty tough and exhausting at times. But boy, if you enter the films, that's just like kindergarten compared to film scoring. the hours that you need to put in. It's really running a marathon after marathon after marathon where for me, The artist world felt more like a 500-meter sprint, and then you take a break of two weeks, and then you do another one. When you're working on a film, what is your relationship like with the director, like your working relationship? How involved are they with the music? Yeah, the relationship, let's put it this way. This has something to do with how people are, obviously. hey, you talk to two persons on the left that have a relationship and two people on the right that have a relationship. And the two people on the right are, you know, they spend minimum time on each other and they're happy with what that is and they continue to live like that for the rest of their lives. And the other two people... constantly are in dialogue with each other to improve each other and to improve their relationship and just to make sure that they continuously stay in sync for years and years to come. So the same with composer and director. So sometimes you work with the director that gives you very little information and is not necessarily engaged all the time with you. And then there's other directors, and those usually are the ones that are the very strong directors, like George Miller, Robert Rodriguez, James Cameron. Tim Miller, Peter Jackson. Those are the ones that I've worked with that are very engaging directors. They want to talk for hours about characters and about this and that. And then when I start making music, they love to play it for three, four times in a row and then discuss it really thoroughly with you. what they feel and what they think it's doing to them. I would say on average, I have a very close and intense relationship with the director when it comes to the musical course of a film. Have you ever had a director be like, this is shit or like start over or like really not like something you've done? So... that happens, but it's not, it's not worded like that because it's, they don't mean it like that. So there's never a question that the piece of music I sent is a great piece of music to their ears. The discussion is whether it's right for the moment in the film. So let's say, uh, we're talking about, um, you know, Superman for instance, and He's about to discover something about himself. we play the music too heroic and the director would say, you have to do this again because he's discovering something about himself. He's not the hero yet. So you got to wait a little. Or with Mad Max, I would write the theme for Furiosa, the main character played by Charlize Theron. And when she finally found out. Or she's about to find out that there is no green space where she wants to go with the truck. And the first initial take on that was that I was too sad immediately and George said but wait she hasn't even found out yet that the place does not exist you gotta grow into that so these are the type of comments that you would get from a director not like your music is shit and you need to do it again or it's not like that it's always in relationship to where we are in the film and if that scene deserves that type of approach at that point. And you do a lot of big Hollywood movies that involve, like you said, heroic themes or the Terminator action movies. How did you learn how to make music that evokes these moods? Because it seems very different, like, composing something for, like, that Superman scene you're talking about than making, like, a dance track. So I was never considered a trans artist, even though I was loved by the trans audience. And I would share the stage with Chiesto and with Ferry Corsten and with Paul van Dijk and Paul Oakenfold. Even though I was not trans per se, I was very alternative in my sound. But I had really big melodies and big harmonies. And I think the music that I made as an artist in the live setting made people feel very inclusive. It's like, oh, this is about me or this is I belong here and I want to be part of this. And that's not all that different from scoring in a heroic theme because. When you write an heroic theme for Furiosa or for Deadpool or for Superman or for whatever character, Lara Croft in Tomb Raider and now Terminator, it needs to have that big quality that people feel like, oh, I'm part of this. I want to be part of this. And this guy is a hero and I want to be part of that. Superman. story or feeling. I think it's pretty close in idea. you're what you're trying to achieve i've seen you described or describe yourself as the as this phrase the full contact composer i was wondering if you could explain what that means yeah so um i've never considered myself even in the in the even when i was making electronic dance music and a lot of my colleagues were and i don't mean this as a negative uh thing at all But a lot of my colleagues were just sitting behind a laptop with a headset and just like, you know, just like typing in stuff and then the music would appear from that. And I was never really that guy. I need to turn knobs. I need to bang on drums. I need to bang on pianos or play guitar or bass guitar or... play around with my modular synth system and just like make noises and chop them up later or making great guitar noises with amps and and experimental sounds and that's what i mean with full contact i need i need something in my hands uh to make music with or noise with to really get inspired. And I even did that when I did my dance tracks. There was so many sounds in there which derived from weird recordings and just doing stuff myself. The benefit of that is that you also create sounds that are 100% yours and the odds that somebody else would make that same sound somewhere in the world. is not all that big. And so if you were to talk about certain synthesizers that are popular in the dance music world, like in the past Massive was and Serum is right now, you might run into the issue that you make a track with either one of the great presets that these synths come with. five or six dance tracks come out within the same month that actually use the same sounds. And I never wanted to be that guy. So it's like, oh, I've heard that sound in another dance track. So that's why it was very important to me to create your own sounds and to be part of that. You have to actually do it physically. And so that's where the full contact comes from. I know that sometimes you use recordings of things that aren't just like a modular or instruments. And I was wondering if you could talk about maybe a few examples of times when you've recorded something that wasn't like an actual instrument to use in a score. Yeah, well, I love... So one of the things that I love doing is scan YouTube for really odd sounds. And it could be... I don't know, like a street musician that is playing in the subway in New York. It could be some awkward, weird documentary about the Amazon and they're walking through the jungle and you hear all these weird bird sounds and the leaves just like being cut away by somebody with a sword. I would take recordings of that and then do sound design of them and create something unique. I love making my own instruments and start experimenting with those. I have a thing that's called the Piano from Hell, which I made and I use guitar pickups and sticks and hammers to play that thing. I've done a lot of city recordings. buses and trams and trolleys. For instance, for the movie I did with Peter Jackson, Mortal Engines, one of the main characters, Shrike, he has a theme that is a sample from a garbage truck that drives away. And I was sitting at the dentist waiting for my appointment and I heard this garbage truck take off. And I was like, man, that's awesome. And because I sat in the room and the whole room started shaking because of the low end coming from the garbage truck. And then I had one of my poor assistants look for two days through garbage truck recordings to find me a recording that did. exactly the same thing that I wanted it to do. And we did find it. So those things I find very, very enjoyable. And that's, to come back to what I said earlier when you asked what is controlled noise, well, this is exactly what that is. You said, obviously, you have assistants that help you in these projects. When you have a movie like The Terminator, how big is the team you're working with? It depends. I mean, usually it's like two people and usually that's fine. The thing, though, is with modern movies that are very expensive, you know, we're talking about movies that are two, three hundred million or more to make, which means that at the very end of the process. everybody gets nervous. Do we make our money back? So that is one. Two, the technical development of where music is today, but also the technical development where it comes to visual effects shots. the CGI, but also the picture editing has gotten to a point where you can keep everything free floating and open till the very, very latest moment that you have to say, okay, this is it. And now that we're talking about digital releases pretty much all over the world, it means that a theater three days before the movie starts playing. They can download the movie from a server. It comes with a security code and they have to type in the security code on the day of. And then three, four hours before the screening, they can test if everything is okay and then they play it. So as long as you deliver that digital downloadable file to the theaters like three, four days before the premiere, that's when you have a movie coming out. Now let's go back 30, 40 years in time where all the movies were still film. So the film needed to be completely glued together and edited months and months before the release because it needed to get... copies like in in I don't know like 30 40 thousand films needed to be copied and sent all over the world so theaters could play it so quite a different production process than where we are today And so that means that at the very end of the production process of that movie, things can get really crazy with requests from the director or requests from the studio to try changes here and there. And that influences the music as well. So sometimes you need to go very wide at the last, we're talking the last 10, 14 days of a film. Sometimes you need to work with six people on it or seven or eight just to get it done. And when you're working on these movies, your movies tend to be like big Hollywood movies. Do you feel like it's still artistically satisfying to you? For me, it is also because directors in studios give me usually... a lot of freedom to come up with a musical concept that I think is right for the film. And then we discuss it, obviously, with the studio and the director and the producers. And then we come to some sort of an understanding what it needs to be. And it's so refreshing to be able to do that. And, you know, to name like two examples, one is Mad Max and the other one is Deadpool. It's just really great when I saw Deadpool for the first time to say like, I think we need to come up with... sort of 80s music score on acid you know for for him and uh so it's so cool that the director in the studio was like totally on board with that because when you see that film, it's just like, but why would you guys stick 80 music against it? And, but it works, it works so remarkably well. And the same with Mad Max. It's, it's a, it's a dystopian film in, not in the far future, but dystopian film. And to come up with that sound for that, it's just like super great. And that you have the freedom from the director and the studio to freely experiment in that world until you feel that you're ready. And then you present the whole concept and then you take it from there. Do you still make music for fun, for lack of a better term? Yeah, so especially there's a couple of instruments. I started playing the string instruments really intensely like a year ago. So I have a violin at home that I play and practice in the early morning hours. And that's just me and the instruments just like nicely playing. I have the same relationship with my drum kit that is over there and with my Spanish guitar. It's just like me playing at night or early in the morning. And it's just me and the instruments just nicely playing. And then the other set of instruments I have that with are the synthesizers. In the other room I have over there, which is the synth room that is featured in most of my studio time recordings. I just switch all the synths on and at night I'm just playing. I'm not recording. It's just me and those instruments, just having fun on my own. And it's really good for the soul. You mentioned studio time. Can you explain what that is? Yeah, so this is for me... There's a couple of things in that same vein. I was brought up in a family where music was always very important. And my mom... was a music teacher. And during the day, she made her money giving music lessons on schools and such. And at night, she would give private lessons to kids, usually from less fortunate families, for no money or very little money to make sure that these kids also got education. So that's how I grew up. Education has always been an important part in my life. I also have had really great music teachers myself that also functioned as mentors to me, like how to look at life and how to... to achieve certain things. So in 2003, I was asked by Artest, which is the biggest music conservatorium university in Holland, to set up a four-year study course there, which is called Music and Media. And I was attached to that university for 10, 12 years or so. And then I quit that and I was like, okay, now what? And so that's when the idea got born for Studio Time. Very in-depth tutorials about how I work, about my gear, about how to score a film, how to write for strings, how to do this, how to do that. So very, very detailed documentation of the process of being a film composer. And we're now about to record season four. So we're super excited about that whole process. It's definitely expensive to do. We do it without sponsors and it's really like labor of love and it's a way of giving back to the community. And the second extension to that is that I now actually started a physical academy here with two students. And we did a test year last year and it was very successful. And this year we went official for the first time. And we have Ching Chen from Taiwan. who got selected, and Daniel Grice from Australia. And so it was really like a submission process, like it is on any university. written motivation, five tracks, and a couple of questions that you needed to answer. And I went through all these applications and boiled it down to like a top 10. And then, you know, who were my favorite two. They're studying now here. And the beautiful thing is it's for free. When you're giving people this detailed documentation and all your methods, you don't feel like you're giving away secrets or anything? No, because I think it's important that... people see how other people work in order to learn from it or you see something that you like or you see something that you dislike and then in both scenarios you want to pursue it or you want to pursue the other direction but then at least you've seen it and if you look at the classic cultures, the Chinese culture, the Roman culture and the Greek culture, like thousands of years ago, sharing was a really big part of their culture. And that's how you can really thrive and grow. I feel that a lot of people holding too much stuff to themselves. unnecessary, I feel. You need to trust in your own creative process and in your creative capacity to come up with new ideas every time. And so why would it be a problem then to share how you made Mad Max and how you shared Batman versus Superman and how you made Tomb Raider and how you made Mortal Engines and how you made Terminator? Why wouldn't you not? share that if for the next movie you're going to come up with a new plan the only thing I cannot share is how I come up with that idea you know it's just I don't know how that process works I watch a film and poof I have like 15 ideas in my head I cannot explain where they come from but I do have them and from that point on I can share everything that I'm doing from that point on you
