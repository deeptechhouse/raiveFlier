Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Sanjay Fernandes and I'm a freelance writer at Resident Advisor. Poor Music only began releasing digitally in 2008, but its founders are three of Melbourne's most recognised and respected techno identities. Mike Callender, Craig McGuinney and Christian Vance have all made valuable contributions to the city's electronic music scene and as such, their story goes well beyond the imprint. I caught up with the trio in a claustrophobic radio studio to talk Melbourne's past, present and future. you I guess a good place to start is for you to sound off just so everyone knows who you are and I guess give me a brief introduction to how you got involved and inspired by techno. Well I'm Craig McQuinney, one third of Hall Music. I got inspired by techno music basically by going to a local club that my calendar ran. that I later became involved with. So it was very much a local introduction or dive into the scene. Hi, I'm Mike Callender and I should probably take the ball and run with it now because I was the Mike Callender that he just mentioned. I used to run a little techno club called Focus with my best buddy Luke Rivett. and we had this guy that used to turn up every week and get really wasted. Who was that? His name was Craig McWinnie. So that was in 2001. So, and then there was this other guy floating around at the same time called Christian Vance, and he was kind of, he'd already asserted himself as a... a bit of a veteran of Melbourne, I think. Yeah, he was old school. He seemed a little bit older than us. It turns out he's not, but he acted like he was. It's great that you bring the truth out now. Yeah, that's right. But yeah, that's how, I think, is that how we all met? That could be how we met. Hi, I'm Christian Vance. I'm sitting right next to Mike Callender. I'm pretty sure... It could have been at your night, Mike, because for a while there, especially in the late 90s, there was like a really big boom of electronic music in Melbourne. Parties, small labels, a lot of live electronica, things like that. And it really died in the ass in a big way. And one of the people that filled that void was Mike Callender, and he ran a very successful club night called Focus. And I believe that probably could have been the place of union for all of us in some respects. I possibly knew Mike beforehand, but definitely Craig at that point. Okay, so you mentioned that the scene kind of died in the ass. Just give me a brief... Can you elaborate on that? Okay, I think it was really fertile in the beginning. When things are new, people get really over it. excited and really exuberant. And when electronic dance music culture hit Melbourne, I mean, it started really in the late 80s, just like it did in Europe, but it wasn't until the mid to late 90s that it really became quite a big thing, where 2,000, 3,000 people would go to a party. There were clubs running, you know, at least one or two. Every weekend, there was a really long-running club called Filter in Melbourne that lasted, I think, at least 10 years. It was as old as Trezor in Berlin, something like that at the time. And it ran on a Wednesday night. And it was on a Wednesday night. Even now, when there's so many DJs and producers and promoters and all the rest of it in Melbourne, I don't think anyone would be able to run a successful Wednesday night. It was new and fresh. People wanted to be... part of this new thing and once that initial wave had dissipated and a few things like licensing laws and some local things changed the landscape a little bit it kind of went back into the club and these small parties and nights and evenings and stuff cropped up. So Filter was a techno night. Yeah, it was. What kind of music were they playing there? Techno. It was kind of like, I think they pitched themselves as an acid techno night and the main resident there was called Rude Boy. I'm not sure what he does now. There was also Mad Rod who used to dress in some really lovely frocks. And they were characters, you know, and I think it was a really important identity thing that they had going on. And it was a Wednesday night at a venue called The Lounge, which is still running, probably Melbourne's longest running club space. and that was in an era when there was Wednesday night you would go to Filter, Thursday night you would go to Teriyaki, Anakisaki, which was, in my opinion, still the best techno night that was ever in Melbourne. That probably lasted nine years or so. Does that sound right? And you could also go out and see DJs on a Tuesday night in Melbourne as well. And that was like, that was maybe '97, '98, '99, and that was the best time ever, I think, in Melbourne for clubbing. and there were people everywhere going mental. And then at the turn of the century, I think for me the real indicator was a couple of parties that preceded a lot of the festivals that are happening in Melbourne right now. and one was called Welcome 2000. It was like the big New Year's Eve party, 99-2000, and that was massive. And everyone went to that, and everyone took ecstasy. That was the night when all of Melbourne's youth decided they were going to take drugs, you know, and it was massive, and it didn't matter what persuasion they were from. And then the year after, the promoters who did that, Probably expected this event like that, you know, 15,000 people going nuts and they probably got, I don't know, maybe a third of that. And that was, for me, the beginning of the end in a big way. A massive downturn, a huge beginning of a slump. That coinciding with Kiss FM not getting their full-time licence, which is a radio show that still runs now but in a... radio station? Yeah, it runs now as a limited bandwidth station and Craig's actually a part of it. But it used to be competing for a full-time massive large-scale license in Australia or at least in Melbourne. and it didn't get it. Instead, the license was given to a gay... Was it Joy? Joy FM, yeah. Was it given to Joy? It was given to another station. So those two things happened around the same time, and that was, yeah, the beginning of downturn and after that was when I decided with my friend Luke that Jesus we need to do something all the techno that we were hearing before isn't being played and you know something's got to be done so that's how we all kind of came together so at just to stay in that era for a moment at Phil Tarr and at this Millennium Party that you're talking about, was there a big focus on internationals or was it still a very local-centric... They had, I think the focus in 2000 was, we probably all can answer this question. Sorry, guys, I just jumped in. We split it up. Yeah, sure. Yeah, totally. In 2000, it wasn't, there were internationals for sure. There was always at these parties, there was always a Jeff Mills or someone like that. But it was less about those acts in 2000. that it was in 2001. 2001 is when it became about more names on the flyer and that's when it screwed up in my opinion. I remember distinctly around that time, I remember I think the first gig that I ever played was in 90, maybe 98, something like that. There was a local DJ in Melbourne who had, at that time, already been on tour in Germany. He played a lot of, I guess, I mean, his love was really Detroit techno and Chicago house, but he played... in Melbourne because the partygoers really wanted to hear this German trance and techno and stuff at the time. But he was a DJ's DJ. He was able to play all this bizarre music and different music and put it together, and his name was Jeff Tyler. And he ran... With him and a couple of other mates, he played at all the parties, but there were some really big parties at the docks that formed... techno music in particular in Melbourne. Let's talk about it. Forget the genre or whatever, but techno music and the way to party to it. And he played always at Richie McNeil's parties called Hardware. which up until that time where Welcome the Party Mike was talking about, they were really an integral part of anyone that was into electronic dance music because there was 2,000, 3,000 people in a big warehouse in an abandoned part of town which has now become... you know, something completely different over the past 10 years, geographically changed even. But at that time, it was quite a big thing. It was almost a rebellious thing for teenagers to be involved. And as soon as those big New Year's Eve parties took place, it really shifted it. Not that it became mainstream, but there was a mainstream understanding of electronic dance music, which was probably the tipping point. And that's why young emerging artists, DJs, all the rest of it decided to take up the reins and get a little bit of kudos or power back to themselves. And since then, I've just seen the cycle repeat every two to three years. That was when I was getting introduced to dance music, was around that time. My first few parties, I remember going to wet music parties. I remember going and seeing Carl Cox at the Metro. And it wasn't so much about going to see an international. It was about going to the party. It was about not necessarily the brand, but there was hardware running parties. And you'd go to a hardware party because there was Technoplate and it was good. And there was a few staple locals that would always... playing an amazing morning sec, Jeff Tyler being one of them, Damien Laird being another. And it was about this time, it was about that time that it all started to shift. And all of this attention was given to these people, these DJs that nobody in Melbourne even knew. And a lot of those... other local established DJs started to get left by the wayside. You know, Damien Laird started being left off the bill in the morning. And a lot of people that you just didn't understand being there were there. And it was a very sudden turn too. You know, all of a sudden it went from being this kind of communal dance party that everybody went to for the same reason into this completely different beast. And nobody really understood why. What year did you guys meet again? Just clear that up. The focus started in 2001. So definitely that's when Craig and I met. Christian and I probably almost surely met before then, but I'm sure I can't remember when. We're probably under the influence of something. Do you remember what date you toured Detron? Yep. That sub club? Yep. This is like September 2001. That's the night I met you. Yeah. Okay. So that was when Detron played in Australia for the first time. first time. A much chubbier detail. Yeah, he weighed about 50 kilos more than he does now and things have changed a lot. And he barely spoke any English too, it was really funny having dinner with he and his now wife Simone who are now friends of ours, we've known them for a decade now. But yeah, it was a funny dinner that we shared on the first time, speaking half of a language, you know. I imagine you would have eaten a lot as well. Yeah, probably. And so yeah, that was 2001. So this is kind of at the end of the year after what I'm calling the beginning of the end. It's a pretty bad time for you to kind of enter the game, the beginning of the end. Well, that's the reason I entered the game, though. It was like when I was an upcoming DJ and had every intention of being... as involved in this techno thing as all the people that were inspiring me at these parties from the years, you know, three or four years before that. So I was watching the Jeff Tylers and the Damien Lairds and another guy, Willie Tell, who none of them really DJ in Melbourne anymore, but they were... key factors in a lot of people like us becoming involved. You know, they were really the catalysts for that. So to all of a sudden find yourself in a scenario where these guys, the forum for this kind of thing isn't as regular. I felt like, you know, we need to do something about this. And it was more, and it wasn't entirely altruistic. It wasn't like, oh, we've got to do something special for Melbourne. I wanted a freaking gig, you know, and no one would give me a gig because there was the party thing, the arse had fallen out of it. So... best thing to do I thought then was do my own thing and that I could probably say the same thing shoot ahead a couple of years and we're doing the same thing with our label you know patience yeah patience let's not get ahead of ourselves I want to add something small there because I mean obviously The whole thing is with our label and we don't literally, we release more than just techno music. And I think I was also involved in a little bit of the mid-history, I think, of Melbourne's house music scene. And I remember even as a late teenager dancing at clubs because they were in tandem. Clubs were doing really well at the same time that these early techno raves, parties and nights were. doing and there were places like Mansion, Nightclub, Dome, Chasers and they left off from places like Fantasia and Savage and stuff which are really good, Savage being a really good bi, mixed and gay kind of house music night. which was on par sort of musically and party-wise with everything else that was happening in the late 80s, early 90s around the world with that music. And I think there was a really nice overlap, though, of partying at, you know, 6 o'clock in the morning at the rave. Rave would finish. This guy Jeff Tyler we're talking about had played this amazing morning set, finished with, you know, some beautiful... you know, whatever music and then you would end off at the club for the next three hours, you know, dancing house music with no lights on with a bunch of really people that were very different than the ones that you went to school with or hung out with, you know, and it was kind of a special time, I think, and that's why most people, a lot of people that are sort of running labels or who have been producing music for a while in Melbourne or DJing as long as these two guys next to me have been DJing or whatever. They started around this time. It was quite fertile. It was a great time for imagination, I think, and what you could do with kind of dance music and stuff in Melbourne. So I guess when you guys met then, let's say 2001, was each of you offering a certain taste to the friendship? Were you exposing each other to different sorts of music or was it very focused on certain techno artists or sounds coming from around the world? About the time I met Mike. I was just starting to DJ. I'd just bought my first turntables. And I did a bit of, because I'm a graphic designer, I did a bit of design work for Mike. We would have long conversations about different sorts of techno music because I was coming from a harder techno background and being introduced to different sounds by Mike. So we would have long conversations about what records were good, what I should be buying and all that sort of stuff. So it was definitely, you know, it was definitely fertile ground for me because I was not only making a new friend, but I was being introduced to a lot of different sort of music to what I was used to. What kind of artists were you into when you're talking about harder techno? Definitely. Definitely DJ Rush, definitely Luke Slater, you know, even up to Chris Leabing and stuff like that. I mean, all that sort of music was around back then. I remember one of my favourite gigs back in the day was seeing DJ Rush, which a lot of people sort of bag, and looking back at it, it was very fast and it was very hard. But you've got to remember DJ Rush comes from a Chicago house background so even the choice of music that he was playing back then there were still influences from all that sort of music. But you know I was still into the Jeff Mills and stuff like that as well so you know music tracks like The Bells were and Steps to Enchantment were massive you know. Yeah they were literally anthems like and proper beyond techno anthems, you know, that was a dance music anthem, The Bells, especially, I think, and Luke Slater's Class Action. tracks like that were just huge you could play that anywhere and i think this is what we started to do with focus is we started to play techno some techno classics and crossover or potentially crossover tracks to people who weren't normally into techno, and part of our mission was to spread a little bit more techno around. And Christian, I assume you may have been following the same path as far as taste went, or were you a little bit... No. I think since I was... I don't know, I started gigging when I was still a teenager. It was just out of school, and... This is live gigging. This is live gigging. So, okay, so the other two cut their teeth as DJs. My uncle had studied in Europe. He bought a synthesizer when he came back because he wanted to try and recreate this music which was happening over there. I borrowed the synthesizer and with two mates that I had from school, we created a band and started making our own. form of, I guess, techno music and house music. It wasn't as hard as what was, I guess, popular at the bigger techno parties. There were some smaller parties, still, you know, 1,500, 2,000 people in Melbourne. like the Innovator Parties that were run by Richard Maher that had a very Detroit-centric kind of focus. And yeah, I think my thing with music, I came from a really trained background. I used to sing and blah, blah, blah. And the whole... Chord and melody, rhythm element meant a lot, I think, to me and the guys that I wrote music with. It didn't mean anything to me. Yeah, you know, it probably did, you know. It didn't at the time. It really didn't. Actually, what I loved about techno was that you could, it was an entry point. for non-musical people into music and I still don't know a fucking thing about music but that's what I loved you could make a contribution so I think your background was totally different and Craig you know you do have musical training but you came at it from a kind of almost an industrial I did. I was a drummer in two bands when I was a teenager, a death metal band. Yeah. And I can't even remember what we were called. And a jazz fusion band with some Latin guys. And I kind of sold my turntable. I sold my drum kit and bought turntables. And I was right into the industrial. strength kind of techno and it's been like a slow then rapid change for me or enlightening I've watched you change you have watched me change you've watched me blossom into a flower well I have a really good memory it's probably the first time that Christian and I really had a a genuinely good conversation. It was a big gig I played at Sunshine People and I played in front of all these people and Christian came up to me afterwards and said, I really enjoyed that. And that's like, we'd talked, we'd spoken before that. Like, we did know each other but that was the first time that... we one-on-one had a connection where I think he, in the past or before that, didn't really know what I was about. And until that point, when that point came, he then kind of had a little bit more of an idea. And since then, he's watched me change from being this sort of hard techno guy into, what do I make now? Post dubstep, emo, shoegaze, heavy stuff. That was a really special day then if you guys connected because that was also the day that I decided that you guys had to release your fucking music on a record label. I was at the same party. What year was that? 2003, 2003 maybe. It was New Year's Day. It was Sunshine People. Yeah, it might have been just 2004. But yeah, I was at that party too and I saw Christian's band, Functasonic, play. And just, you know, had one of those moments on the dance floor where you have this epiphany and you go, geez, I know exactly what I'm supposed to do now. And it was, I need to, these guys, it's ridiculous that they don't have a record out. And they never did. But it was the beginning of a journey into we've got to get this shit out. And it started with FunctuSonic. And I guess at that time, that project was becoming more you, just you anyway. And then it's morphed into going. going, oh, we've got to get Christian's music out. And then Christian and I heard Craig's production. We'd obviously known him and been friendly for a long time, but when we heard his stuff, we were like, oh, that's the piece of the puzzle that completes the whole picture, you know? Any track names? Christian had this thing where he didn't give names to tracks. The first track that I was going to release, he called Green because that's the colours that he saw when he made it. It's pretty true. I swear I haven't smoked pot since high school. This is probably a good place to then focus on Christian for a moment. I was taken by this start of your musical journey. Do you remember what synthesizer your uncle bought back from Europe? No, he bought back all these mixtapes and it was a Korg M1 synthesizer, which is, you know... One of the early... It is a classic, you know. It's like mid-late 80s kind of thing. It's basically all MIDI and PCM samples. It did away with analog. But the thing that was great for me was there were all these sounds in one little box and then I could modify them. Not as much as I would want to modify them these days after having made music. for that long but at the time when you're 15 or whatever it was it was pretty cool and uh i remember the guitar lead i used to borrow from my dad's old guitar to plug it in to record One day, I think we might have accidentally burnt it or something. Anyway, whatever happened is we actually had to record through a ghetto blaster through the actual microphone that was next to the speakers. And that was the first recording of electronic music I ever did as a 15-year-old in the bedroom. And I think I've still got the tape and you can hear a bird in the background. Awesome. That's awesome. Can we sample that? No. You own the rights. Yeah. We had no one, there was literally no one else in Melbourne that either was willing to share how they wrote music electronically, how you would ever get that on a record, how you made a bloody kick drum um there was the information just wasn't there it was pre-internet still um i mean you could read about certain things i guess and you know we fantasized about 808 drum machines and stuff they were things of myth you know and as a 15 year old you don't have a thousand dollars to spend on a drum machine so um the whole diy thing which I guess a lot of people have done over the years with dance music and home studios it was definitely what I did in the beginning but I think it's a real I mean with the population was less here no internet to book an artist from overseas you had to look at the back of a record and send a letter in the mail or try and ring on a telephone. Send them a fax. Send them a fax. And it cost a lot of money to send that fax back then and you're 15 years old. You can't really get involved in any way. So you literally form bad habits of making music really young, which even now I still have and Mike and Craig are really aware of them when I make music because it's... You know, it's just like, well, bad luck, that's the way I do it, you know, and there's no other way that I can do it now because we were by ourselves in a little bubble trying to make stuff that sounded like other stuff and then it became your own stuff because you actually didn't know how to make it other people's way. So when you were making music as a 15-year-old or in your late teens, It seems that production was very much in favour of performance or is... No, it was the other way around. We wanted to actually go and play the music. So I think from the age of 18 or whatever it was like. bang play gigs the next year i remember playing gigs with derek may and kenny larkin and meeting all these guys who had like spawned you know genres of music and put out all these records and whatever and i've never really like that for me is that's what electronic dance music performance means you know playing live electronic music with djs you know but that's that's what it was you know I collected records but I didn't mix records. And so that's stayed with you now because you perform really only live when you play out in Melbourne now. Yeah, well, I've always played live. You know, DJing is something fun to do on the side. What's your setup at the moment? Setup is, these days, it's like if I have to go and play live, I have a sound card, my laptop and a MIDI controller and I... don't want to take much else with me because yeah it's great having a whole bunch of analog gear but when you have to set up in a small little booth where DJs play you can't put a synthesizer in and yeah so it's it's literally to go and play a gig even six years ago would feel a small sedan boot, back seat, nothing, even the passenger seat, you know, sometimes someone else would drive it to the gig, including the girlfriend, you know, and it was a bad thing, but it's just like, okay, I've got to go to the gig, got to catch a cab because I can't fit in the car with so much gear, so it's great these days, you know. It's kind of a small, smaller, more refined way of performing. I guess I wanted to ask you, Craig, whether your involvement in the scene was very organic or did you have to push with Mike and Mike to really get a gig or were you just the pissed guy in the corner who they decided to get up there for a laugh? No, no. No, no, that's now. No, I'm... Well... It was organic and I had to push. So with Mike, the relationship with Mike and the friendship with Mike led to... My first gig. My first couple of gigs. But it wasn't solely because we were friends. I think they saw that there was potential there. I definitely wasn't as polished as I am now. Not that I'm that polished now. I've got heaps of DJ friends who are shit DJs, so they didn't get a gig. Yeah, yeah. Well, there you go. I know those people too. So... So Mike put me on, and then from there it was, I had to push. I mean... You know, and I wanted to push, you know, I didn't want to be someone who was seen as being given some sort of golden ticket into the scene. I definitely wanted to make my own way. And that's how I became involved with the MTC, which was definitely like the MTC, which is the Melbourne Techno Collective, with whom I'm still lightly involved now. We started running parties because focus had stopped. And we had all met at Focus and we wanted to continue doing parties, but we couldn't get anybody to come to our parties because nobody knew who we were, so we did them for free. Which led to this whole... kind of thing in the scene of people having a bit of a grudge with us. Definitely not the people who were putting on and supporting it our nights, but there was a little bit of a grudge, a little bit of a, who do they think they are putting this stuff on for free? Nobody gets paid. You know, what is that? So that was where I did my pushing. And that's kind of where I cut my teeth as well, really, as a DJ. That's where I... I changed from being this slamming hard techno DJ into being something completely different as well. More subtle. More subtle, yeah, and more nuanced. So the Melbourne Techno Collective was a community of local artists that really didn't pay attention to international DJs beyond the music. perhaps bringing it to Australia. Exactly right. We did local only parties and we did them for free. And it was my friends Sam McEwen, Matt Radovich, Peter Baker and Jay Reading after a year, I think, Jay jumped on board. And we would do local only parties. We did them for about five years for free at the Mercat Basement, which is a bit of a renowned club in Melbourne. It's a dirty hole, basically, across from the Queen Victoria Markets. And Sandwell District played there the other week, you know. But we did this thing that there was never an international insight until much later in the scene. And that was actually when we started to really die off. Our most popularity was around when we were just doing the local thing, concentrating on 150 people in the room and five DJs, you know. And that was, I mean, it was, when you look back at it, in hindsight, it was special, but at the time it was really hard work and it was really hard to get people to come along. For me, I think you're... involvement's been much more, I'll say public, but I think a lot more people are aware of what you've done in Melbourne, Mike. So, I mean, I'm talking about post-focus and your involvement in Honky Tonks. Particularly because of the reputation of that club as well. So if you could just talk about that time, because that's always looked upon as perhaps the best period of this end that you're talking about. Yep, Honky Tonks. I think it opened in 2001, which is exactly the same time as all this other shit was happening. and it was a very special place because it was for me this was the best transition out of the warehouse parties and into a space that was really more than just about what music you're playing it was about What are you drinking? Who else is coming? What does it look like? It was a really beautiful space. It was very small, only fit probably legally about 300. There were often a lot more people in there. And the people running it were... Probably eccentric is a fair description and definitely unique and had real character. So it started out, I wasn't involved until kind of the last half of its life. It was probably around for about six years. But it already had a reputation. From the first time they opened the doors, they had a reputation. for doing things very differently and they were um they were booking acts that otherwise definitely would not have been booked and they were doing parties like um they would do Derek Carter on a Wednesday night and it would be jam-packed until You know, the door, I think it was licensed till five o'clock and then it would go till seven or something like that with the doors locked. And then after a few short years, guys like Steve Bug were saying, I'm only playing at Honky Tonk. when I play in Melbourne or at least I'm not going to Melbourne without playing at Honky Tonk so they might play you know a second show or something like that so it was pretty pretty rad in general they used to do incredible cocktails and it and it started this whole thing of you can go there even if you don't like this certain kind of music you can go to this space and have a really good time so um and I think that was the secret to their success. They didn't really spend much money on advertising. Once a month they would print a calendar in the street press that said May 1, May 2, May 3. That was it. And the rest of the money that they would have allocated normally to publicity or promotion, they used to give away in alcohol to people that they knew. And so it was just huge. And I became involved, I guess, in maybe 2004. started playing guest spots and stuff and then eventually for the last couple of years it was open. I had a residency there on Saturday nights and did a mix CD for them as well which had a good run with another guy, local DJ Aram Chappers. And yeah, so that finished up on... New Year's, or not New Year's Day, probably the day after the day after New Year's Day, because it just kept going, in 2007. So it was, yeah, notorious for lock-ins, debauchery, crazy owners. Michael Delaney, who's a friend of ours, was the guy sort of... doing most of the kooky artwork and he did the crazy decor and he really pushed the boundaries with what was not just acceptable but what was considered normal in clubs and now he's still in the game putting his name on different things. And he's a real personality. He's that guy that you can see him a mile away because he has an interesting look. And he's that guy that people still come up to and look at like a kind of a superhero in some way. And he's still a party man. You know, he's like, he's in his 40s and he can still party anyone under the table as far as I can tell. And he's still got that energy. for it and he put it best when we spoke about this a little while ago. He was talking about me when he said it, but he goes, you know, you're a lifer. You're going to be doing this forever. You don't have any choice. And that's certainly what I would say of him. It doesn't seem like Honky Tonks had a musical mandate, I guess. Was it pushing a certain genre or was it just good music? It was pushing good music. And it was like, it was pushing, let's do the stuff that's not getting done, you know, really They'd have the first shows for so many guys who now are playing at festivals. Honky Tonks had their first shows. Within my personal interest, it's guys like Michael Myers, Super Pitcher, Matthew Johnson, some of my favourite acts. I came a long way just to find you I came All those guys are pretty big in Melbourne right now, all started out there. Steve Bug. You could call out five or six names from any genre of music that isn't trance, basically, and find similar circumstances. They'd have guys like Questlove. playing there and then other people just turning up there because it was cool Mick Jagger's turning up Pharrell Williams is turning up you know it was that kind of place I can't imagine any of those guys turning up to the Mercap basement Well, you probably just couldn't tell if they were there. Yes. I want to talk now about the collaborative institution that is your label. When did it first enter your mind to start this? I think it was what Mike first said. He wanted to release music that I'd been writing. And I think once... Craig became involved at whatever point, you know. I mean, we'd already been talking about stuff and whatever, but it was some... Mike had it in his mind. Mike was destined to run a record label. You know, I can't see... any other way the guy knows just how it works in people's brains to to how music is mapped out in a social way a lot better than I would understand you know and um I think whole music is the three of us beforehand it would have been something different it would have been Mike trying to put out music that that I was writing or whatever so I don't know Craig I reckon Craig is probably the most qualified because without Craig I don't think it would have happened you know what year was this 2008 the label actually launched in 2008 but it was probably conceived in this uh new year's day 2004 so i was a little bit slow but um yeah well mike mike had spoken to me about wanting to run a label and i think the first name he had for his label was chalk city i remember actually designing a record label for him and it was going to be a christian van record and I remember that nothing came from it and he was like oh yeah we're not sure about vinyl at this point in time and there was a lot of talk remember him talking about viability and the cost of vinyl and then it was at some point i think i just released a digital track um it was one of my first and um i played it to christian i think i sent it to christian and he said oh that's really good and then the next thing i knew mike was emailing me going oh i heard your track No, I was calling Christian going, why the fuck don't I have this track because it's awesome. Why is he giving it to some label that I've never heard of? Of all things, a digital label, that's ridiculous. Yeah, you've got to pay for your music, kids. Pay for your music, kids. So, yeah. Yeah, so the digital thing was just starting to boom. And I can't exactly remember the conversation, but it was something along the lines of Mike saying, hey, we want to do a digital label. Do you want to be involved? It was that frank. And I saw the opportunity straight away. I think I'd released a record and I'd released a couple of digital tracks and I was like, I'd really like... to if I'm going to release digitally which was kind of a dirty word back then still I definitely want to be involved on the label side of it So we conceived this idea to do this thing where we'd basically release our own music and remix each other and I'd do the artwork and we'd all write music and we'd put it on Beatport and, you know, that was really the crux of it. So why? I didn't quite capture the... the dirty word, the digital dirty word transition to let's do it digitally. Yeah, there's probably a little bit of time passed between those two statements, but... I was working for a record distributor with Damien Laird, who is the guy that we were talking about before, alongside Jeff Tyler doing awesome morning sets. He was working in record distribution for a long time, first for Hardware Records, which was owned by Richard McNeil, who now... the hardware and stereosonic parties. And then he'd gone out with a guy called Greg Molinaro who had Rhythm and Soul Records and they started a... import and distribution business. So I went and worked for Damien and was heavily involved in vinyl. I just, you know, it was very, very special and very important to me. And it was my bread and butter too. So I was working like 70 hours a week in this little warehouse, importing records from Germany and France and the UK. And so I thought basically there was no way I was going to... Oh, and that's what got me thinking, you know, I can so do this, I can do this label thing. Because part of my job was basically picking the records that would end up in the record stores locally. So I thought I was reasonably qualified to decide. what we could release and that there was definitely a market for the kind of stuff we were into, for us to push back out the other way, you know. And so I was like, yep, it has to be on vinyl. But then upon further investigation, realising that because our profile is biggest in Australia than anywhere, that if we were to sell records here... The problem with pressing vinyl is that the cost of shipping it to Australia is in many ways more than the cost of manufacturing it. So you Europeans have got it so easy, you should feel very grateful for the fact that it's pressed in your backyard and you can hold on to it. This whole digital thing now where vinyl barely exists anywhere but mainland Europe is certainly a symptom of that. The freight company is making more money than the producer of the record. It's ridiculous. But yeah, a little bit of time passed in between me investigating and going, Jesus, how am I going to come up with a model for this label that's financially viable? And then the digital thing became less of a dirty word every day. And now it's like, yeah, you can release your music however you want. But certainly first it was like... that's ridiculous. Why would you do that? And now it's like, why wouldn't you? And for most people, it's like, why would you do vinyl? I know we're about to start pressing vinyl for our label. And the first thing that my friends working for distributors said was, why? You know, this is guys selling vinyl for a living. So yeah, there was a bit of a transition in there somewhere. Yeah, because I mean, I've talked to you, Mike, but I assume you guys would feel the same way that the tyranny of distance is a massive problem. And I presume the digital label is a way for you. guys to not lag behind. It was probably the only way. It was the only way that we could really, we could release the music that we wanted to in the model that we wanted to and not blow $5,000 per release, you know, pay $5,000 for this release to happen and have nobody buy it. Whereas this way we pay... a nominal cost, whatever we want to put into it, really. And the sales are a reflection of how things are in the global scene and how much we can publicise the music and its release date and all that sort of stuff. So, I mean, it was just a way that we could do it, that we could effectively do it and manage it and not go broke. I mean, I'm also thinking about time. Like, is the time turned around on pressing vinyl? Yeah, we've been trying to get our first record out for about six months now, and I still don't have a release date, so time is a big factor. And talking to other, like I was talking to Andy Hart. Recently about this as well. They're about to launch their Melbourne deep cast label and You know, he was like, oh man may 9 can't wait now May 9s become May 27 Then it's gonna become June something and you know this whole somehow record distribution is definitely not a science and I don't know if it's a symptom of the kind of people that are in the industry or some other bizarre intangible factor, but you just can't be sure when something's coming out until you... You don't know that record's been pressed until you've got it in your hand almost, you know? So it's really a pain in the arse. But I think for us, more than the timeliness of it, we really believed, especially when we started, that the music we were making wasn't... anywhere else so it didn't matter if it came out today or tomorrow it's kind of inconsequential but at the same time to maintain your enthusiasm for something if you did it if it's finished and you've put all your energy into it why not present it to people as quickly as you possibly can because you know sitting it on the shelves pointless I think the thing that I think is a real blessing from the digital release, which we've been doing for a couple of years now, is when you listen back to our back catalogue, I hear the journey of development with all of us. And at the time, I definitely would have put the record, the music on vinyl. But I think now, I think it's better that we're... going on to vinyl at the stage that we're at um on a global level i think on a local level it was it was a great introduction to who we are but i think on a global level for people to be wanting to pick up wax they want to hear us now they want to hear we're doing now. They don't want to hear what we were doing back then so much. Exotic Australian music. Exactly. So Hall's exotic? Well, yeah, it's funny how people from other countries view Australians and our funny accents, but yeah, exotic is definitely What do you mean, mate? What do you mean, mate? What are you talking about? But yeah, exotic, definitely. It seems like, let's say from 2001 to 2008, there's a seven-year gap between this eventual haul eventually becoming a label. And I find labels... exist or at least rushed out by people whereas it seems there's been a very long period for you guys to come to terms with exactly what you want to do um get it down pat and um really execute something that on your terms rather than i i definitely agree with that but i don't think we're i don't think any of us with the label we're sort of like this is how it's going to happen now because we've waited so long and these are the exact things you know we don't sit down and you know this it's it's not it's it's more about putting out majority australian electronic dance music that is australian electronic dance music doesn't sound like this artist or that label or blah blah which a lot of aussie producers fall into that trap because all they're doing is buying music from elsewhere and slavishly following what's going on. I think the whole idea is that it has an organic thing. Yes, we're doing the label now, but it evolves in its own way. We're not forcing any kind of philosophy on anyone. We're just making music. that we enjoy making, that people we've seen enjoy dance to our music. And I feel that's how the label is. It's not some predetermined, premeditated marketing exercise. It's not something that's like super cool, arty, like, wow, look at us, and we're at the cutting edge. of some South London dance floor. It's not about that. It's about Australian, in particular Melbourne, electronic music producers putting out records that people will listen to, dance to, DJ with and all the rest of it and it's happening along its own merry way. Yeah, and we've had periods of... really prolific output with the label and we've had periods of bugger all happening and I think we're actually about to come into a very very slow period of releasing and it's because of what Christian's talking about the organic nature of the way we work partly it's because we're totally unprofessional and totally under resourced and Partly it's because there's no need to, you know, we're not running this like a business. We don't have a budget and a target that we need to meet for sales. And our objectives have changed, you know. I think we at one stage set out to release all the good music in Melbourne and realised that we can't do that on our own and now we're... definitely planning to release all the good music that we want to release from each other's output that is really amazing and really unique and that's why we're doing vinyl now because we want to make them collector's items. We're doing jazzy artwork and we're just slowing the whole process down a little bit to be more deliberate. Digital music, DJ charts, all this other stuff which has really only been part of the vernacular for the last five years, really. Like, I mean, DJ charts have been around since discos in the 70s and whatever, but not like they are now. It used to be that you would look at Groove magazine for a DJ chart and that was the... And the reason it was so important to look at the chart is because you couldn't speak German and that was the only thing you could understand. You know, but obviously there were all those DJ mags and blah, blah, blah. But I think now it's like all these things are such commodities. Remixes, this person remixes that. I'm going to pat you on the back for this, blah, blah, blah. The great thing is about, I guess, having your own label on the other side of the world. You actually don't need to be a part of any of that, you know? We have done a majority of what we've been doing. just for the sake of doing it. And it's like the only little box that I would say that we can jump up on because it's, you know, you're just putting out music. A lot of labels do do that, but there are a large majority of labels, especially that you can buy digitally these days. It's just about fulfilling a niche, you know. It's pre-packaged, manufactured. crowd control dance music and we're not, you know, we haven't been into that and, you know, people have sent us music and stuff from Australia and we're like, look, it's really well made, it's great sounding, whatever, but we want stuff that kind of sounds like you and where you grew up and, you know. how you met each other at some festival, hugging one another and all that stuff. Like, we met, you know? Yeah, totally. Given the local focus of the label, do you think you've, Hall Music has played any part in establishing a community? I mean, it's a stupid question in one sense. Yeah, I'd just like to get your perspective on that. I think we've celebrated the community and we've made that public. So we've said a lot of things that people were thinking already in Melbourne. And I'll tell you what, there's an incredible amount of padding on the back. in Melbourne at the moment, everyone going, wow, aren't we great? There's so many great producers who are doing stuff now that are being recognised and that kind of thing. We're definitely not responsible for that, except that we did it for ourselves. And so we, I guess by example for some people, we've made it clear that... possible and also we've yeah we've definitely celebrated the successes of other people doing it locally so I think that's been important there were definitely times in Melbourne when producers and DJs were more competitive than they are now I feel I really do feel like there's a lot of camaraderie and there's a lot of sharing of music there's a lot of feedback definitely there's a massive feedback cycle happening amongst really good producers in Melbourne where you can find out pretty quickly what five or six dudes who are good producers from different genres think of your shit which is That wasn't there before and that was a really big barrier to entry for young up-and-coming producers. You didn't know if your shit was any good and you'd send it to a label overseas and you wouldn't hear any feedback and you weren't sure if you were even being listened to, you know. And now it's almost the exact opposite now. There are definitely ears planted on Melbourne, which is good. I think we should be all proud of that, not just whole music, but everyone who's a part of what's happening. Obviously, just from talking to you, you said earlier that when you were produced... When you were producing music, no one was telling you how to make a kick drum. And just from what Mike just said then, it seems to have changed exponentially now in the opposite direction. Yeah, I mean, you've got one thing, which is the internet, but it can only tell you things in a literal sense, even a YouTube. bit of footage on how to use a compressor, there's still not going to be someone there going, right, don't do this, or this is how you do this. So, production techniques. different styles of different people, ways of doing things, ways to release your music. It's kind of, it's shared a lot. There's, I think about two years ago, there was a bunch of young people coming through and they're now releasing music and stuff and it's good, you know, it's nice to actually be there and have an existing way of doing things and then, wow, look, all of a sudden there's a whole bunch of other people doing it. It's fertile. It might even arguably be as fertile perhaps not in the party way of things that were pre-2000 in Melbourne, but perhaps it's as fertile now in the musical production and DJing sense as it was back then for parties and people innovating in how to experience this music in a different way. Who are those local guys that you're talking about that you enjoy seeing coming up now as maybe older and more experienced? Look, without even thinking too hard about it, I think the one that is the most impressive is Louis Day and his alter ego is Tornado Wallace. You see a young person come up, they play really good music, they produce really good music, and he's done a great remix. on our label. I think he's remixing one of the songs by Mike for vinyl or something like that. It's great, you know. It's really good being around for that long, I think, and seeing people actually doing something from where you're from and you've been part of shaping that in a way, you know, and it's not just with the label, it's just, you know, these people know who you are and then you become friends and it's great. There's no, there's competition but it's not divisive competition at the moment and the longer that can hold out, the better, I think. Definitely would like I mean, being able to shoot an email of a track that you're working on to someone like Louis Day or Jamie Stevens, including Mike and Christian, you know, I've got a circle of people that when I finish something, I send it to. These guys are writing completely different music in a completely different way. And they've all got some form of feedback to give you. But just having that community there that now exists of all of these different great heads that are there at the click of your fingers, and I'm there for them as well, it's definitely very different to how I experienced dance music, you know, in 2004. Yeah, I mean, Sanjay, you talked about the tyranny of distance. I think that was the major issue. definitely in this city. We're the southernmost city in the world, I believe, with more than a million inhabitants. That's an interesting statistic in itself, you know, and it's great now that there are enough people to, you know, there's a bit of convergent thinking going on between people and coming together and through that you have a greater output of divergent thinking in ways of what you're putting out on wax digitally, ways to run a party and all that sort of stuff. You talked just then about how the wealth of producers and DJs is perhaps increasing it to the detriment of parties. No, I don't think it's got anything to do with the detriment. It's just interesting. I haven't seen, in this city at least, a time when parties have been amazing and the quality of DJs and producers has been amazing, whereas it's always kind of been out of sync. It would be nice now that there is this camaraderie in this city that at some point in the future they're all playing regular gigs. around Australia and can earn a living from it and can continue putting out their good, interesting, quality art that is Australian, Melbourne, whatever, you know. Do you think perhaps that's the reason that, like, The fact that it's out of sync one creates the other so an awesome party scene It spawns ideas, but it creates a this situation where it's not really necessary to make music and then a totally shit party scene requires that you have an outlet outside of the clubbing or the rave or the event space and you get guys like Craig McQuinney just you know noodling away in the dark for a number of years before anyone even realises you know But I think, I don't know if Melbourne will ever have the two at the same time. It would be fucking rad if they do. But just, I mean, I guess to challenge that, then I would say perhaps that people like Louis and Griff, Francis Inferno Orchestra, they're really young kids. It's not like they've been partying for a long time or know that the Melbourne party scene is perhaps... lagging somewhat oh yeah but i mean oh louis not that young but um you're sorry louis um but they you know we were uh last year for the summer in berlin hanging out they've seen parties way better than happening here i think it's not to say that there's not cool stuff happening here on a party level because there definitely is but It's just critical mass, you know. So... Yeah, I don't know. And as far as guys even younger than that, maybe they think it's really rad what's happening here and maybe that'll inform their music too. It might be inspired in a different way. Well, I guess not to take away from the local focus that you're talking about, but Hall's also providing for the lack. that exists perhaps in underground international DJs. And I mean that you're not necessarily bringing people out that are household names or that have established. And I think specifically of that gig you brought out, Jin, from Singapore. I mean, he's not someone that kids in Melbourne would, you know, shouting from the rooftops. Yeah, that was an interesting one. I mean, the opportunity came up to do the party. Somebody who tickles my fancy probably a lot more than some other people. But Shin, I mean, what I knew of his music, and I owned quite a bit of his music before we brought him out here, but also knowing that he was into a broader spectrum of music, I knew that he'd put on a good show and it would be a really modern approach. And I just thought that it would be something that would be good to do because I thought it would be fun. It had the possibility of working. We didn't slay the numbers, but it was still a good party and the music was really good. Yeah, I definitely... When I say I wasn't a fan, I don't mean that I disliked his music. I mean that it didn't speak to me in the way that it would speak to someone like Craig. And I wasn't a huge... collector of his material but what I could see immediately when that opportunity was presented was that like Greg said it would be a good show and it's something totally different and it's not being represented here so I think that's important there's only so many parties you can do like that in an amount of time because invariably or at least in my experience they lose money So we're not going to do 20 parties like that every year, but from time to time we will. And especially if we've got money in the bank, we tend to spend it, you know. So the better the label goes or the better some kind of party we're involved with goes, the more likely we are to do things like that rather than because... you know, it's geared like a business. I think the other thing is, you know, I guess Mike and I in particular, it's sort of come, even though with the label, I guess we've been involved in a few parties and we've obviously had a couple of artists and things like that play with us and for us. But I would say that the, you know, Mike's toured a lot. The thing that you had to do in this city, apart from you have to make music, you have to DJ, you know, I've had to play my own music. We've had to tour artists, we've had to run shows, we've had to create. tours for people within the country. You know, there's a lot more behind hall music than just three guys who met on a dance floor somewhere and whatever. You know, the label itself has been involved in so many, well, the three people that are involved in the label have been involved in so many facets of... how electronic dance music has been purveyed and perceived in this city, that I think running a show like that with Sheen and whatever, all of that knowledge has gone into that, you know, and I think somehow at some point it translates across to younger people and to new people, you know, that are into that music. Sorry, Sanjay. And perhaps that black hole between 2001 and 2008 when we started the label can be explained in a big way by those parties happening. We were going, shit, why isn't this person coming to Melbourne? That kind of thing. So doing those shows, it's all part of the whole package. And also, I guess, something that jumps out at me is that you're not necessarily looking to Europe for your touring. I mean, I don't think there's much outside of Europe or perhaps the States that would be on the radar of many people in Melbourne. And I'm saying so to look to the Asia Pacific. is another lack, I guess, in Melbourne. Yeah, it was more... I mean, I don't really care where someone's from. If I have the money and I'm inspired to do a show, it's 100% because of the output of their music. They could be from Botswana, Africa, Tasmania. But to look is the key, I'm saying. Yeah, well, you mean I'm constantly looking for new music and the sort of people who are constantly looking for new music and then thinking that they might do a show for that person is probably going to be somebody who is a selector and writer of music. A lot of, I think a lot of promoters... not saying anybody in particular, but I think a lot of promoters at the moment are definitely, because it is a problem, looking at the bottom line. So it's more about who they can get that will... create enough money so that they continue running the business of the party whereas for us it's not about that it's about the music so if we if we true an artist or run an event it's done in exactly the same way that we run the label basically yeah yeah yeah underfunded unprofessional for the for just the sheer love of music man because we're hippies man So, I guess, and then a suitable segue is this, that this is a suitable segue to, I guess, the current state of affairs in terms of festivals and stuff, because in one sense, you're bringing out this incredibly underground, I hate that word, you're bringing out this music that not many people are attuned to. And at the same time, these national touring mass market festivals are occurring with artists like Villa Lobos on the same bill as Kesha. And yeah, I just wonder... I'd like to get your perspective on that. Mike, I know you're probably a little different to Craig and Christian on this. I think festivals have their place. Festivals are a good opportunity for a cross-section of people to see a lot of different music. Whether they choose to leave the main arena and go and seek out what else is happening in the other rooms is their prerogative. But I definitely think the idea behind a festival is a good one to showcase lots of different sorts of music in a party vibe. That's why it's called a festival because it's a celebration. So I'm 100% behind the idea of it. 100% behind the idea of it. I think that's the beauty of running a label. Within the label and from the label you don't really need to worry about. what's going on, you know? Yeah. It's a very forced way of heads down kind of and getting on with things. So I think from a label perspective, you know, it's not really affecting decision-making at all. I like that there's the variety between the very, very, very small party in a sweaty little room and the big, giant behemoth of a party with very sweaty, waxed men. I love it. It's excellent. I think actually Melbourne has variety. Oh, I guess this is happening all over Australia, but... We have a variety in just about everything, all cultural exploits, you know. There's a variety of people here. It's very multicultural and that's reflected in the outward expression of the promoters as well. So there's a lot of bases to cover, you know. So I honestly, the last couple of festivals that have... happened in Melbourne, I can confidently say I'd never heard of most of the acts on those, but there was no doubt in my mind that I would go to the techno stage and spend the day there. You and I, Sanjay, talked about Jeff Mills playing at Stereo Sonic late last year. I didn't leave that stage at all, and that was where Villa Lobos played as well. So it kind of doesn't matter. I guess Christian answered this as well. So, I mean... The idea of the festival is nowhere or in no way at odds with whole music. Absolutely not. I mean, we create music and we perform music. If a festival wanted us to be involved, then I'd say that we would look at it on a case-by-case basis. To this date, we haven't been involved with the festival. They're completely different things and they have a completely different focus and they can run side by side and they can exist in the same city without one affecting the other. And it's also really good when you play your own tracks at a festival because you get money from APRA. Yeah, totally. I get money from him playing my tracks at festivals. I just have to say that I love APRA. APRA is a very wonderful organisation and it should be supported. Can you just explain what that is? APRA is the Australasian Performing Rights Association. It's like SOCAN in Canada or what's the American version? ASCAP. I can't think of the British one off the top of my head, but it's basically the Collecting Society for Intellectual Property for Musicians. So they, like when a festival happens, they have to pay money to that organisation on behalf of all the artists whose music is played. And then if you're one of those artists, and certainly whenever I play at a festival, the party we were talking about, Stereo Sonic, I played a whole set of whole music tracks. So it's like robbing Peter to pay Paul. It's awesome. At least you're getting something out of it then. Yeah, that's right. What are your hopes for whole music? And personally as well, I mean, you spoke a little bit about the vinyl releases. Yeah, so I guess just give me what you personally hope to achieve within the next five years. I've gone through a total rollercoaster of expectation and ambition with music over the last decade. And I think... After occasional delusions of grandeur and occasional deep malaise, I think the best that we can hope for is that people will still listen to what we're doing and that probably more importantly we think it's worth it. saying so um with the vinyl if someone buys that that's going to be rad i'm really looking forward to having tangible products that i can give to my mum um things like that you know we have very simple goals um i think we're pretty satisfied with the with the output thus far but um just to keep doing you know to like live in the now and get up and go today I'm going to make an awesome track or today I can't wait till we release you know music from this person I think that's um it's very simple but it's very serious goals like that Yeah, I think Mike summed it up beautifully. I mean, as long as I have the will and the drive to release music, I'll want to release it on all music. Part of my drive as well is to see these two guys release more music and for them to push themselves to release. what seems to be consistently steady climb upwards in the quality of music that they produce. So, you know, as long as they're producing music, I'll push to release it on our label. And I'll keep on pushing myself to make music that I think is worthy to be released on our label, you know. So if you're the A&R guy... Yep. Are you like the first and last port of call for like who releases your music on your label? I am. I don't know what's going on, man. What are we doing, Mike? I can see the bank account just shrinking and shrinking. I don't know where it's headed, but you know. You personally got anything any any dreams? Don't get all soppy on you. I've had dreams. Had a lot when I was a teenager. I think, look, this is a label-focused thing, you know, and I think the interesting thing is I've come over the past two and a half years, three years, two and a half years, whatever it is that we've had the label. I now can split my vibe in my head or my psyche into Christian Vance hall music and Christian Vance the live performer, blah, blah, blah. And it's a really cool thing to have the label, you know. If you have an idea, it's sort of like, I think, like, especially the last EP I had on the label and the J. Vincent Jr. remix and Claire Morgan did a remix and I did a B-side and, you know, it actually had a fair bit of love from, more from bloody other producers and DJs overseas than it did from people. buying the EP but you know I know that the original of that thing I would never have sent that piece of music to any other label it took me a bloody long time to finish but for me it's a really complete piece of dance music it's not it's not designed for anything it's not made for anything and I would never release that anywhere else except on the label that we run and I think that's the special thing about it you know you you have another place another space so there you go that's that's really in tune with with what mike said about why things aren't in sync i think i you know in this city in particular i feel i don't have much of a space a lot of the time because it's quite hard to play live electronic music every bloody weekend, which I've done for the past three summers. So within a label, you create a space. It's like if you can't have the physical space, you might as well have the space you can create in a label, and that's, for me, the dream, that that space gets bigger. CHEERING Thank you.
