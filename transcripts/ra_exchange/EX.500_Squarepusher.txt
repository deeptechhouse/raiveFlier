🎵 *BOOM* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping their electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. For this, the 500th edition of the Exchange, it's our distinct pleasure to host an interview with the English producer and musician Squarepusher. The work of Tom Jenkinson is some of the most jaw-dropping and future-facing music to emerge since the early 90s. Although he's generally thought of alongside other key acts from the Warp stable like Aphex Twin and Ortega, Jenkinson's musical horizons are particularly all-encompassing. few artists have managed to so convincingly create a dialogue, or an argument as Jenkinson puts it, between live instruments and electronic sound. It's a conversation he carries out at an insatiable rate, having released something like 14 LPs since 1996, all the while challenging himself and his audience by exploring new compositional approaches. RA contributor Holly Dicker spoke to Jenkinson on the eve of the release of his latest album, Be Up or Hello, tracing key points in his artistic development from his earliest musical experiences all the way up to the present day. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Squarepusher is up next. you Tom, you're about to release your 14th record, Big Up, A Hello. Yes, it's B-Up, A Hello, but yeah, more or less the same thing. What did I just, oh, B-Up, A Hello. Yeah, actually I prefer Big Up. Oh yeah? That's a nice alternative. Sweet. So yeah, if I get to kind of remaster it one day. That's the 15th album then. Christ, yeah. Yeah, I'll get there. Okay, but according to the bio that I've read, the origins of this kind of traces back to an accident in Norway. You slipped on some ice and broke your arm. That's correct, yeah. I'm wondering, what were you doing working in Norway on some slippery ice? Well, yeah, I was actually walking rather than working at that point when I slipped, but I was out there. with my partner, who was doing an artist in residency program out in Norway on an island called Trana out in the Norwegian Sea, which is a pretty fascinating place, and I was just tagging along. But I had taken a couple of bits and bobs to do some work and things, as well as just kind of mooch about. and just out for a walk one day with the wrong footwear, basically. Went flying onto the ice, landed on my left wrist and smashed it. It was pretty devastating because I got it looked at and happened to crack a bone that has a nerve running through it, and that can lead to loss of feeling in your fingers, possibly need surgery, this kind of stuff. And as a guitar player, frightening. was some sort of conceivable chance that I was actually going to be or perhaps even unable to play so it did cause me to have a stop and a think and a moment a reflection given that I was also I guess in a state of distress really because of the concern that this injury provoked. I was looking for sort of a way to ameliorate the kind of sense of difficulty. So I thought I'm just going to go for something nice and comfortable in terms of recording. Just going to go back to all my old stuff, my old analog kit and just have some fun with it, you know, and just start again, try to treat it like a. start I have this craving anyway for turning over a new leaf like a kind of year zero of course at 44 you know I've been making records more than half my life so that's in the end already actually even vaguely conceivable but still with a bit of um of an effort of will and some imagination you can get some way there so That's what I wanted to do. So I just set it all up, all the old analog stuff, and just set up this rule. I would just make a track a day. So one track every 24-hour period. So at the end of the day, I would just record whatever I'd done, and the next day I'd move on. So it was this very, very fast-moving. light-hearted flippant approach to composing and recording and this is um a process that you've done before or is this like a new process yeah i mean it will often sort of come along in in lulls you know after big tours or you know some other kind of much more intense phase of recording you know something that was perhaps you know very technically or psychologically demanding you know it's this kind of moment i crave you know like a little holiday if you like a little break but it's still doing you know the thing of but but in a in a much less programmatic and Focused and, frankly, you know, in a way that doesn't really, at the time of doing it at least, it feels like it has no real relation to my kind of career in the sense of being a public figure and putting work into the public domain. So, frankly, it was just a time to mess about. And it was great. You know, I mean, I was still faced with this dire stress of, like, well... I'm never going to be able to play again, but, you know, it was a good way of distracting myself for the time being. Keeping the fear at bay. Yeah, yeah. Well, we all find different ways to do that, right? So what were you doing then? So before the accident, what kind of work train were you on? It's very sort of guitar focused. That's, I think, probably why it was, you know, the stress was so intense, you know, because it completely destroyed it. Actually, it was a violin and piano duet and then also some music for a quartet too. And then I was, as part of the concert, I was also going to be playing. And it just threw the whole thing out. It was dreadful, really, because I was really looking forward to it. Still, I got about halfway through it and, of course, one day it'll be happening again. Yeah, it's not like forgotten forever. Oh, no. Who knows? I mean, you know, things, life can be chaotic. I hope to get back to it, yeah. Okay. So speaking of guitar, maybe take us back to aged 10, was it, when you bought your first guitar? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So, you know, I mean, that was the year zero. been happier you know this sort of um object was so fascinating for me i mean it was wasn't uh long before that that i'd heard the music of jimmy hendrix but as an avid listener of music from basically as far back as our guitars were a big feature of of the music i heard and i became fascinated by them and just just had to know how it worked so um a classical you know as one does perhaps you know 15 quid thing um that was enough to get me hooked and then i got a bass that november i believe it was 1986 and um off i went Why the bass guitar, though? I just had this fascination with what was happening in the background, like the kind of the foundation, if you like. And it was also a mystique thing. It's like, okay, there's the guy at the front, and he's making all the noise, and everyone's looking at him, and that's cool. But there's also this other guy at the back, and it's kind of like, what's he doing? And I had this sense of, like, that there was something kind of mysterious about it, also quite kind of, as I say, foundational, foundational about the instrument. And because it was mysterious, I felt that there was a greater potential for exploration. I mean, I don't know if I portrayed it to myself like that when I was a kid. but it just felt like a blank canvas. I was like, what's that thing? It's the instrument no one really kind of knows or really cares about. So, okay, let's play that one and see where it goes. See what I can come up with. Yeah, I mean, looking at it in a sort of technical sense, bass, it's so critical for how we hear harmony. You can have, you know, if you have like say an E major and then you drop an A underneath it, then it completely changes and you don't hear it as E major anymore. You'll hear it as a variety of A chord. You know, the bass note will tell your ears, you know, that's the root and then your mind assembles the rest of the notes according to that reference. point and and i think because it's the deep connection with rhythm that you can basically you can play the drums and melody at the same time with that instrument it's the it's kind of for me the instrument all these different areas that you might find in a kind of you know sort of whatever conventional ensemble like there's there's the there's the melody that you kind of up front that you hear and that you remember. And there's the rhythm that drives it along and the bass that's kind of a harmonic foundation. But bass is the thing that, for me, links all those together. And then you also learnt to play the drums, right? At this very early age? Well, I used to mess about on the drums at school. Okay. Frankly, that was, you know, that's my background in drumming. I just messed about whenever, you know, at rehearsals, when I was in bands have a cigarette or whatever, I'd just kind of like get on the drum kit and just blast away into the co-back, which is probably quite annoying. But it's one of those things, I was 15, what are you going to do? Be annoying, I guess. Exactly, that's the point. You're a teenager, you're kind of obsessed with music, fascinated by music. Where do you think this obsession to kind of play and make music came from? As I say, my fascination with music goes right back to my earliest memories. I think when you have a fascination, an attraction towards something that dates from that age where your mentality is not really fully formed, it's kind of hard to know really what the reasons are. I think I could point something obvious out like I couldn't ever really get enough of how... it would take me on a sort of emotional trip. You know, even just a three-minute throwaway pop song could be like a vision and a journey through another world. Music's power to transform the moment. is probably the root of the fascination and that it can take us through any of different emotions in a short space of time. But as I believe Schopenhauer commented somewhere towards this effect, that it takes you through that range of emotions but without the painful stimuli. that in the normal run of human life would be required to produce them. So it's a way of having a rich emotional life without having an intensely stressful one. Well, and then you become an electronic music musician. And then you have a career in the music industry. That all goes to hell. And then your life is stressed. Start to finish. So yeah, there you go. I'm curious why you decided to study art instead of music then. Well, it is an interesting one. I basically have not had any formal music tuition aside from... year one to three at secondary school, you know, because it was a compulsory subject. I didn't get on well whatsoever with the music department at school. I mean, we more or less continually antagonized each other because there was a... If you like a kind of group of musicians at school who were, I must point out at this point that, although not sure how many people would connect him with my work, but I went to school with a guitar player, Guthrie Govan, who is, I mean, absolutely one of the world's leading guitar players and absolutely extraordinarily good musician. And, but I grew up watching him play. and that set the standard for me, which is about as high as it gets. I mean, you know, if you just said to him, right, play the guitar solo out of 1984 by Van Halen, and you just play a note for note, you might not want to have heard it, but you could still play it, or anything else you care to mention. And the guy plays with such extraordinary conviction that that set basically the highest standard possible for me from day one. It was just, you know, demanding. There you are. But anyway, he was part of this little gang of rebels, musical rebels. And we sort of, you know, would try to get rehearsal time on the stage at school. Music department would sometimes kind of grumblingly permit it. And teachers would wander past kind of frowning. Like, what are you making this hideous racket for? What is the point of this? horrible music that you're doing you know and of course I'm sure some of it was horrible but what you're going to do you're learning you know it starts out that way and maybe it continues to be horrible I mean I hope it does in ways I hope my music's still horrible here and there sometimes yeah yeah amongst the other things whatever they are But anyway, so, yeah, it was this battle. It started out as a battle. And in this quite funny, you know, extremely sort of, I suppose, harmless context of school. But, you know, it set me out immediately with this kind of sense of being against the authorities. I remember, like, surprising them. Like, they do try and sort of, you know, set challenges as far as music lessons are saying, play a G on a piano, and then he'd play another note. And he'd say to the audience, the assembled, you know, the class, he'd say, well, what was the second note? And he'd ask the music boffins. None of them would know, and I'd say it was an E flat. And so they kind of were suspicious of me. what's going on with this child? You know, it's horrible music, but somehow he's kind of got this peculiar skill of knowing, wiring out the board, you know, he understands like harmony, like already. And I asked if I could do A-level music at that point. They told me, no, you wouldn't be capable. What? Yeah, I walked off and it was a shock. Now who's laughing? Well, I don't know. I mean, I actually would love to see him and say, you know how it turned out? It turned out all right. It's not so, you know, it's still pretty horrible though. So sorry about that. But yeah, so, you know, and it only added fuel to this sense of. rage against the authorities, you know, in the way that rage occurs when you're a teenage boy, you know, just like, right, well, I'm going to fight back and I'm going to continue fighting until I win. But, you know, in that context, it was just, I was a black sheep and that was that. So consequently, academic study of music was just a no-no. It just was ended in that very moment when he told me I couldn't do it. Art was, I just chose it as a fourth A level and then it turned out to be a load of fun. And I took it foundation year as a sort of experiment and just had such a wonderful time because I actually started making, apart from anything else, I was trying to find at that point ways to make visual art and sound go together. You know, in quite an elemental way, I mean, this is going back to like early 90s still. was doing slide shows and things you know this really granddad sort of format amazing yeah I know I mean I mean it's really like so clunky and and and primitive and it's got this kind of like reference of really tedious kind of family gatherings or some sort of taking you through the holiday snaps like one by one and I tried to make that work and in I guess in ways you know I had some success And it was a fantastic year and it led me to want to pursue it. So I went to Chelsea. Very prestigious art college. Kind of disappointing though. I mean, I didn't, yeah, that year was a bit of a shock because it just suddenly was this sort of, again, it was another hostile atmosphere, you know, and I felt at odds with the teachers. quite often would argue with them i don't know if they really saw any merit you know in my work and trying to combine sound sound with picture and i was just always made well you must read john cage you must read john cage because he's the person who understands you know this kind of like a you know, the fine artist's composer. And actually, I think John Cage is absolutely fantastic, a really fascinating, really fascinating person. So, yeah, they did me a favour here and there. You say begrudgingly. Just that one, though. That was it. That's where it stopped. Yeah. Okay, so you only did one year at Chelsea Art College? Year and a term, yeah, because I got the contract from... warp uh the contract offer came through in the first term of the second year um i mean it was it was approaching christmas time so yeah um getting on you know for this time of year really and and i remember just looking at this sheet of paper that there was a summary of an offer And it was someone offering to give me money to make music. And I couldn't really believe it. I thought, well, what I'll do is I'll go with it. I'll defer the course at Chelsea for a year, which is what I did. I'll make them a record. it will do nothing. I'll get dropped and I'll go back to Chelsea and I'll go on arguing with my tutors, you know, and that'll be what happens and who cares, you know? And, um, yeah. And that didn't happen. Apparently not. Apparently not. I don't know if the chase Chelsea has still got the place open for me. Chelsea, if you're listening to this. Yeah, exactly. Tom wants to come back. Come on, you know, one day. Make slideshows. Let's do it, yeah. Okay, well, let's go back a little bit. So this is what, this must be after your Reflex record. So, yeah, so no, there's a little bit more detail in there to cover because before, one of the reasons why the Warp Offer came in is because I'd met Apex a couple of months back at a show. in Finsbury Park. In fact, you know, the story, which obviously Richard embellished somewhat on the back of FEMA Weird Things, is broadly true. Like, that's where we met at the George Robey. where there was a monthly experimental electronic music night. And it was the proper kind of old school London pub gig, you know, with a bar on one side and then a big blacked out room, you know, with a knackered 16 channel mixer and a kind of floor standing PA and, you know, fill it with 100 people until six in the morning. It was totally amazing in a very rough and ready way. But Richard used to live around the corner from that and just chanced on being there when I was doing my first show up there. And we had a chat afterwards. And then the long and short of that was Femi Weird Things. And in the meantime, Warp got wind of it, partly through Richard checking out and also checking out a couple of my early 12s. which led to the offer. So just to add a bit of colour to this gig, I've actually, for those listening who haven't read the sleeve notes, I'm going to read a little sample. He made the sound of ambulances turn into slide trombones and the sound of a secretary filing her nails into a 24-piece string section. When my partner Grant Wilson-Clared saw Tom spasmodically twitching in order to play a funky bass line in time with a 347 BPM drum and bass track, he thought he should either be committed or recorded. Fortunately, he chose the latter. So this was in 1992? 1995. 95. That's 95, yeah. So winter 95, all that happened, and then the... The album was out in the spring, 96. I want to ask about this first 1992 gig where you just jumped up with your bass guitar and played with, is it DJ Hardy Finn? Oh, Hardy, yeah. Well, so this is the stuff that me and my mates were doing when we were at school still. So there was a couple of venues in Chelmsford. One was called the Chelmsford City Football Club. And then there's also YMCA, both total dens of iniquity, loads of fun. And we would put on nights once in a while at both these places. And, you know, there tended just to be a bit of a free-for-all, like people DJing, general kind of party, kind of atmos, fairly eclectic approach to the music. But, you know... specifically my friend Hardy was a real, like an absolute sort of savant when it came to dance music of the day, you know, like sort of roomfuls of... Detroit, Chicago, and New York rarities. And I mean, it's through him that I came to learn about the music of Derek May, which is like still one of my absolute favorite, still one of my favorite musicians. And, uh, but yeah, so we just put on parties and play records. I would sometimes, you know, there were sometimes events where you'd like chop up break beats and things and I would jam bass lines on the top. It was just a massive load of fun, basically. And quite kind of, you know, just making out as we went along, really. But stacks of fun. But it was quite foundational in terms of my... look on electronic music and trying to expand the range, I suppose, by bringing in electronic, sorry, by bringing in conventional instruments. You know, I started with the bass because that's what I had to have, but I was quite quickly then bringing in other acoustic instruments and so on. which ultimately led in the early days to records like Harden All Daddy and Music Is Right Will Note, where in different ways I'm trying to explore and blur the boundaries between electronic sequence delivery of musical material and performance. blur those two and trying to make one sound like the other and vice versa and i think if if there is a thread through anything that's probably it this kind of dialogue although i think you've used the word argument quite a bit between this uh kind of electronic instrumentation versus machine processing and so on that point um i want to take ask you about sort of the first time when you kind of tried to combine playing bass with digital sound sources you described it as being quite unpleasant in the beginning yeah yeah because i mean just taking the example of a of a conventional drum machine when uh you play along to it there's absolutely no give in the tempo it's just absolutely rock steady at whatever tempo you set i mean of course if you get involved with it you introduce subtlety with some hard work. You know, you can begin to get it to approximate the ebb and flow that you might get from a drummer. But, you know, the majority of my experience at that point and in those early days was playing bass with other musicians, you know. So this lockstep timing. initially was a bit of a bind in terms of being a performer. But in the end, I found a way to turn that to my advantage. So rather than trying to dwell in this domain of conventional motifs of expression, sort of emphasis here, slow down at the end, you know, big moment, start the next bar, you know, the way that you might make music ebb and flow as a performer. I actually thought I'm throwing all that away and I'm going to play like a machine and just actually try and learn. acid riffs instead of like Jaco Pistorius licks. You know, I just want to learn like DJ Pierre slam and like, you know, box energy, like tracks like that, that the intervals are so weird, like on a, for a musician to go to play it, it's suddenly your hands are in this knot because. It's not made with any reference to a physical musical instrument. It's just what those guys plotted out in space. Just this note and then that one. and that one sounds wicked there. And you're just not stuck, you know, with the limits of your hands, which is one of the things that made it fascinating for me because it's got that same kind of like, occupies that same sort of sonic territory, but it's, on the other hand, just completely psychedelic, you know, not stuck in all these kind of clichés, really, you know, that musicians tend to play in. So it was about finding a way for my left hand to get all the way around through those strange kind of intervals. And then for the right hand, just to make that machine-like attack and make it completely digital. And of course, you can't only approximate it. I'm not a machine. But who knows whether that's good for you or not. And whether it makes good music, I don't know. But it felt fun to explore it. And I believe, you know, that what is exciting about it is you can get somewhere towards that trance-like state and immersion in sound that you get through dance music, like repetitive dance music is one of the fascinating things about it is how you gradually can kind of sink. rise into this state of other worldliness if you like you know like a lot an alter state of me as performer that can happen too you know you get involved in that sort of and of course you know that that that actually happens if you look across world music i mean there's any number of different forms of music around the world that actually seem to be trying to get to that same place you know through repetition kind of trance inducing style so i'm curious as to what your entry into this trance dance music realm was from playing in bands and being well just just um i remember hearing lfo uh the track lfo by lfo at a party 1990 I think and at that point I really didn't have much time for dance music and I think it was an article of faith amongst the musical rebels at my school that dance music was kind of fake then it was just sort of throwaway commercial that doesn't have any kind of real value. It's not nothing kind of really particularly good about it. It makes it worth checking out. So I'd absorb that, although not entirely because they're always at the back of my mind. Yeah, but what about electro? What about Grandmaster Flash? Where you have these electronic sounds with instruments. Anyway, LFO really just showed me the falsity of that premise, you know, that electronic music is sort of lifeless commercial crap, because it was suddenly this luminous world of sound, really super, I mean, I really remember it being super visual, like a really striking visual image as I was hearing it. It just sounded so neon. and glow in the dark and I just had to know more. And of course, you know, a lot of the other dance music I heard subsequently is like, it's actually just pretty far away. But I chanced upon LFO and just wanted to go in deeper. And as I say, my friend at school, Hardy, was my, you know, way in really because he already knew. so much about that world so through him I learned about Detroit music and Chicago Acid House and which is still you know they're still kind of major reference points for me but were you also going out raving or was this more sitting at home listening to music no no no I mean it was it was it was very much tied up with very much tied up with hearing this music in in the proper context i.e. really really loud in a really dark room flashing lights and smoke and no one knows what's happening cool so where was this like were you going illegal raving or well it was just a mixture of things whatever whatever we could manage you know in 1991 wasn't exactly overloaded with money. So it was whatever we could do locally and save up for a ticket for whatever nights in London. there was a big, I think it was a world dance event, Summer of 91 in Great Lees, which is in Essex. That was a big event where I saw a couple of things which really stayed with me, including Ragga Twins. Yes. Yes. They were so good. They just ran onto the stage as well. It wasn't just like, you know, they're trying to be cool. They just literally ran. onto the stage. The music started and it was just bliss. It was such a powerful performance. I remember it so well to this day. It was dynamite. So it was that and Odds and Ends, whatever, you know, hardcore breakbeat nights up in London that we got ourselves up to. So it was all that, yeah. And did you have a little brief period of DJing at this point? Yeah, I mean, I would do it, yeah. I didn't really ever see myself as that. kind of performer really I can do it it's just I feel a bit stuck when all I've got is records I mean it's fun for a party and there is something pretty satisfying about doing decent mixes and stringing an interesting set of tunes together but it's just something that I'll do like messing about you know and I did do it in those days but really You know, it's instruments. That's what it's about for me in terms of performance, you know. And then perhaps more being in the studio and making music, that's more your home. Well, yeah. Well, there is that, yeah. I mean, there's that, which has been, you know, pretty, pretty. I mean, you've basically been making an album every year for the last over 20 years. Well, yeah. Yeah, there's been quite a few. But, I mean, it's true to say that there's plenty more stuff that hasn't reached the public too. So there's a stack of material. I mean, it's just... I just record more or less obsessively. It doesn't matter really what it is for me. It's just about keeping going. And that sounds like a throwaway comment. It's actually really not. Like for me, continuity is everything because it's about keeping these ideas fluid in your head. It's about keeping all the information fresh so you can access it with a click of a finger. key you know it's about keeping your information at your fingertips so you can just do whatever you want so you can think the idea and you can make it you know that that's essential for me if you're scrabbling about thinking how do i do this for me you've already lost you know the enthusiasm levels are going to sort of just gradually start drifting away So, yeah, and for me, composing the studio, writing, recording the studio, even if it's just completely exclusively with electronic instruments and sequences and so on, still, it follows broadly the same kind of patterns that I will... follow when I'm improvising, making something up on an instrument. So if I'm just making something up, like start to finish, off you go, make a piece of music, three minutes off you go, just make it up. I love doing that. A lot of my practice will be that. If I'm playing guitar, then I'll just sit there and make things up. And this is, for me, just composing in real time. That's all you're doing. But it's a skill because you haven't got any time. You've got to just do everything more or less on the basis of instinct. If you hear the sound in your head, you need to be able to go, yeah, that's C flat. I need the E flat There is. You play it. But that needs to happen. split second and um that's the way i work in the studio it's like i need i just i need to know like without thinking about it you know and and that that fluency is what it's about um and i've read somewhere that uh you've said i feel like i'm rotting inside if i'm not learning so my question is what are you learning about at the moment right now yeah right now well That was a grand statement for me, wasn't it? I know, right? Or what were you learning about with this latest, this current album? Current album? Well, as I started out, more or less trying to amuse myself. I mean, I will quite happily be learning about things other than music. It's not the only thing I do. But in this instance, it's perhaps like learning how to take care of yourself. whilst I don't think I did much of any musical merit in that immediate phase after I broke my arm, I can also say they helped me out and got me kind of, you know, at least thinking sort of, you know, kind of relatively straight up way, you know, like rather than in this kind of panicky frame of mind, you know, that ensued, you know, when I thought I might never be able to play the guitar again. So, you know, it's kind of therapeutic value. So learning how to look after yourself. But it did lead into, you know, quite directly led into the phase that produced the music, which I selected the pieces that formed this new album from. So, yeah. And do you have like a general approach when you are making an album or is it really, it has depended and changed per each time? Yeah, it really is a variety. There's no set pattern. I can start with like a fairly broad and quite strict kind of conceptual framework. You know, I'm not shy to say that. if a concept album beckons I'll make it you know has one ever beckoned yeah yeah they do they do I mean the thing is it sounds like a joke but you know they're they're they're quite often have been I mean something like well uh say go plastic the broad conceptual framework there was trying to find a way of making music that was catchy without using melodies, without using hooks, and without using repetition, or at least using as little repetition as I thought I could get away with. But still trying to make that melody, still trying to make that loop, you know. compelling you know to bring people in you know like i think it is a bit of a a trap you know when you're wholeheartedly making experimental music that it can kind of veer off into its own domain where it really the music sort of betrays this sense that the listener is no longer relevant. And at that point, I think I switch off. I think there's a strong independence that I need from the audience. I need that because I can't thrive when I feel like I'm being dictated to. I need to just explore. And the public's free to dis. dislike it if they choose they don't have to buy the record they don't have to come to the gig so i think it's fair yeah i need that framework but yeah the the conceptual boundaries can be quite strict you know and whilst in the end on go plastic there are a couple of moments of what you might call more conventional melody i think broadly is you know fulfilled that kind of outlook you made one of the probably one of the catchiest tunes of well my personal favorite it's got a cheeky yeah it's got a cheeky opener in it yeah it's got a cheeky talk about red hot car if anyone doesn't know already wasn't it like top 40 or something oh i don't know i don't know about that Sounds unlikely. Classic. But, yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe. Okay, so speaking of conceptual albums, was, I'm going to mispronounce this one as well. Don't worry. Budokan Mindphone. That's bang on. Yes. Using Bolognese instruments, right? Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, so gamelan instruments in there. I mean, used in quite a, I guess, a flippant way, or at least. not trying to emulate Gamelan tradition. really made with any direct references to Balinese music. Didn't you just have the instruments and you just wanted to use them and incorporate them? I happened to spend some time in Bali in the early part of the summer of 1998 and saw many performances of gamelan music, which was absolutely astonishing, really, really. enriching experience and then chanced upon a place where they were selling some instruments so I had a few things shipped back I mean I didn't buy an orchestra but I just bought bits and pieces that appealed to me on the day and and then yeah lo and behold Budokan came around so And they crop up here and there. It's not like sort of banging away all through the record. But yeah, they're here and there. You know, played in the way that seemed appropriate on that day. You know, as I said, I didn't study it. I didn't try to adopt the techniques that are used within that music when it's performed. Yeah, I had some fun with it. I guess now would be a good time to flip it and talk about software. Yeah, feel free. So you've been developing your own software. Now it's more than 15 years. It's more like nearly 20, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And that got its first sort of big outing on Damage and Fury's album. Yeah, well, that was the first record that I made exclusively using it. Yeah, I think the first piece that I released was using any of that stuff was in 2002, which is called Kill Robocon, Do You Know Squarepusher? So that was... That was the first outing of my early experiments in that regard, using software that I'd actually worked up myself. It wasn't until Damage and Furies that I'd used it exclusively on a record. So what can I say? I mean, it grew partly out of a kind of academic interest in a way, looking at the mathematics of music. I've always been fascinated by the physics and the mathematics behind sound and it was the way to join those two things together. So, you know, working up. music in a form of equations. That sounds like fun. It was for you, wasn't it? It's stacks of fun. Believe me. Oh, I believe you. I was so thrilled when that became, you know, a possibility for me, you know, because I shunned computers actually in the early days. I didn't use a computer for sequencing or any kind of processing recording, not until 2001 really. I just didn't. want to see the computer. I didn't want the screen. You know, it's just too much like a telly. And telly's too much like switching your brain off. So I just thought, I don't want screens. I just want, you know, just music hardware. And that'll do. So it was, I suppose, relatively speaking, kind of late on. the computers came into my world and become mixed up with music. But yeah, so it was just so thrilling. Broadly, to me, you could sort of form a very, very, very quick summary of music as being the mathematics of the emotions. And that, for me, is borne out by this process of making music in that way. You're designing equations that evolve over time, and yet this produces sounds that then result in emotional effects. I mean, what could be more fascinating than that? I mean, honestly, that will keep me going forever. Saying that, I mean, I did start out very early on using some VIC-20 programming stuff. It was a nice way to get back to it. I had a Vic-20 when I was a kid. And so when I got my bass guitar, you know, the first things I recorded were basically Vic-20 drum machine tracks. And this is the computer that you used for the upper hello. Yeah, so it's just come back. The Vic's back. Yes. I'm so thrilled. Like, it sounds so great. It's so tight and slamming. You know, it's like really... I set myself a challenge a couple of years ago. First of all, I just thought I was going to sample it, I was going to fire it up and sample it, because there's a square wave on there that's got a unique sound to it, and also the white noise generator is, again, very, very specific sounding. So I thought I'd just make a sample library out of it. But then as soon as I fired it up, I thought, actually, I could have a load of fun with this. I thought I'm going to try to make... a synth that I could use in the studio you know on a day-to-day basis and it would just integrate and blend and just be usable like all the other stuff is you know you just trigger with MIDI it delivers the results in a consistent way and off you go you use it in tracks so that's what I ended up with I mean it was a bit of a journey but yeah just running like a machine code program on the VIC-20 that reads user port and the joystick port and then using a sound card to send control voltages to those terminals like a 12-bit signal across that which is enough to kind of get your access to the amplitude control and all the pitches on the four voices. and then lo and behold, there you go, you've got the instrument. And it's not on every track on the new album, but it is on a fair few. So, you know. That's one for the anoraks. Listen out for the rig. You know, it's in there, bubbling away. Nice. I wanted to sort of go to this year where you kind of shut down your studio and just focused on playing bass. Yeah. What happened there? So we're referring to like 2007 there, right? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just finished up Hello Everything. There was a couple of shows, but there wasn't much really associated with that, gigs here and there. By this point, I'd be slogging away in various forms, different recording approaches. I mean, Hello Everything was formed out of a very eclectic phase with no real overarching concept or idea, which is why it's kind of a mess. It's just like a big compilation, really. But still. Is that why it's called Hello Everything? I guess it is. Makes sense, doesn't it? Now you say it. It's everything. It's everything. Just who cares? Bring it all in. Very kind of eclectic outlook. But yeah, it was just basically like a diary. You know, like, look, here's what I've been up to. You know, I've got the big sort of conceptual statement, but I've got this stuff. Check it out. And then all those, the cover pictures, is that all you as well? Yeah, yeah. It was just to sort of try to give a very simplistic sort of reference to like, you know, here's the stuff. Here's the stuff I do. You know, I felt quite like a very, very sort of literal sort of rendering of it. But there you go. But so after that, I thought it's time to turn all this gear off. It's been switched on for the last, whatever, 12 years. It needs a break. So do I. And it wasn't long before that I got the six-string bass. I think I got the six-string in 2004 or something. No, three. And whilst I got quite comfortable with it by that point, I used it on Ultra Vista, for example. It felt like time to just go into it. and absolutely see how the thing worked. So I started working up pieces just for solo, which in the end formed the pieces for the solo electric bass record. I think it's because it's a solo electric bass, yeah. It's called Solo Electric Bass 1. Is that because you were going to do another one? It felt like it at the time. You know, I don't know if the public... uh really kind of you know particularly kind of agree with me and in that there should be a number two i don't know i think it's beautiful oh thanks that's really sweet i mean actually yeah i mean a couple of people have have i i think it's one of those records that you know uh you know there's no no two ways about it's a bit niche but that on the other hand you know there's some sort of really movingly heartfelt comments that I've had from people. And that's enough. You know, four or five people, it really is something special for them. That's more than justified in terms of putting in the public domain. So there could be another one. You know, maybe that's next. I haven't really been playing bass, you know, because of the arm. I started playing guitar more because guitar is easier, frankly. It's smaller, the strings are lighter, there's less tension. it was easier to play. So I just thought I'm going to rehabilitate myself with that. And then I just got into playing it. I just thought electric is actually loads of fun. But you mean this is sort of your career in a nutshell, isn't it? Sort of jumping from one thing to the next, whatever you're feeling at the time. That's it. Yeah. You've called your career a mess because you follow your heart. But I mean, it's a lovely mess. Well, that's, that's That much I can say. But yeah, I don't really, in the end, have much choice. You know, I'm just driven by enthusiasm and enjoyment and the joy of experimenting, trying things out. And, you know... got to say sometimes I feel I feel I'll get a bit of a kick out of winding people up you know it's just like see what this happens see what happens when you do this who knows who cares let's try out you know and it I think sort of careerism is something I'm inept at you know I've blown out stacks of things that could have been huge career opportunities but but all on that very same basis that's like, I don't want to do that. I'm not doing that today. And beyond today, who knows? But today's the thing I'm in command of. Who knows about tomorrow? You know, I can't plan for that. I've got no real kind of idea of, you know, in any case, if I did try and actually work out well. So, you know, just go with what's in front of me and just make the best of that. So you're very much an in-the-moment kind of person. But does that mean, do you ever really look back, reflect on what you've done? Not really, no. I'm more or less anti-retro. I really don't like that tendency. It feels dangerous. I can't help but see it as part of the... the way things are developing politically. There's this sort of bunker mentality in the culture that's like we need to look back because looking forward is too frightening. It feels like all of a piece with climate change and things we are faced with. So on the other hand, I think there's no other way through. We have to face forward. Absolutely no choice. Looking back is not really going to help. But it's funny because once I set up a rule, I've got to break it. Right. And so the anti-retro thing is more or less a rule, but I know that actually when I started out making this record, I was just trying to comfort myself. I was like, I just want the 303. I just want the 101, I just want the, you know, the 909, and I want all this stuff that's just, like, fun and reminds me of amazing spirit of adventure, you know, when I first came across it all. And actually, you know, I want to mention that the record is dedicated to my friend Chris Marshall, who died actually shortly after this escapade with my arms, so it was like a... One thing happened and then another, and it was just an enormous blow. And partly I wanted to return to the days where him and I were just messing about with that stuff. He was a very technically minded guy. And together we learned about how samplers worked and how drum machines work and how synthesis was actually happening inside the synths. It was really both. really into the electronics as well. And we made pieces of music together and just had a, you know, great, great, great time. You know, it was just part of that posse with Hardy as well. We just used to put on the parties and have a great time. But it was, there was this technical slant always. It's like, how is that happening? How does that work? So, yeah, in a way, I guess perhaps there's some sort of... Well, that was what happened. I mean, I've just wanted to go back. Yeah. And, look, I mean, I wouldn't stick out a record that was retro because I just don't want to waste the public's time. I think it is actually a waste of time doing that. You know, I'm not trying to recreate some moment from 1994 or whatever. you know if it felt you know i'll quite happily make a like an acid track that you wouldn't be able to probably tell from something from 88 in chicago but i wouldn't stick it i wouldn't stick it in the public domain i think it's pointless So here we are, you know, old instruments, but hopefully new sounds. I mean, I've tried. I really like really, really trying to get new sounds out of these things. And what's so amazing is that it's possible still, you know, that all this old overused kit is still, still got some spark. Bye. ♪ ♪ Thank you. Thank you.
