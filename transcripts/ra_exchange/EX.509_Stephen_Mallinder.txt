Bye. To the Resident Advisor Exchange. Normally for these, we'd go chronologically through someone's career, but I'm not even sure that's possible in the time we have with the man here. It's an honour to have Stephen Mallinder in the... Resident Advisor studio, and I honestly don't know where to start with a career like yours, Stephen. I mean, what are you doing now? Let's start with the present. What am I doing now? That's quite a good idea. We can sort of like deconstruct the whole thing and go backwards. Right now, well, I've just finished, obviously, I released the Um Dada, the album I did under my own name. uh solo album um i've been i've written kind of a whole virtually in other albums with the stuff since then because i'm doing i'm kind of playing live with that a little bit as well but it's just me so uh i decided i wanted to kind of keep it a bit raw so i wrote pretty much another album of stuff in a similar kind of vibe just for live so i've got a few dates doing that um and Aside from my own stuff, we've got the Wrangler album out, which is out in February because we signed to Bella Union. We launched the album in November with sort of an Anthropocene, just a video, and then we started kind of rolling that out. And that's you and Phil from Tung? That's me and Phil from Tung and Benj from, obviously, Meme Tune. I mean, it's Benj's studio. We did it in. And Benj works with, you know, does the math, does the math with John Fox. and all three of us work with John Grant and do the Creepshow, do Creepshow. And that's the other thing. We're probably writing new stuff in the new year for Creepshow because I think we're doing some, I think we're doing festival things in the summer, so there's more Creepshow coming up. And that's where the Bella Union connection comes with John Grant. Yeah, that's where it came from. I mean, it does, but at the same time, I've known Simon for Simon and I knew each other really well, so it was kind of an easy fit. And Simon heard the Wrangler album and went, you know, I'd love to bring it out. So, yeah, there's history there, but it's, you know, the connection more recently was through John, yeah. And over the past few years, you've also had ongoing collaboration with Steve Cobby. Yep. Yeah, Cobby and I, we should get back together and do stuff. I think distance is the tyranny of distance a little bit because Steve's up in Hull, which sounds terrible, so it's a long way away. But if I go up, it's kind of a block of time and I'm travelling to Cornwall a bit. So we sort of put that on ice for a little bit, but I'm hoping at some point to get back and do some more Cobby and Mallander stuff. We'd had a I'm hoping we can revive that at some point as well. So, yeah. And I've got my original solo album, Power, from many years ago being reissued. It's coming out on double vinyl. So I'm doing that with Jason Am, who obviously is known for I Dream of Wires and Solvent and all the analogue stuff. So he's in his label. that's kind of a quick snapshot of the next couple of months. And we got gigs with Wrangler as well as my own gigs. That's a fair bit to be going on with. And I mean, these are more than just kind of, you know, being busy with collaborations because all of these people are fairly radically networked in their own right. For anyone who doesn't know Tung, for example, they were kind of right at the heart of the Folktronica thing in the early 2000s. And around that time, I remember doing a piece for Word magazine where I drew a family tree. I started with The Accidental, which was a side project from Tung. and tried to draw all these connections from the various different members and managed to fill this whole double spread of the entire music industry. Effectively, it was only two degrees of separation from Tung to like Kylie. Yeah, and when we played the Albert Hall. when Wrangle played the Albert Hall with John Grant Kylie was the guest there so there was actually one degree of separation from that so there you go yeah and and and Tung and Benj were always kind of working in parallel they started in the same studios and um But this is how you've always worked, really. Like, Cabaret Voltaire was never a conventional band from the beginning. No, I mean, I don't think we set out to be a band. It wasn't the idea. The idea was, I think we were all kind of creative people and sound was the medium that we worked in. I mean... We were all kind of into art. Richie went to art college. Chris and I were really into it. And hence the name resonated with picking the name Cabaret Voltaire because there was that wider interest in all kind of art forms. And that, you know, for various reasons resonated and it became the name. But we were interested in just more sound experimentation. We didn't want to be a band because we couldn't be a band because we... We weren't musicians. We hadn't grown up in that kind of way. We'd grown up sort of wanting to play around with electronics and tape recorders and processors and things like that. Very much inspired by, in the first instance, by Brian Eno and Eno's role in Roxy. That was kind of the little spark, I think, the catalyst. we were all, you know, it was one of those things where, you know, we wanted to be Roxy in the sense that we all, but we all wanted to be Eno, everybody wanted to be Eno. So it was a band full of Enos really. So no one wanted to go, oh, we'll do this. But at the same time, you know, the idea of using conventional instruments was the idea of processing them and making them part of more of an art thing. So it was like experimental in pick up some of the sort of tropes of bands and drum, the drum machine was the big kind of change for us because it gave all of a sudden without having to, we never wanted a drummer because we were working in a loft, a space smaller than the studio we're in now. And so we couldn't, you know, it wasn't practical, three people in there. That room messing around with tape recorders was enough, but a drum machine sort of changed the world for us, really, in the sense it gave us a bit of some kind of structure and backbeat and backbone to what we were doing and that. sort of pushed it along a little bit, but we were never really a band. And all the way through, and I mean, you know, it doesn't take a musicologist to see continuity from then until now, and for, you know, the multiple collaborations and constant experimentation with whatever technology is available, and, you know... talking about modernist art movements, you know, you're still talking about Dada and all of those things. But, you know, you reached a point where it was pop music by the mid-80s, for example. Did you, at the beginning, have a sense of separation between high and low or pop and experimental? No, and that's the thing. I mean, I talked about where we saw ourselves and what we wanted to do in terms of creating, but our history was in, you know, popular music in its broadest term. I mean, Richard and I were both sort of soul boys back in the late 60s, early 70s. That's how we first met when we were really young, you know, sort of 14 years old, Richard and I first met. And we were, you know, we went to soul clubs. We went to see, you know, all the Motown bands and all that. So would this be what we know as the Northern Soul scene? No, that's what, there's always a mix up between Northern Soul. It's really, because Northern Soul only really happened around the late 70s. I mean. just a bit of kind of context for that was, I mean, Northern Soul was around the same time as punk and disco. What it, well, Northern Soul emerged from the, from the, the, the thing that, as soul music morphed into funk, a lot of people were purists and they missed that soul thing. And so they sought out all these obscure and often much more sort of harder, tougher sort of obscure sort of seven inches. And that became the soul movement. But it was Northern soul was more of a... response to funk and disco which you know the purists felt had softened the edges of that kind of sound and that movement so we had i had a lot of friends who from that early soul day who followed it into northern soul were quite a lot of friends who did that but oddly enough we moved into a path probably because we were into you know got discovered the velvets and roxy and you're really into bowie and things like that So we followed a path into that way. So punk was the thing. So not Northern Soul as such. I mean, I say I've got Northern Soul friends, but that was later than the Soul period. We're old school. I mean, I'm talking sort of, you know. going to see Stevie Wonder when, I think he was only 17 years old. When he was little Stevie Wonder. Yeah, when he was almost when he was little Stevie Wonder on those really early days. So this is really, you know, this is the kind of period when we first... What was your identity? Did you have a sense of identity around that? I mean, did you see it as a scene or was it just, that's the music we like and that's what we go and see? No, it was a scene I'm still friends with some of those people from that early soldiers. Obviously, Richard and I were kind of part of that. But also a guy called Mike Ward, who was in Floy Joy and still makes tons of music. He writes with Crooked Man. He's Barrett's kind of music writer. But yeah, Wardy and I still work together, and Wardy's still really active. But we came from a little kind of... We were only really young, 14, 15 years old, and it was sort of... we used to sneak into clubs and sort of overage clubs and, you know, pretend we were 18. We didn't have to, it was great. You didn't have to have an ID in those days. No one wears your ID. It was like no one carried ID. So if you looked tall enough and you kept a little bit of a moustache on you, you could get in, you know, so. But we were very much part of the same. We were into that. Was it connected to mods? I mean, how were you dressing and stuff? Yeah, we were part of that. I mean, we kind of linked in that. I mean, we used to go to the matches. We were skinheads as such, but not in the way skinheads are becoming. in the kind of stereotype it wasn't that it was it we emerged from that kind of mod suede head vibe so we had mohair suits and you know we had you know crombies and and all that kind of stuff and you know, we'd wear Royals or people who know this scene would know this, you know, but, you know, barter shoes and, you know, sort of two-tone and, you know, Ben Sherman button downs and Brutus button downs. We, you know, we used to go shoplifting, Nick and all that stuff. That's, I've still got mates who used to go shoplifting with when I was a kid in those days. So, you know. So, yeah, we were part of a little, it was a town scene, you know, we were young, so we'd spend all our time in the, you know, in the sort of pinball rooms and then sort of, you know, try and sneak in clubs on odd nights to listen to sort of soul music. I was Sheffield, that was the music, you know, that people were listening to. And speed was the drug. We did. Speed was something that, strangely enough, no, not for, well, it was, but Speed became the drug more around the punk period and, as you're saying, and Northern Soul, which is an interesting kind of bit of cultural history because we, I lost a few friends around that time, ones who'd kept that Northern Soul path on and, you know, you know. I mean, I have to say, you know, Judd from Clock DVA was a Northern, he was a bass player in Clock DVA and another friend, a really good friend, Russell Davey, who was a big person in that scene. I mean, they died because speed was the drug around that Northern Soul period. But then when that sort of tailed off, a lot of people got into heroin and we lost friends through, you know, through overdoses. Speed was a different thing when it was connected to Soul. But around the same period, we were into punk, so it was a different scene. So it wasn't all-nighters as much for us, but yeah, it was part of that, yeah. So what you were doing was essentially what we would recognise as club culture. It was your identity, it was where you forged your social links and everything. Oh, completely, yeah, completely. I mean, I think probably we moved away from it. Punk was the big sort of change. Not that we were specifically punk, but it changed the culture a little bit. And it moved it away from sort of that club, soul-y kind of disco-y thing and moved it more into live performance, you know, people gigging, things like that. But our roots were originally in that. That's why, you know, we slipped back into that. And also... Part of it obviously never left us, and that's why I knew you were talking about later we moved into more, you know, not pop music, but certainly more club music. That's because electro made complete sense to us, you know. When people in New York were starting to mess around with drum machines and sequencers and, you know, that kind of stuff, then that made complete sense to us because we saw, we could see our direct line from the old soul kind of period when we were into that. We never really lost it, but punk was the thing that opened and changed a lot of things for so many people. We were making electronic music in that period, but it gave us opportunities to do some of the things we were doing at that time, and labels, you know, Rough Trade, Factory Records, all those things started. So, yeah. There was a connection with all that. And the other big thread that was running through British pop culture at the time when you first started out was psychedelia. I mean, I'm guessing as skinheads you weren't that well predisposed to hippies. No, well, when I was at school there were two factions and I was in the incredibly small faction when I was like 13 years old, you know, because... The shift in school, when I was at school, was to, you know, they were called Blues Boys originally. The hippie stuff was tended to be more of a middle class thing. I mean, there were kids at school who were into Soft Machine and what have you, and some of the Americana that was probably coming out. But strangely enough, a lot of people... The other culture that exists along that was the origins of heavy metal. So it was more deep purple that people were into. So we were the counter to that and we were the soul boys in that early period, yeah. I mean, Sheffield never quite had the embrace of psychedelia in the way that, say, Liverpool did or Manchester. But the music that you started making when you did those tape experiments, and, you know, I mean, maybe you can say the same for Throbbing Gristle, who were in parallel around the same time, was mind-bending. Yeah, I think there was a... I think, I mean, I think there was a kind of desire and an intention to sort of really challenge people and warp and change people's perceptions. But perhaps, as you know, I've alluded to, perhaps there was a grittier, northern, more kind of working class notion to where we came from. The hippie thing always feels rather middle class and cheeseclothy for me. So we came from the idea of... Psychedelia is a part of it. Particularly visually as well. Even if the sounds that we were doing weren't the guitar type of psychedelia, visually it certainly was. Certainly a feel for that, you know, we were massively into the idea of, you know, when Andy Warhol did the exploding plastic inevitable. So the idea of really dark sort of psychedelia, I think we tend to think of psychedelia as rather sort of sunshiny, whereas there was a much darker side to it. And we were into that. And another band, one band that's strangely enough that we kind of related to around that time, and I know Lydon did, was we used to go and see, we used to go and see Hawkwind. But it was the visuals from Hawkwind that we were into because the guy was called Liquid Len. And he used to do these amazing sort of light films. That was the thing that, you know, we were into sort of the more art aspects of it. And so the visuals and the projections were the thing that we found fascinating, really. So we kind of, that was the bit of psychedelia that we picked up on. I think Hawkwind, there's a bit of retroactive appreciation of them now. It's starting to happen and you'll get people like the Norwegian Space Disco DJs doing Hawkwind edits and stuff now. But them and also Gong in the Steve Hillidge period especially, I sometimes think that they should be appreciated as our stooges or our can. Well, funnily enough, I mean, I did see, you know, Richard and I used to travel to gigs and we did see Can a couple of times in that sort of period. But also, we did see Gong. It actually put me off festivals probably for the rest of my life, but we went down. Kirky and I and a couple of other mates went down in a van with blacked out windows and went down to the Windsor Free Festival in about 1974 or something like that. Because it was a free festival and Gong were playing and we were kind of fascinated by Gong. I think what it was, I've got a funny feeling they might have had a VCS3. We were quite sort of like specific in our interest in things. If a band had a VCS3, we were like, well, we're going to go and check them out. And I think Gong sort of touched on that sort of interesting bit. So I remember going down to see them. This is one of the synthesizers that would make the... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you know. Tangerine Dream I'm going to see Tangerine Dream we were like I don't really like this hippie stuff but the gear the gear's good and the sounds are alright they're just not using it properly you know so yeah we did actually go and see Seagong you know there's a great there's a great Lester Bang's piece about Tangerine Dream where he's just like I think he just does a couple of Valium and goes and sees Tangerine Dream and he's just really interested in the lights on Yeah, you know, there was that connection to German music. I mean, that was the thing probably we, oddly enough, we were in the early days, we were drawn to the sort of, we were drawn to the, you know, the black urban music of America, of Detroit and Philly and, you know, whatever. But the other counterpoint to that was being interested in the German stuff. So we were interested in early Kraftwerk and going to see them in the very early days of them and Cannes. So there was a... Vale wanted to be James Brown. Yeah. Yeah, well, this is it. I mean, and the Caps did as well. I mean, there was that thing where it was weird and messed up. You know, we never lost that element of funk in what we did, even though... it's never really apparent, but because it's so lo-fi and messed up and unstructured, but we know we always had that kind of rhythmic kind of part of what we did. And so we never lost it. And, you know, I think that was Cannes appeal. They, they, they sort of mutated some of that American funk. I mean, Jackie leaves. It was like, for me, it was a God, you know, and Holger and all that there, the rhythm section was, you know So we saw that part of it as well, yeah. And did you see yourselves as forging an artistic movement? Did you actually kind of think, right, we are building something new here? No, I don't think so. I think we just thought we were sort of the fly in the ointment, to be quite honest. I think we just thought our main role was to be an irritant. I think there's only certain ways you can get attention and sometimes being rather brattish about it. And I think we were always brattish about it. I think the thing was, if we wanted anything, we wanted notoriety, not fame and success. we wanted just that notoriety. Everybody wants to have... some recognition and we've probably figured our our way of recognition was in it as in the dada thing and as in sort of ken kesey's pranksters or you know obviously fluxus there was that idea of if you annoy people you're going to get some recognition we're not going to we're not going to get people aren't going to notice us for our musicianship or proficiency or songwriting because we can't do that but we would do we thought we were doing something very different with the idea of attention to different things really and then punk came along and that became yeah there was a there was quite the thing yeah yeah that was it it was everybody did it yeah but we didn't do it with guitars and drums that was where punk always let us down in this we felt it was like well yeah all right you know your attitude and you know everything that punk stands for is really good but You're still playing bass, guitar, drums. You know, it's still within a rock format, really, which worked in certain occasions. But in other occasions, it was like we never saw ourselves connected with that at all. Did you, what about what became known as industrial? Did you feel any kinship when, you know, you started becoming aware of Coombe and Throving Gristle and these people? Yeah, I mean, I think Richard and I and, you know, and Chris as well would have always said that industry was something that was particularly... you know, for Throbbing Gristle. And it became a wider kind of banner, I think, for bands. So because of TG invented it, you know, it was them, Industrial Records and industrial, you know, stands for industrial people. And they captured that completely. But I think then people joined those dots towards us. So we were quite happy to have the connection. But in terms of the name. Because also there was a bit where it felt like it was an in-joke a little bit with TG. It was like, not in a bad way, but it was like, oh, we've actually created something and people can now go, it's called that. Genesis was nothing if not a good marketer. Oh, yeah, yeah, exactly. So he knew how to do that. So, you know, we paid our respects. I think obviously the thing sort of, not diluted, but mutated a little bit when it got a lot broader and then all the bands started coming along and they all got shoved into the industrial sort of thing. And we probably, we didn't particularly feel, we weren't against it, we didn't see all that kind of affinity. We felt a massive affinity with TG and those guys because we felt as though we were on a similar path. and massive respect to them as well but we probably didn't feel as connected or feel, you know, as though we had as much in common with some of the other bands like Skinny Puppy or whatever, or the brand, really, perhaps the brand. It became convenient, but music is always conveniently sort of categorised and you just accept that, really. Yeah, I mean, when it became Skinny Puppy and Frontline Assembly and all of those kind of things, it's a genre. And that's possibly, and that is probably, even though we weren't doing it that consciously, but that's why we moved back into electro because we were like, okay, well, we don't want to be sort of corralled into this sort of way this is going. So, you know, I've got no problem with Front 424, 242 and all those bands, but we were like, no, we want to... We actually, it's interesting what's happening with, on the other side of America, what's happening with the funk and with the electro. So... that's when we probably shifted. It was partly to probably distance ourselves a little bit from this industrial thing. It was a little bit too convenient for us because we were a band from Sheffield. It's like, oh, you're industrial. You come from an industrial city. We were like, no, we actually, there's more to us than that. And I think that's probably why we sort of shifted a little bit towards that and picked up some of those traits a little bit. But talking of Sheffield itself, I mean, around that time, did you feel part, because obviously what became Human League and Heaven 17 and Chak and all of these kind of things were starting to emerge. all of them in some regard had synthesizers, some element of funk, some element of conceptualism and dressing up and all the rest of it. Did you feel part of that? Yeah, I think, and that was a much looser association, I think. People weren't branding that quite as much. Because, you know, from that period, as well as them having a massive connection with, you know, the Sheffield bands, with, you know, with Cloak D. and the league and then, you know, Martin making, you know, starting Heaven 17. We had that connection. We had that affinity and we were, you know, we were friends and we were part of that Sheffield sound. I mean, Chuck, we released Chuck's first record. They were on double version. So, we, you know, still connected with those guys, you know, with Mark from Chuck who's obviously Maloco now. So we were connected with that. But the other bit of it as well in that history was, you know, I think you have to recognize what the pop group were doing, what Gareth and what Mark were doing. And that had an impact. They had an impact on... DVA really massively and also on the ratios so there was that sort of darker edgy sort of funk that was coming out you know another band at that time obviously manicured noise so there was this sort of like funk thing that was coming out of that period and I think that was that was something that we could also recognise, but it wasn't sort of tied up in a bow as much as the industrial thing, so it was kind of nice to have bits of those things in there. Yeah, I think the legacy of the pop group and Rit Rig and Panic between them is going to only be more and more appreciated as time goes on. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. And, you know, the stuff Gareth started doing later with Sean, Sean Oliver, with God and Rit Rig and all those So, yeah, I mean, yeah, there was, so the Bristol thing was kind of part of it a little bit as well. And also some of the, you know, the stuff that was coming out of, you know, New York a little bit as well. So that was kind of part of that thing. I think we felt, you don't feel smart, but you kind of go. That's where it's really starting to get interesting, and the rhythmic side of it was very interesting. That's always the part that's fascinated me. So, yeah, we were drawn to that. And then expanding out of that, you have what's broadly called post-punk, which incorporates everything from New Order to Public Image to Skritti Politti. Again, was there a sense of kinship? Did you kind of feel, all right... there's something going on that we are part of on a national scale. Yeah, and also I think by this time we'd sort of signed to some bizarre, and so we were not only, the kinship was a reality as well, you know, we were actually on the same label as some of these people, and also I kind of split my time between London and Sheffield at that time, so we were... We're close friends with those. It's funny, actually, coming up, I was coming up from Brighton on the train this morning when I was getting a coffee. The people in the coffee stall at the front of the station were playing Rip It Up and Start Again and Blamonge Track, and I was thinking, wow, wow. The last 30 years have never happened, you know, it was really funny. And they were singing along and I was thinking, well, I really, you know, and I knew those people, obviously, knew Edwin and knew, you know, knew Zeke as well. So Zeke's still kicking around from Orangeview. So there was a friendship and there was a, you know, there was a camaraderie. I think we, I think we have to, I think you have to remember that I think pop music in particularly in the last sort of 20, 30, 20-odd years of the Simon Cowell-isms and Stockake and Watermans of that kind of thing. But there was some things that were happening within popular music that were really good. And public image were part of that as well, just as much as, you know, orange juice were part of it. it didn't feel as though you could make music that you felt was reaching out and being accessible without losing every element that you'd had before. So you could keep that edge, that darkness, the tape bits and all that, but, you know, in any group. pushes forward a little bit so there was interesting popular music at that time that was going on so you know so it was fine I mean kind of the high golden era I guess is 79 to 81 for all of that stuff it was like the charts were full of incredible exploratory stuff two tomes going on you know it was just like felt like a real interesting time for cross-fertilization. Yeah, people like Dennis Bavell was right at the heart of a lot of that, you know. He was working with the pop group, with Ryuichi Sakamoto. Yeah, I mean, Dennis worked with, yeah, and worked with Edwin as well. So there was, you know, it was fascinating, all that, you know. And Manchester, and obviously we were connected with Factory, and obviously New Order, we were close with those guys. So it was kind of, at that point, I think you felt like you were sort of probably pushing things out a little bit from the experimental thing was annoying. You started to go, well, it is, you know. it's probably we're making that annoying bit into something that probably is reaching a little bit further by changing a few things in the way we approached it. But I think we certainly felt at that time, in that post-punk period, there was something that allowed you to sort of enjoy it without feeling as though you were compromising your artistic integrity, shall I say. And we still did the films and we still did all the gigs and it was all still really edgy. It still all had an edge to it. We didn't lose any of that. Yeah. Now, the really fascinating period for me that I have been learning a lot about recently, so I've been doing the research for this book on sound system culture that I've just done. And so from that era, the people I spoke to were youth, Dennis, Bavell, Adrian Sherwood. And what is interesting is that period between, say, 1982, when pop kind of took a turn for the glossy and we landed with what we think of as 80s pop, Duran Duran and U2 and all this kind of stuff dominating. And then 87, 88, when dance culture as we know it kind of exploded and everything that leads us to Resident Advisor and so on. But that period from 82 to 87 is kind of undocumented. Like, rare groove was really interesting and these kind of rare groove sound systems where people were bringing reggae sound system culture but playing American funk. and electro and hip-hop and learning to scratch and all these kind of things together. I mean, what did you feel about club culture and underground culture of that period, that mid-'80s period? Well, funny enough, I was thinking, just as you were saying it, I was thinking about that because obviously I was living in London, still working in Sheffield and still had a house in Sheffield, but I was down in London, so... I experienced both sides of that. And that's where Phil and I, Phil from Tongue, who's in Wrangler and Creepshow, that's where Phil and I, that's our roots. You know, we were massive, you know, we're really into that kind of funk and loose ends and that electro and all that. kind of stuff that brought into a lot of gay music you know gay kind of electro music so we were really into that and I think that was kind of an interesting period there was some some kind of strange things going on in that period so um and it was really interesting and obviously you know you mentioned it I mean Tackhead and everything like that um and again these were you know Adrian we worked with Adrian Adrian produced code. So we, I thought there was some, it was nice for us. We were in a position to tap in and connect with some of those things. So I thought it was, but yeah, we were, that's what we were doing. I mean, I, you know, we were going to a lot of those clubs. I used to go out in the wag club on Saturday nights and all this kind of stuff and go to the warehouse parties and fill dirt box and go used to go to all the dirt box stuff So those were the things that we were doing. I mean, they were some of the very first London Warehouse parties. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Pre even Norman Jay. Oh, yeah. We used to go to Battlebridge Road because I was good friends with Dave Durrell, you know. So we were really connected. You know, it was kind of connected. with all that scene and those were the parties we used to go to so particularly in London I would always be at the Dirtbox sort of that's the original you know for me Dirtbox is the original rave scene and also it was a nice time to be in London because I know it's a bit of a prior now but you know rightly for some things of Hamburg Ken Livingstone's London was great you know I mean, I remember going to see things like Urban Sax. There just used to be big events, you know, just mad events going on. London was quite a vibey place to be able to sort of connect with at those times. a mutoid waste was going on, all these things. So, you know, there was kind of, so we didn't differentiate. You know, you go to, you know, you go to sort of Dave Durrell's club at the YMCA, underneath the YMCA at Tottenham Court Road, and you go to a mutoid waste thing, and you go to a dirt box thing in those periods. So there was kind of, there was, that there for me are the roots of. of, you know, that kind of London underground scene. I see the connection there with what, you know, then Danny and Jenny were doing at Shoe. So it existed already, if you know what I mean. This is exactly what has kind of become apparent. It's like, you know, people think, oh, everyone took this magic pill and suddenly it was like black and white and gay and straight all dancing under one roof. But it was like, it was there in the warehouse parties. And, you know, I talked Jumping Jack Frost, who grew up as a young rude boy in South London, but he was going to the gay clubs and going to high energy nights and listening to disco and all the rest of it. you know, it's only a step forward to rage at Heaven with drag queens and, you know, junglists dancing next to each other. I mean, because also, I mean, somewhere like Heaven was also a big part of that early scene. I mean, Final Solution used to do their gigs there. we used to go to gigs at Heaven and so even though it was ostensibly a gay club there were nights which were very much open to people going down so we used to go to those things and didn't have you know we just going out was going out and I think you know I have to say I'm somebody I don't do it, you know, I still go out, not as much as I used to, but I, you know, I was, we used to do those things. And then when, and obviously the other side of it was up in Sheffield. So we got Jive Turkey and we got Winnie and Parra. And so we had all the events that they were doing and the nights that they were doing, you know, at the back of the occasions and also. you know, down when they used to run the city, you know, the city underneath the city or ballroom. And, you know, so, you know, and Winnie and Parrot, we used to take Winnie and Parrot on tour with us and they used to DJ for us. We, we, in that period we didn't want support acts we would show a film and have Winnie and Parrot playing you know that was that was just like oh we can't be bothered with somebody turning up with a drum kit now let's show a film and have Winnie and Parrot DJing for us that was way more fun so that's a good nice out yeah I mean, I want to get on to the sort of longevity of those Sheffield guys in a minute. But I mean, you know, the big looming thing at that point, though, is Acid House. And like, did you immediately gravitate to certain strands of Acid or Techno? Because there's stuff that we can hear now in your new tracks that have carried all the way through from 89. Yeah, I mean, and to be quite honest, the album that I just did was really wanting to do that. I've come through so many different periods of music. And it's really funny. You can't do everything. And I thought, that period meant a lot to me. The early Chicago and the early Detroit stuff and some of the electro stuff also that had come out in New York. And obviously we were working with John Robey and later I got to do work with Bam, with Bambarta. So I was drawn to that period, but also, you know, the Acid House stuff. I mean, I've still got it somewhere. I've got my membership for Spectrum. I think it's like number 43 or something. And, you know, I was, you know, I was lucky. I didn't go to the very... first couple of nights but I went down to you know down to the you know Shume when it was in the in the fitness center in the aerobic center and you know and those nights because I kind of knew all those people I was a bit of you know London stuff so you know I'd go down with Rutherford and Paul Rutherford and Wiley and knew all those kind of guys so The actual scene was really interesting, but I think musically I was always drawn to the electronic elements of that. So therefore, you know, the big records were when, you know, the first time you hear Strings of Life or the first time you hear, you know, the Acid Tracks and those sorts of things. you know, Marshall Jefferson's The Truth and all those kinds of things. That sort of summed it up because it had that, it had a minimalism, it had an edge to it. It wasn't, it was based around machines and technology, but it had such a groove and such a move to it. So I've always been drawn to that. And I think there's also a beautiful simplicity about how that music was made. And that's what I was kind of into. That's what I captured. So it was like, I wanted to do that, just keep the simplicity. That simplicity, because in that period, that's what I was massively drawn to, really. And also the lights and the duration and being packed in a dark space with all these moving bodies. I mean, did that speak to kind of the... early experimental ideas of discombobulation and getting people out of their minds. Yeah, completely. I mean, you know, and also there's something nice about, you know, I've got, you know, the great accelerant in music has been drugs and it's often the thing that's never talked about and I'm, you know, you've got to be careful because I'm not there condoning drugs and where drug culture is now. what it's become is scary. But there's this part of drug culture, which is forever inextricably linked to music and particularly club culture. And it's always been a catalyst in club culture. And it's been part of the enjoyment and fun of it. I mean, alcohol as well. has as well but so those things are really important I think you just have to be you know you have to be wary of you know where those things go and the consequences and you know obviously I'm no saint but at the same time you know I think if it's I accept it's always been part of that and I've been part of it as well so you know I've come out the other end if you don't mean but it is it is it is part of it is part of that and part of that is part of drugs is to, music is always, should be experiential. It should be something that... changes you and changes you, you know, for the good and brings things out in you. So, and I think, you know, always clubbing was always part of that change in your experience, you know, and it still is today. I spoke to some of my students who've just been, you know, go down to Corsica Studios and go, I've just seen, you know, just seen, you know, so they're transformed by it. I think club music is all, and those spaces in which it happens transform people it should be a kind of transformative experience yeah and it's one of the reasons that you know we're still fascinated by the history of these different iterations of it because this is part of human society but you know as far as we know cavemen were like having raves in their stone circles or you know at least carnivals in which different tribes came together and had commerce and had spirituality and all the different things that go on around a carnival event so the more we know about the different versions of it the more we can hopefully come up with other new good ones yeah i mean and that's it it's part of the it's part of it's part of the human it's part of human nature to experience the ecstatic and i don't mean ecstasy as in the drug ecstasy in mdma I mean, the fact that there's a connection with people, you know, it explains religion and cults and tribalism in some ways. Music is the more acceptable form as far as I'm concerned, but it does bring that collective experience. You know, sport's the same thing. People need a collective shared experience as part of their life, not continually. I think it's where it goes wrong and you lose. lose sight of what it's for but I think as humans we do need that ecstatic and collective experience music is part of it the origin of the word the Greek ecstasis is stepping outside of yourself that's literally the meaning of it and then we fight this constant battle between genuine collective experience and some ego monster up behind the decks taking control of it and becoming a you know breeding new messiahs and you know just kind of tyrannical club regimes But did you follow club culture as it kind of mutated through techno? Actually, no, the first thing I wanted to ask about that techno era was, were you aware of a Sheffield clang? Because Winston talks about the Sheffield clang. Yeah, yeah. And did you kind of feel part of that? Yeah, I mean, you know, the history of that sort of scene, I mean... I mean, originally there was Fon Records, the little record shop, which is actually, you know, a lot of kind of Adrian stuff on you, Sam. That was their kind of scene, music coming out of there. But you then Warped Records and everything and what Robert was doing, what Robert and Winnie were doing with Forge Masters. And it was, and that was, you know, that was also connected to the Fon Studios, the original Fon Studios. in the Wicca. And, you know, I used to record down there. We used to meet. That's where I met Cobby, actually. He was, I think Cobby, that's where I met Steve Cobby. He was, he was Rodium for Bomb the Bass and he suddenly turned up in, he suddenly turned up in the Fon Studios when he was a kid, really young. and that, that and Western Works, our studio, were the kind of homes of that. But obviously Fon later became really the source of some of that whole kind of warp scene, really. But yeah, I mean, I was going backwards and forwards between London and Sheffield, but I never lost my connection to that, and I was very aware of it. And it was also nice to see that other, like another generation. It was fun, really. It was fun, you know, what they were doing, those guys, with Robert and Mark doing the fond force and Winnie. all those guys so it was really interesting yeah I mean that was transformational for me I was 16 when Dexterous and LFO and all those tracks came out and it was just like that was the thing that was like okay this is our stuff now this is like our generation's music whatever But, you know, Winston talks about that Yorkshire bass sound as resonating the sounds of the hammers of the steel factories clanging across the seven hills of Sheffield. Yeah, all the bleep stuff and all the, you know, which, you know, Parra and Richard captured in the Sweet Exorcist stuff was really good and obviously, you know, Unique 3 and LFO. And it started to be that. I think it was just a pure sound. I don't think it was ever sort of... sort of constructed really specifically. I think there was just, it's part of your nature in that, you know, it wasn't contrived. That was the word I was looking for. It wasn't a contrived thing, but I think there was a notion of those sounds that were just pure and it just kind of seemed to generate it something. So once it started, that whole bleep thing kind of generated itself. So, yeah. And I mean, that bass, the sub bass of that. kind of then resonated straight away it was sampled on a dozen hardcore records and you would hear the bass from LFO and then you could hear it like week by week rolling through into what became Jungle and then all the other forms of rave music and did you kind of follow the different electronic music scenes as it then you know 93, 94 splintered into Trance and Hard Bag and yeah well I mean The thing was, I was into music and we made music, but I didn't DJ, but I used to buy a lot of records. I used to live around the corner from Jazzy M's when he was on. Fulham Road so I used to go down there every week or so and just see what the imports were but I was kind of quite eclectic in the things I got so I was you know because I love music so you know they play something oh yeah I want that I want that so I actually was starting to pick up you know really as well as sort of New York kind of garagey stuff as well as the early sort of bits that were coming through of drum and bass as well as you know all the bits and pieces starting to come probably kind of feeling like I suppose it was the early Richie Horton stuff that was coming through, the new sound of Detroit at that time in that early period. I loved all that stuff as well. So I was picking up all those things, but quite eclectic in the sense that some of it would be from, because they were just important stuff. So I saw no difference between a Chicago record and a Detroit record and a London record because it was like, oh, this is really cool. You know, I liked all that. that I used to get a lot of records from Jazzy M's as well as Black Market. So I was just listening to it all, but without any... because I wasn't DJing, it was nice because it wasn't like, oh, well, I have to have that record because it goes with that record. I was like, I just like that record, I'll have it. You know, so that was, so I was picking up on, you know, I was listening to all of that. And then in the sort of mid-90s, I moved to Australia and that's when it became quite interesting for me. I mean... I mean, I suppose people think I disappeared, but I didn't. It was actually, I was massively connected to that because I had a radio show, a weekly radio show. And Australia was very popular for traveling, you know, for acts and DJs, both from America and the UK. And they always used to come in, you know, just have everybody in on my show. So I never missed out on anything. So, you know, I had, you know. Jurassic 5, Grandmaster Flash, Mr. Scruff, Left Field, Ray and Christian, anybody who was in town used to come and do the show with me. So I actually kept, maintained that kind of interest. You had a sort of inside-outside kind of an overview of what was happening from outside, I guess. Yeah, and at that point... as well as writing and as well as, I mean, I was a radio producer. I produced a lot of arts and talk shows as well. But it also meant, because I got lots of records and I used to import vinyl for record stores, I didn't DJ all the time and had quite a lot of residency. So in that period, I was actually probably more music-centric in terms of club culture. and electronic stuff because I was DJing a lot and DJing in Melbourne and Sydney and everything. So it was interesting. I sort of, and I promoted as well. So I, you know, first gig, first gig I did, what was the first gig? Oh, bloody hell, Derek Delage, wasn't it? I think so. Yeah, I did a Waller sound night, which was nice because I did, the first night was actually. Sorry, I'm digressing here. I'm rambling on. But I mean, the first thing I did was Rhythm Digital. That was the first night I promoted, actually. so which was great you know did you ever guess he'd be producing Madonna a few years later no but I saw him actually I mean I stayed you know we kind of bumped into each other because I put him on a bigger gig you know like about four years later and he'd just done that and yeah it was really funny because yeah he was going on about that so yeah it was funny I never expected that but yeah yeah top one so yeah So I stayed connected with lots of kind of music. And I ended, you know, it was really, because I was in, people used to say, oh, you know, would you DJ for us? So I used to play with lots of bands and with lots of acts that came through. Just play on the bill to earn some money. So I stayed connected to it, strangely enough. Was there any plan at this point? I mean, you know, did you, were you sort of going, cabs is what? Is the main thread to what you do or were you kind of thinking, I need to settle down a bit and do the more academic and the more day job stuff? No, I've always been... been quite rubbish at sort of that kind of thing and I can't I can't not do that I mean I did I mean I had my own record label over there and I used to do gigs and promote and I did but I basically I used to do what I could to maintain my sort of connection and be able to still do music really so No, I don't think I've ever settled down. It feels like it now because in all that madness of everything I was doing, I did teach and I did write my PhD and I do sort of teach down at Brighton and teach sound art and digital, you know, down there. So it appears as though I've kind of... I'm more established or at least I've settled down. But I still do everything I do. I don't think I've ever changed really. So do you ever sort of see phases in what you did or was it just a constant flow of all these different things? I think there have been phases and I think also... I think it's also how the phases have also been how I've responded to the changes that have happened culturally and musically. I think, and also growing older, obviously, certain things do. I mean, so I think we each have to respond to things as things change. It was like adapting to that particular world and that circumstance, but it's how do, it was always how. how can I still maintain the creative side of making music and doing those things whilst, you know, putting food on the table? And so there's also, so as things change, much as I would love to say I shaped everything in my own world, my own world, you know, the world shaped me as much as anything else. So it was great. I DJed when vinyl was king, you know. And I still DJ, but it's like I shifted to other things, I think, as certain things became a little bit harder. You know, running a label was great and bringing music out was obviously a lot harder when, you know, when vinyl and CDs go and everything. So you have to adapt. I couldn't change that world. We've gone into a very different kind of world now. And so the world... as it is, is me trying to contextualise what I do in very much a digital online streamed world. And part of it is massively critiquing it because I don't like all of it. But it's also, it's my response to that world, but still making music as our respondents in whatever way I can. But that clearly provides you inspiration. I mean, you've certainly not dried up at any point in terms of actually getting tracks out there. No, I do. I mean, I love it and I love all aspects of sound. I mean, the nice thing is working at Brighton, which is the stuff I'm involved in there is much more abstract and it is much more kind of sound design and much more installation art and gallery stuff. and and things like that so that's nice because i still do my own stuff but i'm still open to much a much more kind of, not avant-garde, but certainly a more interesting and developing way of where sound is going. So I kind of, I make music, but I'm also involved in the bigger world of sound as it is. So I find that quite interesting now at the moment. Do you feel like the formal avenues, as it were, between experimental club culture electronics and... and the art world are more open now. I mean, I talked to the Warp guys recently, and, you know, through the 21st century, through the video directors they work with, through the people like One O' Tricks Point, Never, through all these artists, you know, it's just natural for them to be in the Museum of Modern Art in New York or the Tate Modern or wherever it might be. I mean, does it feel like those structures have changed in the last couple of decades? I think there's always... I think it has, but I think in some ways there's always been that connection with contemporary... music and and the more kind of i suppose contemporary art world i think contemporary art was always wanted to recognize music you know craftwork of obviously an example of how they that they've incorporated their aesthetic into a into more of an arts world but i also think I also think from the other side, I think the interest is also the breadth of what sound means and what can be done with sound. I think sound as a medium is the last area, not last area, but it's the area that's being explored a lot more. And so I think that I find it really interesting how... how, you know, things like sonification and, I mean, the guys that I work with, you know, they create, you know, they write their own kind of program and do their own stuff. So I think there's an interesting fusion of experience. Technology has kind of made that form of experimentation a lot more interesting and allows it to... reach into that world a lot more. So, but without losing some of the sort of, not commercial, but at least it's appealed, you know, sound feels a lot more appealing. I think it's also in part that as, you know, CDs and vinyl and that content thing is eroded. I know people buy records now and that's great. It's really good, but. I think it's probably meant that people who want to do things with sound are challenging how they can use that. And so therefore, you know, making multi-speaker events or, you know, how they creatively use Ableton and all those things. So I think it's... I think it's sort of the technology starting to shape how people do it and it's making it a bit more arty, which is really nice. It is exciting and I think it actually does feel like a new corner has been turned or is being turned because around the late 90s when digital audio workstations and Pro Tools first came in, there was a sense for a electronic music of too much possibility and people not really, you know, not having the constraints of one drum machine and one synth. And a lot of people felt that electronic music was losing its way or kind of splurging, losing its identity. But finally now, that kind of extreme sound manipulation technology is... accessible enough and understood enough so that cultures are actually starting to emerge from that now. Yeah, and you know, when you've got people like Steve Goodman doing Code 9 and Hyperdub and everything like that, then they represent that collision of those worlds, and that's where I think it's really interesting. And I also think... It feels like it's allowed electronic music to grow up. We were talking about the hedonistic side of it earlier on, the club culture, but I think part of the collateral that comes with that is that people regard it as hedonistic and it isn't smart or intellectual or can have those ideas placed within it or used. it but you know people you know people like code nine allow you know a proof that are obviously proof that you can fuse those things it is intelligent and people who are doing it are smart and the things that they're trying to do are really smart as well so you know and this You know, there's so many cool things going on. You know, I work with some of the Outland people and obviously some of the more experimental, the supersonic stuff that's going on, mad festivals, and what John Doran's done with Weird Britain and some of those things that are electronic. I just think this has just gone off. It's just gone off into fractals now. Completely. And I think those are interesting. And, you know, a lot of the kind of globalization of electronic music, you know, you've got these guys from Indonesia and from Shanghai and from Angola using quite extreme electronic. production and stuff that can be blasted out of the speakers in Berghain but is also examining intellectual ideas and identity and all of those sort of things in ways that I don't think anyone foresaw 15 years ago. And Berlin has been very significant in this because Berlin is kind of where a lot of those the Venn diagram overlaps in the sense that it's very much a centre of sound art, it's also a centre of club culture. And places like, you know, Berghain Funcast and all that are using those spaces for, they're allowing those spaces to be used for interesting things. And so that's just pushed that whole scene along. So it's just shown so many possibilities. So I don't know where it goes. The challenge is to take it away from old white guys like us. Yeah, exactly. And it's less scene-based. It's less sort of like, oh, I meant, you know. it's this type of sort of style or genre of music. It's not. That genre thing has kind of gone in some way. So it's just, and it's also become more about the experience of seeing that because as buying the record has gone, it's gone down to experiencing the sound and the music and the event. So that's where those interesting sort of things overlap. And obviously Berlin. has pushed a lot of those things. And that's where a lot of the great lessons of the past in terms of the experimental happenings that you would do in the 70s or sound system culture or rave culture, you know, they bring these lessons of being there in the moment next to speaker stacks or next to the film presentation or whatever. and they become still relevant. I mean, I said I wanted to talk about the longevity of Sheffield. Like, people like Winston, Parrot, are still making, like, the music of their lives. What is it in the water in Sheffield that, like, gets people, you know, into their 50s and 60s making great electronic music? I don't know, because as soon as... I always continually think about some of the stuff that Parrot says, so... Because, you know, we talk about it like this way, but if Parrot was here, he'd go, it's all rubbish, it's fucking rubbish. It's all fucking dead, mate. You know what I'm about? But he can't stop doing it because he loves it and he's really good at it. And underneath it all, there's this massive passion and belief in what he does. And I love that. And Winnie's obviously, you know, all over the place and still DJing and pipes and everyone. So I think it's also in part that... you know, people, I think they're aware that there's respect for them. And I think there's, I think, I think it's nice that they still go, oh, okay, I can still do it. Yeah, it's all right. I mean, you know, Parrot's just done those brilliant mixes for Roche, for Roisin, and he doesn't stop. So he's still, he's got it, basically. It's something they've got and you can't lose it. you know, I mean, he doesn't really, that's the only thing, Parrot likes making music, he doesn't really play, I mean, Crooked Man stuff was brilliant, but I mean, there's been no gigs, but he's also, I don't know, there's just something about those guys, I mean, Parrot's the only person I know, he's, I mean, all the singers that he finds, he finds them usually in the post office, you know, I'm not joking, you it's something, and Mick Ward, obviously, and Phil, who's the engineer, so they all, they just, they'll moan about it, but they can't stop doing it, you know. I think you've got to put this into a Sheffield context. It's like, it's not people jumping around really excited about what they're doing. They're just like, oh, I better... bloody do this answer really, you know. So there's a necessity to it, shall I say. I've spoken to Todd Letty at some length about this because obviously, you know, he is like... I was going to say, because Todd has sort of made sure, it's people like that have made sure that its relevance is still there, yeah. Yeah, he's a true enthusiast. He's like trying to drag these guys out. They're just going, that's right, shit, mate. Yeah, yeah. I mean, do you feel, because, you know, like you say, your newest solo album references that old house music and a bit of the Sheffield clang, you know, do you feel like that's kind of your folk culture almost? Oh, it is, yeah. I mean, that's probably why I wanted to make that record, because it's probably the time, I'm not saying it's the time I was most happy, but... the time when I felt some of those all those things kind of aligned a little bit it was those weird sounds it was the sort of the fact that it wasn't tied to kind of proper music structures but it was also machinery it was also rhythmic it was all those things and I think there was a night I think it was also that period I felt there was a naivety about about it that had the naivety of our early days when cabs were experimenting, but it was kind of able to work with boxes that made a little bit of sense of that naivety and that experimentation. So I think that's why I wanted to do that. And also for me, because I'm very, you know, obviously the voice is kind of significant for me and I always, you know, I've always used the voice. It's an instrument for me. I feel that type of music is a way I can use my voice in a kind of sample-y played way that doesn't compromise how I use the voice. Without intentionally being noodley or, oh, I'm going to be a bit avant-garde or experimental. I kind of captured those, I wanted to capture that vibe in a period that I felt was doing it, but had that groove to it. You know, we talked about my writing and pitch, but my research and everything I've written is about rhythm. I'm just fascinated by rhythm. You know, the stuff I've written is all about Chicago and about Detroit and about Dusseldorf and about Sheffield. So in some ways, that Um Dada was kind of like a record of what I'm into and what I've written about and what my research. So it felt like a natural fit to do something within that kind of style, really. And it leaps out. I mean, you know, it's a danceable record. You know, I very much, you know, you can picture people dancing when you hear it. So, you know, obviously it's not a dry academic exercise. No, I think you got, you know, I'm not daft, but I don't, you know, nobody wants to sort of hammer down sort of, you know, either an academic or an overtly intelligent thing. I mean, I think all the people I've mentioned, all the people I've talked about here and all the people I've known are incredibly smart and intelligent, perceptive and understanding people. but I don't think any of them will want to be seen as pretentious, nor would I, and I think there's a danger sometimes of being a little bit pretentious, a little bit smart-arse. And so I think that was it. It's being clever, but not being sort of intentionally smart-arse. Yeah, I mean, nothing that... Code 9 does would be would be worth the tinker's toss if he wasn't shelling down the rave on a regular basis no that's it I mean this is it I mean he's making incredibly you know people like that make incredible they're very clever people and you know the proof is in the pudding yeah but they make you know amazing sounds you know so that's that's it yeah totally um And finally, I mean, if you got, you know, you don't plan massively ahead. Have you got projects that you want to, you're looking forward to now? Um... Well, I suppose my plate's a little bit, the thing is my plate's a little bit, not full, I'm saying, but, you know, we have got Creepshow and the Wrangler stuff, and I have to say, I mean, that's, I enjoyed working, doing the record, which I did with Benj, a massive shout out in respect to Benj, but I mean, I did, I wrote all the stuff, you know, originally all the, everything was written just at home by was made with, you know, I made that, the Um Dada with Benj and so, and I love working with those guys. It was great that he was supportive and sort of worked with me on, on my, on this Um Dada album. But The Wrangler, I love working with, I love working with Benj and Phil and I love doing the Creepshow stuff because John's brilliant. but I love working with those guys so I'm in the new Wrangler album situation I think all of us I quite happily if I never made another record again after a situation even though I'm proud of everything I've done the new Wrangler album is something I'm massively proud of and I think it really kind of nails sort of so much of everything that we've done where we are and everything so I'm really happy with that but I don't know actually I think The thing is, I was talking about this yesterday to someone, it's like, I don't say no to anything. I think it was Andy Weatherall said, somebody asked him why he kept doing stuff, and he went, well, you keep doing it because you're really worried that one day someone won't ask you to do something. And I'm a little bit like that, so... The next thing, I don't know what the next thing I'm going to do because I'm probably waiting for somebody to ask me to do it and then I'll be really excited about it.
