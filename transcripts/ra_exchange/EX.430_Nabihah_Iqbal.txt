Inside the darkest jungle, beneath the moonlight sand When you are sleeping softly, your dream will take you there Inside the darkest jungle, beneath the moonlight sand Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week on the Exchange, Christine Kikari speaks with Nabiha Iqbal. the producer, songwriter and NTS host from London. Over the past five years, Iqbal released a series of EPs as Throwing Shade, mining an intriguing left-field sound for labels like Ninja Tune and No Pain in Pop. But at the tail end of last year, Iqbal dropped the moniker and released an album under a given name for the first time. It marked the beginning of a new era for an artist who has achieved much more than releasing great records. In this conversation, we hear of Iqbal working as a human rights lawyer in South Africa, her time completing an MPhil in African history, and her ongoing interest in ethnomusicology, which has helped define her long-running show on NTS. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Nabiya Iqbal is up next. ♪ Together, we share ♪ ♪ A vision ♪ You're in Berlin at the moment and you just performed at Berghain in the Zoiler space. And I believe you're saying it's your first time in Berghain. Yeah. How was that show? How was that space for you? Well, it was amazing. I mean, I've heard so much about that club from, you know, all my friends who've been there as well. party as we've been there performing and so I felt like it was a pretty big deal so then to get invited to play there felt good and obviously it was my first time in the club as well so it's a nice first way to experience it all and now I understand what all the fuss is about because it was amazing yeah the sound system is just incredible I think it's the best sound system that I've experienced in a club because it just like puts the music right in your body, you know, so loud, but so clear. And also, I was really impressed with the range of non-alcoholic drinks on offer. Well, what did you go for? That's something that stood out to me. They had banana juice. Oh, that's some nasty business. Oh, you don't like it? It's not for me. But they have a lot of other fantastic non-alcoholic. Did you try Club Marta? Yeah, that's like a given every time I come to Germany. Yeah. What was your, because unfortunately I wasn't able to make it, like how, what was your set like? How did you build it? How did you progress through it? What was the kind of sensibility of it, I suppose? Well, it was quite different to every other DJ set that I've ever played. Obviously, you know, being invited to play at... a techno club like berghain and then um looking at the lineup and seeing like what the sort of direction of the night might be i was quite excited because it's nice to be invited to play at a place that has that aesthetic because i really do love a lot of techno music and electronic dance music and house and stuff like that but i've never really played a set before where it's like focusing just on you know techno like that sort of stuff because maybe other times they get booked because of like my nts radio show which has a more eclectic vibe to it so for this one I was just went in hard I think like just playing all the tunes that I love listening to um and sometimes in other sets I'll like drop one or two of them but on Friday I could just play all of them in a row and it was really good yeah so I built it you know I was doing the opening set from midnight till 2 30 so obviously I started from like a completely empty dance floor but one thing that really struck me about Berghain which I haven't really seen anywhere else is that when people come in and even though they're the first people they just come right to the front and they just start dancing there's no there's no hanging around really So that was quite nice because I started quite chilled, but then I saw that people were really up for it. So then I just was like, all right, let's just start with bangers and keep going. Full throttle. Yeah. Well, that's a nice little segue, I guess, into your radio show that you do for NTS. And I believe you've been doing it for quite a few years now. Yeah, five years, over five years. Okay. And how did that come about? Because I believe it kind of coincided with around the time you started putting out music. Is that right? Yeah. It's like it's coming up to five years now of doing all of that sort of stuff. Just serendipity, really. I mean, I went on NTS radio the first time as a guest on somebody else's show. And it just so happened that the station manager was listening at the time and he really liked what I was doing. So I went in and I took a bunch of tunes that I discovered whilst I was studying ethnomusicology at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. And that whole process really broadened my horizons in terms of listening to music from around the world and appreciating different kinds of sounds. So I was sharing some of those tunes on the radio. And then I guess, you know, it's quite niche. No one else was doing it. I think still really no one else is doing it in the same way on the station. So they offered me my own show from that. And I was like, cool. And that's it, yeah. I celebrated my 100th show earlier this year. Congratulations. Thanks. Yeah, I like playing music from all around the world and just sharing different sounds that I come across that I'm enthusiastic about and I hope other people will appreciate as well. Yeah. Like when you're exploring all of these different types of sounds and origins of sounds, are there particular things that you're drawn to? Like is it... percussion or is it like chord progressions have you picked up any kind of patterns in what appeals to you I think it's hard to say about you know specific patterns of things that appeal to me especially when I'm thinking about all the different musics that I enjoy listening to from different parts of the world because there's just so much variety But I think that's what I appreciate about it the most. And not just even listening to the sounds, but also, you know, researching where that music comes from, what the instruments are made of, how they're made. What's the significance of that type of music to the people, like within the cultural context of where it comes from. It's all really, you know, as a music lover, it's just fascinating, really, because, you know, here in the West, we listen to music because we love it. And, you know. we'll go to a gig or we'll go to a club and we'll feel those feelings that we get from music that we don't get from anything else. But beyond that, I guess there's, you know, that's where, beyond that, we don't really, I feel like we listen to music for music's sake mostly. But then when you look at the role of music in other communities from different countries, it's interesting to see what music means for them. So like music as a healing force, like trance inducing, like spiritual, getting you closer to God or whatever, or trying to invoke specific weather for this harvest season, things like that. And so then you start thinking about music in a much more integrated way, you know, that it's much more part of your life, all aspects of it. Yeah, I want to delve into your area of study. But I think as like a first like kind of top line question, because I often think about this idea, particularly in our sort of scenes, like within pockets of like club music culture or DJ culture, and this idea of rare music and... fetishizing particular sounds and where the border lays rather between genuine appreciation or something a little bit more problematic. So I don't know, like kind of with your academic background, do you think that, I don't know, would it be fair to say that there's a responsibility for people to learn more about the music or learn more about the origins of the people who made the music if it's not of their culture? For sure. I think it's really important because, you know, learning about each other leads to greater understanding, which leads to greater acceptance. And that's, for me, that's the most important thing in life, really, you know, just people being chilled and just, you know, realising that we're not really that different from each other. And so there is a fine line. And for me... I guess, you know, coming at this as like a female person of colour, I have an inherently different stance to, let's say, like a white male from Europe who's presenting this music to other people. I don't know. I mean, I don't know what it feels like to be a white European male because I'm not one. But there's definitely instances where I think, What's that person's line of thought? What are they doing? Or, you know, other things like, well, just one example is that once I played this field recording of these Congolese miners working in a mine in West Africa, made by Hugh Tracy, who is a British ethnomusicologist who made loads of recordings across sub-Saharan Africa from the 50s to the 70s. And this was a recording from the 1950s and it was really rare. And I came across it whilst I was at SOAS. And so I played it on my NTS radio show. And then I got this message from a listener saying, oh, that music you played is actually been used by this other producer in Germany. And he's just basically looped it and released it as his own music. And he sent me the link, he sent me the SoundCloud link. And when I listened to it, I was like... quite shocked you know because that honestly it just been lifted there was no reference um you know or citation of where that music actually came from who was actually making it and here was a dance producer in Germany just releasing it as his own as his own track and you know I feel like that's completely wrong so you know Obviously, there's like a plethora of music to discover once you move beyond what beyond your immediate surroundings. But then, you know, you need to be aware and you need to you need to make sure that you don't cross those lines, as you mentioned. And I mean, it's fun to learn about new musics and new cultures and things like that. So why wouldn't you really? So I guess as a follow-on question, just as you were talking, I was just flashed into my head this meme that kind of pops up every now and then where it's like starter pack for white male DJs who play rare African records and it's like a screenshot of like a Discogs. for sale page. It's like a record that's 10,000 euros or something and like a Hawaiian shirt. Like it's really funny. I haven't seen that one. I have seen the Startup Pack memes, but not that one. Yeah. You'll have to send it to me. Yeah, I'll send it to you. But I guess there's also like, you know, when trying to kind of negotiate, what's appropriate and what's inappropriate. There's also got to be room for, I suppose, like cross-cultural exchange as well. So, I mean, I don't know. I'm personally curious and kind of trying to tease out a little bit more of the nuance around things like that. Like, for example, I was reading something on, about ethnomusicology and about how... things can be transferred both ways and how, you know, for example, Fela Kuti was influenced by James Brown, things like that. So it's, I don't know, I just think it's like a really interesting. Kind of muddy ground that we're... It's totally muddy. I mean, once you start looking into it and you start looking also into, like, you know, the history of humans in general, you realise that everything's fluid, everything's constantly changing, things are being transported from one place to the other. And it's been going on probably since the beginning of human existence, you know. And that ultimately, you know, once you realize that, it makes you think, well, yeah, what this whole, you know, it's hard to claim ownership over something and say like, well, this is mine and it doesn't belong to you and things like that because things are always moving. I mean, it. last year or the year before I came to Berlin actually to do a lecture about this for Native Instruments and I was talking about you know there's like this new genre called global bass which everyone's using to refer to music like Kuduru or Batida for example from Lisbon where you've got these African heritage producers blending their traditional sounds with electronic, more like European electronics. palette and creating a new thing things like that and so that was like the starting point I guess for the talk but then you know I was explaining that for example would you what would you think if I said that Beyonce Beyonce's style of music let's just say American R&B has its roots in actually um Arabic music from North Africa and the Middle East. And when you say that to someone, they'll be like, what are you talking about? But actually, you know, when you trace back the histories of musics that have travelled to the Americas and where they came from, you can see how it happened. Because, for example, let's say if we divide North America and South America up, you can see that this musical styles vary quite a lot. And in North America, a lot of the musical styles are led by harmonies and melodies and a lot of vocals. Whereas in South America, it's much more percussion driven and much more about drumming and beats. And so when you look at how people were moved from Africa and the East over to the West during the slave trade. The slaves that were being transported from Africa to the North American states, they were coming from further up the continent, the African continent. So their musics that they were bringing with them were more influenced by North American styles or like the Islamic empire. So Quranic recitals, you know, it was very vocal led. that's what they took with them over to North America and then over hundreds of years whatever that's developed into the music that you have now but when you listen to let's say Beyonce's vocal acapella and the singing you can definitely draw similarities between that and someone reciting the Quran or someone singing in Arabic you know and then in the same way slaves from sub-Saharan Africa, where the musical styles are much more about percussive instruments, they were transported over to the Caribbean and South America. And so those, you know, musical styles then developed into what we see now in Brazil or, you know, like Mento music from Jamaica, things like that, or Calypso, all these things. So then... you realise, OK, well, that's... When we think of Calypso music, you think so much of the Caribbean, but you don't think of where it came from before that or how it got there. So once you start realising those things, you know, it's just like, whoa, OK, it's pretty mind-blowing. And then you think about music moving the other way as well, kind of diaspora people who've moved over to... The Indian subcontinent, the music they create over there is insane. But no one really talks about that because we think more of like people moving east from east to west rather than the other way around. Right. Yeah, that's true. But yeah, there's so much to learn about and discover. Yeah. So what was your first exposure to area of study? I had no idea about it. I mean, growing up, music had always been my favorite thing. Just listening to it all the time, playing it, learning instruments like the piano and guitar and flute. And when I applied to go to university, I actually applied to do straight history degree. And when I went to SOAS, School of Oriental and African Studies, the first week they had this induction week and they had like... different sort of taster sessions and so there was this Cora player who did a performance and I'd never I mean I had no idea what it was this West African harp that this guy was playing and it just blew my mind honestly And so I thought, OK, I don't know anything about this, but I need to learn about it. And that very experience just made me rush over to the music department and speak to the head of the department and say, I haven't applied for your course, but I really want to study it. Please let me on. And then I was speaking so effusively about the core and it just so happened that she was also the head of like. the West African music. That was her speciality. So obviously in her mind she must have been thinking, yeah. Anyway, she let me on the course and that's how it all started. Yeah. And what kind of areas did it take you through? Like I imagine there's obviously elements of instructional. study in terms of instruments and also history, but like, are there any particular aspects of what you study that kind of like remained in your mind, particularly as an artist, I would say? We had, you know, things were split up between practical and theoretical work. So on the practical side, you had to actually play instruments and learn them. I got really into gamelan, which is Indonesian percussive music. and I learnt the Balinese style and the Javanese style and I still love listening to gamelan music, definitely. And then my main performance instrument was the sitar, which I'd always wanted to learn even growing up, but obviously never really got the chance. And then at SOAS I took it up and I still play it, just learning about... North Indian classical music's been really interesting for me because it's such an ancient tradition. And looking at how music is perceived within that world is so different to how I learned music growing up. Because we learned music growing up and you learn scales and it's like major or minor and like happy, sad. Just you learn the scales and you just, you know, like read music off a sheet of paper. Whereas, for example, even with gamelan, but also like in North Indian classical music, it's a completely oral tradition. So there's no notation. You just have to learn everything by heart. And so when you're not reading notes off a page, you've got to feel it more. And I feel like it brings you closer. And I know this is going to sound really cheesy, but even just having to sit on the floor to play the sitar and just being on the ground, you can't wear shoes, you've got to really respect the instrument. The way that you have to hold it requires so much effort and stamina in the first place before you even start playing. So it just puts your mind and body in a different gear. And yeah, it just makes you zone out, you know, to the music. And the scales in Indian music, which are called ragas, they're defined by certain emotions, times of the day, seasons, colours. And so, you know, there'll be like a specific raga and you're supposed to play that. maybe like just when the description will be like just when the sun is coming up in the morning and everyone's feeling a certain way and it's cool you know because I'd never really thought of scales in that way before you just kind of learn them to pass the grade exam and then move on to the next one but yeah And what kind of music were you listening to as a kid, like in your family home? Because you grew up in London, is that right? Whereabouts, actually? Central London, yeah, which is quite hectic. Yeah. Yeah, so I'm Londoner, born and bred. And growing up, I mean, my parents always encouraged me and my sisters to study music, so we all played different instruments. and we all went to music school on a Saturday. But, I don't know, my parents weren't especially musical, so there wasn't always, you know how some people talk about, like, oh, my parents always used to play this record. There was none of that, really. It was just whatever was on in the background, sometimes the radio. Why is it that they wanted you and your sisters to learn music, do you think? It wasn't even just music. It was just extracurricular activities in general. We did a lot of sport and other things as well. And I think they just wanted to give us as many opportunities as we could. And, you know, growing up as an ethnic minority family in the UK, I think they were very adamant about making us feel like we could do everything that we wanted to do. And so, yeah, I think that's what it was. They just pushed us to do all sorts of things. But I'm glad they pushed on the music. I'll have to ask them why, because neither of them are really musical. So I'll ask them and then I'll be able to answer this question. You can write the answer in the comments. Yeah, I'll be like, why did I ask my mum about this? Well, let's start talking about your music. So you were at university, you were studying ethnomusicology. Around what time did you start experimenting with your own productions and your own work? Probably before that, actually. So, I mean, I played the guitar growing up as a teenager, so I'd just be messing around on that. But then I did my first music production course when I was 18. So just interesting. I was actually using this program called Cubase that I've actually never used since then. But it gave me my first experience of how actually to use MIDI and how to record sound into a computer and how to arrange it and all those sort of things. That was when I was 18. And then after that... You know, just messing about. I think when I got a Mac, then just recording stuff into GarageBand. That's definitely how I made my first tracks because that's the easiest way to do it. And then whilst I was at uni, I was also in this other band, like a noise band. So I was listening to a lot of noise and drone music at that time. Right. And that was quite intense stuff. And then, yeah, after that, I think during when I was doing my master's degree, that trying to learn a bit more about DJing and then producing well trying to make some music using Ableton and things like that and then that's how it started and it just I was just doing it for fun because I wanted to learn about it and yeah but then it just grew into a thing I mean the DJing side of stuff that I just me and my friends in London we always used to put on our own parties and that's where I started DJing. So actually at these parties that my friends used to put on in different laundrettes around the city. Like while the laundrettes are operational or after hours? Yeah, it was after hours, after hours. It was basically a lock-in. And I think the laundrette owners didn't really understand what was going on because it probably never happened before. But yeah, that's where I started learning how to DJ. And then people always danced a lot when I played. So then the guys who put on the parties were like, oh yeah, you should play every time. And that's how that started. Yeah, just messing around on the computer as well and trying to record different sounds. Yeah. Were you going out a lot in London around this time? Yeah, definitely. More than now. What were your haunts of choice? Well, I started going out when I was about 13, I think. I don't know whether I looked older than my age or whether they just didn't really check ID at that time, but that's when I first started going out. that I lived close to Camden town in London and growing up as a teenager I was really into like punk and um yeah like punk and metal music so obviously it was great to be near Camden which is where all the gigs happened so used to be at Camden Underworld every weekend and then um yeah Reading Festival when I was 16 that was probably the best weekend I've ever had in my whole life even now It's so good. What made it so good? Well, it was just my first experience of a music festival. It was... The day I went out there, it was the day we got our GCSE results. It's always that weekend, even now. And so me and I felt like every person I knew from London had gone to Reading and I just kept bumping into people and we were in a massive crew. And it's the first time that I'd experienced that and probably didn't sleep for about four days. And remember. The lineup was, you know, all bands that I really liked at the time, like Less Than Jake and AFI and Hundred Reasons and people like that. So, yeah, it was good. But yeah, that's when I started going out. But then obviously... when I reached the age of about 17 or 18 that's when electro was starting to get quite big in London and then used to go out to nightclubs like White Heat and After School that's where everyone used to go it was like the indie nightclubs you know and yeah that's how it started and then after that just getting more into different types of music and going out all the time to gigs or clubs and stuff So that's, you know, that's one of the amazing things about growing up in a city like London, because it's just all there in front of you. Yeah. And it's interesting. I feel like when I listen to your music, like the kind of progression of it, and we'll speak about specific tracks and about your new album. in a little bit but I feel like I can hear like traces of these it's like kind of impressions like audio impressions that are there and I found it really interesting that with your album when I was listening to it earlier today I was like this is somebody who like grew up listening to like The Cure and like New Order I there was a real kind of sensibility of like a specific part of like British music history which I thought was really cool um is that something that yeah you're right about that yeah yeah totally I mean I yeah I'm obsessed with bands like The Cure and Joy Division, New Order I mean I guess I started getting into that older music um maybe around the age of like 15 16 yeah because you know I was listening to like current guitar music at that time but then you just start you just start exploring don't you like you hear interviews with bands that you like at the time and they're referencing other things and so that's how you find out about stuff but um yeah totally I mean this on my album my first album is actually the first time I used guitar on a record even though I put out like five EPs before that so that was a new experience for me but it felt really good it felt really natural and um and it feels like I'm going in the right direction. It's like you don't really hear guitar, like a lot of guitar. slash electronic music these days. I don't know. I guess not in the sense of it being identifiable as a guitar. I feel like there's perhaps a lot of guitar that's used that's processed and filtered, but I believe the first track of your album, it starts off with guitar. So it's really a specific sound and it kind of carries all the way through, which is super cool. But, yeah, so you started putting out records in 2013 and the first record was Mystic Places, like it's like a... a two-sided record we're on Aminera Records which is Castamoss's label how did you two connect I'm assuming it was through NTS or was it through another yeah it was actually through NTS I think that's how he first heard about me because he was listening to my radio show and then he listened I think yeah then he just went on SoundCloud and saw that I had some music on there whatever yeah I guess that's how he heard it and he liked it and then he got in touch but you know he's such an elusive person so when he first got in touch with me he was actually under an alias and so I didn't even know it was him but then like you know after a few email exchanges and then when he told me the label was on Muneerah and I was like wait a second and then I realized it was him and you know he's such a musical inspiration for me so that just felt surreal to have my first record being put out by him and for him to like to be into it that much that he wanted to release it was really nice and actually you know I've been hanging out with him in Berlin this weekend because he he came to my Bergheim show and I was so nervous about that because I was like how could I do a techno DJ set in front of him but it was fine and then he played here yesterday so it was and you know it's almost like the five year anniversary of that record coming out so like we get on really well and he's actually one of the best people that I've met in the music industry so far because he's like really down to earth and just knows what he's talking about and he's just such a good person to work with you know it was really so that was like a really good first introduction into releasing music yeah sounds like yeah I mean how did things change for you after that first record came out and after kind of being um I guess like vouched for by somebody like with the the status and reputation of Kassamoth yeah well I guess that it was really beneficial it was really beneficial for me because I guess you know a lot of um other labels or music heads and journalists they they really follow the releases that Kasim Moss has been putting out on Omanero so when that came out then I got a lot of yeah I got like a lot of good press and then also other labels getting in touch about hearing music and then that's what led to No Pain in Pop which is a London-based independent label to put out my name next two EPs after that. And that again felt good because, you know, that label's released other artists like Night Jewel and Grimes and Forest Swords. So it was nice to be on that roster as well. Yeah, and I think I put out... After Mystic Places, the next EP was called 19 Jewels and that came out the following year in 2014. That was like four or five tracks. I can't even remember now. And then the year after, Fate Exclusive. Yeah. Actually, I wanted to ask you about those two particular records because... I was watching this morning two music videos that you put together, which I thought were fascinating. So the first one that I watched was Sweet Tooth, which was one of the tracks off the 19 Jewels EP. And I thought it was really striking because it was like quite like a romantic and kind of sensual sounding and looking song, but it was framing the bodies and features of men. And there was... like a really interesting kind of like inversion somehow of images that you're used to of women's bodies being objectified or even just things like comparisons to food and combinations with food I just found it really refreshing somehow yeah how yeah yeah that was definitely the thinking behind that video I mean it was definitely a little bit tongue-in-cheek right but Yeah, no, on a serious note, though, I did actually want to create something which just flipped the norms that we're used to. So instead of objectifying a woman's body, I wanted to objectify a man's body. And, you know, and the result was that I actually made people think about it when that video came out. And that, you know, around that release, a lot of people were asking me about it because they also picked up on the same thing because it's only when you see it makes you realize that you actually never see it, you know? So all of the guys in that video, they're all friends of mine. Like I wrote them into that messy, messy video shoot. But for me, it was quite fun to just be pouring like honey and stuff over like hot boys. Yeah. Not bad for a day's work. Yeah. But I mean, you know, it's like a funny idea. And when you watch it, it's quite playful. But at the same time, I think there is, it is making like a serious commentary on the type of images that we're subjected to, you know, of women versus men. It's very, very different. And then when you, when you try and like. flip it over onto itself then yeah it makes you think about it a bit more yeah um would you say that you try to have I don't know like similar messages in your music as well like is there I don't really put it into the music as such because like the music is sort of its own entity and it's just this creative output of mine but I'm very conscious of of image, I think, in general, you know, now that, you know, as soon as you start releasing music, or you're doing a radio show, you're doing whatever else you're like in the public eye, and you've got people looking at you. And so you've got to think about, well, how are you going to, how are you going to make yourself look in front of them? Or what do you look like when you perform or when you do photo shoots and things like that? And that's something I feel depressed that so many females have to conform to this. cultural aesthetic of how a woman should look and you know anyone who says like oh well actually you know you can't say that about me because it's my own choice and it's like yeah it might be your own choice but you're still you're making that choice within a certain framework and that is the bottom line so I mean just thinking about like why do we not see photo shoots of like Kim Kardashian wearing a baggy outfit? Do you know what I mean? Like people would actually be quite shocked if they saw that because it's again about like flipping it and then being realized like, oh, actually every time I see her, she's always like almost naked. So it feels weird to see her wearing clothes that aren't like really revealing. But that's what it's about, I think. And so. The same pressures just don't apply to guys. If you're a man and you're making electronic music and you're DJing, you don't have to think about what you look like. It doesn't matter. you don't have to be topless you don't have to be muscly you don't have to be a certain way but then for women like whenever I look at female you know especially now with Instagram and things like that like there's so much pressure on on the visual side of things and image and I don't know. I just want people to realize that you don't have to look a certain way. You don't have to always wear hot pants or be taking bikini pictures to get more followers and more likes. Because, yeah, that happens, but it should also, you know, you should be able to get a solid following from people who are just into what you do and who respect that as well. So, yeah, something I always think about. Yeah. I don't know. It's like as a woman of colour, do you think that kind of like background assessing of situations? Because I know for myself as another woman of colour, like I'm very, very, very sensitive to the use of women's bodies. or representations of women, but also the use and misrepresentation of the faces and bodies of people of colour, which is something that still happens within quite a few parts of electronic music and it grinds my gears to no end. I mean, how is it for you being an artist to... you know, to some degree it is necessary for you to be, to represent yourself somehow or to be portrayed somehow. Like, how does that work for you? And I guess, especially with your academic background as well, like how does all of this intersect? It's so confusing, isn't it? especially because you're trying to figure it all out as you go along. But, you know, there's probably like a few, there's a few sort of things which are important to me. One, I just really believe that nobody should be able to tell anybody else how they should look or how they should dress, no matter like, I just feel like it's just crazy, you know. It's just, it's such a personal, it's such a personal thing to choose what to wear and what to look like. And it should be up to that person and nobody else should have a say over it. And, you know, it doesn't really, yeah, so it's up to them. I think that's really important. And so... Clothes are really important because it's your first point of communication before you even open your mouth. You're saying something about yourself and then the people looking at you are making a judgment on you just from your appearance. So that's quite an amazing thing, you know. So it's something that's quite interesting to play with as well. And I always think about outfits on the stage and stuff like that. Yeah, I mean, whenever I do a photo shoot or something, I don't ever want to do get in positions which are, you know, like suggestive or anything like that. And like, I'll pick my clothes because of, you know, according to what I want to wear, not what I think I should look like for a certain audience. And yeah, I just want people to. It's just about confidence, really. It's just being confident about yourself and what you look like and just owning it. And I think more people need to have that, whatever they decide to do. But it's always like a difficult thing to navigate, especially as a female and especially as an ethnic female as well, because there's so many preconceptions about. who you are and what you should be like and what you should look like. It's like a constant battle, but it's fine. You just got to do it. May I ask, what is your family background, actually? Pakistani. Pakistani. And are you, like, first, second, third generation? Well, my parents both, like, grew up in... in England from a young age, but then, yeah, we, we, I was born there. Yeah. So I guess like first generation of people born. Yeah. And. Um, cause I, I find it, I found it interesting and I don't know if there's any real like, um, weight behind it of you changed your artist name or rather you um dropped your alias and took on what I'm assuming is your birth name what was the reasoning behind that yeah so that that was a pretty big deal for me at the end of last year um To coincide with the announcement of my debut album, I decided to drop my alias because previous to that I'd always been working under the name Throwing Shade and then instead I decided to start using my real name, Nabiha Iqbal. And choosing to do that was really difficult and the fact that it was difficult took me by surprise because I thought... It's really strange why I'm finding it so hard to just use my own name. Like it shouldn't be that much of a bigger deal. But then it really got me thinking about everything. And to be honest, you know, it was like almost, you know, four years of working as a music artist and then getting to a point where I was like, actually, you know what? I just want to, I just want to use my real name and be like, yeah, this is who I am. And that's it there is something political about that. When you have a name that's not an English sounding name and when you're not like... a white person but you're operating in a predominantly white space then just you know being upfront about your identity and your name is a political thing it wouldn't be the same if my name was like Amy or something I don't know you know just as an example so but just the whole process of getting to that point which is like like this whole journey of self-realization I guess um took a while it took a while but I'm I feel like I did the right thing because when you look at the representation of South Asian people in music, you know, in Western music industry, it's basically nothing. Like the only people I can think of in pop music would be Zayn Malik and M.I.A., you know, like the other two big sort of like brown faces that you see. But apart from that, who else is there? It's just not that many. And then, you know, in the type of music that I make and the type of world in which I work, I am definitely... the exception to the rule. And then I just thought, you know, I want to be able to represent and I want to be able to like, well, actually, one of the reasons that got me to that point was that over the last few years since doing music, been receiving so many messages of support from people of all, you know, different backgrounds, but especially a lot of people who come from other ethnic backgrounds. And they were all messaging me to say that. They find it really inspiring to see me doing what I'm doing, et cetera, et cetera. And like until that point, I didn't really realize that perhaps there's a greater responsibility with what I'm doing because, you know, I was just doing what I love. But actually, you know, when people start looking at you and following you, then, yeah, there is definitely more of a responsibility there. So I just wanted to be upfront about it and try and like normalize my name. You know, yeah, it's an Arabic name. And if you haven't seen it before or heard it before, you might not be able to say it right. You might be scared to pronounce it, but you shouldn't be. I don't get angry at people who say my name wrong because you can't blame them. You just have to correct it and then it's fine. But, you know, it feels good to now see the name So we'll see how it goes. I think we should talk about the album in a second. But I'm also wondering, was there any difference in your approach to music between... throwing shade and between Nabiha Iqbal like do you think that that change of identity as an artist had any change on your music as well or this is just all like a natural progression I think it's definitely a progression. When you listen to the music on the album, it sounds quite different to, let's say, the music I was putting out on 19 Jewels. The main reason for that is that there's a lot more live instrumentation on this album. But to get to this point, for me, it just feels like a sort of natural trajectory. As an artist, you're constantly changing, I think, or you should be trying to challenge yourself or thinking about new ideas or how to do things differently. And for me, working on this album, you know, it was the most intense thing that I've ever done in my life because, I mean, making an album is not easy and it's very time consuming. to create like a large body of work that's got to have some coherence about it or have enough meaning for you to want to do it rather than just doing it for the sake of it. it just basically like took over my life. For how long? About a year. Well, I was working on it for about two years. But then, you know, the last year and then the last six months were just so intense. I was just... just in the studio all the time and then first I was doing a lot of all-nighters but then I realized that it wasn't so productive because maybe you could do two days like that and two nights and then you just crash so instead I used to go to the studio at like six in the morning and then work till 11 at night then go home sleep get up do the same thing I wasn't talking to anybody. I wasn't thinking about like anything else, like not even eating and stuff. It's just crazy how it just takes, it just consumes you. It made me think of loads of interviews that I've read with other artists, you know, when they talk about writing an album and how they're just like in a little hole, just doing it and it takes over. And whilst I was in that process, which was actually like this time last year in the summer. felt it and I've never cared so much about anything in my life and I've never worked so hard on anything in my life so it's really really important to me yeah Where did you start with the album? Like, what was your first moment of something kind of feeling like it was clicking into place? Do you remember? Oh, yeah. No, I remember. The first track that came together was actually In Visions. Yeah, that kind of formed the beginning of the album. So I was working on music for a while. before that and trying out different things. But then when I made that song, then I felt like, okay, yeah, this is going to be the beginning of something. And Ninja Tune were into it as well. And yeah, naturally, I just felt like I'd reached a point where I've put out a number of EPs and now the next. the next move to make would be to actually work on something bigger and try and write an album and yeah it's weird that you asked me that because no one else has asked me about what was the first song and I had to think for a second and now when I say it's in Visions that feels weird to me but it was that was the first track yeah why is it that it feels weird? I don't know, because I guess I'm thinking so much of the album in terms of its track order now. Sure. Maybe that's why. But yeah, that was the first song I wrote for it. And then, yeah, I just started going from there. And anybody who makes music will know that you can't just go in the studio and switch on your... creativity and just write a banger quickly so it takes a while and sometimes you might be working for like 10 hours and not feeling any of it but then you get to this point where you suddenly have like some epiphany and you'll get an idea really quickly within half an hour like sketch out a track and those are the moments that you've got to wait for but I feel like you can't really get those moments without those annoying hours of work beforehand where you feel like you're not going anywhere so it's part of the struggle isn't it it's all part of the process yeah how did you and Ninja Tune find each other? Ninja. So they put out my EP before the album as well, House of Silk. That was in 2016. And whilst I was making music before that release, you know, just preparing. So after Fate Exclusive, when I was just working on new tracks for the next thing and some, you know, I had some tunes ready and I was sending them out to different labels that had shown interest. And then. The Ninja Tune thing was actually like one of my friends who worked there, I remember him saying like, oh, if you have got any tunes, you should just send them over. And I remember that when I was emailing, so I thought I might as well send them to him. But then it was just another weird coincidence. Basically, everything that's happened is just, you know, just by chance. a little bit of luck and like the right place, right time. I don't know, it just happened that the head of A&R there was already a fan and he had like all my other EPs already. And so then when he heard the music, then he got in touch and we met up and spoke about it and then it turned out they were interested in putting it out and that's how it happened. And that for me was again like a very surreal feeling because Ninja Tune has been one of my favourite labels growing up to then be able to release an album on that label. It still doesn't really feel real to me, you know. It's been cool though. Okay, so let's like hop back to your time as a student because I understand that you went to Cambridge. Yeah, I did a Masters at Cambridge. Okay. An MPhil in African History. Okay. Yeah. What does that look like? A master's in philosophy. Yeah, it's called a master's of philosophy degree because it's kind of like between a master's and a PhD. So I had to write a 30,000 word dissertation. That's a lot of words. Oh my God, it was just too much. And I was looking at the... political role of the black press during apartheid in South Africa. So because I did, because, you know, whilst I was at SOAS in my undergrad, I was studying ethnomusicology and history. And I got really interested in South African history. So I applied to do a master's in it. And at that time, I was probably thinking like, yeah, maybe I'll do a PhD. But then that year made me realize I couldn't do it. It's just too isolating, you know, just like doing a research master's. But it was amazing. And I got to go to South Africa to do research and do interviews with like all these veteran journalists and black consciousness activists and stuff. And that felt really amazing. So what was it about South African history that drew you to it, first of all? I mean, obviously, it's had quite a long and very turbulent. modern history is that kind of what drew you in initially yeah I think um I think part of it was just having an amazing teacher you know we my lecturer at SOAS Wayne Dooling he was he's from Cape Town South Africa and and he I you know I'm such a geek anyway I was just like oh my god this is so interesting like doing loads of extra reading and stuff and then also another pivotal thing was that that summer after After that year of uni, I actually went on a family holiday to South Africa. And it was the first time I'd ever, you know, visited a place after having really studied about it in depth. And so then seeing all the places that I'd been reading about and like speaking to people who, you know, experienced apartheid and the end of it and speaking to them about like more of the sort of like contemporary political situation there. and traveling, like going down a mine in Johannesburg and then going and seeing Robben Island. I don't know, all these experiences, they just made me even more fascinated with the country. And so, you know, I've actually... I've been back there quite a few times. Because after my MPhil at Cambridge, then I did the law conversion and the bar to become a barrister. And then after I got called to the bar, I went back to South Africa and carried on working in Cape Town with a group of women's rights lawyers for six months. And then I was back there for another music project earlier this year as well. So I just love that country. It's so interesting. It's got a really dark past. And every time you go back there, this year when I went back, it was the first time in five years that I'd been back. And you just forget how much the racial divide still exists. And coming from somewhere like London, which is so diverse and so multicultural, it's quite a shock to the system. But, you know, it's amazing music from South Africa. And, yeah, just interested in it. People always ask me, they think, like, they're wondering what's my connection if I'm South African or what it is. But, yeah, just really interested in the country. So you're, like, a registered, like, you completed your bar? Yeah, yeah, I completed the bar, yeah. So you're able to practice law, essentially. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, I haven't I mean, I'm not thinking about it now. I'm just focusing on the music. And that was obviously quite a tough decision to make at that time back in 2013 that I was going to just focus on music. My parents were like, what the hell are you doing? But I felt like something, some like higher force was pulling me that way. And it just felt, made me realize that you can't always plan everything in your life. And maybe like the universe knew that music was really, really my favourite thing ever. And now it's letting me do it and it feels amazing. Do you think there's space for music to kind of coexist with things like activism or like social justice work, things like that? Do you think that there is space for there to be like a mutually beneficial? beneficial union between these two different things. Because I know, you know, for a lot of people, for a lot of people, the idea of combining music or the arts or something that they find to be an escape with something which has more of a message to it is, can be off-putting for certain people. Like, I don't know, what's your, what's your view? That last point you make, that's the interesting thing, isn't it? Because it's like, okay, well, music should be something soothing or something to allow you to escape from other things. And then how can you join the two? How can you join something like music with a really serious issue? And is it possible? And it's something that I think about a lot, especially having worked in human rights law and sometimes just getting this weird moment of being super objective when you're standing in a nightclub and you're looking around you and you're just like, what are we all doing here? But, you know, the place I've got to it so far, having thought about it, is that for me, I think music's one of the most important things in the world. And the fact that it exists everywhere in all forms and, you know, for different uses just shows you that. And the way that also music has played such an important part of important of an important part of, you know, historical movements or political movements, even just throughout the 20th century, shows that there is. The power of music is huge and it does bring people together and it does give them energy and motivation and helps them to get through things or to do things. is there and we can try and harness that and I think people will do that even in South Africa you know with the anti-apartheid movement music played such a huge huge part of it whether it was just like acapella choirs coming together and singing songs or South African jazz being played by musicians that had been exiled from the country but you know, just there's a lot, there's always going to be examples of it, like protest songs and things like that. But then... Yeah, I guess, you know, the opposite, the flip side of that would be like, well, what difference does it really make? Or how can you try and, I can't think of the word, but like, you know, just put, combine the two together and make it feel like it's working. I also think that, you know, if you can create a platform for yourself through whatever medium, whether it's music or art or fashion or whatever it is. You can then use that platform for whatever cause you want. And so for me personally, I feel like what I'm doing is has has. significant you know some significance to it just because I'm as like a Pakistani female doing what I'm doing I feel like no one's really done the same thing before and so maybe it's trailblazing a little bit or it's going to inspire the younger generation to do the same thing and like hopefully um create even more diversity in the music scene um so I think that's part of it like I feel I feel like I'm doing the right thing maybe and I hope people can get take some positivity away from it and then also you know one example that I think about a lot is Harry Styles from One Direction because because obviously you know he's such a huge pop star And then he made, you know, like this announcement about how... SeaWorld is really bad and you shouldn't go there because it's bad to keep killer whales in captivity, blah, blah, blah. And he made that statement, I think, around the same time that the film Blackfish came out, which is all about that. But then obviously his demographic, his follower base is exactly the demographic of people who would be visiting SeaWorld, you know, teenagers. And so when he made that statement, there was this... There's this like repercussion that's directly linked where the number of people visiting SeaWorld started to drop. And like teenagers online would talk about how we shouldn't go there and they were reading up on the situation. And all of that then led to SeaWorld saying, OK, well, we're not going to have any more whales in captivity and we're not going to catch any more. And, you know, they're shutting down the, I guess, once all the killer whales that are there now die, that that will be the end. And that's an amazing achievement, you know, because people have been campaigning for that for so And obviously that's all made a difference too, but it's funny how when a pop star like Harry Styles says something like that and there's like this immediate reaction to it. So, yeah, so that's just an example of how you can use your space to draw attention to different things. Yeah. There's a lot of conversation in, I'd say particularly, I think in all branches of music, but... In electronic music, particularly about the space for activism or the space for combining what is traditionally thought of as hedonism, I suppose, with something that's a little bit more socially minded. Is it something that you wish you saw more of or was more apparent in our scene in particular? Or, I don't know, what's your feelings about that? About seeing more activism? Yeah, yeah, or perhaps more like overt, just moving away from this idea that... myth of like plur, peace, love, unity, respect, like we're all coming together to be as one, which is idealistic. Yeah, which is something that I... personally feel may have been a reality for a really short period of time. And then this kind of nostalgic view has been held onto, even though it doesn't, it actually doesn't apply to a lot of people who partake in these communities. I don't know. What are your thoughts? Yeah, I totally see what you're saying. And, and. It is a real issue for sure. I mean, for me, because music is my life and my relationship to music is very personal. So I feel like anybody else who's into music also has that own very personal relationship with this powerful thing. And each person will interpret it in their own way and take what they want from it in their own way. You know, like when you go to a club. or you're at a massive festival like Glastonbury and there's like 200,000 people all there watching the same band. I think that... You know, OK, the reason I'm saying this is because last year I was at Glastonbury and then afterwards watching the footage back on TV with my granddad. And we were watching Radiohead headlining the Pyramid stage. And, you know, it was like 200,000 people there and they're all watching this one band and they're all singing the words. And then my granddad was like, he said this, he said this sentence, he said, oh, I'm witnessing the power of music. And then that really stuck with me because I was like, you know, that's so true because here's, you know, a huge amount of people who don't know each other from all different walks of life, different life experiences. But for some reason, they're all here watching the same. band listening to the same music and and that collective experience I think is important wherever it's somewhere like that or in a nightclub like Berghain where you're all there and you're you might be in your own world feeling the music and dancing away but there's so many other people they're doing the same thing and I think there's something very um there's something there's something very special and like intangible that you gain from that maybe without even realizing that gives you energy and like helps you I don't know just helps you deal with life for sure on an individual scale but then yeah I mean obviously when people throw around these like big sort of banners saying yeah like peace and love and music this is what music's about and stuff Then, you know, as soon as you start moving away from like the individual scale, that's when things become more complicated. And that's what I've realized a lot. You know, an example would be like just looking at the way large charities operate and seeing that, you know, actually a lot of what they do isn't good. You know, like the big story that came out recently about Oxfam and like, was it also the UN where people were just taking advantage of their positions of power in Haiti? Like with, you know, when they're trying to help the most sort of desperate people that exist in our society. And when you hear stories like that, it just makes you feel like, well, what's the point? What's the point of even giving money to those charities? Because I don't know where it's going. And so that, along with a few other experiences I've had over the last few years, and trying to make sense of it all for myself, like my peace of mind. I've got to the conclusion that I think you should just try, as an individual, try and live the best life you can or try and do things in the way that you see is the best way. Because as soon as you even start moving beyond that and you start considering the bigger problems that exist in the world, as an individual, there's nothing that you can do to stop that. Just even this weekend in... Berlin, I walked past this Syrian refugee camp in Temple of Park and it just made me feel so strange because... it was basically like a cage of people and it's just like well how do you deal with that like what's going on there there's a fence dividing us and those people they've made that arduous journey from Syria to Europe by foot probably lost a lot of friends and family along the way and here I am and I'm like I've just played at Berghain last night and I'm just here chilling it's just it's hard to make those two sit with each other and you know when you think about it too much And so then, yeah, I don't know, the way that I try and deal with it now is just try and do things in my own life to help someone or to raise awareness about something with a group of friends or, you know, try and make a difference that way on a small scale because it all starts on a small scale. And maybe that's just the best way of dealing with it. ♪ ♪ Bye.
