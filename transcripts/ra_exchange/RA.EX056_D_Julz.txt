Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Stephen Titmuss and I'm a freelance writer at Resident Advisor. The Jewels is an artist that's been hard to ignore in electronic music circles of late. He's produced a steady stream of underground hits and been an integral part of the success of Rex, probably Paris' premier nightclub. However, you might not be so familiar with The Jewels and his long history within the French club scene. We talked to the DJ about his early days within Parisian Rave, life-changing trips to New York, and its 15-year residency at France's most famous house and techno hotspot. So I read that you had a history with just general black music before you got into house music. What kind of records were you first attracted to? Well, early on, the first musical memory I remember was before black music. There was really some movie soundtracks. As a child, I remember one of the first experiences was listening to a Fellini movie soundtrack of this movie called Les Clowns, and it was kind of horns and gypsy because that was... When I was 3-4 years old I was really into circus and clowns so for some reason I ended up listening to this. And so that was my first thing. Then afterwards the James Bond films and late 70s James Bond movies which were already quite disco. So without knowing... Already as a child I was into the kind of the dance, the early dance music thanks to James Bond's disco interpretation of the theme. And the first records I bought was collecting some 45s with more synth pop kind of stuff like Eurythmics and Yazoo and Visage and also the early electro-funk like Freeze, How Are You, that kind of thing. And hip-hop started at the same time in France in the early 80s and there was this TV show called Hip-Hop and you know, in two days I was learning how to break dance and how to... there's no culture but it was really the classic hip-hop. Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa. I think that whole thing probably direct me towards more the funk roots and the black music roots. But the real, the real, the first big shock with music was Prince. When I was 10, I saw a video of, I think it was 1999 on TV, and I was blown away by it. A lot of my friends had the same experience with Michael Jackson. For some reason, he didn't touch me as much. But the first time I saw Prince, I was like, wow. And I was buying every record. And that opened me up towards his own influences, which were James Brown and Sly and the Family Stones and also Jimi Hendrix. So thanks to Prince, I discovered not only the Minneapolis sound, but also his background, which were funk and soul. So that was my definite background, music background is this. So was that an important thing for you, the kind of party vibes you mentioned, Prince? I think so. I mean, again, I think it comes from the childhood, but I remember when I was a kid, I was dancing a lot. I was going to, sneaking in, you know, those grown-ups, especially during holidays, going to those club med kind of things with my... that ended up sneaking in the discotheque and hearing without knowing what it was things like, you know, "Last Night the DJ Saved My Life" or "Funky Town" and also some ska like "Madness" from "One Step Beyond" I remember loving to dance on that. So I think the dancing introduced me to the dance music was my first introducing to it. towards music. So it stayed with me until now. And was that the kind of first clubs you'd ever been to? Those kind of club med things? Yeah, for sure. I was five or seven. I was breakdancing too. I was a crazy kid who goes and, you know, the adults. I'm watching like, "Oh, that's the kid who likes to turn on his back." When did you first start experiencing house music in France? Well, at first, I think the first house music I heard, I didn't know it was house music. I was going to those underage kind of clubs when, you know, my friends from high school went to when I was around 15 or 16. And in those clubs the DJ was playing a bit of everything. But a lot of... funk, some rock, some hip-hop classics like The Message and things like that. And without knowing what it was, some big, more mainstream house stuff like Pump Up the Volume from Mars or S-Express or French Kiss, the things which were already in the charts. So, and the Jungle Brothers, you know, House You and that kind of thing. So I didn't really know what it was, but in the mix of everything... I loved it, I was dancing on it. But I didn't see it as a different style of music. It made sense with the rest. The real house music shock was later on, I think in '89. I went to this club for the first time, this gay club in Paris called Le Boy. I think it was definitely more techno than house at the time. the entire vibe, it was really kind of decadent and the music, I never heard that before, it was no songs, no lyrics, no words, it was only instrumental and it was quite hypnotic and yeah, altogether it was a real shock and that's I think my first house music and techno shock and the music there was More, you know, the kind of Belgian techno and also the early warp stuff, the bleepy... Nightmare on the Wax. Also the R&S and Joy Beltrame, it was that kind of music. So it was very different from the house music that you had in the charts. It was more extreme. This song was... and I was going to this club all the time. I loved it so much that I was going there pretty much every week. And I think it was a very important club for Paris, for the scene. That's where one of the clubs where Laurent Garnier started. I mean Fridays and Saturdays were more Belgian techno and that kind of harder stuff. And Laurent was playing on the Thursday for this party called Les Incroyables. some performances on stage and you had people like Laebovary coming and some you know weird looking people and Laurent was playing when he was playing more happy and uplifting house kind of stuff a lot of more songs it was more New York New York house, things like Crystal Water mixed with Italian, piano Italian stuff which was very big I guess in Manchester. So he was bringing that to Paris and he was playing that a lot. So on the first day you were listening to more house. And Friday Saturday was definitely more techno. So was there anything in Paris you could compare that club to? Or was it very different from the rest of the... There was other clubs, but the Palace was also doing some nights there, and Laurent was also playing there. There was this other great club called La Luna, which I'd never been to at the time, because it was way too... like scary gay, no girls, and I was too scared to go there as a 16 year old looking teenager. But the boy was more me. and the Rex also had some nights, I think the Friday nights, but it was only one or two nights a week that was techno, the rest was open to other styles. But the boy was only this, yeah. And there was also this other club called Power Station on the first day, which was really good. That club was great because it stayed open only one year. but it had two rooms. The first room was more that kind of acid jazz kind of vibe, you know, like soul to soul and really very quality music, but more in that genre. And in the back room, it was like super dark, one strobe light and smoke machine and banging stuff. And it was like, wow, what the fuck? It's different, different world in the same club. And it was a lot of mixed crowd because of those two different... styles and I like that club for that because you had a really people going there for one hour going to the other room and it was a cool club but it didn't stay open too long. And going to those clubs, basically, I started to meet people who were giving me flyers for the rapes, the early rapes. And I had no idea what it was. It was like, oh, come this Saturday, meeting at this address, and someone will pick you up and bring you to the place. And it's going to be a crazy party. It's like, wow, what's that? And that was the entire, the rave scene started. Perhaps could you name some of them, the early electronic DJs that were influential on the Paris scene? Yeah, the first, okay Laurent Garnier was obviously one big influence in the first raves and my first club experiences. But there was other artists which are not as known. which were I think very important for the Paris scene. One of them was Guillaume Latortue and there was also Jerome Pacman. Eric Roig was also one of them and the first I think foreign DJs who played as guest teachers in the raves were a lot there was a lot of Dutch teachers and some Italian teachers and I think one of them Italian teachers had a tremendous impact on the French scene his name is Francesco Farfa And basically, we all thought we knew how to DJ. And we heard this guy, Francisco. We saw him mix, and technically, in a way, he was really creating a third track with two. And we were like, "Okay, no, we don't know how to mix. We have to keep learning." So, Francisco had a huge impact for the DJs of my generation. And also Dimitri from Amsterdam was a big influence for me. I guess it's important to point out that's not Dimitri from Paris. Yes, it's Dimitri from Roxy, Amsterdam. Which I think was to the Dutch scene what Laurent is to the French scene. He's the guy who really studied the whole thing. The Roxy, his night at Roxy called High Tech Soul was very, very legendary, I think, in Holland. And it was a DJ who has this ability of playing every style. Detroit techno mixed with UK breakbeat and New York house. But the way he was doing it... was quite unique. You keep mentioning Laurent Garnier obviously, how important was he those early nights? Was he the one guy playing house music you sang? Yeah, I think there was him, there was Eric Rugg and then a couple of other DJs who were into the raves, like some people who introduced me to this music later on like Guillaume Latortue, I mean unsung heroes, people who are really important but Laurent was definitely I think the first DJ who ever played house music in Paris because I'm not sure exactly I mean you would have to ask him but I think that the story was that he was doing his military service in Manchester so ended up playing at it was a bartender at the Hacienda and then he started to play there as a warm-up DJ so he had access to the this entire culture being in England at that time and The early, early... I was too young to go there because I think it was 87, 88. But the very early acid house parties in Paris were, I think, at Le Palas. It was a party called Pyramid and at the Rex, another party called Jungle. And it was London promoters who were organizing acid house parties in Paris. And I think they were bringing images like Colin Favre and Laurent was the... French DJ who was playing for them. So basically that's how it started, you know. And that's why Laurent was the first one to play this style because through the English promoters who knew him because he was already playing in Manchester. I guess, I mean, I'm not 100% sure about the order of the things. but that's how I remember. So you mentioned Rex briefly, which is obviously a very important club for Lauren and a very important club for you as well. Do you remember the first time you went to Rex on a club night or a house club night? Yeah, it was from one of those Friday nights. called Space and again it was quite techno, it was very much Belgium kind of stuff and yeah I think the first time I went there was probably 1990. And the DJ at that time, he's called Ian, had the first, the only record shop that was selling house music in Paris. It was the owner of a record shop called USA Import. And so, that's actually, I went to the record shop. because I saw a sticker of this record shop at Le Boy on the disjoubouf. I was like, well, that's probably where you can get those records. So I went to that record shop. I remember buying Energy Flash and Circus Bell from Rocket Harmony. Those were the first house records, or techno records I bought. And then he gave me a flyer to his night at the Rex, so I went to his nights and I was going there quite often on Fridays. And what was it like in there? Do you remember? The club at that time was different. The DJ booth was not where it is now. It was quite underground club. The crowd was very different from Le Boy. It was not gay, it was straight. It was more kind of a rave kind of crowd. Maybe... It was a different crowd than the other clubs, but more techno. At the time, in the early 90s, was that the main place for dance music? Or were there other clubs around at the time? No, that was it. That was those three clubs, basically. It was The Boy, it was The Wreck. Le Palace which was a very big club especially in the early 80s it was like a French Studio 54 In 1990 it was not doing so well. They had some good nights but some of them were the disconnect. So I would say a really direct... It was a couple of nights in all those clubs. It was not one club which was only electronic. It happened later. So how were you listening to records? Were they played on radio in France? Well you had that radio. There was two radios that were playing. Actually you had a few radios that were playing. and techno you had a radio that no longer exists called maximum which i know i remember they were broadcasting some nights live like for you could be in your house and listening to seven hours at the boy of people playing so that was pretty cool and uh there was radio nova where you have a lot of djs playing i think laurent was playing there and also my friend Guillaume Latortue which was a very important DJ for the scene. He doesn't produce or DJ anymore but he was someone which was really important for us, kind of a mentor. So he was playing on Nova and FG was already there and it was a gay radio, it was Frequence Gay but they had the techno mix and I did some early mixes there too. So yeah, you had three radios, but it was Paris radio, it was not France, it was really local Paris radios. It was not national radios. So in this early time, when you first started going out clubbing, were you, had any aspirations to be a DJ or anything? Not at all. Not at all. I mean, I always loved music and... dancing from early stage, early age but no, absolutely not. I was buying some records but I didn't have a huge collection of records. No, it really is that shock of this music. It's really house music that made me want to be involved. the music in a more active way, from being a spectator to being an actor, basically. And so I was starting to buy more and more records. And going to those clubs, you will always meet the same 20, 30 people. It was a very small scene. After a few months I ended up being friends with Laurent and some other DJs and going with them to their shows and spending time with them and seeing the records they were playing, getting the names and after a while I was like "Okay, I have now these 50 house records, I have to buy another 10 tables to do something with them because I want to..." mix them, you know, and so making my my own tapes and hanging out with them and playing my tapes to them. Not, I didn't, it's not like I wanted to be DJ, but you know, we're friends, we're doing the same thing and I want to have their impression on my mixes, so... So they were listening to the tapes and one day they said "Come with us, why don't you play to this rave with us?" It was Guillaume Latour too again, who was doing this thing on Sunday afternoon, both parties, every Sunday afternoon. I was like "Come next Sunday and bring your records and play with us." And that's how it started. And the first time he gave me, I think it was 400 francs. I was like, I didn't want the money. He was like, no, no, I'm doing it for the fun. I don't want to be paid for it. I was like, yeah, but you'll buy more records with it. And the scene became bigger, you know, the rap scene started to really blow up in '92. And there was not that many DJs, so all of a sudden I had requests to play all the time. And my DJ skills were not that good, I couldn't beat mix really well. So I ended up learning my job in front of a few hundred people and a few thousand people later on, so it was strange. But it was really like a hobby, it was a passion. I loved doing it but I had to wait another seven years. to really decide it was going to be my life and my work. Before I was finishing school, I was going to university, I was working advertising and mixing on the weekends. So it was until '98 I was doing both, really until later that I... I decided that was it, you know. So what were the French Raves like? What kind of venues were they in and things like that? It was from a lot of factories, usually in the suburbs. There were some crazy venues like some castles, some... tunnels and the first I've ever been to was a it was actually very in this place, this business district near Paris called La Défense which is full of big buildings empty during the weekends because people go there only to work and it's like a downtown kind of place and there were at that time there were building the extension of the subway line. So there was this underground station under construction, underneath that district. And people managed to bring a sound system in that fucking place. So, and I ended up there, in this huge tunnel. Empty, like, you know, the floor was not even... It was not wood, it was just like this, and people huge on the system and 2000 people in there. It was crazy. You have to be going there, you have to be "shhh" not making noise so the police wouldn't hear and you open this trap and you go down two stairs and you ended up in a fucking tunnel. That was crazy. That was a shock. So what kind of music were you talking about? Is it more banging techno? Not necessarily, you know, it was a bit of everything. You know, at that time there was no so much... sub-genres, everything was new. So there was not so much of a separation between techno and house. It happened later. So we were all playing a bit of everything basically. I remember doing sets with some new groove records with strictly rhythm but also with underground resistance and some early breakbeats from London, more kind of hardcore, early hardcore, some breakbeats like Prodigy and early progressive. So every DJ has his own style but it was not like oh I'm gonna play only New York house or only Belgium techno. We were doing our thing with what we were finding in the record shop and thinking it's all techno or it's all ours. So I read you made some trips to London in the early 90s. Where did you go when you first went to London? Was you at record shopping or...? Yeah, the first briefing was around '91 and I think the aim, the reason why I went was to go record shopping originally but I ended up also going to the clubs. I was there for three days, three or four days and it was great because the records you were finding as soon as you were leaving your own town. you would find records you would have never found in Paris. The distribution thing was totally different than what it became later. So you had to actually go to places to find records that nobody else had. And London was obviously an amazing place for record shopping, always were. So you would go and come back with 50 or 100 records. of things that nobody would ever heard and you could play them for two years and people would go to hear those tracks that you were the only one to have. It was great. So yeah, I remember going to Black Market, which was probably one of the first record shops I went to in London and a couple of others I forgot. And the first parties I went to in London was some more... That's when bread meat was really big, the hardcore thing. It was '91, so it was huge. And I went to Rage at Heaven on the first day. I remember it was Halloween and I forgot who were... DJ, but probably Groove Rider and Colin Favour. And what we were playing was very similar to the rave music we had in, because it was a lot of Belgium stuff and some techno mixed with their early records, their breakbeat stuff, you know, the Rabbit City and that kind of stuff. So I remember buying a lot of those white labels that I'd never heard of before. And yeah, that was my first London experience. I also went to this big rave in Astoria Theatre. I think it was a Fantaisie FM party. It was crazy. And the rave was very different. It was the people with lasers and glow sticks. Yeah, there was the rave scene, I think was big in Paris, but compared to London it was tiny. It was a totally different dimension here. How did the atmosphere compare in the two cities? It felt... In comparison, in Paris it felt a lot more amateur, you know, more discovering thing, adventurous. In London, I had this impression it was, it's been like this for years and it was a big business and it was, people knew what they were doing, they had their own looks and they, you know, there was a lot of certain format in a way. As in Paris it was... more abstract, more mixed, more a bit of everything. kind of sense, you know, not so much defined, not so much, not as precise. In London you could tell, yeah, you go to this club, this is this kind of music, people are dressed like that and they dance like that. I remember the dancing was really strange, it was the rave dancing in London, there was a dance, totally people were doing some moves, you know, like big box, little box kind of stuff. But there was no move in Paris. People were just doing whatever, jumping up and down. It's not as defined. Almost like the French scene was a lot younger. Yeah, completely. It was a lot younger. And it stayed like that. Because then the rave stopped. There was a lot of repression. And the scene died really quickly because it became too big. And the police started to, well, you know, like the criminal justice. The same sort of thing happened in France. So did the police just kill them off entirely? It happened actually when I was in New York. But I remember leaving Paris. in 93 when the rape scene was at its peak and coming back and it was basically almost finished things had moved to clubs you know so you mentioned obviously a move to New York how long did you stay there for? for a year for a year yeah that was 93 yeah okay so that was kind of the peak what some may say of the New York house I realized that later on but all my favorite New York records were made in 93 so I was really lucky to be there that particular year. So were you working there? Yeah, basically I was finishing university in France and I was doing an internship for a publishing company and I had this offers basically to do my internship for the same publishing company in New York. So it was kind of a weird thing. completely illegal. I was paid in my, you know, in France through that company. So I didn't have really a green card, but still I was working there. So it was weird. I had enough money to basically pay for my rent or half a share of rent in New York because the rents were really expensive like that. and I always wanted to... I was traveling in the States quite a lot as a teenager to learn English. I was going there for summer school or exchange, but I never stayed more than a month. And for me it was kind of a dream to at one point be able to go to the States and for a year maybe to live there. So when I had this job opportunity, of course I jumped on it. which in a way was a bit risky because I left when as a DJ I was really becoming quite big in Paris in the rap scene and I left I had my first mix CD that just came out and that whole scene was exploding so I realized now that it was very taking a risk to leave Paris for a year time because I felt well maybe when I come back everybody would have forgot about me but still I wanted so much to be in the States that I did that move and I'm glad I did because it was one of the best experience I've done and I had in my life it was amazing So I arrived there in 1993, not knowing how long I would stay basically. I felt, well, what's the risk? If I'm broke, if I don't find a job, or if I don't like it, I come back. And if I like it, I stay. That's all. So I ended up staying a year. And I got really lucky. because after being two weeks there, I gave my CD to a guy who was working in a record shop, 8-Ball record shop, he was doing the imports, he was an English guy called D.B. And I said, "Well, I'm a DJ from France, I'm gonna be here for a while, so I heard you do parties, here's my CD." Mix CD, I mean, we're talking '93, people were making tapes, I come with, "Mix CD, that's hot!" The guy listens to it and calls me back two days later and says: "What are you doing on Friday?" "We're doing this party called NASA." "And if you want to be playing, come back." And I started to be a resident for them and playing for NASA almost every other week for a year. So I got really lucky, I mean I was great, it was amazing. I suppose sometimes that can be helpful being like the French guy in a new city, perhaps? Yeah, true, but also New York I realized later that it was, the raves were the only place where you had DJs playing. I'd say five or six or seven DJs playing in the same night because the culture, the club culture in New York was more like one guy playing one club. And it was not so much places for other DJs to play, so the rave was great for this. So where was he throwing these raves then in New York? Were they... in the center or...? It was in Manhattan, no, it was... I know there was a rave scene in Brooklyn, in the Bronx, more with Frankie Bones, which was, I think, closer to how it was in Europe, it's more like factories, but the Nassau raves were the Manhattan raves, it was different, they were doing it originally, I think they were doing it at Shelter. When I arrived, the shelter had just closed, so they were moving to some other clubs. So it was mostly in clubs or theatres. And it was a different crowd. It was a very, very young crowd, underage. Sixteen. I mean, I was twenty-one and I felt like old. They were really, really young. They have their pretty strange look and doing their strange dances and doing a lot of dance contests. It was very, very different from the European rape scene. I have to say, At first I didn't like it so much. I felt the people were more concerned about their style. It was very pausing, a lot of pause. And they didn't care so much about the music. And it was very eclectic. The programming was very eclectic. I could end up playing between a trans DJ and a drum and bass DJ. Nobody would see the difference or would care. It was... Again, a very good experience. I was also playing in clubs like Limelight and Club USA, which was big, more commercial clubs and tunnel. But, you know, it was a different scene. But for me, the real scene, the club scene, was something else in New York. And I discovered that. Yeah, can you say about that? Did you go to places like the Sound Factory? Yeah, yeah. Oh, and that was a mind-opener completely. I mean, Sound Factory, I could go on for hours about this club because, okay, coming for more rave... I had no idea what was a real club, what a real club should be because the Paris club was one thing. But when you arrive to Sound Factory, all the history of New York clubbing is there. This part of Paradise Garage, the people who go to Sound Factory are the ones who used to go to Paradise Garage. the music is not the same but you can tell it's the same that the background is the same and the story is there it's perpetuating something First the crowd, the mix of the crowd was something incredible. It was gay, straight, black, Puerto Rican, rich kids, rave kids, everybody there for one thing, the music, sound system, best sound system I ever heard. All that combined with a DJ who was a junior basquiat who at that time was playing amazingly and different than everybody. else creating a sense of drama playing for 12 hours so playing a lot of different style of music. I didn't like everything he was playing because it could get really really cheesy towards 10 in the morning. It was an after party too, people were getting there around 4 or 5 and depending on your taste of music you knew which were the hours that you wanted to go. I liked it, I liked when he was playing harder and darker and drugier kind of sound. and that was between five and eight you know so that was and and that was a great thing because you could hear someone playing for so long and playing a lot of different styles and at that time most of the the new york clubs like some factory bar or other clubs like this with people like Vega or Frankie Knuckles, they were very New York house. Full on vocals, garage, and it was great. I mean, I didn't like it so much before moving to New York, but then there I started to like and to appreciate good songs. But I didn't want to hear this all night. The great thing with Junior, he was the only DJ who was playing, who could play, okay, vocal masters at work things. But also, he's the one who really pushed the wild pitch and the DJ Pierre sound. He broke all the big DJ Pierre records in this club. And all the tribal stuff, the early Savin Fisher and the DJ Duke things. That was cool. custom-made for Sound Factory. So that what was called the new sound of New York was created by this club. And he was playing also some European stuff. He was playing Dave Clark, Red 2, and Plastic Man. spastic. Okay, a minus 7, I was playing at 123 BPM, but nobody except in the rapes would play that in the clubs with a vocal garage track after. So it was fantastic to hear that mixed in a different way and as a DJ I learned everything there because I thought I was... a DJ because I knew how to play one or two hours in a row. But that's a totally different story. I started to see that it's not only about the mixing because his mixing is not so good. But he was playing tracks, he could play tracks for 20 minutes, like play one track twice or three times and then making a blank and playing another one. I was like, the first time I went, I was like, ah. I can't mix. It's not how it should be done. I didn't understand it at first. And then it grew on me and then I understand he's playing for 12 hours and he takes the time to, when he wants to break a track, he's gonna play it for 20 minutes. And the next week when he plays it again, people know it already. That's it, that's the track. And that's tracks that he was the only one to have. People were giving him... that tape and it was making acetate of it. So you could hear some tracks for six months or a year before it actually came out. Things like Future Scarp, This Is House Music. He played that track six or seven, eight months every weekend and it came out eight months later. Same with Underground of Lisbon, So Get Up. It was the only place where you could hear those tracks and nobody knew what it was. It was magical. I mean, honestly, it was a bigger experience for me. Were you one of the people going to the record store asking for those records? Yeah, it was like, "Oh, Junior played that trial, so get up, forget about it." I was like, "I don't know, it's some guy from Portugal who did it." You know, you had some info, but nobody had the tracks. And he wouldn't have played it if everybody else had it. He was like, "I won't be..." to be the only one to play. And he was express too, music express. He made that, he made that hit. He was making hits, creating hits really. You don't have that anymore, a DJ who plays every week in one club and this one club was such an influence on the international scene. People were coming from London for the weekend to hear him play and were coming back to London making tracks so he could play the month later, you know. I remember some friends, I mean DJ friends from Varys, when I was in New York, was asking me, they were looking for some records that they heard because they had people like... people like that playing in Paris and he was playing a lot of tracks which were big in New York but it was hard to find in Paris so friends were telling me "can you find these records for me and ship it to me?" So I knew that the New York sound was getting bigger in Paris and when I came back it was a great idea. Basically I started to play right away. I was afraid people had forgotten me for a year but at the end it turned out to be really good because that New York thing was hype, you know, it was hot. But then I started to play more in clubs. And I have to say, going to Sound Factory and learning, which was a school for me, was perfect to make that transition from the raves to the clubs. because I knew what it's like to do a warm-up, what kind of music you have to play depending on the time you play. So I started to play at the Rex. and I started to play a lot more for the gay crowd in Paris, which didn't happen before because before '94 it was very different. You had the rave scene and the club, which was more gay, but people were not mixing so much. So as a rave DJ, I was not asked to play in the gay clubs, but when I came back from New York and my sound was slightly different, I ended up playing a lot for the gays and it was great because that sound was fitting perfectly what I heard in New York and it was a match. So were you a regular DJ at Rex straight away? Did you pretty much get... No, what happened is one of the big rave promoters that I used to play for, when he couldn't organize raves anymore because of the repression, he moved his... his parties to the Rex. This party was called a temple. And he asked the resident teachers of his race to So he was doing basically every Saturdays and he had one resident one Saturday a month. So I was doing one, I think Eric was doing another one, I think Jeff was one. And he asked all of us to invite the people we wanted. invite. So it was not my own night but still I had it started like this I was playing and I had to choose the choice of my guests and it was around that time I started to play a bit more abroad especially in Belgium and Holland So I was bringing people that I met during my trips and DJs I didn't know that I loved their music. So I was bringing mostly resident DJs from Café d'Anvers in Belgium or people like Cooney or Smos and BBB and also going to Amsterdam. The Dutch scene was a big influence for me. the early rave days. I was influenced by the Dutch teachers, especially this guy called Dimitri, who was a resident at Roxy. So I was bringing Dimitri, who was already big in Paris because he was playing in the rave, but I was bringing that kind of sound to my part. and some of them were more connected with the UK, who were in UK. So everybody has his own style and his own guests. And when, after a couple of years, I think so up to '96, '97, when the temple parties stopped, the promoters decided to stop and do something else, the Rex... the manager of the Rex decided to keep the DJs who were playing on the Saturdays and to start their own night. And so that's how I started bass culture. And that was in 97. And again, I kept the same formula. It was me plus a guest and someone I liked as a DJ or as a producer I wanted to hear. And then I started to bring, because I was going more in the UK at that time, and I started to bring people like Kenny Hawks, Ralph Lawson, and Chris Duncanfield. The tech house thing was also getting big, so Terry Francis was my first ever guest. And up until now, I keep doing it and just keeping the formula like this. So what's the idea behind bass culture? Can you almost sum it up about what you want to achieve with The Night? You mean with The Night or with The Label? With The Night, yeah. Like I said, it's very simple. It's me seeing myself as a fan of someone and saying, well, I like this guy and I want to hear him in Paris. So I'm going to bring him to play at my night. Simple as that. You know? It doesn't need any more explanation I guess. I do find it interesting though, you started bass culture in '97, maybe the time when the French touch was almost at its biggest. Yeah, true. So you didn't go down that route. No. Did you ever feel tempted to get more involved with that as French DJs were getting a lot more attention in the press? It was a very different scene. But in a way, I mean, I was doing the things I've always been doing. But the French touch, which I think started in 95, 96, was really big around 96. It was great. I mean, it was great for the entire French scene, including me. But I was not playing so much of it. I was not playing so much of the French things. I liked, of course, I liked the first. My first Daft Punk album, Homework, was great and I liked the first Motorbass album, or the only Motorbass album. But apart from that, I was not so much into that. sound. The filter disco thing, okay I like some of it but I would rather play a sneak, it's a sneak record than a French filter disco. And there was a night dedicated to that sound called Respect which was at Le Queen and all these guys were playing there. So it was not really... I didn't feel it was necessary. And again... I didn't... What was strange, because of being a French DJ at this time, all of a sudden people all around the world wanted to book you just because you were French, but they were expecting you to play French music, which I was not playing so much. I was playing again a bit of... a lot of... English stuff and American mix of it but not so much playing all the French hits. But I would, so you know, it was existing, it was a strong scene but it was two different things I have to say. Talking about your productions, Rob and DJ, it did take you a long while to get into production. Yeah. Why the wait? Well first because like I said I was still working. as a copywriter and advertising. When I came back to New York, I had a job and I was DJing on the weekend but I had no time to make music because I was working. during the weeks. So only in 1999 I had to make a choice and I quit my job because I wanted to, you know, I realized that if I wanted to make the move I had to be 100% into this and find the time to make music. So I started to... I had a few records that I made. friends who were engineers and musicians but I really got into producing in 99. when I had the time to do it. At the time it was full time and I guess the first records that came out which started to do well for me and get my name around was in 1999. It was this track called Dragon Dub and Crossing Road which was on a French label called Serial. And a year later I had... Acid Tricks on all of them and The Theme, Timeless Basin, The Theme on 2020 and thereafter tons of remixes and that was it. Those three, two tracks, two records really made it for me. And it was really in reaction, I have to say towards the French touch thing. I was really over those, you have to understand that around in 97, 98, you could only find in record shops in Paris, the only sound you would find was filter disco. And not the cool one, not the early Daft Punk stuff of the sneaks. Chicago stuff. It was really what the big major companies, the big... "Oh, we want to have our own Daft Punk, so we're doing this formula." And all those cheesy disco loop stuff. And there was an invasion of it. And I couldn't find any records. It was really hard to find records in Paris that I wanted to play. And I wanted also, now I started to produce, I wanted to show that the French sound could be something else. That it was not... Because I was tired of going to play somewhere and people asking me to play. French, Dutch music. So I started to do quite the opposite. I did acid house and I did dub house and tech house, things with a lot of... I had a big influence towards... world music and dub. I was a big fan of King Tubby, so I was very influenced by this and at the same time I was missing the old Chicago assets. The first track that I did was in that style, which in '98 nobody was doing. maybe moving forward to where we are now, with your label Bass Culture and all the gigs you're doing, how do you pick the records for Bass Culture? How do you do the A&R side of it? It's the same way we program the night. Like I said, I like someone or I just get in touch with him or if someone sends me a track I like it, I want to play it as a DJ, I want to play it more than once and I try to find music that's as much timeless as possible. so a bit classic in a way and that comes from my roots was mostly house and techno but I don't ask myself too many questions I just see well do I like the track as much as I really want to put it but that's it you know yes and where do you see that developing where do you want to take it I don't have planned. I don't have master plans. I'm very new at this. It took me 15 years to want to start a label and now I do it. For me I'm really a beginner at it and I do it one step at a time and I see it more as an extension of my DJing. I'm doing my own selection, signing people I want to sign and right now what I know and I think my knowledge and what I like the most is things that's aimed at DJs. Some would call it DJ tools. I don't know. It's just music that I want to play as a DJ. So maybe in a few years I would go to open it up towards things which is not only for the dance floor. Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. Right now I'm happy with this. Even if people call it DJ tool, I'm a DJ and I make my own tools. That's what I'm doing. And I think you can make DJ tools which are quality DJ tools. It doesn't necessarily have to be something disposable. So I guess yeah like DJ Tools like is very strongly associated with tech house, you know What's your opinion on that? So some people have very kind of negative opinions about that, but tech house is a genre itself. Well, I've always been careful about the term tech house because from what it was originally and what it became it's a totally different world. And I think if you were asking the questions to to someone like Terry Francis. He would say the same thing. Originally, Tech House was the style of music you were... When you liked house, deep house and techno, you could play both records together in the same set. And sometimes you would find B-sides or dub mixes of Garage or Deep House. That would be the perfect link between your deep house record and... a Detroit techno record. So it came from all those B-sides or more dubby kind of tracks and that was the tech house. It was the gap between the two and records where you could definitely say if it was is this a house record or is it a techno record? I don't know it could be both or it's played by both kind of DJs. That's the original tech house. Then it became a style on its own. and it became boring. So sometimes I say no, I'm not a tech house DJ, I'm a DJ who can play house and techno. And the same happens again now. There's a different style of tech house because when you look at Big Port, the genre tech house, it's very different from the tech house of '98 or 2000. But again, it's the thing you don't really know if it's house or techno, but they put everything in it. So for me that name doesn't mean anything anymore. Really, it's... whatever.
