My name's Mark Smith, and I'm the tech editor at Resonant Advisor. Right now we're listening to New Haven, which is the second track from Fawlty DL's 2014 album for Ninja Tune, In the Wild. It gives a solid impression of how difficult it is to nail down the New York producer's sound. A hybrid of English and American styles mixed with a touch of IDM and considered song structure. The man born Drew Lossman initially rose to prominence as an American advocate for UK styles like two-step and dubstep. But his impressive knack for songwriting and a seemingly endless reserve of fresh ideas has placed him in a category beyond functional dance music producers. He's seen trends come and go over the last decade and during this interview at home with R.A.'s Max Pearl, He spoke about how to create a sustainable career as an artist without falling prey to negativity or burnouts. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Fawlty DL is up next. ♪ ♪ So you arrived on the New York City scene in the mid-2000s. Correct me if I'm wrong. Yeah, maybe thereabouts. Yeah, 2008, 2009. And which was sort of considered like the beginning of a dead time in New York City. Like people sort of consider the mid-2000s as like a lull. Interesting. And so I wonder if that was your feeling. Like, was it lonely for dance music? No, is like my quick answer. But I think, you know, what happened was, is I came here and I quickly... found a party and it was there was so much energy around that party that uh it would be impossible for me to feel like that there was a lull but i wasn't look out looking outside of it honestly it was dub war i was going to dub war monthly and then meeting lots of people there Promoters, DJs, producers, all sorts of people, dancers. So it felt like there was a real scene for what I wanted to do. And maybe that was just how cool and sort of ahead of the curve that Dub War was. It was bringing over this UK sound, you know? So yeah, no, it really wasn't dead for me. But I know that like in the indie rock scene. People certainly felt like it was dead then. Tell me about Dub War and Club Love and set the scene for me a little bit. Yeah. Club Love was an amazing place that was underneath a barbershop. or adjacent to it, sort of on the northwest corner of Washington Square Park, NYU territory. And yeah, it was cool because there was this real sort of, you had to go downstairs. It was kind of this dark, not scary element, but this dark sort of like what was waiting down there for you sort of feeling every time you entered the club. There was a room that was called the Fraggle Rock Room that looked like a big sort of gerbil run, you know, with like sort of tubes and areas to hang out. Fuzzy walls, as I remember. That's right. Yeah, fuzzy walls, which feel really good, you know, come 3 a.m. you're just like sort of clinging onto the wall and it feels really good sometimes. Or gross. But beyond that, what I think what really made the club was the sound system in the booth. and the style of sort of dead-sounding room. It was just this little box that comfortably fit about 150 people. It often had twice that amount of people in it, but comfortably fit 100 dancers. and had a lot of elements from the old Paradise Garage in the booth, including maybe the Bozak was from it, or the monitors in the booth might have been from that club. In any event, there was just history in that room and excellent sound people running that show and light people, too. Oh, what was her name? She would shoot a laser pen through crystals at the crowd, and it was incredible. And I don't think I appreciated it enough then, but looking back on it now, man, she was into it. But yeah, it was great. And I would walk down there and, you know, fashion was different then. This is 12 years ago. Like everything was different about all sorts of things, politics, fashion, music. But I really felt on a good night, you could go down there and get sort of lost in the. crowd and just be one of many in a way. And I never felt like I stood out awkwardly or anything. And I was actually even straight edge at the time. Like I wouldn't drink, I would just drink water and sort of hang out in the corner. and I met Dave Q, who was running it, and we became fast friends, and he let me play many times. And yeah, we're still in touch, but the party, unfortunately, is no longer. Yeah, I feel like Dave Q is sort of someone who deserves his own RA exchange as sort of an unsung hero of the bass music and hardcore continuum here in New York City. Yeah. I mean, I like to tease him that he created dubstep in America, you know, what it has become now. This sort of, well, whatever. It's not gross. It is what it is. Some people like it. But yeah, he brought over Scream and Banga and Code 9. And did he bring Benny Ill over as well? I mean, he brought all these producers over for the first time. Vaccine, you know, so many people that had never played in New York and had never heard So partially responsible, definitely. You're from New Haven, Connecticut. Yeah. Is that right? That's right. And you played in a bunch of bands before you landed on making electronic music by yourself. I did, yeah. Really only one band that was sort of semi-serious. It was called Luggage. And for a short while, there was an umlaut over the U, and it was Lugage. You know, so just basically making really bad decisions together. But I played bass and it was fun. And I was just getting into electronic music. This is like 2002 to 2005. So I'm playing bass, but I'm also listening to Squarepusher and stuff like that. And I'm thinking, wow, I could really take this a lot further or I could at least get into like programming some other things. But it was fun being in a band and it was fun collaborating and jamming. And we played so many shows. We played like twice a week at least, you know, mostly locally. But got to play this one venue called Toad's Place, which is pretty famous in New Haven, which is come through. You know, growing up in New Haven, you're like right in between New York and Boston. And if you want to see anything decent, you got to go to one or the other, often New York. But there was this place, Toad's Place, that could get these bands on like an off night in between those weekends, you know, so you would see like... the entire Wu-Tang Clan on like a Wednesday night. And, you know, and it's just amazing. We're like George Clinton up close. And I knew the bouncers. I knew the club owners. I would go hang out upstairs. I would run downstairs and I'd get back into sort of the dressing rooms area and I would hang out with whoever was around and would put up with me. I met Razor Sharp, the keyboard player for George Clinton. We had a fun night together one time. you know i was like 17 18 it was cool i really liked it um and then your first solo records well i guess they weren't records they were digital releases online yeah but your first solo releases were these sort of insane like break core idm splatter break um splatter break yeah i like splatter break that's good um the first thing actually i think well yeah the first things were digital but there was a cd at one point in like 2007 but uh yeah digital splatter break releases i guess on various labels that would have me myspace era stuff you know What were you listening to at the time that was drawing you in that direction? I was really getting into Planet Mew. And I think at the time they were doing a lot of breakcore, you know, listening to Shitmat and Venetian Snares, but also Squarepusher and stuff like that. So the manic sort of style breaks was really interesting to me. It felt like there was a lot of room. to sort of do your own thing there. Because I really was like melody focused at the time as well. The drums were important, but I wanted to sort of bring my own thing to it. I don't think I ever really nailed it there, but looking back, it was just years of practice until I really found my sound, I think. But yeah, I even sent a lot of that stuff to a lot of labels back in the day. had some promising feedback, one of them being Mike Paradinas. And that started that relationship. Although none of that splatter break stuff, which is the only way I'm going to call that music from now on, by the way. You're welcome. And none of that ever really saw the light of day. Were you part of any kind of like IDM scene? Like was there, were you, if you can even call the American IDM movement a scene, like were you in touch with Kid 606 or any of the Tiger Beat 6 people? No, and that's a really good point. I was just listening to Kid So Sick the other day, and Miguel, I think it is, and we've maybe had one exchange since then. But no, I didn't know anyone then. And I know also Travis Machinedrum had been active for years. So there was Schematic, yeah, and all these other labels. But no, I didn't know any of these people. I mean, MySpace was my first sort of internet connection to other producers, and that was just online. I didn't meet anyone. And definitely in New Haven, there was no one really doing it. There was one person. named Peter Edwards, aka Casper Electronics, who's a pretty well-known circuit bender. And so we would do some circuit bent music together and stuff. But that was really it. That was it. I'd come into New York, though. I would start taking trips into New York to see groups like Plaid or whoever would come play a show here. That was my first foray into seeing electronic music live. Or Amon Tobin or something like that. Do you look back on those records like, wow, what a mess? Or do you actually... I remember someone once told me, I asked them, do you think you're a better artist because you're in practice and you've been touring and you have so much experience? And I remember she told me, no, in fact, I want to get back some of that youthful energy that was a rule-breaking instinct. Yeah, that's a good answer. I choose that. No, but like that's, yeah, that's, that's, I think that's true. And I talk to people about that now because the longer you stay sort of in this, in this game, so to speak, the more second guessing or the more thought you put into things. And maybe, maybe it's too much thought, you know, definitely just acted on impulse back then, which I've always done in my life. And for the most part. it's gotten me good things. Sometimes it's gotten me into trouble in other areas. But yeah, so I don't regret any of it. But yeah, the music itself is like, oh, it's kind of trash. But it was super fun. What's funny to me is how much I believed in it. But that still happens. Like, I'll listen to something I did two weeks ago that at the time I thought was genius. I listen back now and I think, what was I thinking? You know? Yeah, it's hard to self-edit and it's also hard to know which voice to listen to in your head. Are you ever tempted to do the more straightforward house and techno thing just because you know it will sell and you'll be able to get these big festival bookings? Are you ever tempted by... doing something more traditional because you know there's commercial potential or you know what i mean yeah no i do know what you mean um sure yeah i mean uh but i think i've always made stuff that's been sort of house adjacent someone said i was a house adjacent producer the other day i thought that was pretty cool i'd never heard that before is that a thing House adjacent? It is now. It is now. Splatter break. Splatterhouse. Splatterhouse. Yeah, right? Splatterhouse. I mean, like, so that's so, you know, I think I found out at some point that I couldn't do... I'm easily influenceable from what I listen to, but I actually don't make good copies of other ideas. It ends up coming out a bit weird in my own way, which I think is great. And I think once people realize that that's a strength of theirs, then you can listen to that. and accentuate that. But I, you know, yeah, I mean, there's been so many points in my career, if I can use that word, that I was faced with sort of a couple of decisions and I did not pick the decision that would. make my life financially more secure. I mean, there's been entire tours with bigger artists as support that I could go on that I've just said no to in the end because I felt uncomfortable about the whole thing. I didn't really want to be associated with that or I just felt like I couldn't take it on in my life because I'd rather sit around with my friends at home, you know? So not a great financial decision, but like... it is what it is and also you know i think there's so much that goes involved to like that's involved in a promoter deciding who they're going to book for something that often the music has nothing to do with it or not as much to do with it which which is cool because that means that a lot of A lot of different people are getting opportunity that didn't have it perhaps before. But I'm not one to judge what is mainstream or not and whether or not it deserves to get festival booking, you know? Yeah. But you've never, I mean, this sounds like a cliche, but you've never really fit into any of the boxes. Yeah. And I wonder what impact that... would have on your career if you were more marketable as one thing or another. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, well, so let's say I fit into one of those boxes and I had like one of those mile-long DJ booking lists, you know, where I'm like booking like eight months in advance or ten months in advance. Is that attractive to you? Not at all. On one hand, it is financially. Yeah, it's amazing. And like I would also, I mean, if I was that busy, I'd probably be getting even more money per show. But I just, I can't take that on. Like, I will sit in a studio and do 10-hour days with someone for weeks on end and be happier than a pig in shit. But if you tell me I've got to leave on Friday to go play this show somewhere, I'm shaking and I'm freaking out and I don't want to go anywhere, you know? And it wasn't always like that, but something did shift. And this has been an interesting sort of like thread that I've heard other people talk about. Is it mental health? Is it anxiety? Is it this? Is it that? You know, and I don't really, I think it's all of the above, but it's also decide the type of life you want to have and do it. And don't be afraid that it's not what other people are doing. You know, like the good things that have come out have come out of me being myself, not out of me copying anyone else or trying to like do anything else. Like that's never really worked out. Yeah. Rather than being like, well, the measure of success is a million gigs and, you know, a million flights. And yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But more power to them. Like that's dope. You know, I watch, I know friends of mine that do that. And some of them, uh, And some of them are falling apart and some of them are really strong and they're just crushing it. And it's and it's awesome. And I have a real joy for them. And that's another thing that's happened is that I've learned how to to just be happy for other people doing what it is that they want to do. If they're happy doing what they want, if they have what they want, you know, but if that thing is. that zeitgeist, you know, whatever. That's fine though. Good for them. That's awesome. I just hope that they're finding healthy ways to cope with all the traveling and stuff because that can get really hectic. I don't know if that answered your question, but trust me, I think about this all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. I mean, it's, yeah, it's like crossroads where you, you really have to decide if that's the kind of life you want to live, you know? Yeah. Well, so, okay. So then it's like, how do I make a living? Right. You know, and there's, there's, there's only so many other ways. If it's not playing to put together a real living because I have to make a living doing this or I need to get a full-time job and music becomes a hobby again and I wouldn't say I'm unemployable but it's been a long time since I've worked for someone else and I'm not exactly excited about that idea of showing up on listening with someone I think I don't take orders very well you know but maybe one of the happy mediums is producing for other folks, which I'm just starting to get into because I'm happy to take criticism from someone I'm trying to make their dream come true for them. That only helps. So since we're on the subject, you are executive producing the forthcoming Mickey Blanco album. Yeah. Is that something we're allowed to talk about? Yeah. It sounds so serious hearing you say it. I'm a serious guy. Hey. Can you tell me about what that's been like and where you're at in the process? Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, it's a hard thing to articulate because it's meant so much to me. I'll try my best to put words to it, but essentially how it's come about is me cold calling Mickey with a song and an email. not hearing anything for a little while, but maybe a couple months later, getting an email that was just like, whoa, what is this? This is amazing. And I'm like, it's yours. And he's like, oh, thanks so much. I'm also like, hey, you know, I've got this album I've made, but I don't think it's time for me to do another one. Check it out. Let me know if there's anything else you want. And Mickey's like, yeah, I ironically now a month or so into this project, a lot of those tracks that, that Mickey wanted, we're not even, I don't even know if we're going to use, or maybe in the future we will, but it started a conversation and a relationship that has just been so incredible. Like. waking up really excited about music, sort of in love with music again, in love with the idea of like working hard on something and having to put the work in because mixing vocals is a whole nother beast. Like recording it and mixing it is so different from just making a track, banging out a track and headphones are on my own late at night or whatever. So I'm in over my head, but in a great way. And in that way that I think David Bowie said so famously, like if you're just struggling to breathe, if you're a little bit underwater and your head's just poking out, that's like where you're going to make something good. And I keep telling myself that. And I think we're going to nail it. It's cool. So do you also have a hand in some of the songwriting aspect? Like, are you like, oh, no, like, I think the hook should go like this. Or, no, I think this part should come after that part. Sometimes, like, Timberley and pitch-wise and things like that. But when it comes to the actual lyric writing, I mean, I think Mickey is just so good at it and thinks of things that I could never think of. Although the atmosphere is so comfortable that I come up with things and I pitch ideas and some stick and some don't. But, uh... well, you know, it's interesting, you know, there's this worry. It's like, are the tracks like, are you going to mix the vocals better? Is it going to sound good? Is it going to sound good enough? And I'm like, yeah, what you basically need to do is let me have the tracks on my computer. Let me lock myself away for like a month and just sit there in my underwear and like tinker and tinker and trial and error and try things and try things. It's like yeah, this isn't fun at all. I'll see you later. Let me know when it's done. It's really boring. And it's why I hesitate to send working versions to people, you know, it's like, let me just get it there. Have you been listening to rap or vocal music in order to steal and borrow techniques for vocal production? Yeah, actually. I wanted to interrupt you and be like, well, I'm always listening to rap and hip-hop and rock and stuff like that. And the Beach Boys haven't left my... playlist for years now. In fact, before this project started, I was already singing on stuff. None of it's been released, but part of that album had my vocals on a lot of the tracks. And maybe one day there'll be another version of it that'll come out. But yeah, yeah, so much. It's an art form in and of itself. And you can't expect to just rock up and know how to mix vocals. You got to try all these things and read and research and experiment and also invest. I got this crazy microphone just for this project, basically. And, uh, but you know, it's going to pay for itself and it's really awesome. Yeah. It's interesting when you, when you listen to something that is produced by someone who. clearly has spent a long time working with vocals versus don't yeah like there are all these little things that you're like oh my god i never would have thought of that like um there's that suction effect of the reverse vocal going into when the vocal starts you know what i mean just like these little things like and you don't know it's missing until you hear truly beautiful vocal production you know yeah yeah but also but then i listen to stuff that's like made in someone's bedroom you know with one mic just like an sm57 you know a cheap microphone and it's just sort of blown out punk style and like if the song sounds good, it's good. If it has a vibe and it's true, right? It's like, that's like Hemingway, right? It's like, if it's true and it has a vibe, then it's good. And so, yes, we could sit in a studio and I could pay someone two grand a day and use all these different microphones to really make it sound amazing. And on some tracks, it'll call for that. But on some tracks, it's like, put the distortion And it's punk, you know, and that's awesome. And that's a vibe. And sometimes you get lucky. And sometimes you're like, oh, no, I should have spent more time on that. Are you more sample oriented or a synth guy? Way more sample oriented. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. but maybe going through some growing pains with that. I think as I've released things over the years and gotten a little bit more well-known, like I got to a point with some of the Ninja Tune releases where they were like, we can't release this sample. We can't, we don't want to clear this or we can't afford that or whatever, or, or they were too nervous about it. So you sort of, you can hit a wall, I think if you're going really egregiously and, and sort of producer. I'm in a lot of its programs, lots of little programs that do very specific things, you know, and then Reason is sort of at the center of it all. But yeah, I got, I'd much rather have analog instruments. I got a piano and I got my flute and I have my bass and I have a guitar and stuff like that. And I've had other woodwinds and vocalists, you know. I prefer all that to stay sort of musical in a way. Is it nice to get out of the box? Yeah, it's really nice. So the way I have my piano set up over there behind you is so great because it's nowhere near my computer. I literally, I swivel my chair over there and there's no computer and I wake up some days and I make music with my coffee before I've done emails or generally after I've done emails. And I just make it and I don't record it. And it's like I've made music for myself and then it's gone. It's sort of a, is that Zen? I don't know what that is. That's like a weird philosophy, right? It's like you make something, the impermanence of it is sort of attractive, you know? And I'm not worrying about who's going to hear it or if it's going to get released or not. I mean, I worry about that stuff later. Trust it's nice to just make it and have it go away. You're also not making it with like the pipeline in mind of like, okay, this is going to get produced and then this is going to get distributed and then it's going to be played in this particular context. It's like, you're not thinking about five steps ahead. Whereas I think inherently with something like techno, you have to keep in mind the room in which it's going to be played because you have to think about the dynamics, the crowd, the time of night. You know what I mean? And there's something beautiful about doing it without considering the way it'll be reproduced. Yeah, definitely. I mean, and can't you tell just by looking at how messy, like how much stuff is in this room? Can't you tell I don't make techno? Like, if I made techno, the walls would be, like, super clean, and there'd be, like, two objects in here. And one of them, like, you couldn't even, like, you couldn't look at. It just was, like, it was like a statue or something. angular minimalist design yeah no no no i'm like give me some yeah give me some yeah give me some soft edges but um yeah i still worry about stuff but again it's the stuff that i don't worry about that i just make you know my cousin is a writer and a movie and a filmmaker and he just sent me an email that was so hilarious and i know he's writing a film right now and i was like are you writing like this and he was like no i was just trying to make you laugh And I was like, well, I think there's a musical equivalent of this and it's not. thinking is just like making stuff, you know, and then putting it out there. And I want to get back to that even more and more, you know, I don't know about the putting it out there part, but the just making, you know, don't be afraid to go there, make everything, edit later. I didn't go to art school. I didn't go to music school. A lot of my friends did, and they have MFAs and I talk to them all the time. I'm like, so But one thing that my buddy Tom, who's done a lot of my artwork over the years, Tom Simon, he says, like, don't be afraid to go there. Make everything. Even if you think it's awful or cheesy or whatever, just make it. Finish it. No one has to hear it. No one's going to know you made it if you don't want. Just make it. And then decide later if it's shit or not, you know? You put out Elysia Crampton's first record How did you identify Alicia Crampton? What made you say, oh my God, this person is a massive talent? Yeah. What was the spark that you identified? Yeah, well, it was E plus E releases that I really liked her prior producer name. And I'd gotten in touch after I had heard... I heard like Fire Gut and a couple other really beautiful tracks. And I wanted a remix for a track of mine. This was 2013 or 2014. And I was emailing with Elijah at first. And then a couple weeks later, I was emailing with Alicia. And we were talking a little bit about what was going on with us and stuff. And she did this incredible remix for me that came out on Ninja Tune around the release of my album In the Wild. I think that was 2014. And I just said, I put it out there. I was like, you know, I would love to work with you. I've started this label. If there's anything you'd like to put out there, you know, I'm all ears. Like anything, anything you want to do. And it was always just very sort of polite. And we had a nice rapport, a And the funny thing about Alicia is I've always felt like, well, why hasn't a big label just come along and like really you know swooped her up yet and and i'd even love to help that i've told her i was like if you want me to help you get in touch with any big labels let me know you know that's assuming she's not doing what she wants to do and she's definitely i think crushing it and doing what she wants to do but um in any event she sent me uh like a like a you know a 30 minute mp3 that would that was american drift just as one sort of song And she sent it to me right before I got on a flight coming back from London. And I must have listened to it maybe five or six times on that flight. And I had already drafted the email I wanted to send by the time I land and hit send the minute I got, I think, service back on my phone and said, I want to do this. I would love to do this. We can do anything you want. Artwork, you know, any way you want to release this. I'm super happy about it. And I think some other labels were talking to her at the time. So I just would, I would always be very helpful, you know, and this is the way I've worked with all my artists. It's basically an amalgamation of all of my relationships with label heads in the past, sort of the best parts of those, of those individual relationships, I think. And one of them is just being open and, and, you know, and ready to hear no. but also excited to help out. And Alicia basically just said to me, you know, Drew, you're the only, well, you've just been so honest and forthcoming with me. I really want to do this record with Blueberry. And that was like the greatest day, you know? It was a real turning point for Blueberry. A lot of prior releases had been... me hitting up some OGs that I was just a big fan of, like Digo and Todd Osborne and Luke Vibert and stuff, you know, and I was like, I really need to branch out and get some, some new, some, get back to some new blood in here. Cause that's why I started the label was for bird. You know, that was his first album. Um, and he's doing something else for me now, actually. But yeah, we've kept in touch. I had dinner with Alicia maybe six months ago, or maybe it was even more than that now, when she was in New York one night. And we met up at Hooters in Midtown at like 1 a.m. It was really fun. And her suggestion. And, you know. I think she's one of the, she's a giant. She's a musical giant, both in thought and in performance. If you haven't seen Alicia perform, you haven't seen like what electronic music can be right now. It's so much different than sort of the old tropes. And also like the keytar. And there's like, there's some drama and theater involved in her performance. Her vocal range is wild, you know? I mean, yeah, I hope we get to work together again. I just, you know, I'll always be very grateful that I got to put that out, you know? And it was great for the label, and I think it did really well by her as well. So success all around, you know? As a label owner, are you pretty hands-on? Like, for instance, do you offer feedback and say, oh, I think this should be a minute longer, or I don't like that bass line? Do you handhold through the process at all? Sometimes, only if it feels like that's wanted by the producer. But generally, no. I mean, I'd rather say to someone, keep working or do you have anything else to hear than give specific feedback on a song unless they've asked for that. It can really go either way. I'm happy to give that feedback. But then again, what do I know? I'm really interested in signing minds that are so unique that they're just thinking differently from me anyway. And they're coming up with melodies and rhythms that are way outside of my own wheelhouse. So I don't really know how to critique it. I'm like, yeah, this is weird. This is cool. Let's do it. Sort of first thought, best thought. If I hear something and I love it Yeah, totally. You know, I don't think I've ever really given very specific. I've been like, oh, can I have the stem so I can make an edit or a remix of it? I've done that on a few tracks for people and sort of done what I wanted to do. But yeah, I'm not I'm not interested in really, really changing anyone's music too much. And then in another interview, I think it was, it might have been you and Squarepusher sitting down for a one-on-one. You mentioned the press aspect of things and specifically press releases. being kind of stressful for you because you mentioned that every i mean an album is expected to have a story yeah and part of a pr person's job is sort of weaving that tale and sort of giving it a conceptual or narrative back because that's sexy and that sells. Is that something you think about a lot? Well, it's interesting you say that because I actually, I think traditionally that's the PR person's job, but I don't think PR does that anymore. PR send a lot of emails and they receive emails and they forward you ideas and things that are coming in. But I think the label and the artist are the ones who sort of come up with the story. Yeah, it's incredibly stressful, you know, for like different reasons. It's stressful because the truth is when I'm like getting ready to put out an album, yo, here's 45 minutes of the best music I made to the best of my ability in the last 18 months. And I feel, and I deem it worthy to release. And hopefully I think it's the best thing I've ever done. What more do you need to know? You know what I mean? I don't want to hear the story of how Aphex Twin made his last album. I just want to hear it. But also, music comes in waves, how politicized music is. And right now, it's highly politicized. So if it's a way of you telling your story, then that's awesome. I'm not sure that I have a hand in that. in that game so to speak or anything that interesting about about myself politically that i want to shout about i mean i've got ideas and other thoughts and stuff but um maybe maybe the idea of me just saying here's my philosophy at the moment and here's the music that's backing that that's just not that interesting to me you know i mean does it sound good or does it not you know that's all that's sort of important to me About my own music. Yeah. I mean, relationship with press is like, that could be a whole nother exchange, but the short of it is that it changes as you stay in music for longer. It comes and it goes and you're in fashion and then you're out of fashion and maybe you get another. So if you catch a few waves and... troughs so to speak you you can get a little hardened and seasoned by the whole thing and maybe turned off by sort of those things and and i think i'm at a point now where i'm way more open and just relaxed about that stuff i used to be really because Because when you start, if you're lucky enough to get some heat behind you in the beginning, you get shot right up and you're on all these people's end of year lists and you're on all the cool gigs and you're doing remixes for crazy people, you're opening for Radiohead, you're doing all this stuff. A year later, you might have zero gigs and no records and you might even drop by the label that did the other stuff. So there's no real job security in what we do. you know? And some of that has to do with if press is writing about you or not. Some of it doesn't. It's in that same category as like, try not to think about it as much, you know? Try to just make your music, try to just do your thing. But it's hard. It's really hard, you know? Do you read your reviews? Yeah, definitely. Not all of them, but a lot of them. Yeah, for sure. And do you take them into account? A lot of people have a pretty antagonistic relationship to their reviewers. They've pretty hardened at this point, like you said, where they're like, fuck the music media. They're a bunch of parasites just leeching onto the real artists. Yeah, but the truth is I actually know, of the music reviewers that I know personally, there's a really high percentage of quality in that group. that are really good and that have been doing it for a long time. And I, and I think care as much about the reviews as much as the producers do that go into that music. So, yeah, maybe don't think about the ones that are not making the most insightful comments on your music. But if I get some really good constructive criticism from someone that I respect and have, like, had a back and forth with for years, like Joe Muggs, for instance, someone who's been writing about my music since, like, 2008 for a good decade now, like, I'm going to listen to what Joe says, you know? might not change anything. I don't know. It's so funny. I mean, that can become your vibe, antagonistic, right? That could become what you're known for. And I don't think that's a very good thing. You know, it doesn't really work. It doesn't really work. And you're allowed to sort of go through that and figure out that that doesn't work. And hopefully people forgive you. You know, hopefully you come out on the other end and you still get a shot. and you still get a hand and you still get delta delta set of cards again you know there's some people who have like a kind of wise antagonism and i think like anthony bourdain is a great example of someone who was like antagonistic uh in like a very intentional and and like wise way yeah um um that's not like it's not bitter but it is kind of mean i don't know i feel like there's a way to pull it off but genuine generally i think you're right you're doing it doing it smart yeah no for sure um and i think everyone appreciates wit and being clever but uh You know, I have this deeper philosophy in life that's hard because I'm connected to family and loved ones and friends that keep me grounded. But I have a serious streak inside of me that is a bit anarchic. Anarchic? Anarchaic? Anarchic. Thank you. Antarctic? And it's very cold. No. But I have this part of me that wants to act on every first impulse and not think about anything else. So what that means is once a conversation has started about artwork, I feel like the art is no longer relevant. Some people would say the art is there to start the conversation. I think that once people are writing about it and talking about it, I feel like the moment, the artistic moment, the beautiful moment is completely gone. And that's... That's for good reviews and bad reviews. You know what I mean? I just think that it would be really beautiful if you could just make something and have it just exist purely alone, like this sort of pure art form that isn't at all colored by any sort of commentary around it. I mean, it has problems with it, this philosophy, but... Well, it's interesting because often on the same token, often the writing about the art object is what canonizes it or elevates it or creates a mythology around it. Yeah. That's what elevates it to greatness. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. But here's the thing. What should really decide if something's great? Just you. Your eyes and your ears and whatever else you're using to experience something, right? I mean, I don't want to be told what's great. I really don't. I don't want to be told what's bad either. I hate the news. You know, I hate all this stuff. I want to be able to make my own decisions and... we are increasingly all as a human race coming to a place where we're losing our own free thought. We're all influenced by whatever, what other people are thinking and saying online. And there's a collective sort of hive mind mentality, mob mentality and virtue seeking element that clouds the intake of information. you know so if you don't believe in criticism as a way of saying if something is good or bad or you don't believe that there should be arbiters of taste do you still think that writing about art and music has a role yeah definitely i do uh Because like you said, it's the way that so many of us do find out about things. So I am at odds with this. But, you know, if so, if our tools get to a point where we can we can share things without anyone writing about it, would that be good? You know, I don't want to take away the profession of a lot of folks that write about stuff. And like, it's still very important. And I read articles on R.A. and other sites that I love and that I Only allow so much of yourself to be persuaded by someone else's thoughts before you don't have your own opinion anymore of something, you know. But so, okay, so what's a really good review? A really good review just does a good job of getting you to the artwork, I think. Exactly. You know? I agree. Yeah, I think that's what's really good. Of like illuminating the insights and drawing your eye or your ear to what aspects of it make it great. And if no one wrote about my music, then I wouldn't have a career. So it is what it is. Have you ever had a significant creative block that you've had to push through? I mean, you're so prolific that the edge is probably no. Well, I mean, for me, 24 hours of not being able to do something can feel like a significant block. And that started very early on by implementing what I felt was a good work ethic, mostly by coming from a long line of people that work like hard nine to fives. And I did before music work, like show up and do a lot of. manual labor jobs and some other things too i taught as well but like all these different kinds of like draining jobs where you put so much of yourself into it so if i'm doing music i got to do that as well and if i spend a day and i can't get anything going at the end of the day i feel like what did i do and as i'm now 35 it's no longer a little what did i do it's like a what am i doing with my life you know It gets bigger. I think generally what happens if I feel like I am at a moment of writer's block, it's because I'm sort of a writer. abusing the same musical system over and over again. And I'm not, I'm not getting outside of my comfort zone and trying new things. It might be as simple as updating a bit of software, getting a new synth or a new instrument, working with someone else. I mean, there's so many ways to, to get yourself out of your own way to keep it going. And that's like advice I would give to people is to just like literally physically try and do something different. Also, you know, I hang out with some producers who are like, yeah, I just can't write anything. I'm like, all right, well, what'd you do today? And they're like, well, I got coffee. And then I went to the gym and I went food shopping. And I was like, well, did you just sit at your computer? Did you like physically get there and try? And that's at least sometimes I feel like up to 50% of the battle is like just getting yourself there, having good practices, you know. It's good to hear that someone thinks I'm prolific because I think often that I'm, I know what my days look like. I know when I'm like, if I'm sitting down and that PlayStation is turned on by 2 p.m., it was not a productive day. You know what I mean? Anyways. Well, it's interesting because to talk about creative routines, a lot of people will tell you, you should go to the gym, you should run errands because these things get you, get your mind going and they get you into some kind of, you know, like circadian cycle or whatever. And sitting in your house in your sweatpants may not be the best. way for some people to get their ideas out. You know what I mean? Yeah. So it's interesting that you say like, you know, some people over structure their days because otherwise they feel like they're floating and they're lost in space. Yeah. Yeah. Um, no, definitely go to the gym, go food shopping, like take care of yourself. Those are both forms of therapy in a way. Um, but, uh, also get yourself in front of your music making, you know, Put yourself in the captain's chair. Get there. Put that into the schedule as well. But the gym is a funny thing because part of it's vanity, but it really is an incredible form of therapy. When you're in the gym and you see someone with that thousand... thousand yard stare and they're just like they are deep in some crazy thought and then you see them like rep out 10 reps of like bench press or whatever it is they're doing you're like cool they just got through that little uh they just burst that cloud you know um And it was something that was happening to me when I was getting ready to put out Heaven is for Quitters, my last Faulty DL album. This is like late 2016. I was like, you know what? This is going to come out. I'm not going to get the press that I would like or whatever, probably. All these things are going to happen that feel like they're outside of my control. I was sort of craving some form of control. And it came out on my own label. So I had 100 I need a little more of control of something in my life. I'm going to, I'm going to join the gym across the street. And I joined it and I went every day for like six months. Like it was insane. I got addicted to it and I completely transformed my body. I had like lower back pain. I had anxiety. I had all these, all these physical elements and I'm now 35 and in the best shape of my life. And I ride my bike every day and I'm out and I'm more, And that felt incredible just to, I was like, if I don't have control over my music career in some aspects of it, at least I have control of what happens in this gym, you know? And it can be anything, you know, pick up another hobby, do something else too. I think that's really important. One of the things you just suggested was changing your setup or introducing a foreign element or a new method or a new technique. You said you just updated your copy of Reason, which was from the early 2000s. You had Reason 3, and now you're rocking Reason 10. So over the course of a few months, you've jumped 13. years into the future. Yeah, it's cool. I remember hearing about VSTs and being like, what kind of STD is that? I can't use any of those. What's a VST? Now I have so many VSTs. Yeah, it's cool when you let a long time go and then you update and all of a sudden you're brought into the present because there's been a lot of advancements. I tried a couple things. I tried reason four at one point. I tried six for about a week. And all of it was such a huge change to the GUI that I freaked out. The simple key commands that I always knew, my flow was interrupted. And I was like, not today. So I would get back on version three and just keep going. Until you'd get frustrated by, like, you can't print audio into Reason version 3. You know, like, you'd have to start the song over at the beginning of the sample to hear the whole thing. Even if it starts two minutes in, you'd have to start at the beginning of the triggered part of it. Just silly things like that. So the workflow has gotten incredibly quicker. And that... you know, yielded me about an album and a half so far, if not more. So it's done its job for sure. And what do you think introducing the organic instrumentation like the flute and the piano has done for your process? I mean, you said earlier that it was nice to be able to swivel around and get out of the headspace of being in the box. But what do you think it's done to introduce that more traditional musical element? Well, it's, uh... It's made me a better engineer and a better musician as well. I mean, recording real audio is way different from playing a soft synth on your computer because you're wrangling with so many different points of connection. There's so much electricity that's involved and EQing and different things that you never have to worry about when you're just playing on the whatever synth comes with whatever program. I spend a good part of my day watching YouTube tutorials on how to record upright piano. A million different mic techniques. Tomorrow I'm going to pull it about a foot and a half back from the wall. and try miking it behind and opening up the bottom part of it. I'm just going to experiment with it. And once you start doing that, you know, you're not going to yield a final product for a while. So it's like you're walking a mile into the woods. You know, you better, it better be, you have some comfortable shoes on because it's going to be a while before you get anything out of it. Does the lifestyle of an artist agree with you just on a day-to-day basis yeah i mean the way i do it it does you know i i think that's a pretty open question in a sense you know of what what that can be i basically i need to have a balance of good and bad practices to feel sort of fulfilled And it's changed a bit as I've gotten older. I think I'm more sensible now. But, you know, everything from just your daily routine to, like, taking care of yourself to, like, used to go to bed at 4 a.m. no matter what, even if I wasn't playing, to, like, going to bed at a more reasonable hour and enjoying the early hours of the morning, you know? Being very productive at, like, 8 a.m. sometimes, 7 a.m. And the hedonistic aspects, going to shows, you know, doing drugs and like, you know, being in a solid relationship versus sort of just being single and out there, you know, like all these things are always at odds with each other in a lot of ways. And I don't, and luckily I haven't, I've never, I've never gotten out of control with anything in my life. adult life. I did when I was a kid, I got really out of control with, with drugs when I was like 15, 16, 17 to the point where I did rehab and detox and all that stuff. And then years and years of 12 step programs. Well, it's cool that you got it out of the way early. Hey, I think so. But, you know, it's funny. My friends always look at me with this weird perplexed, like, I'll go grab a beer or smoke a joint with some friends, whatever. And they'll be like, Drew, you really can't. just enjoy that beer without thinking about going over the deep end, huh? And I was like, yes, that's absolutely true. There's always in the back of my mind every time I smoke or drink or do anything that I think I am a few bad decisions away from losing it all again. which is intense but also good it's a great safety system i mean i'll take the little bit of worry and anxiety over knowing that i'm actually being healthy you know do you think that like the unstructured life of an artist makes that particularly difficult because you can like go out and party and kind of make your own schedule yeah definitely yeah yeah for sure and also you get offered things like i go to shows all the time and i get offered cocaine and i'm like i don't want to do any If anything, I want to go down. That's more of a personal preference. To be honest, I don't judge you if that's what you do at all. Just don't talk to me too much because you're annoying. But, you know, do your thing. Clubs are an interesting space to occupy in 2018. You know, there's a lot of things going on. There's a lot of layers of it's an intersectional spot for a lot of different things that are happening, you know, inside and outside of the body, essentially. Yeah. You know? Can you expand? Yeah, definitely. First of all, I'm no longer a young person in the club. I'm not the oldest, but I'm not the youngest in the club. So there's a good generation or two between me and the... And, you know, in New York, you got to be generally 21 to go into some clubs, most clubs. So I'm often... 15 years older than a lot of folks in there. So we just have, we're at different places in our life. Also, I can't shake off a hangover like you can, a young kid. You know what I mean? Like I wake up and it might take me a day or two to recover. And I just don't want to do that. I just want to be able to go to the gym and feel good the next day. Do you find that New York has like a high turnover rate in terms of generations? I think that here more than in other cities, like you can show up, rock shit for three years, and then all of a sudden you're at the top of the pile. What I've found is that it doesn't take many years of proving yourself and that in fact you can sort of rock it to the top. quickly yeah maybe i mean i i mean i don't know what it's like in other cities though but but i would definitely agree with that um i don't know if that's an overall technology thing where we're at with sharing stuff or if that is a new york specific thing but that's actually that's pretty interesting yeah i also thought what you meant by that was just the scenes and there's been since sort of the dubstep thing, then post dubstep and then techno again, and then lo-fi house or whatever, you know, there seems to be every, every two years or so a new thing. And then you generally, if it's good, there's a club behind it. You know, we had, we had club love and dub war. you know, up in recently there's been bossa nova civic club and lo-fi house. I don't know if those two go together or not. Uh, they kind of do in my mind. Um, and it's great. So if there's like a good club or two and, and a bunch of producers around that and DJs, then yeah, in a couple of years it can be huge. It can be really big. Do you ever feel like it's moving too fast and the hype cycle is vicious and it builds people up and breaks them down at an alarming rate? Well, yeah. I mean, yeah, because I don't want – I mean, I know what it's like to be built up and then broken down. And I'm lucky that it didn't make me go over the edge. Some people can really get – fall into a depression. because of that. I mean, I've flirted with depression all the time, unfortunately. I still do. But, and anxiety. And a lot of that has to do with being a freelancer with no job security and a really fickle business at the end of the day. So, yeah. So I hope that young kids, if they go, if they, you know, the faster they go up, I hope they don't fall that fast as well. But they might not necessarily. I really don't know. That's another thing I've had to remind myself is that if I feel like I'm seeing patterns. I have to be open to the idea that some people are going to break those patterns and they're going to do their own thing. And that's, and that's relieving. And I think that's also, it's just endearing. And that's a good model to look at, look at how someone handles something. And then, you know, it goes, you know, fuck it. I'm gonna do my own thing. Watch, watch me go this way now. And they can still ride that wave. You know, For a lot of us, dubstep was truly an inflection point where something radically different and like that was immediately identifiable as drastically different. and new and exciting. And a lot of the talk around that is that we haven't really had an upheaval or a shakeup since then. Do you believe that? Or do you think we're due for one? Or do you think that's fatalistic to say that we haven't had anything that drastic since then? Well, maybe nothing that big. I mean, dubstep comes from things. And there's an amalgamation of things. But it was definitely a new thing. It wasn't a revival of an older sound like Houses or Techno, which keeps coming around every 18 months, you know, and there's new producers that keep coming and do sort of a bit of a fresher take on it or something you haven't heard or Nick and Acapella you just haven't heard before. But Footwork was as exciting to me, you know, in juke music as Dubstep was. I think what Alicia Crampton does and Rabbit and Low Tick and I remember someone said it was called Epic Collage and I don't know if they liked that or not, but I think that's a good way of saying it, you know. But if they're not as, but dubstep was so big, look where it went. I was at an Applebee's on Flatbush Avenue with Dave Q and Lofa in 2012 or whatever, having like $5 margaritas. And Skrillex is on the screen receiving a Grammy and shouts out, South London boys or whatever making dubstep. And Lofa is just like, you know, mouth dry. And I was just like, right, so that's where that went. That's how big that got, you know? I don't know if someone's going to shout out Alicia Crampton in five years because of their really cool, weird music they're making, you know? So I guess time will tell. I hope so. I hope, yeah. I mean, also like as an A&R for Blueberry, it's really exciting because I hope I am, my finger is on the pulse where I can pick up some things that are going to be really, really cool and at the beginning of something new, you know. I'd rather get something at the beginning than something that's already proven to be good in the middle. ♪ ♪ Thank you. Thank you.
