you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. On this edition of the podcast, we're taking a final look back at 2010 with a special roundtable discussion. with a number of RA contributors. Over the course of this lengthy conversation, you can expect to hear us talk about some of the DJs, the live acts, the labels, the mixes, the albums, tracks, and trends that define the past 12 months. So this is quite a unique podcast. I'm very excited to have all of these RA writers together here in late December. My name is Todd Burns. I'm the editor of RA. I'm Will Lynch. I write the news at RA. I'm Ryan Keeling, a staff writer at RA. My name's Jack Highton, one of the staff reviewers. I'm Philip Sherburne, a staff reviewer. I'm Christine Kikari. I work for RA Tickets and do a little bit of writing as well. I think more than that. So let's start. the year, the oft-discussed Ricardo Villobos. in their poll, actually. - I did not. - Okay. I didn't either. - Nor did I. - No, I didn't this year. - I had him in there. and took him out. So you wrote one review, at least this year, of Ricardo, and I think you saw him a couple of times. You wrote a review of seeing him at Watergate, which was, you were not that impressed. Yeah, right. Well, basically, I mean, I guess I would say overall, I still think of Ricardo in a long-term sense as one of my favorite DJs. But I probably saw him four or five times this year. And Watergate was by far the worst I've seen him. And that was, you know, basically when going into it, I knew it could go either way. But I didn't expect it to be quite so boring. and it was kind of a strange DJ set because on the one hand he had a lot of great records like one that stuck out to me was he played this Three Chairs track that was really very deep and the fact that he thought to bring it to that party kind of shows how like if he had been in top form it might have been really good but he just wasn't and he it seems like he hasn't been in a long time but then at the same time I saw him I saw him at Club Divisionaire on May 1st and it was far and away the best time I've ever seen him and for me like one of my favorite DJ sets I've ever seen And it was like, you would assume it was the least likely time that he would be good. Like he'd been up all night at Sunwaves in Romania the night before. He was totally pale and covered in sweat. And the whole place was, it was so packed, you couldn't even dance on the deck outside the dance floor. And like people were knocking the needles off the records every fifth track. But it was still just unbelievable. The music selection and the mix. and everything um was basically everything could hope for from like a you know really good dj set but um so yeah i just think it's strange um that you should probably know as well he's playing with zip yeah it was him and zip yeah and um and they definitely have a pretty good chemistry together and everything but um anyway I guess I think he's interesting because um it's still he's not just uh I don't think he's done or anything like that it's not like he's all hype or I don't know if it's for whatever reason when you go to see him it's unlikely that you'll get the Ricardo Villalobos experience that probably made him number one was he still playing records that just I mean, we're so almost out of place in any other person's DJ set, the parties that you saw. Well, I mean, when I saw him at Sonar, it was basically like the first two hours, it could have been that every single song was on Cocoon. And then the third hour, he started playing all his own classics, which at least made it kind of fun. But it was just like... fonts over 808 the bass queen segued into MDMA and it's you know so I don't know it's just like it sounded like someone doing an impersonation of Ricardo Villalobos and um what was the venue? um that ridiculous beach Club with the horrible sound. But anyway, and then Club Revisionaire was the opposite. Like, aside from the few, you know, classics, like Feeling Sad or whatever, I didn't recognize a single thing for like three hours. Except for live jams, actually. I think that's the same thing you put in your Watergate review. It's like, if you catch him at the right time, it's still going to be... But I feel like... It's becoming less and less. Right, and I feel like the reason he's number one is because enough people have seen him at some point where it's that slam dunk DJ set, but those hardly ever happen anymore with him, it seems. It seems like more and more... People this year saw Soul Clap, who were the highest debut, I think, in the DJ pool. And I mean, the Wolf and Lamb crew, they're associated with sort of all kind of made jumps, because I think... It was the first time they really went at it in Europe in a major way. You're, sorry to focus so much on you early on, Will, but you're from Boston, Soul Clapper from Boston. I found it interesting when you wrote up in the DJ poll, you know, these guys were playing at like a department store a couple of years ago. Yeah, I mean, I think, I guess... I would explain their meteoric rise by basically, first of all, they're extremely serious about what they do. When I lived in Boston and there was not that big of a scene there or whatever, they had a Wednesday night party and just basically worked their asses off and got really good guests that very few people in Boston could even fully appreciate. And you could just tell they were, you know, 100. determined basically to do this and I think it was kind of them and wolf and lamb was a really good match because they both have that kind of pop sensibility that's kind of rare in European club music and I think sorry sorry I was just gonna ask was their sound in any way similar back then So how it is now? I don't know. I only saw them a few times when I lived in Boston. But I think now, like when I just saw them at Trout, the RA party, I thought it was, they had kind of taken what I considered, or what I had pictured to be their sound, and it was a lot more tailored for European clubs. Like it, I don't know, not as much pop. influence, no edits or anything like that the whole time, I think. But, um, so yeah, I think this summer they kind of came into their own. They're, I think they're like past as DJing anything and everything in Boston, all kinds of parties, sort of hone their abilities, DJs, to like be able to figure out the of where they're playing and like sort of tailor what they're doing to that. Right, yeah, I mean, well, that's the thing, like, with them playing Macy's, which is kind of an example of what I was saying earlier, that they were just, you know, determined to be, to DJ full-time, to just, you know, to have this be what they do, to DJ. So, yeah, they were playing Macy's, and I read somewhere in some interview that they were saying that's part of why they got so good at it was the only thing they had to work with and then they kind of got used to playing these records and you know got ideas of how to throw them into their like cooler sets and now that's kind of their special edge that they have that you know those wildcard tracks. I think it's interesting that they want to stick with that that they somehow want to carry that over and they wouldn't just want to shed that coming to Europe. Yeah, I mean, to me it's kind of like, I think it's more common in American DJ culture and everything to sort of reappropriate pop or mainstream music and stuff like that. And it's a lot less common here, so it ends up being like, in a European club context, it's kind of their calling card that, I don't know, they'll play like a Michael Jackson track or something like that. That would probably be that. I was just gonna say isn't that also partly their edge is that and there's hardly the only people doing this but by doing so many of their own edits and kind of putting their own stamp on on the records that they're playing that's kind of I don't want to say it's just branding but it's kind of part of the whole experience right you know you're gonna go see soul clap you know you're gonna hear their record or you're gonna hear classics with their spin on it And I think it's even kind of the way like, I don't know, it's sort of a middle path between DJing and live sets and like here you have people who want to be doing their own production and they want to sort of make it recognizably theirs. They want to own their material. you know, they've stuffed their bag full of edits. Do you think their place in the poll is based on their skills as DJs or because of this sense that we're talking about here of fun that they have? and their gigs, you know, you're going to hear a Michael Jackson record, you're going to hear this pop classic that everyone's going to put their hands in the air for. I think it's hard to draw the line between DJ skills and what the DJ set sounds like, you know, like I remember someone was talking about their set at the Bar 25 closing party and the first thing I said was like, oh, that Talk Talk edit was just unbelievable. You know, it was like, Soul Clap was great, the Talk Talk blurred now haven't they between you know the records people are putting out there especially when they didn't put the original artist names Oh, Jack. I just think they have this whole collective family thing going on which they bring to their parties. They make everyone feel part of their thing. This, you know, the Massey Hotel and they're all kind of buddies and pals and this transfers and people get a feeling for that when they go to see one of their gigs. And I think that's one of the reasons for their surge in popularity. A bit of an aspirational thing. Yeah. Perhaps. I could be that cool one day. So speaking of eternally cool, the guy that you, I don't know if you put the number one as your DJ. I think Jack and I both did, yeah. DJ Harvey. Right, yeah. What to say about DJ Harvey? you He played in Pan Am Bar, I think in September, was it? I think it was earlier in the summer, perhaps. After some 10 years of exile to the United States, obviously stoking expectations, you know, hearing stories of his legendary sets when he'd turn up at Ministry of Sound with only a plastic bag full of five records, of which he played A and the B side with his head. mixes have filtered through over the years sarcastic disco and everything it's essentially like an early version of what Soul Clap and all these people are doing, you know, playing these kind of weird, trashy records and having fun, you know? And so obviously expectations were huge. Normally that's a really bad sign. Just as a little aside, I don't know if any of you guys heard this, but I'd heard that it actually took a bit of convincing to him to actually accept that gig. I don't know if anybody heard that. Ken Arimovar specifically. Why? I've no idea. I know one of the conditions was that if you were going to play then it'd have to be for some time like six hours or the whole night. I think that's a pretty rush. He had to play the A side and the B side. Right. Record he brought. Yeah, I saw him build at a festival in I think Finland and you looked down the listing and it was like DJ A playing 45 minutes, DJ B playing 45 minutes, DJ Harvey six hours. I think it was, that's not inaccurate. Yeah. I mean you're kind of setting yourself up there for a fool but it was I must say with no sense of hyperbole the best DJ set I think I've ever seen. It was just a party wasn't it? The silly string, the balloons, do you remember that? The cake coming out of your hand. Yeah it was like a carnival in there. It was balmy. But also at the same time everything was spot on. You couldn't fault his mixing, you couldn't fault his selection. Everyone was walking around that place. Normally it's just full of zombies at that time on a Sunday afternoon but everyone had beaming smiles on their faces. It was an electric atmosphere. I remember being surprised too by his selections. I'd never seen him before and I expected it to be sort of all disco, all Beardo, all the time. And I remember he pulled out that track Angie's Fucked. I think C++ is the artist on Music for Freaks or Classic from years ago. Okay. You know, a very like kind of tech. house from 8-10 years ago and I didn't expect him to go that modern and the way he folded into the set it made perfect sense. I think pretty much the first two, two and a half hours were tunes of that ilk. There was a strong kind of tech house new disco would I say? kind of vibe at the start and then yeah just descended into he was just reading everyone in at that point you know he's getting them on board yeah I think it's I think he ended with a rock track right a really heavy kind of stadium rock track Just a wall of sound, wasn't it? The blinds went up. Mids up. One remarkable thing about him that I never really heard before was this kind of blatant use of pitch control and volume control as well. I think the volume was striking for me because he actually, if you got close and looked at what he was doing, he actually, okay, maybe he had another amp or something, but he actually had a volume control like... under the mixer with his hand constantly on this rotary knob like up down emphasising like okay I really want to say this I really want to put this across up down for maybe 15 minutes or something and then you really felt the impact of when he mentioned in an interview recently that that was something that yeah I read that too taught him the importance of. Also, at Panorama Bar, since this is a Berlin-centric roundtable, Will, you mentioned Fred P. was quite great a week ago. Yeah, it was fantastic. Yeah, it was actually really funny because kind of like a quirk of Bear Kine and Panorama Bar is how much the set times matter. *laughs* I don't know, me and my girlfriend were saying recently that when the set times come out, I could give a lecture on my opinion of what this means for the quality of the night. And with that night, it was like the set times were exactly the opposite of what I had hoped. It was Donato Dazi started at midnight and Fred P was on at five, which is usually kind of an iffy time there. But I think just, I don't know, it was... It was a freezing cold night, it wasn't that crowded inside the whole place. I feel like panorama bars are usually the best moments to happen when it's light out. But yeah, it was totally dark and Fred P's music was like... One of my friends later said he'd never heard dance music that struck a chord so similar to something like Sonic Youth or Joy Division or something like that. where it kind of was like a it was never it was never like a i mean there were a few like you know really um classic like house tracks that were you know very emotionally unrestrained but most of it was sort of like had kind of like a weird mystique or um he was playing techno tracks slowed down and kind of mixed in a way that they sounded groovy and more housey and um i don't know I guess for me, I'd seen Fred P before, but in a not great venue and everything, but he was still really good. And I think his kind of like dirty, raw sound with the occasional like classic house track was basically perfectly matched for Panorama Bar. And that night, also having just watched Donato Dazi. for four hours that intro to Fred P was really good and um what was um Donato playing? Donato was like what do you describe what he's doing? well actually um I was gonna talk about him um in regards to the favorite podcast thing cause um he was like Basically, the opening set of Burghain is usually kind of a non-event. It's nothing to write home about. But he basically just made it sound like it felt like an opening ceremony or something. Every track perfectly created a little more anticipation than the one before. And even though there were no vocals, it was like every transition had like a reward waiting or something like a new track would come in you're like okay this one's okay and then every single time there would be you know interestingly placed hand clap or some weird little sound off in the distance that um i don't know makes this one more exciting than before it and the only thing i recognized was this new Anthony Shake Shakir. I forget what it's called actually, but it's the B-side of the new one on Fit. Which that track really encapsulates the whole thing. It's kind of like a crout-rocky, atmospheric, I don't know, techno song. But at the same time, it was extremely atmospheric, but the beats were always very strong. So you could dance, but the dance floor wasn't that full. And actually a lot of people were there specifically to see him. It's rare you see someone at Berghain. that early on in the night with fans there. Yeah, sure. Keeps things at Berghain, one of the also best sets of the year, I think, in your opinion, Jack, was seeing Scuba, the second substance birthday party. Yeah, in Panorama Bar. Thank you. I've seen Scuba a bunch of times doing his dubstep thing, in Berghain where he runs this... what's it? Substance. Is it quarterly? Yeah, quarterly party. Substance. But for the two year anniversary he decided to move on upstairs and play what was pretty much a house, techno-tinged house set. Yeah, with a nice dose of garage as well. And a few Prince edits for good measure. That's right. It was pretty spectacular. What was the Prince edit? Which one? I can't quite remember. It's all Derek Carter. But yeah, it was quite spectacular. Do you remember what time it was on? I think he played 2-4? Yeah. And Pias... No... It was quite early on. So it flies in the face of your ass. Although to be fair it was a Friday which was just a completely different set of rules. Yeah, and it was a very uncompromising selection. You also had him down Ryan. Was it for that set in particular? Yeah, it was for that. I think you just get a nice whole package with Paul. It's like, you know, between hot flush and... The fact he runs this quite... Would you describe it as the biggest dubstep? party in the world because I was thinking about this the other day and like would you get a higher attendance at anywhere else in the world for a dubstep party that anyone can think of you could maybe Fabric Live yeah possibly Fabric but um Yeah, I just think he's got fantastic range. He also has different reference than a lot of the sort of dubstep house techno DJs. I feel like you wouldn't hear, I don't think, 2-5-6-2 playing the same house records that he puts in his sets, which I find interesting. I'm trying to figure out, you know, when you're talking about the DJ Paul, why Scuba is... so high and he's one of the very few nominally dubstep DJs that's in the poll. He's been in the past two years now. I mean you can talk about the album and the mix CD sort of... Well he's a fantastic DJ for a start. Technically it's... pretty amazing. I think you can still download his Panorama mix and it was recorded live and you just think, well, there's just not one hi-hat out of place. There's nothing, you know, it's just so incredibly tight. I think the interesting thing is that I'd argue that it was actually DJs who bring the house and techno more than scuba. I mean if you're talking about appealing to like an RA audience that's... I was saying just a different type rather than more... Yeah but I'm trying to get at like why it is that the RA readership like places him so highly. I saw him at Labyrinth this year and it was... it just weaved between those two things just... so easily. I don't know if the Labyrinth audience was 1000% ready for dubstep. Labyrinth was traditionally a psytrance party, it's now house and techno. Sorry, techno with a tiny bit of house party. But he did pretty well and the set was really, really good. It was interesting to see him out there, sort of in that festival context, to see whether that sort of music can work in that arena. There's quite a marked turning point where he did slip into the techno bits. I find it interesting like in his RA podcast where he's doing the SCB versus... He would go back and forth. Okay. It wasn't like half and half for sure. It was interesting. And on that same note, I wanted to also talk about Joker because Christine, you saw him play Exit. Yeah. and talking about sort of, you know, a lot of people say that dubstep really, really broke through to mainstream audiences with like Magnetic Man and stuff this year. What was the reaction to Joker's set? It was like nothing I've seen before at a festival for a DJ. It was like naked torsos and flailing arms and beer cups and I was really surprised because generally speaking Jerker is somebody that doesn't, I find him to be a little bit one dimensional as a DJ. As a producer, sorry, but as a DJ, it kind of really works in his favor because he's not like doing the traditional DJ set of peaks and troughs and going on a journey. It's like every track just kind of ratchets up the atmosphere a little bit more and it's relentless, but it really, really works. Did he run through the classic joke material? Yeah, absolutely. He basically went through his whole back catalogue and reached back to things like, you know, Benga's Crunked Up and other classics. But also he's just so calm and so removed and dressed all in black and quite sombre. But on the other hand, the reaction that he's eliciting. from the crowd is just pretty remarkable. Yeah, I have to say the last time I saw him at Sona there was a bit of distance between me and where he was and I couldn't quite see if he was jumping around or not but you're saying he was quite still. He was head down, cap on. not really moving. He had an MC with him. He was kind of, but you know, to be honest with you, I think that MC could have been there or not been there. Yeah. It would have been the same reaction. How long does he play for or how long did he play then? Um, or from memory, it was maybe about 90 minutes. Okay. So not super long. I'm just curious how that intensity level works, you know, like. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think we got there just after he'd started and it was already quite vibey in there, but by the end it was, we were watching from the side of stage and just kind of aghast, but also like completely won over by what he managed to do. 90 minutes is a real stretching of one's legs for a dubstep DJ. Yeah. So let's move on to the live acts. In the poll, I believe I'm the only one in the room who saw Plastic Man this year. Yeah. Yeah, unfortunately. It was... pretty fantastic in Detroit. I mean, I assume that he wasn't exactly playing the exact same set he played everywhere in the world, but because obviously Detroit has a special meaning for him, but I was just, I was blown away by the fact that it wasn't one tempo, there were like gaps between the songs and that everyone was going crazy. I think it was also a testament for me to the strange popularity of Plastic Man and the Chee-Hawkin over all others in America specifically. Like even people just walking around the festival grounds, you know, people are just... Richie! Plastic Man! And like yelling out song names as though it was like, you know, a rock concert. And this is sort of bro-ish. Lots of bros yelling out song names. Plastic Man bros. It's like stadium techno. But at the same time, as I said, it isn't stadium techno. Here's the hip hop track and everyone still locked in. Visuals have a lot to do with that. Visuals were like as advertised. I mean it wasn't sort of a Swedish House Mafias type overload but at the same time it was interesting and very very well done. I think You know, say what you will about the G-Hawk and the plastic and all this stuff, I think it's 100% deserved number one this year. Yeah. Let's talk about some people who didn't make the list, though. Obviously, the list is only 10 for various reasons. And that means a lot of people that are totally worthy got left off. Will, you voted for, for instance, Bruno Pensado, who did a live RA podcast. What is it about? Bruno's live stuff is so appealing to you. I guess for me it's kind of like a... To me it sounds kind of classy. He has really... He keeps the club vibe going. He has really nice drum sounds and really punchy beats and everything. But everything else is very... I don't know, I guess kind of like wispy and subtle. And he's, I know he personally is very inspired by post-punk and everything. And sometimes you sort of get the like shoegazy sounds and everything. Actually, his R.A. podcast had a bit of My Bloody Valentine in it. And I don't know, it just kind of comes in and leaves. Anyway, so there have been a few times where if you're seeing him at a club, as the live act, he'll often play right before peak time, right before the main DJ or something. And it kind of has a drawing everyone in effect, just because it's kind of deep and trippy. But at the same time... keeps everyone going, it doesn't happen. - Do you think he has the capacity to headline? I mean, he does headline in certain places, of course, but like, to really sort of... Yeah, I mean, I guess the only problems are basically set length. Well, actually, I saw him headlined at the black market party on Halloween in 2009. And it was Craig Richards before him and Mr. C after him. And actually this is like a problem that happens, it's happened a couple times when I've seen Bruno, which is that whoever comes on afterwards, even if they're quite good, it can kind of sound a little headache-inducing, because, I don't know, Bruno's music is very uncluttered, and I don't know, just not. it's kind of I guess smooth or something so like when Mr. C came on after him he opened with like some LaVon Vincent track it was a track that I liked but it was just like sounded so like clangy and I don't know just like too rough at the same time Craig Richards before him was like you know getting so fist pumping by the end that Bruno had to kind of do like a little ambient thing to sort of like you know cleanse his palate and um so yeah I guess my point is um I think his sound and his kind of like vibe um is best suited to a little earlier in the night like an after hours thing but where would you say is the ideal spot to catch Bruno? um you don't have to name names I'm just interested in what sort of environment you think oh actually one time I really had fun was um the downstairs of Watergate which normally I don't like Watergate very much at all I don't know, it was just the sound suited it and the size of the dance floor suited it. And the sun coming up at the end of the set, I don't know, it just all kind of, there was kind of a nice chemistry. What are the people that you put on your list? Ryan was surprised by didn't see coming at number 5 it was Tim Exile yeah and that's not really to say that I think Tim ever had a shot at making the poll but I just think What he did, he played at this tiny little venue in Friedrichshain in Berlin and just the volume of gear, I think I probably, even if I hadn't seen the set, I probably would have voted for him just for the volume of gear that he brought to this basement. And he was just all over the place. Like, were you that lucky? No, no, but I saw him at Exit and it was a similar thing. He's just a performer. Yeah. was punching notes on a computer keyboard he was manipulating his voice he was interacting with the crowd he was yeah it was the same in Serbia he was like jumping over the barrier and he had some kind of joystick controller he was like recording people's voices and yeah Yeah, I mean, I was so horned to the fact that he changed his clothes for the performance. He put on like a blazer beforehand, that really impressed me. Doesn't take much to write a kid. No, I know, but it's just the, I guess the... performance art side of things. He's also a technological innovator for Native instruments isn't he? Designing a lot of their programs designed to manipulate voice and what else? Yeah, I think it's interesting because these things, it's in no way I can try to move. It's like he is actually pushing the limits of these things and the products of these ideas and what he's trying to get out of existing techniques. is why a relationship with Native instruments like that is so mutually beneficial. It's like, how the heck am I going to do this crazy thing, this manipulation, come up with something like the finger or the mouth, I think? Speaking of, I guess, on that same lots and lots of gear on the stage, Christine, you were telling me about this Jujo Jordache set that they played with Move D. Yeah, it was titled Gear Porn. Every possible variation of vintage Roland synthesizer plus a guitar plus a whole other bunch of stuff that I couldn't even recognise, and speaking to Jordan and Gal afterwards. Basically, it was entirely improvised. I had some time in the studio with David but didn't have the time before the performance to really kind of pull anything together. But it really added to the show. I said to them afterwards it was controlled chaos and they really agreed with me because at any given time there were these kind of weird, like... Obviously things being plugged into the wrong holes, things kind of making strange noises. Every now and then there'd be a little bit of a panic and they'd all kind of gather around one machine and kind of fix something. But at the same time they just... And I don't know if it's just kind of implicit in the kind of music that they do because it's so long-ranging and just kind of morphs over a really long period of time, but it just came together so beautifully. Would it be right in saying that these little fuck-ups were like, enhanced the show? Oh yeah, absolutely. It was very kind of nice edge, like, and it was really interesting to see that the crowd was very mixed, first of all, it was a proper split between male and female. And just like, a lot of young people, like... hanging over the edge of the stage and kind of trying to see what they were doing and really being kind of involved in the physicality of it, I guess. I'm always interested in a live electronic music act that actually looks like they're sweating over what they're doing. Or that they're actually doing something apart from clicking a mouse on the computer, you know? Yeah, yeah. It's a big thing of worms. Is it still, for you, Jack, like, it has to be? to be you have to see work being done oh well yeah I would like to see I'm still not wholly convinced by the live concept you know there are very few artists whose music I want to listen to played from an iMac for an hour so why did you see Erdberg Schnitzel like 18 times I'm a fan of his music. I think the other two or three times I saw him were kind of... of out of coincidence but um he has a great lifestyle you know and and admittedly he he's he's not using utilizing keyboards or things that i do really respect from a live setup like someone like art and wambay has um but he is doing something his tracks are patchwork as they are, but he kind of unstitches all of that and tries to put it back together again in a really interesting and crowd-reading way. I mean, when you say he has a great live set, do you actually mean he has a great discography? Well, yeah, there is, I mean, the person I voted for as number one, Tensnig, I think that's the principal reason why I chose that, because he's one of the very few artists whose discography I want to listen to for an hour in one go, you know? And it's more like a gig with him. You have people kind of chanting. the melodies and reminiscing about "this is classic here" with Ed Bechnitz though I think he really does something to his tracks Was that just a manipulation of a MIDI controller but just done to such an extent that... Yeah, rather than just relying on hooking up tracks together in a kind of... pre-programmed mix, it's really broken down into lots of different layers which do work well together. Is Ten Steak doing much live in the new scene? It's quite a linear approach to live performance. I think he knows where the set's gonna peak, he knows pretty much the running order beforehand but... It just goes back to that thing where his discography is so strong, he has such great tracks to draw on that it doesn't really matter that much. I think he's the first to admit that as well. Yeah, yeah. Certainly when you spoke to him earlier this year. Yeah, yeah. He's not under any illusions, you know, he just, I think, wants to bring his tracks to a wider audience by touring some. But what would be interesting, I think, for him is he released his DJ mix this year and I think he also mentioned at one point when I talked to him that he was... can really get sick of hearing Comacat over and over and over again, which is that sometimes you just pull a classic disco record out of the bag to liven things up a bit and say, if that's the direction you're moving next year, I'd be impressed. I mean, that's the somewhat crippling thing. I mean, how could you go and play a gig in Mexico to an expectant crowd and not play Comacat? Yeah. I think one guy probably... Well, he may have that problem now with his last record, but on Otrich's point never, I don't think anyone's like, oh, you gotta play... Right. The noise. Right. You saw him in Poland? Yeah, Unsound. You said it was one of your favorite acts. Yeah, it was. I had... It's funny, I actually had kind of low expectations for that set. I mean, I really love his music. But I didn't think that he was going to be able to do it translated to a live context at all. I just didn't see him, and I really didn't want to see him up there with a laptop paging through Ableton scenes. And what he did, I mean, he kind of did the best that he could under the circumstances, which was he had his, what is he used? It's a Juno. It's a Juno. Yeah. He's called Judy. Yeah, exactly. He had that up there. He had a couple other little bits and bobs. He seemed to have maybe some looping pedals, you know, and some effects all running through a Behringer. And you could tell it was basically a mixture of kind of backing tracks and noodling over the top and some live sequencing and resampling and whatever. But it just really worked. There's no other way I can put it but that it just drew you in. It was musically compelling. You did get that. you did get the kind of cause effect thing. If you were paying attention, you know, watch his hand move and hear the sound change, which to me is always gratifying. And I think also, I just, I didn't think he could really get away with it. I thought of What Other Tricks as somebody who is purely a studio project that... wasn't made for the live context and he really pulled it off. I was really happy to see him play on stage in what became a clubbing context later on as opposed to sitting down, which there were some other things at Unsound Festival where you just sat and listened to it, which was nice. Well, I was going to compare him to Emeralds, actually, because I couldn't wait to see Emeralds at Unsound. They played a different night, a different context, and I came away very disappointed by them. And I think in part it's because they put them on a stage. They played before Goblin, too, which was a odd but for emeralds i just wanted to sit down close my eyes and instead you were everybody was like standing up arms crossed back hurting it was painfully loud and i just couldn't get into it like for me emeralds is like recliner stoner music not like jostling rock crowd so the set you're referring to was a sit-down affair no it was a stand-up yeah and what sort of crowd react did that. It's hard. It's funny because the people who was before them, it was Joel from Quiet Village and I forget the guy's name, Godzi. And they played a bunch of old Halloween-style soundtrack music. This was the Goblin track. Yeah. The Goblin album. And they actually got booed. This was the first time I've seen somebody get booed in forever. They finished their set and it was like... I was really blown away. And then Emeralds went on and I mean, they were just really hilarious anyway. I'd never seen them before and I didn't realize kind of what bros they were. Like, Mark McGuire was like just rocking his axe the whole time. We're on tape so nobody can actually see me mimic pantomiming these things. But just like with the Thurston Moore hair in his face. And then one of the big guys behind the keyboard kept like pumping his fist in the air during totally ambient beatless passages. Like he was tuned into another frequency entirely. It was hilarious and I enjoyed that. I just wanted to be like... Going into the labels bit, which is next, the first one we have down to talk about is Editions Miga, who both Emeralds and Trixie Point ever record on. And I think it's fascinating to see these young guys... On Migo, which has felt like an old label for a while. As I was talking to you earlier, Philip, it feels like Migo 2.0 with some of these new releases and new artists. Yeah, I mean, I think there's definitely a sense of kind of a renaissance there. And I don't know when Migo turned into Editions Migo. I think it was a couple years ago now. But yeah, I mean, you get the sense of like kind of a new generation of artists. And also, I think the American angle is important. Like Migo has always been, to my mind, you know, kind of a European art music label. I mean, and... And PETA would probably be really pissed at me for saying that because like he's a punk first and foremost but I mean they have you know the gallery context and it's always been a very European lineup and now you know he's made these connections to the American kind of noise or post noise underground like Emeralds and One-O-Tricks and Mark McGuire. And I feel like there's kind of this new blood coming into the Migo universe. And at the same time, I was also saying, I think you can see how those artists are developing and learning from Migo as well. Like the opening track on the One Outtakes record, I don't think you would have heard him do that on another... I hadn't heard him do anything similar to that until he came to... to Migo and I think that's a... You were talking about learning from the label, they also of course reissued things this year, the Kevin Drum record and the Finesse record which are obviously... Touchstones. Classics. Yeah, so I mean, and there was a ton of stuff on Migo that I didn't even like really check out at all this year. I had it written down, I mean they had the... They had the Cindy Talk record. There was a Cindy talk with Robert Hampson, another Fennelberg, Daniel Manchet from Portland, I'm pretty sure. A Stephen O'Malley cassette, which I've got to hear. And yeah, it just seems like there's a lot of energy there right now. And also, I have to say that the vinyl pressings that Migo has been doing are just breathtaking. Like I had the Emeralds CD. I think just I had the promo on mp3 and then I bought the vinyl and it was like it sounded like a different record just and that was all Robert Hampson's mastering and just like hearing I don't know one of the most striking contrasts I've ever heard between digital and and vinyl one of the vinyl labels that were Christine here, quite excited about these future times. They're out of DC? Yeah, from Washington DC. And I was thinking about it earlier today. It's a funny thing where I'm like, is it just because it references so many 80s pop culture images and sounds? And I'm a child of the 80s. But I think something that they do, which is really interesting, is that they'll kind of... mimic things but not all the way to the end. You feel like you can anticipate where a track is going and then it will kind of shoot off into a different area, which I think is really interesting. And this year, particularly, Beautiful Swimmers, who basically own the label as well. One of my absolute pet peeves in electronic music is the sampling of Marvin Gaye. Like, it really, I see red. Actually, that's Ricardo's new track. Yeah, I heard you talking about it earlier today. But they kind of sampled the rhythm track of Sexual Healing for one of their... It's called touch baits. But they just do it in such an ingenious way and it kind of like blooms into this like cosmic sprawling thing. Wasn't there a Marvin Gaye sampling golf channel? Yeah, the DJ Nature. I think he quite liked that. I did, but it was borderline. It was borderline. That's just because I love Golf Channel that much. I just remember seeing your face screw up. It is ridiculous. The interesting thing about Future Times, another interesting thing I guess, is also that one of the beautiful swimmers is Max Millian, who's recorded on the ramp, who sort of has one foot in the sort of... UK bass community. The record he released, it was quite good. I really enjoyed it. So I'm excited to hear more from Future Times next year. Jack? We have two labels we wanted you to talk about. Yeah, retreat. Yeah, first retreat. And we're going to have you feel close to our hearts. geographically. No, it really does, Retreat, what I like about it is that it really tugs at the heartstrings of nostalgia, you know, it's run by Hauke, Freya and Yannick Salvo, who are one half of Session Victim and Quarion, respectively, and these guys really weren't so much as sniff at an MP3, you know, it's vinyl only for them, they really care about it, and it's something, it's just, just for passion, they really don't care about any money that they're making. It's really all for the love of house and something that you can see transferred into the caliber of the collections. I think they've only released three records with one to come this year and they've all been pretty fantastic. They also run quite a nice little party, don't they? They do, on a Thursday night in a tiny little bar. holds maybe 50 people, but they really do. Do you think they're ever a label that could make Resident Advisors top 20 labels of the year? I think all they need is like a Ten Snake-esque running back last year. I thought you were going to say all they need is digital distribution. They need like a Ten Snake-esque act to like... or song, like last year with Running Back. All they need is one session of victim's talk to really, really take off. I think that's definitely possible. Session of Victim have been playing a lot of gigs in London recently, releasing on Delusions of Grandia. I think they're moving in the right direction, certainly. I mean, and to play Devil's Advocate, would that be a good thing? If they did blow up? I'm not sure they'd even care to do this with you. No. They just do it because they really feel these records need to be heard by the people. I think running back's probably another. really easy comparison you saw what they did. 2010 after 2009 it was like they didn't do anything different. He kept reissuing weird records that he cared about and like one-off Roman IV things. And they have a thing coming up that's like a 70s I think it's like a post-punk track. Yeah, sure. International Feel is also a label that I wanted to speak about. I guess it's just more DJ Harvey love there. I don't know, they also had a really big summer hit with this Coyote record, 'Movin' which was quite on the present. But it's just an interesting label because it seemingly sprang out of nowhere, based in Uruguay which is not really considered some kind of dance music hotspot I don't think. Thank you. Out of the blue announcing that they had DJ Harvey signed on to produce three singles You know, I think it's been pretty clinically planned I'm still very unconvinced that it's based on her record I just think it's a guy in London I don't know I reviewed one of their records and I think I looked into this and I genuinely think he's some yeah I think it was some kind of guy who quite a few people know which is why he's keen to protect his identity he was based in London but who had enough of it all and decided to go and invest all his efforts into creating this really cool mysterious romantic tropical label right at the base of Iguazu Falls exactly And it's cool, it feeds into the whole... Is that in? That's true. It's one of those. They just started a sub-label which only records tracks in the Punto del Este studio. It's all very James Bond style, I think. Which is why it's been such success. Obviously, having Harvey on board helps. And the records have been good, you know? It hasn't just been like a swan song for Harvey production-wise. It's been... I guess the furthest thing from James Bond would probably be further records. The cable. Based in Seattle. Yeah. You wrote the label of the month piece and you were very disappointed to see that they didn't make it in the top 20 labels of the year. I wonder if, what were some of the, I mean, we've talked a little bit about them being a label that only releases tapes and how interesting that is, but what about the music this year from them? Well, first of all, just to quickly touch on the tape thing. They actually release on vinyl now. The Donato Tazi record just came out on vinyl, and I've heard it played out a couple times. So the tape thing was actually a mixture of necessity and kind of like a cool concept, I guess, just because they're super cheap to make, and they sell all of them. It's just a really kind of ingenious thing for a young label to do. But in terms of the music, I mean, when I was doing that piece, La Rosa, I think, said that... The thing about a cassette is it's really convenient to go backwards and forwards. You can't just jump to the track that you want. At any format, it's probably the biggest pain in the ass to just go to the song you're thinking of. So the album really is, you know, firmly an album more than anything else. And I don't know, one of them told me that they had a friend. who like he only had a tape player in his kitchen and so he would come in and just hit play he had no idea which was side A or side B or where he was just like every now and then he had to flip it over and the whole thing was just like this you know ongoing piece and so anyway I think the intentional or not the cassette format really had a big impact on the music of the album and um for instance La Rosa uh he sounds like it kind of sounds like him but it mostly doesn't at all like it sounds like some I don't know it sounds really Drexia or something like that Nah I'm a albumist just Yeah, completely. Isn't that something that they say to the artists along the lines of, okay, this is the place where you can do the shit that you cannot do anywhere else? I mean, would they go that far? I don't know if they actually say that, but the artists figure that out. And the interesting thing is there are a lot of artists that have this catalog built up where they're like, well, I'm never going to... ever going to release this. No label is ever going to put up the money for this track because it has nothing to do with clubs. So it's interesting that artists like LaRosa, Zanotta, Dazzy, etc. I guess it's also a cost issue. It's the same thing you're saying. No label would ever pay. It's not like they're so close-minded. LaRosa's on cool labels. you know, he's on the Kazooie and everything. But yeah, it's just that those records are just gonna sit there, so they're never gonna see the light of day. And strangely enough, cassette ends up being the one channel for this kind of left-field electronic music. I wonder if they've had any approaches from artists, like, keen to, like... exhibit different sides of their production range. - Probably by now, but yeah, but then the other funny thing is, of course you can just do it on MP3, but that just feels like totally uncool or something. So, especially to the artists that end up on Further. Again, I forget who exactly said it, but he said it just, you know, he never thought of that as an option either, just 'cause it doesn't feel like you're doing the music justice, so. - Yeah. Also pretty adherent to their format of choice is live jam records who are very passionate about vinyl. And loudly, so... What records... They're a label that's run by Italians who were living in Berlin. They're quite hard to get actually. I remember talking to a contributor from RA in the UK and he said, can you buy me these because I just can't even find them. live in like the UK I checked I don't know if that's really something it was going for somewhere in the region for 60 or yeah I mean I think the crazy thing about live jam is for a label I wonder how many records there are that artists no one has any idea who they are the record came out less than a year ago and it's more than 50 euro on discogs and sold out everywhere yeah I don't know I think it really speaks to the I don't know kind of like quality music and the weird mystique surrounding the label. Yeah, I mean, do we know anything about the artists? I mean, my knowledge of their catalog is sketchy at best, but... I think my love for them just stems very simply from the fact that every single time you put on one of their vinyl in the office, it's just like, what the hell is this? Yeah, I mean, well, yeah, actually, I remember that I put it on, or it's actually one of their weird sub labels, Relative, and you said they really don't have a dud. Like, every single one is... Yeah, I just think it plays so nicely into this analogue only jams thing that they've actually hit the nail on the head with it. You do just get this intensity and the machine's built about an inch from your face the entire way through. We'll be right back. Yeah, and it was actually, I was thinking the other night I was watching on YouTube a video of Guided by Voices playing. And for some reason it occurred to me that like, to me, live jams and Guided by Voices kind of have a similar thing where like... With live jams, honestly, I really feel like if they made the whole thing in Ableton and it sounded to be polished, I would probably still really like it. Yeah, it's like an additional... But I'm not saying that the analog thing is... silly or something, I think it makes it even cooler. But my point is it's not just that they have this weird method and that it sounds really raw, it's that the songs themselves are really compelling. I think we probably state for the tape what that method is. Oh yeah, okay. So I guess they just, I mean, I don't really know, you know, the specifics of it, but everything is on analog gear. and I think it's just I mean it's just gems yeah yeah they're live gems and there's a new one that one of those relatives yeah the new one on relative um I was listening to it the other night and like there's one track that really sounds like a jam like there's no hook the whole time it's like they kind of try out one hand clap for a while and then take that out and it's like they're really just trying out new things and in the last 10 seconds like a new snare comes in and the song ends yeah it's really just like they're screwing around and then listen back to the tape and it's like all right let's just take that five minutes and then I would at the time they record these sessions, whether it is just like, right, we've got an hour, let's bust something out, or it's like, you know, they're really sweating over these productions. Sorry, it sounds very similar to some of the Sex Tags Mania stuff. I haven't heard the live jam stuff, but a lot of the Sex Tags records are a similar thing, you know. turn on the gear, turn on the tape and you know, when a side of, when 14 minutes is up then you end the track and that's it. Yeah, I think it's just a wonderful, yeah. in sock culture as the Abletonized world in which we inhabit. I think it also, aside from just the idea of Ableton or Analog, I think what Live Game shows is that if you are attracted to Analog, you come up with different ideas that end up being the composition... Analog is a way of life. I think it's also like a matter of interface, like if you're looking at Ableton, you, I don't know, have a different idea of how the composition works or something. Whereas if you're just playing it live, maybe like your impulse of wanting to bring in a clap or something might be a little weirder, but for whatever reason. I think it's quite simple, you're looking down at something and there are your options, should I turn knob A or should I turn knob B? It's not like there's this brain pattern where you're thinking, okay, filter, like you're actually in the filter or something, it's like, there's a filter, I'm just going to grab it and see how it sounds. One of the... things that people shouted about in the comments to our little poll was the distinct lack of techno. I think there was, I don't know how many labels there were, maybe it was just oscute. And people were like, where's Samuel District, where's Prologue, where's X, Y, Z. One of the labels, obviously, that we wrote about, I wrote about earlier this year, the label of the month piece was Stroboscopic, who I thought had an extraordinarily strong in places year, especially their Modot series. Ryan, you? Yeah, I didn't have a ton to say about them, but I just wanted to pull on a quote that I saw that they'd written on Discogs on their mini biography that said freshest and deepest techno. And I just agreed with that this year. I just felt they were darker and more... obscure in a way and just particularly the shin stuff it was just so angular and yeah I don't know again I'm not overly familiar with discography but the Monad series did stick out so let's move on to podcasts mixes and comps For various reasons, again, we don't necessarily list podcasts at the end of the year. We did this year, rather. That may change. But obviously podcasts are out there. They're everywhere. Philip, you mentioned that one of your favorite podcasts of the year was James Holden's mix for Accelerator, which I find interesting because he made a mix CD, and I think he released it around the same time as the mix. Yeah, it seems almost like... crazy, you know, you make a commercial mix CD and then promote it with a free mix. Yeah, I mean, I don't know how K7 must have felt about that, I mean, because obviously he's got to promote, but when the only promotion channel is another free mix, it... kind of obviates the mix CD itself. I mean, I really loved his DJ Kicks mix, but the Accelerator mix I actually, I think I liked better, and I can't really say now, I don't have the track list in front of me, but I just remember it just had a flow and a spirit to it. But I really liked what Holden did, generally, I thought. I haven't seen him DJ for a couple years, and I thought that... With both of those mixes he did a really interesting job of pulling together the kind of like wonky, fortetti sort of like plunking kalimbas and everything a bit sloppy and unquantized. and the haywire modular synthesizers of Luke Abbott and people like that. It just had this great squishy, spongy, colorful feel. Would you agree that James Holden was one of the foremost proponents of the mix, CD and mix in general? Just looking back through his balance mix and his other controls mix. Mix for K7, the mix you were mentioning. I just think he's someone that gets it. Yeah, he's always used the format, whether it's the mix or the podcast or whatever, but I mean, yeah, he, I think, approaches them as, you know, compositions rather than just showcases for hot tracks or whatever and shows. Yeah, yeah. Just because he's a club DJ, he's always so... you know, it's just so mixed in people's reactions to it. It's very much a love-hate thing. What you do get... I don't know, maybe those tendencies that, you know, the great tendencies that he brings to the recorded mix form kind of piss people off in the live environment. Well, I have no, I wouldn't be surprised if he's not doing those mixes, live mixing. You know, I would be surprised if those were. turntables and CDJs. I would assume it's more collage. Yeah. Ableton collage. And I think in his case, you know, he really gets it. He gets how to use that format of, you know, the Ableton strip, you know, and laying in the tracks and arranging them in such a way that really brings them to life and to do things that... he probably couldn't do that one probably couldn't do in a live mixing context because they're tricky tracks I wonder if he'll release a record soon James are you out there Will you picked Donato Dozie's podcast for Minimal Sausages that just went up recently is Crown Rock Session. Why did you pick that as one of your favorite podcasts of the year? Well, I guess it kind of goes back to what I was saying earlier about Dazi, which I guess the podcast is a recording of his opening set at Labyrinth. So it was, I think, like the first night of Labyrinth. Anyway, it was the same thing I said about his set at Berghain where it feels like he looks at the opening set as, I don't know, a really good opportunity to sort of set the stage for what's to come, which should be what everyone does, but I don't know, I've never seen or heard anyone else do it, I don't know, with so much creativity, I guess. But it's also a personal thing that I really like. I really like that kind of music. the Kosmich or whatever, and it was interesting to hear the song by Noi and Spaceman 3 and everything woven together in a DJ set. Also, I think Ambient mixes... this isn't exactly ambient, but usually sort of fall flat for me, but this one had exactly the kind of like tension and sort of narrative arc that you want from a house or techno DJ set, only it's all, you know, more or less beatless sort of like. you know, just like ambient pieces and totally drumming rock pieces. So yeah, it was the first time I had ever heard music like that DJed effectively. Seeing it live, not, I guess he re-recorded the set, but it was basically the same record. The only thing I can say is hearing some of those records on... those speakers was something else. I rarely care or talk that much about sound systems, but I can't say enough at Labyrinth. like the sound system was just ridiculous. It was ridiculous. I've never heard things. I've never heard things and thought to myself, oh, it's nice to hear this record on this or like how it's supposed to be heard. It was very, very nice. It's a great set. Christine, your pick was DJ Q for Little White Earbumps. Yeah. That was full of a couple of unworthy stuff. Yeah, a couple of really amazing, deep, pulsating tracks. . It's funny though because within that whole UQ family I feel like the scales fell from my eyes this year. With DJ Q. I saw him earlier this year at Berghain and he was really good and I've been listening to his tracks throughout the year and they're really good. But I just feel like with this mix I finally got it. It all came together. All these kind of weird discordant... It was just like a mix of delayed gratification. It was almost there, but not quite. But he's just really skillful at maintaining that level of tension, I guess. I think, you know, just that... doing quite well for himself, Fred P, Levon. I think Q is definitely the most underrated of the bunch. And I also agree that this year for me, I finally kind of got him and what his sound is and what he's about. He played a Chris N' Cozy record at Panorama Bar. Looking back on it, that was the most... sort of thing for me that was like ah he's onto something yeah um yeah it was it was a great great mix for a little white ear buds I thought yeah fantastic how would you describe the way he does well they actually when they interviewed him little white ear buds earlier this year I mean the interviewer kind of talked about it and was like, "Your stuff is just, it's really dark." Like, there's this dark undercurrent. You know, with Fred, it's obviously dark and deep, but a little bit melancholy. Yeah, there's I don't think there's a lot of melancholy and what Q does I think it's kind of menacing Yeah, almost and that Chris and Cozy track especially like that's just it sounds like people are screaming, you know throughout and then it was one of those moments where I go up to the DJ booth and I'm like sort of looking around and I'm like, is anyone hearing this? And like everyone stopped dancing basically. It's like, guess no one's hearing this. Great. Jack, the illustrious Promo Mixes series. Matthew Stiles, Metamix. Yeah, it was on repeat for a long time after it was uploaded. And perhaps I think you know a little bit about Promo Mixes so you can explain the concept behind it. Promo Mixes is a series of mixes in which... DJs are asked to make a mix as though they want to become a resident DJ at a club from the past. So Matthew, for instance, made a mix as though he wanted to become a resident DJ. At Zanzibar, yeah. And in a year where old school house and nostalgia has become quite ubiquitous, it was refreshing to hear a mix that consisted pretty much of records that I hadn't heard before. Peace. by looking at some Italian influences from the time, like Don Carlos. There was this great Merc remix of Romantony in it. It was all very upfront, no kind of pussyfooting, straight in there. I think Matthew's a great DJ who's often overlooked. Didn't one of you, I feel like I heard from one of you guys that he had like a rule with choosing the tracks that they had to do? They can't have been heard in a podcast before I think. In a podcast? No, just kidding. In one of the big mixes that he'd, you know, from that style, I think. He did quite extensive research into that. And they're all culled from his... Huge record collection. Right, okay. Speaking of huge record collections, I was really enjoying your Tonomic podcast this year. I know, right? I mean, I've worked in... same artist as you do. Yeah. I'm just, I just had a moment a couple of weeks back when the last bars of the last track of the last Orson Welles' Poycots were playing out and it didn't quite move me to tears but I just felt like I'd been something, been through something with these three individuals. I just, I don't know. that is crazy are you sure you didn't share it you've been on a journey we went places man they take you on a journey I don't know I just like I very I very rarely like maybe only to Jack but I very rarely like shout down people and really feel like they should be listening to things not in podcasts and really did feel like saying to people maybe in the street like you need to be hearing this like look what these guys are bringing to the table It was just a really great mixture of like obviously their taste and influence and stuff that like unreleased. stuff the likes of which I've never really heard before and probably wouldn't expect to get hold of for another year or something. What did you make of the mix that they did for Fabric proper? Yeah, I mean... I know maybe some people such as yourself were slightly disappointed in that it didn't top one of the 12 layers, but I don't think they were ever going to bring the influences side of things to the table. I don't know if that's what you were expecting. I was not expecting the Strux track. No, I thought it was great and I voted for it highly in my poll. I thought, you know, as encapsulations of what they're doing and what they did this year go, I mean, a lot of the stuff was unreleased, so it was kind of a good indication of what was coming out for the rest of the year. But yeah, I thought they really nailed it. Christine, you also. Yeah, but I came from a completely different perspective. The autonomic mix was my entry to the podcast. So this was kind of my first introduction to this sound. And I think that kind of looking back retrospectively at what they've done in the podcast, I think they've really done a very smart job of pulling in elements of those kind of synth wave and kind of 90s warp style influences, but kind of... constructing them into songs and then constructing that into like a package to present to people who are listening to them for the first time yeah I just I like it that I don't feel it's in any way contrived you know it's like I do truly believe that these are their influences and they're not just saying that to look you know good on a track list that's been compiled on it's also a perfect way to kind of do an interview without doing an interview Like saying like, yeah, I like the strokes. I like my bloody Valentine, whatever it is. It's like, you, you don't have to like. them listing their things and they include it with this next level drum and bass stuff which doesn't hurt. Yeah and sort of techno and electro and house by Layer 11 which was again just keeping me and other people guessing. There weren't very many other mixes commercially released ones that caught my eye. What was it about the Dinky mix that really caught your ear? It doesn't rely on classics. What was it for you, Will? Did you have any thoughts? Yeah, I thought it was, it reminded me a lot of seeing her DJ where... there was just kind of like a nice variety and I don't know, track to track, just she really keeps it fresh. Like after there's one song with a vocal hook and the next one, the hook is like some weird sound. And I don't know, it's just each new song feels a little bit surprising, but totally fits also. And I think it kind of has this sort of like snaking motion, like the vibe goes up and down, up and down, that you get more in clubs, you don't get as much on mixed compilations, but I liked about that mix. Overall, I mean, I thought it was just... I don't know, in terms of mixed compilations I've heard come out this year, I felt like that one was the most kind of off the cuff. Like it was really like, I don't know, just made you picture her like just playing with records. It didn't feel like this calculated, well-sculpted collage or something. It was, like I said, it's not so different from seeing her playing panorama or something like that. So yeah, I thought it was really cool. Her mission statement was to kind of take it out of the club, I think. I think she quoted what she said. She wanted to offer listeners something that they won't necessarily get from her hands in the air sets in clubs, where she's kind of tied to that vibe. and I think certainly by the end of the mix you're in the club with her there but the beauty of it is that it starts off so gently and really offers you know it's an ambient track by Matthew at the half and just different things from DJs you don't normally or producers you don't normally expect to hear that kind of music I guess I feel like a lot of mixed compilations these days are feel a little bit I guess like contrived isn't really the right word but I don't know they feel kind of restrained or something and that one it felt like she was just going for it if not in terms of energy just in terms of I don't know going with the flow or something that felt more natural Let's move on to albums. Could we bring up one live or well kind of a live set but a podcast that I totally forgot to mention. Did anybody else hear the Autechre? Was the 12 hour? I only tuned in for a couple of hours, but that was just one of the most entertaining nights of music that I had. This year, I was just, I was at home working and I think maybe it was Derek Plaslaco. I don't know. All of a sudden, I started like seeing people on Twitter saying, oh my God, you got to check out this Autekker podcast that's going on right now. And I think it was 12 hours, right? Maybe it was six. Probably six hours. It was freaking long. And I started listening to it. It was, in fact, genius. I don't even remember what I heard now. There was hip-hop, there was electro, there was breakbeat. drum and bass, there was noise, there was techno, there was bleep, all thrown together, all unbelievably perfectly mixed, which leads me to believe they actually prepared it beforehand. But who knows, who cares? What was amazing was just like... The sense of experiencing that through Twitter and like all of your sort of circle of friends and writer people and fans and whatever. Everybody was suddenly online. And like you were saying, you wanted to walk down the street and shake people by the lapels and say, you should be listening to this. And that's what I got within the space of an hour. Like 10 mails like, oh my God. You should be listening to this and I sent them out to you know and everybody I'm getting all goosebumps here And it was just like it was it was an event you know it was really and then like the next day Somebody created like a Google Docs spreadsheet to to some of the track listing and you had this massive kind of wiki knowledge of people like Put piecing in the track listing and and of course somebody ripped it and you know and it was available for download by the next day. It was just, it was an event and I thought they did it very well. Well actually something, the thing you said that all your writer friends and like music dork friends and everything were going nuts, for me it was, obviously that happened too, but then also like on Facebook, like there were some people that, you know, were talking about it and it's like, damn, like you're listening to Otterker? Like, I don't know, this made it all the way to This had enough buzz that yeah, he decided like okay I'll take out this autograph thing and then they'd like to know to comment on it like There's still one of those groups that really spans a year in cross-section. It's kind of like Talked about that punk the other day in the office. It's like there's it's so there are a couple of groups that like have this strange collective pull. It's like it's the token one that you know even if you don't like that kind of music. It's like Otterker is you know the like IDM you know and for you know for them to release that type of music and for them to still like be the one and there is hope. Let's move on to albums. Jack, you go to Caribou, Indian Hole, White Pine. That was my number one album. I think it was quite an obvious choice. Bye. Bye. I think the secret behind his success was that he's been working as an artist for many years now, but not necessarily within dance music. And I think the album as a format is often a huge stumbling block for dance artists who make tracks rather than songs. albums, you know, they release 12 inches and it doesn't necessarily work. on a long player and you've just got kind of, I don't know, eight or nine tracks all eight minutes long with a fourth of the full beat. It's rather boring. But Caribou came to dance music after having made psychedelic records and I think he brought this kind of album sensibility to his dance record. it's just really beautiful, it's really poppy, it kind of satisfies both those halves in my musical brain. And a lot was said about the kind of underwater production that he wanted to apply to everything, but underneath all that was a really beautiful voice, which is really beautiful lyrics. For me it just worked on every single bass. I was going to bring up the Dark Star album because I think they went the other way. They were making dance records that were known as a dubstep act and then turned their hand to a pop album and that was another one in the top 20. As convinced as maybe a lot of people seem to be over that record, and I think I said earlier that maybe it was just a set of great circumstances for them, you know, like Hyperdarling coming from where they did and presenting quite a clear vision, but yeah, I think there's some comparisons we made there. Christine, you... One of the albums that you voted quite highly, but didn't make it into the list in the end was Ganja Sufi. Yeah, put it at number three. I was wondering if you could speak about that a little bit. Yeah, it's funny when I was thinking about what I was going to say about it and the only kind of phrase I could come up with is everything is in the red. Like, it just, it sounds like the mixing desk is on the verge of complete explosion. Like, it's just, there's so much kind of kinetic energy in this album. And it's funny, we were having this conversation earlier this year about Gaslamp Killer, who produced the bulk of the album, and trying to figure out if he's, like, a genius or a complete charlatan. We couldn't figure it out. But I think that this, his kind of work with... With Gondra Sufi, he's just found someone who's as mental as him, but the interaction between them is really interesting. And it's funny that you were talking about beautiful voices before. He sounds like a Rastafarian, like Tom Waits or something. voice is just otherworldly and then I found out recently that he's actually quite an experienced yogi and teaches yoga and his voice comes from learning to kind of project himself to lots of different people but it's just like a technique almost. Yeah, like he was saying that when he started working with, because he did a track with Flying Lotuses, last album with Los Angeles, and apparently Steve wasn't happy with it and kind of got into it over and over again and it really affected his voice. And so he started kind of using the techniques that he uses in classes to kind of project. But it's incredible, like he can go from falsetto to like... really growling spoken word to kind of something in mid-range but it always sounds like he's shouting from a really far distance it's it's pretty incredible what he can do with his voice yeah that's been the way it's recorded as well yeah absolutely and because yeah i was reading today that um mixing the album took maybe three or four times as long as recording it so he really drove for that kind of saturated overblown sound and I just think it's really incredible because it's like a combination of this kind of faux mysticism but it just sounds like him and Gaslamp Killer have gone into the desert with some peyote and a bottle of rum and a few old Turkish pop records and recorded the results So we got time to stay. I don't remember any references to peyote or tequila. He's a really, um, he's a really interesting guy. Uh, he said, like, I had to make the editorial decision in editing the piece because it was run as a Q&A. It was to basically not edit, like, not change anything because every other word was fucking broad. I don't remember now if it was bro or bra, maybe it was bro, but he swears like a sailor, like way more than I swear, and I swear a lot. And every other word was fuck and bro, and it had this full-on kind of surfer, it sounds like I'm making fun of him, which I'm totally not at all. I was very impressed with like the... how do I put it, just kind of the oneness of his character. And even if like there was some of it felt like a performance, like he's on the phone with the journalist. He didn't know who the hell I was. He didn't know who the hell I was writing for. But I don't know though. I was very impressed. He talked a lot about yoga. He talked about kind of his... anger issues he talked about how he used to you know he would like be walking around town somebody would say nasty shit to him he comes from san diego it's a pretty conservative right-wing place a lot of military down there and how used to be people would say shit to him and he would like end up getting in fights or whatever and now yoga he's channeling that energy differently he told me something really interesting about moving to Las Vegas basically because it's cheaper there and I asked how it was to be away from the ocean because he's a surfer as well and he said how he would driving back to Vegas from LA when he was recording the album he would bring like a bucket of seawater with him and just pour it into the sand, into the cracked mud, just like returning the life force or whatever. I'm just hippie enough that I thought that was somehow awesome. From the same sort of deep type scene, one of the albums you put on... list that I was kind of fascinated by. I've heard a lot of people say great, great things about it. It's the Teves album. Yeah. It was on Brainfeeder. Yeah, on Flying Willis' label. And it really caught me off guard. Like most promos, I put them in a playlist, like a monthly playlist, and hopefully I'll listen to them once, and occasionally I'll kind of find my way back to them. And I remember with the Teab's there were a couple tracks that I kind of pulled out and set aside to use in potential mixes or something like ambient tracks, lots of bell tones, very kind of pastoral, psychedelic, the way I like it. And it was through kind of returning to those in my playlist mixes that I... remember to go back and listen to the whole album again and I just found it really immersive I think it was of all of that like LA beat music brain feeder kind of stuff it's the one that comes the closest for me to like ambient music even though it has I mean a very strong kind of rhythmic foundation but use of bells and all of these very high, kind of wispy tones and it's very bright, very colorful and it just, yeah, it's like air. It's interesting you say that because I remember, if I remember from getting it right, the reviewer Andrew Rice who wrote about it for us, kind of. knocked it for being a little bit weightless in a way. Like you come back to it, but it's kind of, I don't know, it's a little bit too dreamy for that. Yeah, I mean, maybe it's a taste thing, you know. I compare most to maybe Lukid on work recordings, which I found them to be quite similar. I mean... Yeah, again, all these kind of bell tones and high tones. But I just think Teaves is really on to something. He has a control, a command of timbre like very few artists do, and I think... And that's a big brain feeder thing, the timbre control. And I read, there's an interview with him on National Public Radio online, and he actually talked about how... He made the album when his father was dying and I had no idea of any of that backstory or anything. But I don't know, reading that and hearing it again, you kind of hear it in another light as well. I guess Control of Tamor for me. Christopher Rouse record this year, a small film. you I was just shocked to like it as much as I did because it felt like the total typical Deep House record of 2010. But somehow he wrote that line between... you know every cliche you want to throw at it and really really engaging like as I said in the review that I wrote it just seemed like every time you were ready to sort of be like I don't know there was one thing that sort of drew you back in whether it be a slightly off-kilter beat or just, I don't know, him fading. something out. It was, I don't know, it was very... I'm worried about if he does a second album because I'm worried that this is almost like an accident. But we'll see what happens from here. One record that just came in recently, I guess, to our attention, which perhaps should have not come to our attention so late. It was the roll of the dice record. Yeah, when was that released? I think it was March. Yeah, way early in the year, I think. Peter, a former writer for R.A. Minimal Sausage's blogger, wrote it up in his year-end list, and I just sort of checked everything he put in because his list was so... not dance floor driven and I'm always excited to sort of hear the things that he's passionate about because he has very singular taste. And I was immediately like... I can't believe I let this record go past. It's basically organ. That's like a Dave Smith. It's like a Dave Smith instrument. It's like a poly-evolver. They did a live set at Unsound. You missed it. It's Peter. One of the guys. Subliminal Kid. Exactly. Yeah, Peter the Subliminal Kid and then this other guy, Malcolm. I forget his alias. And yeah, they did a live set at Unsound. Three tracks. all just live gear. The first one didn't work for me at all, it just wasn't a super compelling sequence or anything, but the rest of it was really strong and very much in the vein of the album, you know, like evolving sequences and... Just very building tracks, you know, beats to speak of. It's like post-rock basically. And non-4-4 stuff a lot too. When we're talking to them after the gig, I'm like, oh my god, they're doing that awesome one in like 5-4 time or whatever. And they're like, we don't really know. You mean the one that goes, da-da-da-da-da-da. Oh yeah. Dempthight Stare was another one that people sort of talked about that didn't make our albums list. And I think, not to get too deeply into it, I think they released too many records for people to really decide which one was maybe the strongest. There wasn't one to really rally around, so to speak. And maybe they'll fix that next year with the release of Triptych, which they just put them all in one go. They're completely out there doing something I don't think anyone else is doing right now. What I like about them, I mean, in addition to the whole witchy, gloomy vibe, which obviously was really trendy this year. I almost suspect that they wish that it hadn't been. I mean, it's a double-edged sword because on the one hand, there's going to be people discovering them because they're going to read their name mentioned in the same breath as Salem or whatever. But I just, I mean, I've met them, I've interviewed them, and I think they're on a very different tip. I mean, they come from... come from a small town, which is where these witches had a coven 500 years ago. Which I think is important because it seems like the witch house Salem stuff is so American. Yeah, and they're huge fans of library music, of horror soundtracks and stuff. And they're also obviously like deeply involved in dub techno. And what I liked about the records, and I'll admit I can't keep any of them separate in my minds, really like there were the limited 12 inches, which I never got my hands on. And then there were the mixtapes and then the three mini albums, which are now being collected on a triptych. I like how they kind of mix everything up between, it's like a mixtape, it's a collage, there's some original production, and it all just gets thrown in there. They're not tracks to be DJ'd with, it's really listening material, and I like the fact that they're using extended samples, but blurring them in such a way you're not going to really know what they come from. you And also I think just, yeah, the depth of the process. I mean, we, you know. Earlier in the conversation, we spoke unkindly of sort of, you know, the Abletonization of production, what have you. And I was talking to Miles MLZ, and he was explaining that, like, to get his reverb on some of his old modern love tracks, he used to work, his studio was like an old factory, a converted factory. And he would just, and I was like, what kind of reverbs are you using? Is it like a space animal? And he said, no, that he just stood at the bottom of the stairwell with his 909 or whatever. I guess a little amp or something. And, you know, snare hit. booming out through the stairwell and he just records it with a microphone and that's how you get good reverb. The last one we wanted to talk about albums wise who also I guess uses a healthy amount of reverb is Tin Man who's I guess more well-known than the album we put out this year. for his love of acid. You can kind of hear it. Is the album Scared? Yes. Will, you put it on your list. What was it about this record that was so good to you? Well, it was kind of like what you said about Roll the Dice and Peter Chambers' list where it was, I don't know, it wasn't dance floor oriented at all but it still had a lot of the things that I like about electronic music were in there it's kind of like the atmospheres and textures and everything but I don't know I feel like the way he makes music even though he used to do acid tracks and everything is now very disembodied from club culture or dance 12 inches or stuff like that Just like the easiest example is his weird way of singing and everything. He kind of has that like, I don't know, it sounds like he's about to pass out or something. It's like the least clubby thing, least clubby way you could possibly sing. And I don't know, I just think it has this kind of weird drab attitude that... maybe is like was more common music that I used to listen to and it's kind of cool for me to hear electronic artist Kind of going for that mood and atmosphere It's funny because he he doesn't You like he doesn't adopt any kind of explicit post-punk references or anything, which would be very easy for him It's very gloomy music. It's very slow. It's very dark But he doesn't, he's not trying to present himself like in a factory records vein or anything. He's just doing his weird thing. I was really impressed with the fact that all of his records have very uniform sleeves even though they're on different labels. Which is, I think, pretty cool also that the labels agree to do that. Like, yeah, it's Tin Man, of course it's going to get the border and the sans serif. Going on from that, let's talk about Slow House. Slow down. Slow talk. In terms of the sort of talking about the tracks poll, I guess I wanted to talk more about maybe trends and bigger ideas just because it's kind of hard to talk about single things. Jack, Philip, slower house music seemed more prevalent than ever, I suppose. Yeah, I think there were some really strong anthemic tracks, such as the number one, the number two. to the number seven I think it was, The Gathering. And yeah, I just think there was a lot more melody brought to the play this year, which people seem to latch onto. Do you think, I think it's interesting that the slow-mo house thing wasn't necessarily a reaction to anything. It's like, it's, you know, Minimals running around, I don't know, say that was a prominent thing before, Minimals running around 125 BPM and it wasn't like, oh shit, we've got to counteract that. It just seemed to kind of like, okay, well, if we're dropping the BPM, let's say this is logical conclusion. Well, yeah, I don't know if it was so much that, I mean, obviously, you know, the slowing down of deceleration of BPM was a feature, but I think more importantly for me, at least, has been like the resurgence of... melody in house especially, often after the whole minimal thing really dies down. Now for example you're getting tracks like Coma Cat, ostensibly cheesy, in inverted commas, tracks that people are craving because of... for me is a barren melodic landscape. But do you think that's just merely a byproduct of looking to the past? You know, you take on the past whole set and everything that goes on with it. I don't think so. I don't think it's necessarily looking back to, I mean, you know, if you're going back to the old school house days, they weren't, okay, melody was more of an important thing, but it wasn't necessarily so prevalent. For me, at least, it's just the reaction in terms of it being the total opposite of what went just before. I was more fascinated by the fact that like just tempo in general like not even sort of any one type of house music went slower like you had The Revenge and Marky, which is completely different from what Ten Snake is doing. The art department, I feel like, is totally different than those three. It just seemed like all over the place. I don't necessarily think this is a 2010 thing. I think it's gradually throughout the last decade been. on a downward slope. I mean, if you look, even if you listen back to some of the commercial club tracks of the late 90s, I mean, you're clocking in at somewhere nearer to 130 BPM. I mean, they really rocketed. I just think there's been a general trend to slow shit down. Are we just getting older? I mean, there's some of that. I mean, there was, I think, like, just personally for me, if there was a reaction, it was a reaction to, like, this was a year I didn't go out a lot and didn't feel like going out a lot. And it didn't make a lot of sense to be, like, playing 128 BPM sets for myself at home. Like, why? And so for me, it was like... looking for slower tempos just because it sounds better and it's a different mood or vibe. But I think a lot of artists were maybe like more explicitly playing with tempo because realizing that you can do different things at certain tempos and there are certain things you can't do at any other tempo. I was thinking of like Fawlty DL. I mean this year he did kind of like a garagey record. Then he turned around and he did that I want to say Entourage record also on Planet Mew in which he dropped the tempo way back. He had already the previous year of his Ramp EP he had like a 100 BPM track in there too. And the same thing with Andy Stott did like a 100 BPM kind of a Lady Blacktronica style. real slow-mo thing and then he was it also Andy that did the juke track yeah and then he turned then he sped it up and did the juke track and I just think like you're seeing a lot of artists like who maybe a couple of years ago took tempo for granted like we were saying it used to be you know Ricardo and in some interview a few years ago said that 128 bpm was the the gold standard you know and which now I think to many of us 128 feels awful fast. But I think you're seeing more people not just taking tempo for granted and actually thinking about what it means to play at a certain tempo. And people who are deciding that they want to play this kind of records, but they want to play them pitched down to minus six, because that's where... their hard lies. Yeah, I just think it's interesting that there seems to be this mass realization of like two sort of disparate scenes sort of realizing at the same time, hey, if we pitch our stuff down and they pitch their stuff up, maybe we could meet in the middle somewhere. You got peanut butter in my chocolate. So one of the guys who's obviously doing quite a bit of pitching in the way and is one of your favorites of the year, probably the producer of the year, I'd say. Although you can certainly argue with that. It's Ramadan man, David Kennedy. Ryan, you're in luck with him. Yeah, I was hoping we wouldn't move on to this subject because I'm starting to think I'm going to be appearing like a bit of a fanboy. I think a big thing for me is that I get off very much on hearing things done in a certain way that I just wasn't expecting and he does kind of explore like classic tropes in his music but it's just done in like this I had to say to say naive but I know that the approach that a lot of these guys are taking is just a very very simple like I've got this copy of reason or fruit loops and I'm not really tied down to any particular thing and I'm just gonna let my imagination run wild and that he can kind of bring it together and just I don't know I really don't know where he's getting it from if I'm honest um yeah and if anybody else has opinions on it i just think that it's fascinating along with pedo's on that different tip like how absolutely experimental the stuff that he makes sounds like the Rondon and the P's, especially there's some tracks on there I'm just like... I'm no DJ but sometimes I put things in like a program to see sort of like how they would mix and like I can't even tell immediately where the beat is like you know where the downbeat is and it's just like... Yeah. How would you, when you're constructing this, even think to be like, eh, then we'll cut all of this out. and then we'll put something there and there. Yeah, I think it's interesting as well that he's constructing his tracks almost as five minute pieces. If you listen to that latest Pierce and the sound really in its entirety, the last 90 seconds I think of the B side, or I can't remember which side, but just fade out to nothingness and you're left with 30 seconds at the end where it's like a tick. you know, it's like a metronome, keeping time or something. But yeah, he's kind of got one eye on the dance floor and at the same time he's like pleasing himself with all these just like rhythmic obscurities. Yeah, it's incredible. Also a guy who's, I guess, looking at dance music from an experimental lens is Omiavan. Who's 004A, I guess, in our top tracks of the year list. Will, you saw this played out, I think, by Dixon? Yeah. Yeah, well, I saw Dixon play the, what you just mentioned, the 004A and the really... Epic one, the B-side at number three, both in the same morning. It was like a really weird party. It was at Panorama and it was when they had the snacks party, which is basically like an all-men's sex party in Burgheim. And so the crowd in Panorama was like a lot of, I don't know, normal, like weird Panorama crowd plus all these guys in fetish gear. It was Easter Sunday at like 9 a.m. So it was a pretty epic Panorama experience. And Dixon does really well there a couple times. But anyways, when he played the first Winnie the Pooh track, I don't know, it was like, it sounds cheesy. something but like it was kind of like well-timed like the sort of like sun had come out outside it was getting really light inside Pinarambar and I remember it was like I mean that song is has a lot of like has a really epic melody but there it's not a very funky beat they're not really I don't know it doesn't make you really want to dance so it's like people around me kind of took this opportunity to all just like I don't know like kiss or sort of just interact with each other and everyone's just like smiling and everything and it had been a really good vibe for a while and I remember it was actually like me and the people else were like oh we have to sit down we have to sit down and we finally were about to sit down and then it was like hearing that like whistle come in it was like well okay there's no way it was anything and then later it was like you know it's totally it was just kind of like hippie-ish almost like ridiculously euphoric vibe and um and then it was like less than an hour later he played the 04 um and the complete opposite happened like something i felt like was the most like godless rave. The whole scene became very sinister. This guy in front of me wearing a thong and leather straps and everything. Both songs really transformed the whole scene. Those are some of my favorite clubbing memories of the year for sure. I remember it was only until I heard that track out that I finally got it. Got what it was about. I finally heard the funky... Which one? The four? The four, yeah. I think in a way it's sort of indicative of how conservative dance music is in a way in that there's just a bit of distortion in there. You're all like shocked to our skin. What is this noise? I do not think. Yeah, I can see what you're saying, but I don't think it's just a bit of distortion with that track. I think it's... I think certain scenes it would be. Yeah. Charles, maybe. You know me, I'm reactionary about this. The last thing, Lady Blacktronica. I don't know why I wanted to talk about her, but I think she's also doing something that's quite individual sometimes on her tracks. Sometimes she kind of devolves into some pretty cliché Deep House type stuff, but for me at least, the stuff she does with her voice sometimes is pretty cool. really just quite strange and wonderful. Christine, you wrote the piece Breaking Through on Lady Electronica this year. Was that, I mean, part of the appeal for you? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think I knew that I liked the music and I was always more drawn to the tracks with her vocals and having spoken to her and gotten to know her a little bit, I think it's just because there's no filter between... her as a person and her when she sings. She's a very kind of open and unrestrained person once you get to know her and I think that a lot of the that she feels being where she is geographically, perhaps feeling like she hasn't been given the opportunities that she wants or deserves. Which is where? She's in Mount Shasta, which is kind of northern California, I think near the border of Oregon, in a small community. Near the border of Nevada, I think, actually. Yeah, on the way to Reno. Yeah, I mean, it's quite remote. It's quite conservative. I remember trying to get a photographer for the piece, and it was like, well, when are you going anywhere else? Yeah, I think that she's... And it's one of those things... I don't even know if she's truly kind of cognizant of what she's doing, but all of that. That turmoil, like the track that she put out this year, Untitled, on the DL. It is like, it's breaking up with somebody but on a song. It's just the rawness and the kind of range of emotions that she kind of flicks from one to the other. She's pretty special with what she does and I think it's going to be interesting to see how she progresses with that because if she does happen to leave this community or does start to work with the people that she really admires, I think it's going to be interesting to see how that filters through to the museum. I had a similar response that I couldn't figure out if what she was doing was incredibly calculated or was just kind of accidental and specifically with like the dissonance and the atonality of the music there's some really jarring It's like there's keyboards and two different keys and they're just kind of glommed together. And tempos just share with each other. Yeah, and it's like really... And what it reminded me the most of in some ways was the... oh hell, the Childproof Man records on Ghostly, but which were so, their dissonance was very refined and every frequency was perfectly filtered and perfectly sculpted. Whereas this was just this kind of like, yeah, raw, naked, I don't know what you call it. unfinished and kind of ugly but in such a compelling way. Or wrong. I mean, that's such a cliche.
