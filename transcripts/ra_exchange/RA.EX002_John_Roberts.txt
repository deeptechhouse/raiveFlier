Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Earlier this month, John Roberts released his debut album, Glass 8s, on Dial Records. It's easily one of our favorite full lengths of the year at Resident Advisor, delivering on the promise of his lovely collection of Deep House 12 inches for the label. We talked to John late last year as part of our breaking through features on the site, but we decided to catch up with him again last month to see if we couldn't find out more about this American-born DJ/producer living in Berlin. In the process, I learned a few things that I didn't know about him. not least of which was his love of trashy American reality television. I was born in Ohio. I was born in Cleveland. I lived in Cleveland for 17 years. What do you remember about Cleveland? Not even in an electronic music sense, but just like... Not so much. I mean, it's a really cold, dark city. Very, very cold. It always seemed like winter. I don't remember having a summer there at all. But I'm sure there was one. Was it, uh, were you already into electronic music by the time you left or was... I was, yeah. I started going to raves there when I was 15 and... What kind of, I mean, do you remember any of the artists that were playing? Were they... Yeah, well, I mean, it was really diverse. They were always really large parties, so it was kind of like... like a warehouse party with maybe five different rooms so like uh the first one i went to was oliver ho in the main room and then it was a metalheads thing in the basement when you went to this first rave did you go because you knew some of the artists or I went because I was listening to, I guess, sort of like rap music and like poppy punk music before that. So I would always go to the store called... record exchange which was just like a used record store and i got this smarties cd and inside the booklet it said thanks to all the ravers and that was like a completely new word for me at that point so i was spending a lot of time on the internet at that point So I did some investigating and then I found out that there was kind of like this whole Pittsburgh and Cleveland rave scene happening and then also like Midwest, just like a greater Midwest rave scene. And then I ended up subscribing to their mailing list and then seeking out someone to drive me there. So it was like an elaborate series of lies to my parents to like, okay, I'm gonna go stay at John's house and then I would call them at midnight to let them know that I was safe and then I would have this older woman come and pick us up and we would go drive to somewhere like Pittsburgh or somewhere outside of Cleveland for one of these parties. It felt quite unsafe in a way. Yeah, it definitely felt unsafe. I mean because it was... It was something that I didn't know anything about, but I was really intrigued by. And I guess I thought that it was a lot more dangerous than it probably was, actually. Because a lot of them were in areas of the city that I hadn't been to before. You lived in the suburbs. I wasn't allowed to go to, yeah, I was living 20 minutes south of Cleveland. Once you got to some of these raves, even the first one, was there a certain type of music you immediately gravitated towards or was it just the whole sort of experience of being at the rave? more yeah I think I think it was the whole definitely the whole thing and like the general culture and and I remember even at the first one I was just really interested in all all of the different types there was also a happy hardcore room and I was really interested in that but I remember in Oliver Ho's that specifically there was a track which had like a chopped up Lauryn Hill sample and so this was something that was like really easy for me to relate to at the time and so I think that that's kind of the thing that won me over was hearing that at the end of the night. It seems like 90s hip-hop and maybe even late 80s hip-hop is totally a touchstone for you. Yeah. Kind of interesting. Yeah. I remember reading an interview with you recently that you said this first Smith's album, Tennessee hip hop, Southern hip hop. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. New Orleans and Chicago, Chicago house. I was intrigued by the hip-hop one in the middle there. Yeah, I mean when I was... It's kind of the only type of music that I've ever listened to constantly. Just because I was listening to the radio all the time when I was younger. I was going to violin lessons from the... point when I was really young and so on the way to and from the music school which was like 40 minutes away it was downtown in the city I would always force my mom to listen to the rap station And she would entertain the idea until something came on that she thought was a little bit too filthy. And it was funny because actually she usually was wrong about the line that she would think that she heard. and then she heard something but it was usually wrong. Maybe going a little bit too deeply into it in a way, but obviously New Orleans rap is quite interesting compared to, say, New York rap, which may typically have a more lyrical influence. You get guys who are quite a bit... more interested in telling stories like Nas or someone like that. At least the stereotype of New Orleans or Southern rap is that it's just guys chanting a lot of times. And also at the same time, there's also this very electronic element. It's typified by 808s. Right, I think that that's why it was, or I mean recently it's kind of been of more interest to me because it's... to me seems more related to like Booty House or something like that because it's really it's based on these these same loops which is something that I always saw in like Booty House and Ghetto House which was you know these DJs trading around all the same samples and making different tracks but they're always based on these same core set of samples. And so I think with New Orleans balance that's definitely... the same type of thing that happens. Who are you listening to? I mean, are you listening to anyone specifically that you kind of have a fascination with New Orleans hip-hop wise? Maybe Fresh is a good name, of course. Yeah, when I was younger, I was listening to Juvenile a lot. a lot of the cash money artists but lately there's been kind of this they were calling it sissy bounce movement and there's this guy Sissy Nobi who is like you know a bounce MC but he's this this gay guy obviously that plays into The Chicago house as well. Mm-hmm like there's always this sort of tension Mm-hmm in a way fine very masculine and beats but also this right soft gospel aspects Yeah, I think maybe someone like Jamie Principle or someone like that is a good example. I need your job I guess listening to your music, you can kind of hear the influence. but it's it's definitely hard to discern. You sent me a mix that you did a month ago or so and it was strictly all Chicago as far as I could tell. Old school house. Yeah mostly. And do you get a sense of where that comes into your music? and sort of how that infiltrates what aspects are sort of filtering in or do you even think about it i do yeah yeah i definitely I mean, I think that I just have these strong mental associations mainly with the drum programming from 80s Chicago house. But also, I mean, I think there's so much house from that era in Chicago that's really bad. And I think that that's why I like it because it's really difficult to find an amazing record from that era. But when you do, it's something that's really special. So that mix that I sent you was kind of, you know, some of my favorites from that era. What aspects sort of make some of those tracks special? I guess to me, what I mean by that is one where you can really see the personality of the person who is making it. Something that was maybe a little bit more melodramatic or something a track where you can see that the artists let their guard down a little bit Is more interesting to me. Do you because I feel like that's when they succeeded and that's kind of what I have tried to do with my own music do you think Most of your tracks are best made when you sort of let your guard down. Yeah, I mean, well, I don't know about best made, but I feel like I personally succeeded when I know that I've done that. And I mean, I know there's ones that I've made where I definitely feel like I failed on that. And they've been released. Yeah. What are the tracks on the new album where you think that really came through? That the guard got let down and you can hear immediately? I think that the second track, "Navy Blue" probably was one for me where I felt really... I don't know, that one seems really personal to me, but also... the seventh track porcelain because I really that was the last track that I finished and I really felt like I kind of it was kind of like the sum of all the influences that I wanted to incorporate in the album and then it was also Not worrying about restraining myself in any way for the you know, the potential audience or the label or anything and what not. Thank you. Bye. Bye. I was really struck when I listened to a recent interview that she did with Heidi. And she played it in this mix that was pretty, for lack of a better word, bumpin'. And porcelain fit right in. I was really like... I guess even maybe it's just the context of the album and hearing it around other tracks that are more delicate, I suppose, in a way. You almost don't understand the power that some of these things can have. Do you find that to be the case in a way? Well I think that yeah, I mean I also didn't know how it would function in a dance context because I wasn't really... you know I was going to my studio to listen to these things on monitors very occasionally but most of it was done... on headphones, so... And even when I was in the studio, I mean, it's not the same as listening to it in a club, so it wasn't until we got the test pressings and then I heard someone play it in a club environment that I realized that it could... that that track could kind of function. Is it something you worry about? Obviously when you're producing on headphones it's sort of like... I mean it's something that I think that I definitely think about I try to force myself not to subscribe to that though because I really don't want anything to... of what I'm making. I really want it to be purely what I want it to be time-wise, length-wise. I don't ever want to think about, okay, there needs to be some sort of outro DJ so that it's DJ-friendly or something like that. Did you hear things when you were listening to them in the studio context that you said, "Oh, that needs to be changed"? I mean, just EQ-ing wise. Can you give us a specific example of like, the bass line wasn't quite... I don't know, I mean I didn't want anything to be too over the top. I'm not really drawn to a lot of contemporary dance music because I think it's all about kind of scientifically pushing how far sound can go and not in a musical sense but you know how far can we compress this bass line or how loud can this can... kick drum beat so that it functions on a dance floor, has the best reaction on a dance floor. But I was more interested with the album in making something that would function well musically. Or, you know, try to move someone musically or emotionally rather than with this, like, aggression. I didn't find there to be, like, in a lot of cases on the album, a lot of change from the 12 inches sound, in a way. Was there a conscious decision, generally, to do different things? the album i mean there's a couple of tracks where you know the second to last track obviously you're right gonna play that on a on a dance floor right i'm not sure in any case but like was there a conscious decision when you were making certain tracks oh this can't go on the album oh this should go on the tour no i mean i really I really was thinking about it so purely as being an album and everything that I was working on was made to kind of make this, I don't know, it seems a little bit too intense to call it a narrative arc. But it was all made with the intention of having an arc and being listened to altogether as one piece. So I wasn't concerned with making a group of individual tracks as much. Seems like a very romantic idea these days. People listening to albums all the way through. Getting taken on a journey. Yeah, but I think that those are the best albums. I mean, I'm sure you have some albums that you like to listen to all the way through. And then the albums that you have that you don't, you probably don't. What are some of the albums, aside from the Smiths' first album, what are some dance music albums that you feel like work quite well? This Larry Heard album. Totally slipping out of my mind. Amnesia. Amnesia. Amnesia, yeah. I think that that's a really amazing one. And that was something that I was listening to a lot before I started working on the album. Because I think that it really... I mean it's not necessarily in the same style as what I was trying to do but I think that it really maintains um, bread throughout the whole thing. Do you worry about the track sounding too similar ever? I mean, I don't want to like, you know, criticize you for it, but I do feel like certainly it's a very cohesive album. I don't think of them as being similar. I mean, I think that if you listen to the melodies or the rhythms or something, they're a lot different just because the overlying aesthetic is similar. I don't think that that's a problem right now. How did you first get hooked up with Dial? You're the first American, right? On the label. Yeah, I was... I had met up with Romy, who was DJing as Snow for Dial at the time. This was a couple of years ago. And I was visiting Berlin and we had a coffee and... And then she had heard my music through Myspace. And then she was going to be moving to New York for a little while because her boyfriend was living there. And so I gave her a CD of my music and then at her going away party before she moved to New York for a while she gave the Dial Guys. What were some of the tracks on there? Had you sent music to many other labels before that in the hopes of getting it signed? The first place I ever sent anything... Well, when I first started making music, the first person I ever sent anything was Code9. That seems like a very... I mean, considering... But at the time, yeah, at the time when I was messing around with making music and I sent him those things, I was listening to a lot of U-Step and UK Garage and this was kind of when that music was going into grime, going into dubstep and Hyperdub was a newer label at that point. What was it about Hyperdub that immediately drew you to him? And especially, like, as far as... It seemed like the strongest label in that sort of genre, and I still think that it is now. Do you listen to a lot of... UK things? UK bass music? I wouldn't... I mean, like I said, when... When Two Step in UK Garage was coming around, I was listening to a lot of that and I really loved it because there was a strong R&B influence. For sure. And then also Grime, when that started happening, I was interested in that. And then sort of when Dizzy Rascal had that track, I Love You. It was kind of like, that's kind of like the latest point I remember. And after that, I kind of started getting less and less interested in that, in that genre because... You were in Chicago or New York at the time? I was living in Cleveland when I first started getting into Two Step. I was ordering records from Juno. Ordering those records from Juno. But yeah, so after this "Jizzy Rascal" single came out, it kind of felt like the people that were involved in grime kind of saw what could happen with that music. You know, they saw that they could have a big single and make some money from it. And not that that's a bad thing, but... I think it sort of took away some of the spontaneity that was in those dub plates or whatever white labels that were coming out before that. Where it was done purely for, like, this is, you know, this is what we're just doing for fun. I remember getting, like, tapes from friends in England at the time of, like, Rinse FM shows, or radio and just thinking Dizzy Rascal was from another planet. Yeah, totally. And it was really amazing and it seemed really raw at that time. I wonder, I mean obviously the R&B influence sort of appealed to you. I wonder, though, you know, you do listen to rap, you listen to grime and stuff, is... are lyrics something that you're interested in, or maybe exploring in your own music in the future? Not necessarily having Dizzy Rascal rhyme in your tracks, but... Um, I don't know, I don't think it would be something that, or it's not something that I've really wanted to do with this project, but I would really like to have... another project sometime when I had time to concentrate on it that involved singing in some way. Who are some of the singers that, not necessarily even having them on your tracks or whatever, but just like have been sort of touchstones for you? I don't know. I guess the main one, Will Oldham has always been the one. He's always the first one that comes to mind. And this is Bonnie Prince Billy, sort of an indie guy. His music, for those who don't really listen to it, is quite sort of depressing folk music. But I think the thing about Oldham's singing especially is that it's exceptionally raw. Yeah, it's really raw. You can always hear his voice cracking. in this type of thing. Definitely. Is, I mean, what are some of the, is that, I mean, the thing that got to you about his music? Yeah, I mean, his voice, the fact that, I mean, in all traditional senses, maybe he doesn't have the best singing voice, but... But the way he would project it on his songs or in like a live setting was with complete confidence. But I like how he had this confidence, but then all of the songs were... kind of yeah depressed and you kind of get the feeling from the songs that he's this introverted person but then but then he's like really doing doing all that he can to like to push all of that out I don't know if that's making any sense yeah but I think the really fascinating thing about him especially is that he's he was also an actor for a while and a lot of people talk about how they wonder if the Bonnie Prince Billy thing is almost an act in a way. It's like a character he takes on. Yeah, I mean I think in some ways because he's had, you know, all these different music projects with all these different aliases. It's very dance music in a way. Yeah, totally. I don't know, but anyway, going back to what you were saying before about albums and congruence with albums, I think that he has this album, I See a Darkness, I think it's called, and... And that's just like one of the albums that I've always been able to listen to all the way through and there aren't any tracks that you come to where you skip over. At least I didn't. The cover on that album is really distinctive. It's like sort of a... I think that his mother drew it. Okay. Maybe I'm wrong. But I wanted to talk to you, I guess... also about your own cover of your album um seems to be your feet they are why um why did you go with that is the cover to the album um i guess just because i felt like You know, I felt like the music on it was really personal and I wanted to have something personal for the album art, but I didn't want something kind of like cocky or pretentious like a facial portrait or something like that. You studied design, right? I did. I studied design for a couple of years. Did you feel like that's sort of... I mean, obviously Dial has a lot of in-house help on this stuff. Yeah, they've been working with Till Sperle, the same designer for us. I mean, did you have a lot of... I mean, obviously you had feedback into what you wanted on your album. Yeah, we were working together a lot for this one especially. What... you quite like the designer's aesthetic i do yeah why is that the designer for dial yeah i don't know i've always liked the dial aesthetic it's um it's simple but but elegant i guess and you feel the same way about the music as well yeah i think one of the things that makes style special I guess is the fact that everything is but for lack of a better way to put it it seems like buttoned up shirt house in a way yeah I mean I would say it that it's really really well curated and I think that's what that's what makes it something special tell me more about the hyper done thing I mean You obviously like the label and I think in the same interview with Heidi you said you were doing the remix? Yeah right we have been working on the remix for Dark Star for their upcoming album. The single of their upcoming album called Gold. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. You also mentioned you did a remix for Powwow. I did, yeah. When I was talking to you, you talked about how you sort of changed your process a little bit. I was trying to, yeah, I was trying to. I was trying to go about a new way of EQing, I guess. Do you find, I mean, did you get in a groove with the album? in a way. kind of a formula of constructing tracks and it sort of became easy for you? Yeah, I think completely. I mean, maybe not insofar as the, you know, the structure of the tracks goes, but definitely in the way that I would EQ everything or, you know, the way that I would work with samples or work with the programs or synthesizers that I had on hand. I think that you just kind of get into a rhythm and you see something that's working and so you keep exploiting that until you become tired of it. You became tired of it? I mean there's parts of it that I became tired of, sure, so now I'm trying to incorporate different instruments or different methods of EQing and things like that. And how is it going so far? Good, I mean it's still in an experimentation phase I guess. You've been getting quite a few more remix requests. Yeah, I've done a few recently. I did The Powell and then this Dark Star most recently and in the future I think I'm going to do one for Super Pitcher for his new album. And I also have one coming out for Motor City Drum Ensemble and then my friend Lauren Flax's new project called Creep which has the singer Romy Madley Croft from the XX on it. It's a nice song. And are you looking for specific things when you're... you do remakes? I mean you mentioned a lot of friends so yeah yeah it was like it was mainly that I mean it was mainly wanting to work with friends because you know I knew that they would understand what I was doing so I haven't really been from I haven't really been um taking them on from people that I don't know so well. Is there, I mean, do you get your choice of tracks or is it always different? That's how it's been, that's how it was for the Powell remix and then also for the Super Pitcher remix. What about those songs did you sort of hear in them that said to you? okay that's the one I want to I think it was the same type of thing that I hear when when I'm sampling older records for for making a track like for an EP or for the album you know just looking for some sort of a really short but strong loop to latch on to and kind of Work around that I guess I'm always trying to I'm always trying to have one kind of core element that I'm that I'm working in an auto kind of take taking your attention away from and then bringing your attention back Sample-wise sample-wise What would be the most surprising record that you sample? Oh, I mean, I don't want to tell you anything specifically, but there was, I never thought that I would want to sample something with steel drums, but there was kind of like a traditional steel drum record, that solo record that I sampled. Do you do a lot of digging as far as like secondhand records? Yeah, well I do it in spurts actually. I usually have a lot more luck when I go to New York because they have My favorite record store there is called A1. And A1 is owned by the same people that own this record store, The Thing, which is in Greenpoint in Brooklyn. And The Thing, for people that don't know, is kind of like a, I guess a thrift store, like a junk shop on the first floor, and then the basement is just packed with shelves and shelves and shelves of records. And then A1 is kind of where... They take things that might have a little bit of value from the thing, and they bring them to their Manhattan store, and you can buy them there. I think the thing was sort of where Morgan Geist unearthed a lot of the unclassics. Yeah, I would believe that. I knew a guy that was working there, and he said that he found an unopened copy. of Shari Vare there, but maybe that's just a... I think when I started going there, it had sort of been cleaned out by everyone. Yeah, I felt completely the same way, and that's why I really like it as a place, but I never had as much luck there as I had in A1. I mean, A1 was nice too because they had these racks that were the more valuable records, but then they also had the beat-up records. that were underneath on the floor and everything in those bins was like a dollar or two dollars. So I spent a lot of time going through those. And so every time I go back to New York, I kind of try to stockpile a bunch of new samples. I mean you you're buying a steel drum record what are you looking for when you're looking at this one two dollar records and are you looking specifically from the perspective of oh there could be a sample on here? I mean a lot of times when I'm looking through it I don't know if you know I don't know if this is the right way to do it but the way I do it is I kind of go based on the visuals of the LP or something. So if it's something that looks intriguing to me or in the same aesthetic that I'm interested in, then I usually try it out. Or of course, if it's a label that I've been interested in in the past, then I'll try it out. But with a steel drum record, the reason that I bought it is because it has these... really odd kind of like late 70s synth stabs that are mixed in with the steel drum so that's kind of why i wanted to use it um you talk about sort of the same aesthetic So it's all about the cover and basically having a certain look. I mean, that's just sort of like a game I play with myself when I'm there, I guess. And a lot of times I'm wrong. Like a lot of times it'll be some sort of really cold, like, I don't know. like a terrible synth pop record or something like that which I can never find anything on. I guess I imagine sometimes the best sounding records are always the least sample worthy. It's always sort of the cast offs. Yeah, I think so too. Oddities. Yeah, and I think that's kind of the fun part about A1 too, is like a lot of, in those bottom bins that I was talking about, you know, everything's kind of beat up or, you know, has these scratches, like, you know, a record that's 50 cents because it has a total scratch in the middle and it forces it to skip when you're playing it but then you can you can use that skip as part of the track or something like that that's I guess that's something that's interesting to me one of the things I was most interested about your album is that I don't know if it's every track but almost every track seems to have a vinyl sort of like There's like a surface hum or like surface something. They're all mastered to tape at the end. So maybe that's what you're thinking of. But then also, yeah, I mean, because all of them incorporate some samples from old records, I usually just leave them dirty or something like that. Like I don't make an effort to. to make the sampling process clean. And also when I was working on the album, the turntable that I was using to do a lot of the sampling, the ground cable was broken so in a lot of the samples there's kind of like this hum that's on the same frequency range and I would always try to filter it out but you can kind of still hear it. Are you would you consider yourself someone who's into technology and cares about you know like new Not hardware, but you know new programs and stuff um Not necessarily. I mean, I don't... I'm always a little bit leery of new programs that are coming up because I think that it gives you too many options. I think that it's good to kind of have a really limited set of options, and I think that that's when, you know, you kind of end up with these happy accidents, which kind of end up being the special parts of the track, I think. Without giving too much away, were you using this particular program throughout the album? Yeah, I'm using a tracker program to do all of the final sequencing on the album. And that was a program that is kind of like... I mean, I guess you could say it works similar to an MPC or something in the sense that you have a sample bank and then over this time period you're triggering samples and in the tracker it's done on a grid of numbers, so like you have 64 counts and it goes vertically. to translate. But then you also have a sample bank of numbers so you know kick drum is number one and then so you plot out on this grid every every four beats you're putting a kick drum or something. It seems very 80s. Yeah, I mean it's really rudimentary, but I think that's what's so good about it. There's not a lot of options. I mean, I think that with something like Live or something, if you're using it for production, there's just so many effects and plugins and things that you could use that... in the end the finished product can kind of sound like the equivalent of watching a TV show on fast forward or like watching an infomercial on fast forward or something just like the most intense something that's just too intense for the mind or maybe just for my mind you watching much television or like movies I mean you count some of these things as sort of influences in a way oh I mean I really like all of the HBO I don't know, I mean I think that... Well, with the real housewives, it's sort of like a reality Sopranos or something like that, and I really liked the Sopranos. I've never watched the real Housewives. It's not very good. I mean, I usually do it as kind of like a wind down at the end of the day. Yeah, I find myself, there were of course when I was still living in the States, where Berlin now of course one it was quite easy to watch trash television you had a television and totally evil and that's always the thing that I have a choice to download these things I'm always sort of like wow I know you feel kind of lost and you you kind of have to latch on to something and I guess that's why I've latched on to the housewives but that's always something I noticed when I go back to New York is it's really nice to to sit at my friend's house and just have the TV on and kind of have this background, this company of like a background device? I was, when I went to Mutex this year, first time back in North America for a while, and sitting in this apartment and Jersey Shore came on and I hadn't seen an episode. And I, you know, I was just like, people are like, oh, come on, come out to the show. And I was sort of like, well. Actually, I'd rather sit here and watch Jersey Shore for a minute. This weird, this latching on to something from home idea. Do you miss the States? I mean, there's things that I miss about it, and those things get fewer and fewer as time goes on, and I discover, you know... the equivalents that exist here. Because when, I don't know, I guess I had this attitude when I first moved to Germany that was kind of like, oh, you know, they, you know, I'll never be able to find this here, like this certain type of food or something like this. Oh, like I'll never be able to find a restaurant that was as good as this restaurant in New York or something. And I guess over time, you know, you just, this is for these things. And so now I feel really at home here. And now, in my mind, I would much rather prefer to live here than New York. How long did it take before that switch happened? I think it's just been a really slow process. I mean, even just in the last six months, I've started... really feel at home here I think and how long had you been here by that time um two years okay yeah I mean the first the first winter was super super tough It's just really, this can be really solitary and gray here. I think, you know, for some people, though, that's the appeal in a way, especially for some electronic music producers. It's like you have the winter when you get down to work. Right, right. And this solitary winter, and, you know, you have this. summer and everyone comes out and goes to Club Divisionaire and Bar 25 and these places. Yeah, I think I totally have the opposite, unfortunately, where I don't want to go out at all in the summer and I just want to work and in the winter I'm too, like, dealing too much with depression to work or something like that. So it's not the opposite, you just sink further. Yeah, exactly. In the winter as opposed to going out. Further into solitary confinement. ♪ ♪ you you
