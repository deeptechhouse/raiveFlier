Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. When we started the Exchange a little bit less than a year ago, we compiled a short list of artists with a particular charisma that works best in audio rather than text. Canadian DJ producer The Mole was high on that list. We were pleased to finally catch up with this sometime member of Cobblestone Jazz earlier this month. Uninterested in press and even less interested in keeping the microphone steady during our talk, this conversation was one of my favorite exchanges yet. I think I was reading in an interview the first instrument, electronic music instrument you had was an S900? Sampler, yeah. That's right. Yeah. It seems appropriate for you. a sampler still have it still good still like it yeah s900 easy to use a kai still in a kai fan how long do how much sample space do you have on that thing uh the three and a half inch floppy whatever that's worth I don't know what are those? Meg 2 something? I don't know. I used to go 10 bit lower than it was normal. Just then I got a little more real estate out of it because of that. Tell me about when you first got it. I mean, were you like really young or did it come a little bit later? Yeah, I guess. Fuck. Sorry, I'm gonna swear. I swear. Sorry. It happens. Yeah, when... I guess I got it... I was living in Vancouver. I was pretty young, yeah, I guess. It was early 90s, something like that. Yeah. I was... I was buying lots of records. I had a really good job at the time working at some kind of like a brew pub. I was a busboy. But then the DJ quit and I got his job as well. I was playing like rock and stuff. And... Yeah, it was kind of a weird gig. But it was cash. It was under the table. It was a lot of cash. Every Tuesday I'd get 400 bucks, which is tons of money to me, for three nights' work. And I would take that cash and buy records. And at one point I just saved a bunch and bought the 900. So you, I mean, when you were listening to records, playing records, eventually you were like, I need to start making. records. Yeah, it seemed obvious. Or music, anyway. Make music. I remember seeing a lot of DJs come to town, too, that were only famous as producers and they weren't very good as DJs. It was a bit frustrating as well. There's not many people who are famous as DJs, right? Not so many. You have to have productions. Get your name out there, it seems like. Yeah, there are some people, but there's not many. Not like, I don't know, when I was, yeah, the good DJs I was listening to, they had no productions, no chance. Yeah. You were working in a brew pub. You said you've had a lot of shitty jobs. A lot of jobs, yeah. It's one of my party tricks, pull out the jobs, yeah. What was the one last night? They were really excited about changing light bulbs. I changed light bulbs. So you literally answered the question, how many blah, blah, blah does it take to change a light bulb? No, I was changing them. Yeah, I was it. Yeah, I was that guy. It was one column. There is a joke I used to tell at a university that I used to work at to the drummers, and they all hated it. How many drummers does it take to change a light bulb? None. There's a machine that can do it. I hated that joke. Were you always... So you hated drummers? Or you were a drummer? No, no, no. It was just... You just making jokes about drummers. I was working at a university. bunch of jazz drummers like jazz students you know it's just kind of i mean it was a little sad in some ways like learning jazz from the 60s or 40s even but i guess you got to grow up you got to go through it all It's a weird thing to me, though. Learn your music, you mean? Well, the school. Yeah, the school. I guess so, yeah. But you learned how to do electronic music from watching someone, I assume. Or someone gave you some tips along the way. Yeah, well, it was a sharing thing, actually. It was just friends sharing. You learn something, you share. I learned some weird stuff on the S900. I'd show my buddies. Who were your buddies around then? There's so many. It's crazy. Yeah, I mean, Crisco and Koosh and Akeem and the Cobblestone guys. You know, we used to jam all the time. Yeah, it's icy fresh. I don't know, there's tons. There's tons of people. What was the scene like there? This is Vancouver. Yeah, Vancouver, Victoria. I kind of bounced between them before I moved to Montreal. It was great. It's got that hippie vibe and there was lots of drug money. So there was lots of people with too much money to spend. We were making all the weed and selling it to the states. So lots of parties, lots of good parties and, you know, dealers. Bad man likes good things, right? So lots of good music coming in. Lots of, you know, like a lot of free stuff, like outside, a lot of outdoor because there's no spaces. Once the rave, I don't know what happened in the States, but in Canada, there's just like, it just ended, you know, could no more raves. This is like around 2000 or something like that? Earlier than that I'd say even. You know, the big warehouses stopped. Or it had to be more legit when they figured it out, what was happening. Yeah, and we just moved outside. It wasn't such a big deal. You just drive an hour and you're in the middle of nowhere. You know, set up a sound system. I used to have parties. A free party. A friend of mine had a Jenny. A hundred bucks, we'd have a sound You know? Full moon? Head out? What were you playing back then? Fuck, a lot of the same records I'm playing now, actually, which is weird sometimes. A lot of horrible music. I don't know, a lot of... I mean, all kinds. Yeah. All kinds. I liked the breakbeats. I liked the trance. I liked the house. I liked it all. It made sense all together at one point. It seems like the mentality of people from Vancouver that I've met, this hippie vibe, they're just more free spirited and certainly in their DJing. It's just kind of all over the place. Yeah, that's a nice way of saying it, isn't it? There's some seriously bad music out there too, my god. There's some kind of weird music I've never heard before that seems to only exist there, like pop. kind of remix i don't know what the is it's horrible really weird so how did you like find the people who are in the good stuff there was record stores yeah and friends we all seem to just already i don't know what i guess i met a lot of people in victoria we stayed friends kept Moving around, you know, parties or whatever, you run into people. Friendly, friendly time. Make friends. I got on a really busy bus yesterday, two days ago, and Saturday night or something, it was packed. And I was like, man, if there was a sound system in here, people drinking and everything, I'd be making friends. Like, this is a party right now. Berlin, I guess, typical, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know how it is. You just meet people, you're hanging around, rolling around. Does Berlin remind you of that in certain respects? The city? Or no? Remind me of what? Of Victoria. British Columbia. Not so much. Not really. I don't think so. The friendliness of the people. That's really nice. Yeah. I mean, in the tourism, I guess there's lots of tourists in Victoria. It's a big, big town for that. Yeah. Yeah. To a certain degree, I suppose. I don't know. It's not so friendly now, Victoria. Why is that? I don't know. I think they got a big crack problem. So the drugs turned into harder drugs. Yeah, they cut down on the heroin and suddenly violent crime went up. Crack. Yeah. But honestly, I only get the odd bit from friends every now and then. You know, the guys come and visit and I hear some weird news story. cutting up another kid or something horrible, you know. When did you end up leaving there? I moved to Montreal in 98. Okay. Yeah. And I was, I think I was in Victoria at that point. Yeah, I was in Victoria at that point. Me and Pat and Dan, maybe just Pat, lived in a big house. We had a studio in the basement. You know never locked the door never had no concept of the after any of that kind of stuff pretty naive time This is Pat from Colston. Yeah, yeah tiger do yeah. Yeah, I think Dan lived in there too and Bisco Bisco was in there for a while We had a weird studio. I remember everything went around the room If you touch the stuff at the end, you get a small electric shock turntables. I think we're at the end There's some good times in there. What kind of music were you guys making? It's not so far. I mean, it's much less sophisticated than now, but it's not so far off, actually. You know? Yeah. Same idea, I guess. Really. Boom, boom, boom. A couple of shakers, you know? It was all built on samples, though. I mean, you and I think Pat seems, at least from my... conception of cobblestone jazzy seems to be the guys working the turntable yeah yeah there was lots yeah there was there was lots of that i guess there i mean there was there was lots of gear too like uh lots of plan dan always right and he'd always bring something weird like a krumar some kind of weird organ in you know there's always about bringing in something new it still is it ross named it well He called it, Ross, from that Truth is Light label, that great edit label, he called it a barbecue. He said, that's all we do. We just have a barbecue. Everybody brings something different, hang out, throw in their sauce, and yeah, barbecue. It's still the same. So what were you usually bringing? Me? Yeah. What would you bring to the barbecue? Hang out. I don't know. Bring the sampler. You know, crummy keyboard. Maybe my Atari. Bring the Atari. Try and sequence. Were you a good sequencer? I don't know. I don't think I am now. I don't. Probably not then. Yeah. Does it come naturally to you though? Not at all. Sequencing? Yeah. Arranging? Yeah. I don't think anything comes naturally to me, to be honest. I have a terrible time. I was a bad skateboarder. I'm bad at music. I'm still trying to figure shit out. I don't think anything honestly has ever come naturally to me. What's that creative, that really... polar thing there the the what is it the great idea if somebody has a great idea or somebody who works forever and gets to you know a great idea milks it like the minivan or the muscle car or the the person who works hard and slowly gets there like the uh like the what is that engine with it takes both you know the fusion engine or whatever they call that the hybrid yeah yeah it's like ancient but it's only now getting good I'm like the hybrid engine. I'm not the muscle car. So you're only now getting good. I don't know if I am getting good. I think I'm getting worse. Plans are getting worse. I'm getting lazier. That's bad. How? I shouldn't say how is that possible. That's probably pretty rude. So were you ever driven to do anything? I mean, you've made music to your career. Clearly, someone thinks you're good at it. Yeah, I'm really lucky. That's for sure. You know, because there's lots of talented people that don't seem to leave their house for whatever reason. I'm lucky that way for sure. But someone must, okay, so someone must have at some point said, you know what, this record's done, you need to put it out. Yeah, I had to man up at one point and do that, yeah. This was in 2001 was the first record? Yeah, right, yeah, I did that with Reno. I was just with him, actually, that's funny. And Bisco, Bisco, he manned that. I just saw pictures of that, actually. pictures of it because we did a big road trip from Montreal to Ottawa to Toronto to get it cut. It took forever because we put lock grooves in it. And the guy, it was his first time cutting grooves. It took a long time. But yeah, yeah. At one point, you just say it's done. What are you going to do? A million tracks in the machine. Sick of passing them out. Why did you go to see a cut? It's exciting, isn't it? It was the first record on the label, too, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, one of two. Yeah. It's exciting seeing a record get cut. Have you seen it? I've seen it. Yeah, I don't know for me. It's like it was kind of awesome I'd done a dub plate once before that and that was awesome this old reggae guy in Vancouver But yeah, I was just excited to see it see it get done and make sure the lock grooves went in like it was supposed to and all that kind of you know Did anyone know how to do the lock groove? You said? that the guy yeah yeah it was that was the first time he'd ever done it yeah it was the first time for him I mean here the I think they've got a machine because it's the same every time right it's really precise and he was using the old they had like a lever to drop the head in to the you know and then the naked plate and he was it's got a delay it drops slow and pulls out slow yeah you can imagine like you can't overwrite it because it will screw it up and you underwrite it and also throw it out actually if you look closely at that record one of the grooves it splits in three and comes back together into one yeah and depending on the weight you can actually get it to slide in and out of those Depending on the weight of the needle. I've got lots of copies for sale still. Hundreds, hundreds. They're at Cristobal's house in Montreal. They must be going for tons on Discogs. Oh yeah, they must be worth tons of money, I'm sure. He's hoarding all these records. just so they appreciate and value over time. Yeah, yeah. It took you a while after that to release another record, right? There was a record under a different name, but then it was like 2004 before, at least on Discogs. Yeah, Discogs must be right. Yeah, I'm trying to think of what it would be. So what was the holdup? Trying to figure it out. I don't know. You were in Montreal at the time. Yeah. And that's, Mutech had started by then. Yeah. There were all these guys putting out records around you. Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah. Was that really... The Smoke Meat comp came out. John still sometimes apologizes because I wasn't on it. You were supposed to be on it. No, no, no, no. I didn't get asked. I don't think I was cool enough. I don't think I was good enough. You know, I don't think I had my chops in order. It's still, you listen to the old stuff. It's not so hot. I don't think, although some people like that. Actually, what was, what's 2004? Was it the Phil pod? It might've been. That was either that or five. Put Actually, it's sort of sad now that I think about it. Somebody told me that was their favorite record so long ago. It's hard not to think about that stuff. Yeah, you think, boy, I've done a lot of records since. What's the deal? I'm only getting worse, right? Tell me about being in Montreal around that time from what I... can gather must have been pretty inspirational to be around all these guys making records getting european record deals well i mean that's see coming from montreal and vancouver whatever it seems like space doesn't seem real you know somebody's got a hit and it's like yeah right whatever like you're playing it at laika like That's the only place you'll hear it, you know, maybe in stereo if you're lucky. So guys blowing up and stuff like Mark blowing up, it's like a fantasy. You couldn't really touch it. You can't relate. It's another world, you know. Ibiza in the magazines, it doesn't seem real, right? It's a person, it all seems real. There is a certain confidence though, you know, when somebody jumps off the bridge first. You know, it's safe. They lived. You can do it. That same, I guess, logic fits in me getting here. But yeah, it was pretty, it was definitely fun. Definitely a fun time. But there was all kinds of shit going on, right? Like the whole turntablism thing was blowing up in Montreal. A-track, get koala. That was pretty inspiring. There was a lot of... It's still a lot of fun times there. A lot of fun people. It's one of those towns. What is it about Montreal that's so cool? Well, it's, I mean, my uncle, God bless my uncle, is the man for this. You know, he was going out when he was 13 or something. jazz shows and checking out the musicians. It's a cheap, you know, it's a party town. Always has been, I guess. Universities. The French. The French. The French. It says it all right there, right? Right? All the comedians come out of Ontario, but you can't beat Quebec. Like, right? Aside from the clowns and the mimes and all that shit. Somehow, they're the only people who can go to mime school and still be cool. You know? Yeah. Yeah. Party town, I guess. Got a lot of universities. A lot of kids running around, and I guess... But, I mean, there are a lot of university towns, but I don't think there is a huge music scene. I mean, obviously something happened in Montreal around that time. Can you put your finger on it? Around that time? Yeah. Something happening in Montreal all this time. There's still something happening in Montreal. Like, it's still cool. It's still, like I say, my uncle, you know? And he's still rolling around. He's still checking out Jazz Fest. He lives downtown. Him and his wife, they're super cool. I don't know. Yeah, for electronic music, I don't know what happened. I don't know. Stereo was really amazing at that time. But then there was Bombay and stuff. That was Nav Binder. That was a whole different scene. That's still happening. McGill still making music. Records were coming in. I understand that it was even cooler, like, way before I arrived. You know? The house music and stuff. One of the guys I learned to DJ with, Crisco, he came from there. He named himself after a club there. The stories and the music he brought to the table, it was like a different world. He was the first guy to bring that heavy, like, merc and stuff into my world. blow my mind you know still wish I made music that good was it a big change from Vancouver where you were going out an hour away throwing out a throwing a free party in the woods somewhere yeah obviously big change yeah Montreal's got like it's a city it's got bars it's okay to drink you know it's okay to be out till three three can you imagine How late could you go out in Vancouver? Two. So it's just an hour, but that hour made all the difference. Yeah. Well, it seems like it's like, you know, free. You can buy beer at the corner store, the kiosk or whatever you call it. You can't do that anywhere else in Canada. Or maybe you can now. I don't know. But French. It's all about the French. It's all about those beautiful girls. They're just the best in the world. You know? No question for that. What, as far as you said that Kid Koala was there, I mean, were you... dipping into those scenes. They used to have a great night called, I mean, there was a lot of those kind of events, those like scratch-a-thons and, you know, they premiered, was it Scratch, maybe? I can't remember what it was called. They had a big premiere for the movie and like. A bunch of X-Men came, and all the heavies had to roll through there, it seemed. They had an open turntable night. You could just show up in two minutes, do your thing, one minute. I met a bunch of people there. I still see, you know. And, like, weird. Like, I met, like, classical pianists and stuff would come and hang out, check it out, you know. It was a real mixed bag. It's that kind of town, though, right It was happening. It was really cool. Kid Koala, he's still there. He's still doing it. I mean, he's A-track. He was short back then. He's a big guy. Do you do a lot of turntable tricks? Just for fun at home. That's like something I do to keep myself entertained. I try not to, I kind of, I'm not so tricky. Like I say, I'm not very good at stuff. You know, still learning. But I know at Mutech you did some performances where you were doing turntable-related things, right? Yeah, I haven't done that in ages. Five or six turntable madness. Yeah, I just saw a picture of that shit, actually. Yeah, it was pretty fun. Loops, I was obsessed with loops. I guess I just slowed down. They were much faster back then. Well, the record loops, right? Same speed. Yeah. Yeah. Fixed, right? 133. Yeah, I haven't done that in ages, though. I haven't even listened to it. Lots of delays and shit. It was pretty fun. I wouldn't mind doing that again. I should try it. I had to cut them up and stuff. I really worked on that, actually. Spent a lot of time. I still have some of those records. Was it only six records, or did you change records Yeah, yeah, yeah, moving it around, trying to keep it alive. It was just a one-off thing? Uh, no, I did it, I think I did it twice or three times for Mutec, and maybe one more time for somebody else, maybe two more times. I don't know. It was pretty fun, though. It was really psychedelic. It was like a trip every time. I never knew what the hell was going to happen. I was always getting surprised. Yeah, it was good. The first time I did it, it wasn't as good as, you know, I got better. Of course I got better. Yeah, I wouldn't mind trying that again. That's been a long time since I did that, though. A long time. It seems like you're, you know, it feeds into this obsession with loops. You seem to have. It fits, doesn't it? Yeah. What loopers do I have at home? I don't know. Yeah, it fits. Yeah, I should probably try it again. It's very techno. I mean, it can be pretty quiet and weird and spacey, but it's fast. Nobody likes to go that fast anymore. When's that going to come back, eh? People are going to get going fast again, I'm sure. Were you ever fast? Me? Yeah. Music? Yeah. Not too fast, no. I always thought drum and bass would be a fad. No, I never got too fast. Isn't Matt Johnson huge into drum and bass? Yeah, he has a massive collection at home. It's crazy. His first record, I got it founded in my collection in Montreal just recently. A remix for... Drum and bass remix for Nelly Furtado. DJ Decibel. I wonder how much that goes on Discogs for. I should just sell mine. But you never got into it, the drum and bass thing. That wasn't my thing. It's too fast for me. I know everyone likes to dance slow and all this shit. I don't know. It just wasn't my thing. Hip-hop and stuff was easier for me. It was smoother. That was music. I liked Spiral Tribe at one point. You know, I did like, you know, Fast Crazy. I guess that was before drum and bass. But yeah, at one point, yeah. Yeah, I guess I went fast. So it was hip hop that you were DJing first, though? Yeah, that and whatever records I could find. Yeah, yeah. I mean, the very first time I DJed was with hip-hop records, and I for sure started buying hip-hop records right away. But at the same time, I was buying, I think, a Masters at Work album and Spiral Tribe and, you know, like, I don't know, Death Brothers. Think about those first Death Brothers records that they got in trouble for, Chemical Brothers. What kind of hip-hop were you into? Cristobal would laugh at me. He called me a sissy, actually. I liked the West Coast kind of stuff, you know? He called it backpacker. I always liked the far side and, you know, like Dell and that kind of stuff. Plus wine and gin in the sea Finishing the last drop to the liquor store It was a cash crop, dropped right past the crack With the dumbest shit I ever did ever God, I must admit, I absolutely loved Gangstar. It took me a while to find Wu-Tang and move around out of that stuff. Was it the production or was it the lyrics or both? Yeah, both for sure. Some of that stuff is real high school rap, right? You know, it's about goofing off and running around clowning. It fits really well and it's about getting high, which is just like, you know, right into my world. But of course the production. I didn't realize, you know, like who said it? Dill is the favorite producer I never knew I loved. You know, right? The favorite producer I never knew. But, yeah, of course, the beats and the grooves and everything. Madlib, still one of my favorites. Guys, mind-boggling. Do you think getting high is why you make slower music? I hope not. God, no. No, I hope not. Pretty slow in general. I don't know. It's a tough question. Is it? I guess. There was a huge drum and bass community in Vancouver, so it couldn't have been that necessarily. Parties were a little weird for me. They weren't my thing, really. You were never much of a partier. Oh, no, I went to those parties. I went all over the place. Sure, sure, I'm social. I like going out. They weren't the coolest parties for me, that's what I'm saying. heavy speed scene in Vancouver. At that time, there was a lot of meth, you know, broken light bulbs. So what were your favorite parties? Were they the ones that you were throwing? No, my favorite had to be, like, the stuff, like, and actually, this guy, these guys are still my high watermark for, like, dealing with shit the coolest. You know, like, Toffer and Trevor, these guys, they used to be to do these parties. And they still do. They still do. Actually, Soundwave, great. I think it's over. They canceled it actually this year. This is a festival? Yeah, out on the West Coast, out in the woods. It's like five, six hours from Vancouver. Beautiful location. and just an epic festival. But these guys, yeah, still, when I'm dealing with anybody, it's like, well, how would those guys do this? They're just, they're golden. They're geniuses. They're the guys who never stress. Amazing. Amazing parties, therefore, as a result, right? Everybody's having a good time. They're the guys who show up. Like you're on a beach, it's taking you an hour to hike in, and somebody rolls up with a boat and like a keg of beer, or like suddenly a blender appears and their margaritas are going out. It's like 8 in the morning. Oh, fantastic. What a nice, thank you. Margarita, lovely. You know? Have you ever found parties or a festival or anything that's sort of gotten close to that? No. No. No, I haven't. Close to Soundwave? No. And you know, everyone's talking about how crazy it is staying up for days and all this stuff. I think Johnny even said it to me the other day, like, oh, people are going to remember this for years. This is legendary stuff. Way crazier on the West Coast. There are way crazier motherfuckers out there. Those guys can out-party anybody. Animals. It's way crazier than Berlin, you're saying. Yeah. Easy. Easy. Yeah. Yeah. It only happens once a year. It's not like every night here. It's insane. Of course. Don't get me wrong. Party capital. But they know how to do it nice. Some really bad music. Occasionally some good music. Tons of love. You know, what more do you need? Yeah. Do you find yourself when you're making music to go, I guess, back to Montreal? I mean, at a certain point, started releasing stuff again. Was it people getting in touch with you like Philpott? How did that happen? Were you DJing around and they said, do you have any music? No, man. I sent out my demos. Yeah, actually Ben Neville said it to me. He's like, send it far away. There's a better chance someone will listen to it. You know? Cool. I used to send it with a little postcard. Make friends, whatever. I don't know. I was just shopping my shit. I guess. It's still kind of the same, except now it's just uploaded, right? Was Phil Potts someone you'd been paying attention to and thought, eh, maybe? Yeah, I loved those first records that they did, and I think... I must have been because of the first one or the second one. I just thought it was super cool. So I don't think I even put the Jackmate Soul Fiction connection together. I don't think I even realized it was the same guy. But we bonded pretty quick, actually. He's quite like-minded dude. He's a super mellow dude, you know? So it just fit, actually. Those first two. I guess that was the start of the European thing. Now I'm trying to stick with the Canadian labels. Yeah, it seems like you've gone back somehow. Keep giving back to my homies, you know? You've released on Wagon Repair. And what other Canadian labels? Fur Trade. Fur Trade's new. Crystal Balls thing. That's pretty fun. And Risk A, of course. Did you do something for New Canada? Yeah. Yeah. More of that stuff coming. Adam, yeah. And there's some We Got Friends, I think it's called. Some new thing. I don't know what the hell. Out of the West Coast. The next door thing, but that's kind of me and Bisco. You're doing Sandwiches of Love? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did those. Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's Canadian too, hey? Because I did it. Does that make it Canadian? It helps. It adds to the Canadian-ness of it. Eddie and Koosh. Koosh's first record. It's pretty exciting for me. Cristobal's first record. Ted Pilsner. That's exciting. It had been a long time coming, I assume. I think so. Yeah. These are super talented dudes. Like every town's got it. hometown DJ seems to be the best. I know that's not good for business for me, right? I wouldn't say that. That's true. I mean, I'd love to hear Cush play anywhere. He'd blow people's minds. Why is he stayed? you know, why come out here? Well, I mean, you came out here. Yeah, I'm chasing the paper. I'm just, I'm here for the money, you know? I had a good time, obviously, but Koosh doesn't need the paper. He doesn't need the, so why? I mean, he hasn't been. He's going to lose his mind, I'm sure, when he comes and sees what's happening and how it's going because it is a lot of fun. But it's good there. You know, the air is good. It's fresh. It's fish. It's just harder to get the records now. Yeah. Did you, at what point did you decide to move? Here? Yeah. Three years ago now, maybe? A little more, maybe? Yeah. Just sort of happened quick. I was really happy at home in Montreal. They had a good life. Dog. Easy job. Yeah, life was good, but it's that, you know, dude's jumping off the bridge. Everyone's saying the water's nice. Come on in. Quit your job. Look at me now. I get it. I get it later. What, uh... So you don't look back with regret at all? About moving? No, so far, the wave's good. I'm riding it. We'll see what happens when it hits the beach. I'm happy to be on it right now. I don't mind. Yeah, yeah. We'll see what happens. I don't know. It's always what happens next. It seems like you've certainly released a lot of music. since you've been here yeah it's true hey the work you've been really dedicating yourself to the job trying to earn it trying to earn it you know trying to try and try and That's all. Do you feel like your music has changed since you've been here? Yeah, I think so. For me, I mean, maybe that's... Yeah, for sure. I think so. Yeah, I was really confused when I got here. So much techno. I'm not used to hearing so much techno. And, yeah, it was like being underwater or in a bad relationship, you know? It was just not making any sense. Didn't figure out what was what. Then maybe last year I started to... Only last year? Yeah, yeah. Like, last February, I think I can remember, and I made, like, five songs that month. Matt was in India, I think, and I had the studio to myself, and I just... Suddenly something clicked. I think it had something to do with Kush's song too, that when shit becomes a job, you know, you know you're doing it for the wrong reasons. Things clicked, you know? Arriving here, I had this sense of like I had to do something, had to be part of it. I don't know. It was a job suddenly. Shit, I did shit like this, fucking talking in microphones. Pictures. Never had pictures before. It's lame. It's weird to me. It's really weird. Journalism. This is not what I signed up for. You know what I mean? 21-year-old me would be totally unimpressed. It's not very underground what I'm doing right now talking to you. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. Making the 21-year-old version of you. He's not going to be cool anyway. Just seeing the clothes he was wearing. Idiot. Well, you say you can't dress yourself now. Yeah, it's true. I guess the more things change, the more they see. Yeah, touche. Enough. I kid, I kid. You said though that, you know, I guess when you first moved here, then it was immediately like, it is your job. Wow. For the first year and a half, you were like, I have to make music. oh my god yeah and finally it just like you were here long enough trying long enough that it wasn't your job so much anymore well i mean i feel like it still is but i mean yeah making making music still yeah yeah it's back to back to the real purpose right i'm not trying to like Trying to understand sounds and figure out what's hip and all that kind of shit. The fashion, following fashion. I mean, I can't dress myself. I can't follow music fashion, obviously, right? Somehow music fashion came to you, I think. I guess it did. Things slowed down. Yeah, yeah. Things got a little bit more housey. Everything I'm making right now is super fast. Always the wrong way, you know? Always going the wrong way. All the cobblestone stuff right now is really fast. 130 plus. But I realized something the other day, actually. I think you're kind of screwed if you have a hit early. I think the best thing you can do is make something that'll be cool in 10 or 20 or 30 years. Then you've really written something good. You know? Because, well, I mean, I guess some stuff really hits. Thriller, it's going to be good forever, right? Yeah, some of my favorite stuff seems to be just dug out of the pits, you know? I think Matt found a way to, I mean, aside from the DJ Decibel. He's actually pretty good. Yeah? Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. But he had some really big hits early on. I mean, still doing cobblestone jazz stuff. It's pretty impressive. Yeah. Yeah. How did that happen too? Hey, I remember when that was happening, everybody back home. Yeah, he's got a hit. He's got a hit. Like, yeah, cool. What? Like what? He made that in like the living room. Like when we were playing video games, I remember some of those tunes coming down the pipe, you know? Yeah. You could hear them being composed. I remember him writing number five. There it is what it is, number five. I was sitting on the couch. He finished and we were all like, yeah, that sounds like a tune. Good one. I think that's still my favorite tune from him. I can't remember what it's called. Is he maybe something like that? Is he a fast worker? Yeah, for sure. He's talented. Just walks in and starts, you know. Boom, there's another winning bass line right there, ready to go. He's doing it on stage every night. And you, it doesn't come easy. Me? Yeah. Terrible, man. No. You sit there and struggle. It's ugly. I have like maybe a one in... 20 signal to noise ratio. I have so much music in what I pretend is a vault. You know, I pretend I'm Prince and I got some secret vault full of shit. It's full of shit, quite literally. Yeah, I've been tons. The only thing I've realized, I tried to explain this to my booker once, but I think I'm good at is telling what is horrible and what's not. You know? But, I guess that's a point of view. Maybe not true. So when you sent demos that labels obviously you thought here's some of the good stuff Some got released. What I'm still in the vault Is there something they Binds the stuff together. Is there a mole sound? I don't know. I don't think I'm qualified to answer that. I don't know. Messy? Yeah? I don't know. Obviously, the album seems to fit together quite well. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. Perfect example of me working when I got here, right? Put out an album. That was all put together when you got here. Most of the music was written in Montreal. There's a couple of tunes written here. But I put it together here. Sitting on my bed. You mentioned there's too much techno here. I don't think there's too much. Compared to what you experienced before. It's something I wasn't used to. That's all. You have to work pretty hard to hear techno in Montreal. So to hear it constantly everywhere is a whole new world to me. Get into someone's car and it's blaring or whatever in a taxi or at a pizza joint. It's really... But it was very impressive at first, you know? What about... touring these days for you? Or you're not touring with Cobblestone even though you're in the studio with them? Sometimes they book us as a quartet, which is really cool. We do that Modern Deep Laugh Quartet thing. I just was in Japan with those guys. That was a ton of fun actually. Sapporo, I think that might be my favorite. The Fillmore North might be my favorite club. It's amazing. The people are amazing. Japanese hippies. Fantastic combo. That peanut butter chocolate. How did this happen? What do you bring to the, I mean, what are you doing when you play live with them? Some beats, lots of beats and, you know, filling in the gaps and trading with Dan, you know, samples. I got the turntable, so I'm trying to, we try and talk, you know, all of us. Sometimes I just stand back and cheer. It's pretty easy with those guys, right? Like they're already a thunderstorm. They're a locomotive. Yeah. Are you playing live at all yourself? Yeah, I'm starting to again. I just did in Japan and I got to at the end of August. I'm going to Pasha. in Ibiza. So strange to me. I don't know what 21 year old me would think of that. For the cadenza night? Yeah, exactly. Okay. But I think I just took a booking in town. I haven't done it in Berlin in a long time and I've been, I've been waiting. I think I just took, I'm waiting to find out for in September for Mutech, Mutech and Transmedia. What does the live setup look like? Uh, these days, I got one of those little MFB 522s, little 808 clone. It's fantastic, $200, and it's like, it's amazing. Sounds amazing. Sounds amazing, actually. It's really surprising. I got a little MPC 500, you know, which I'm... samples and I'm triggering the drum machine with that. Makes it a little more fun. You know, I can play turntable, a bunch of effects, loopers. Still trying to get rid of it. Still trying. It's hard to get rid of that. How would you? Yeah, I'll let you know when I figure that out. Yeah, still stuck on it. Do you like playing live? Clearly you enjoy it if you're going back to it again, or at least you're... Yeah, yeah, no, I do. I like it very much. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, it's more work. I love DJing. It's just so easy to walk out of the house with a bunch of records and headphones, you know? And it's so much fun to share. After mining and mining, you know, all these things. And there's something about the time hanging out for so long, right? Proper DJ set, you know, like hanging out for six hours. It's really, that's great. But live, it's a totally different animal. And it's, yeah, I do enjoy it. It's a lot of fun, especially with the band. It's the best with the band. I mean. Dan said it, music, playing music is, you can't play music by yourself, you know? It starts when two people play together. So sometimes I feel like I'm masturbating on stage. But I do enjoy it. Yeah, I do. I do. It's rewarding, you know? Challenging. Well, and it's, yeah, of course, a little bit. Yeah, sure, sure, of course. But the raw art is greater if people actually enjoy it. You know, looking out, seeing somebody having a good time. That's what it's all about, I guess. The last thing I wanted to ask you is the last interview I saw with you, you said you were reading Sherlock Holmes. What are you reading these days? I just finished a couple books. I read a super weird one on the way to Japan called A Book of Japans. It was presented as non-fiction, but it's clearly fiction. These guys are... They're living in the Shetlands and 12 guys get arrested. They're caught climbing inside of Shetland cows. And they claim when they come out that they're climbing in the cows, into them, into birthing cows, to travel into the future, to Japan, to Japan's future. And at one point, so they call them the 12 idiots. And at one point, there's an earthquake in Japan and one of the idiots has predicted it, like precisely, like the time, the size, the location. And so people start to believe them. And they gather 12 experts and the 12 experts interview these 12 idiots. disturbing and funny at times yeah yeah i can yeah book of japan's that's uh just just just finished it Bye.
