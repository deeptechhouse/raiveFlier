Trace. Trace. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Alan Abrahams doesn't like to sit still. Cape Town, London, Lisbon, Berlin, portable body code, pseudo-electronic, ghostly international, you're perlone. These are just a few of the places he's been, names he's recorded under, and labels he's released upon throughout his involvement with electronic music over the course of the past decade. Rather than trying to take it all in at once, we sat down earlier this month and attempted to focus on his new album for Pallone, Into Infinity, and why love was its catalyst. Naturally, however, the conversation soon started to travel far beyond those parameters. I read an interview with you around the last album and you talked about five books that sort of influenced the recording. Were there books that recorded or had an influence on this new one? On this new one, not really, no, no, not really. Because, I mean, the thing, my influence really is, I think, just to find a really good relationship, you know what I mean? You're in love. Yeah. So it's really like a love album. Well, not the whole album, but I mean, I think most of it, like the making holds, it's also from that kind of experience. So I think that's the sort of theme of the album. Is this the first time you've done a love album? Yes and no. I mean, I've done love things before. It's always a love and loss. Before it was more like a melancholy kind of loss of love. I think this was mostly kind of a celebration of it. Not all of it, but just the general sort of feel. Because the album was... most of it in Lisbon when I was still living there and then I finished some of the making holes for example I finished this in Berlin over the winter So, and some of the other tracks fade away and you can, I mean, when I listen to the album as a whole, you can hear the difference between the different cities because they're really sort of saddish, melancholic kind of ones in Lisbon. Okay. And then the ones with the sort of... more positive ones who were in Berlin. Which was weird because in Berlin I was just right in the middle of the winter. So it was quite a big change for me because I moved back to Berlin and I've got a really nice apartment, really nice studio and it was a really good working situation for me. The winter was, I quite enjoyed it because there was really no distractions and I was quite focused to finish work and music and the album. And you're living here now again. I'm living here now again. You seem to go back and forth. Yes, yes. I mean, Lisbon was, I mean, I was living in Lisbon three years and then I kind of missed being, because Lisbon was also a reaction from London because I was living in London for 10 years. I really had enough of being in a sort of like a concrete city situation. And then I really wanted to, because I grew up around the ocean in Cape Town, so I really wanted to experience that again. And then I moved to Lisbon for that whole three years and it was amazing. But then I also kind of... had enough. I think also like in Europe and especially the situation now I mean of course with the internet and the fact that you can do almost everything online it's just you just need to be from my work of course I have to be in Europe but you just need to have an internet connection so I mean when I left South Africa it was like 18 years ago something like that around that time and Then it was 1994, it was 1995 when the new government came into power and I wanted to continue making electronic music. And at the time there wasn't really a scene for... Most of my influences were from Europe really and I could only speak English as another European sort of language. And that was the first choice to move to London and to continue trying to follow the dream. It's cheesy but it's true. I really wanted to do that. At first it was really difficult because of course I had to work in a foreign city and I had to work all kinds of crap jobs like you do, you know, and work all the time. We'd be working to make money and then working for... on your music. So that was a constant situation all the time. And then it was just a break. I mean, lucky break as such, but we were, we started doing this, me and, I'm saying we, because my partner, Institute Electronic, we did, we started this night, firstly, called Mahala. And, I was playing one of my tracks, one of Sutex tracks actually, on Force Inc. And then he was living upstairs from the venue. He was doing a gig there and he came in and he said, oh, he's never heard his track played in Europe before. I said, oh, I'm really crazy on your music. And then I gave him, I played in some of my stuff. And that became the first portable release actually on Contacts. And then everything sort of came from there. The background stuff and the... Scape and then of course Perlon stuff now so had you met Lourado before you had moved to London yes yes we knew each other like from South Africa already from Cape Town Johannesburg actually and we kind of moved over to London at the same time so like I said we started this Mahalo night and then we went on to start sort of electronic also in London. The expectation for both of you though was to move to London, do crap jobs and work on music. Yeah, yeah, that was the thing. I mean, it's the same as like, I mean, as anyone like even the States or people who kind of want to make it in any kind of industry, you have to go to the... capital city. Although in South Africa at the time, I mean, I think things are different now, but at the time it was really so separated from the world that you couldn't really do anything. I mean, you had to leave and be somewhere. where it was happening in London was at the time. I suppose it seemed also in South Africa, even though things were changing, that it was going to take a long time before they changed enough. Yes, yes, definitely. I mean, we left and the government, the new government came into power, but I mean, there's still the, they had like so many years of sanctions and everything had kind of broken down. A lot of the, a lot of the... the infrastructure of the music stuff and stuff like that. So those things had to be reworked on again. And only after the new government came to power, we had the whole, the Kwaito scene, all that stuff came into, became more popular because they had a kind of infrastructure work. But that took also years afterwards. It wasn't instantaneous. With the live set, obviously it's changed quite a bit through the years. Where are you at now with it? What does it look like? Well, I mean, now the main element is actually live vocals. This is really very new. It's like three months old in this added element. I mean, I used to... two live vocals before but it was mainly just as a as effects to put add that kind of texture to it now it's i'm actually singing um because it's also from this a lot of the new album a lot of singing tracks on this and i've got a vocal processor and a new mic and although the whole live set is based around singing, but a lot of it is. So that would be the newest sort of element at the moment. And it's been going very well. I mean, it's been about since the summer, since the summer is actually when I started doing it. I would say Fusion in June was like one of the first gigs. And almost all the time it's been going, it's been really well received almost everywhere. It seems like it's quite important to you to have a performative aspect to the live. Yes, definitely. I mean, even though before the vocals, I still have my MIDI controllers. And although I'm using Ableton Live, of course, as a sequencer. But all the track, the actual composition, the arrangement of the track is all done live. I mean, there's no, like the pre-recorded stuff is only the instruments, but the actual arrangement and putting everything together is done completely live. And it's good because people can also... I mean, I have to be enjoying it and people can see it. I guess it goes back to the live set, the way you were talking about keeping it interesting for yourself. You had a quote in an interview about house and techno becoming Ikea music. lately, and I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about that, and what you meant when you said that. Well, I mean, of course there was a big, basically, anyone, the music that you can do, the music that you can compete with, composing, the sound you can be using, you can get all of that really easily. You can get packs of stuff easily. So to actually make a track, it's really easy to make something, but to actually have some kind of substance, it's not that easy. And that's what I meant by the IKEA sort of aesthetic. It's just crap after it looks good. lasts for a week. Do you listen to your music a lot? I mean, I listen to it when it's done. I mean, I think it's important for me to listen to my music. I mean, when I'm composing stuff, I listen to it. I listen to a particular track over and over and over so I can make sure that things are alright. And when I don't really hear this track anymore, then I'm happy with it. when a project is done, like this last album or any album in particular, and I'm able to listen to it, especially when I'm cycling and stuff around, it really affects me. Of course, I'm listening to it and I know it's my music, but at the same time, it's not like I'm... And so I'm listening to it as a listener, you know, so I would listen to the whole album and see how things work together. And most of the time, I mean, all the time it does. And also when I'm working on a new set of projects, I've been listening to a lot of old, really old stuff, like the first portable stuff to kind of get, to keep grounded on what I'm trying to say, in a sense. Were there certain records of yours that you listened to a lot in the writing? Yeah, it's like the first album, the first one I did for Background Records, I think Futuristic Experiments 5, because it was quite experimental for the time, and I think... Yeah, I mean, the background records sort of stuff. And I mean, those first things I did was really as a ghost album from the dance floor. Basically, there's a lot of dance music around and I wanted to be influenced by that but to be able to have something that you could listen to at home at the time. Did you find it took you a long time to make your music work for the dance floor? It was really just... This happened from necessity really to be honest because I was invited to be playing in most places which were clubs and my audience were people in the club so I had to kind of make the earlier portable stuff more dancey and I did that and I would use the release stuff already and just make more like danced versions. And that's actually where the body code thing directly came from that because I had Ghostly. I was doing a gig in Detroit and they came to one of my shows and they really liked it and they recognized that it was portable stuff but more like dance orientated. And then they asked me to do a project for them but just a dance project. And that's why I did body code. Do you feel hemmed in a tiny bit, you know, by the necessity of making music because you have to make it for a live set? Yes and no, because... Yes and no, because on the one side, I mean... I mean, it's strange, for example, this album, for example, was on Perlon, right? And then I also, of course, Perlon also had their own sort of dance, kind of particular dance following. But the tracks that I thought actually wouldn't work, they weren't really like straight-up dance tracks. They were the ones that were accepted the most. You know, like Onwards, that's the Philip Eftiman chart that is his favorite track, and that's a... one of the slowest tracks on the album. So that's really quite surprising. And at the same time, I mean, also, I mean, when I'm playing live, I'm actually having a direct connection with the audience, and I can see exactly how things are affecting people, you know? On the one hand, I mean, it's not... I do feel, of course, I'm a little bit hemmed in by it, but at the same time... it's also, it's not a bad thing because you've been in contact with hundreds of people, they're immediately with your sound and you can see exactly what works and what doesn't. And because people are coming to listen to your stuff, I feel more and more, I feel that I am able to experiment more and more. I mean, especially in Germany, in Berlin, when I'm playing in Berlin, I feel really free to be able to do what I want, almost. Tell me about growing up in Beverly Hills. Well, I mean, it was... Bonn-Tier-Vaux was... I mean, at the time, it was... I mean, I grew up in a big family, family of ten. I was the youngest. my family and I was the youngest of the second marriage actually because my parents were both married before so I was the youngest and then I was the only one of the second marriage so and I know that before they were married I mean before I was born there was a lot of problems in the two families because my brothers and sisters are all like eight and ten years older than me so I was born and it was like the catalyst for the two families if I look at it now it was quite deprived not deprived but deprived like materially deprived and not really enough money and poor, but I didn't think of it in that way when I was growing up. I mean, now I would look at it that way because... You certainly didn't have any other context for anything else. Yes, exactly. You know, exactly. Because also in Ponte Avel was like this whole area of Cape Town that was people, like non-white people were moved to that whole area, you know, like really far from anything. And everyone was living in that situation, you know, so in that there was, I had no context exactly. And you said that sort of dance music. introduction wasn't necessarily playing on turntables but actually taping vinyl for other people yeah i mean because we used to have a rented disc which was renting rental um you could rent vinyls from them and very you still i think they still had a sign on there that recording was illegal I mean, what music made it down there? Was it... Well, like, all this early house stuff, like the... All the tracks, all those tracks, the early tracks, records. Was there a particular... I mean, this rental, rent-a-disc. I mean, was there a guy there who was really into importing that stuff? Or... Yeah, I mean the owner I mean it was just the owner and his brother. It was huge corners. It was like a small store, you know Yeah, they were interested in that stuff because of course, I mean it's Cape South Africa and Cape Town people want to dance and it was very much part of the society. So they had a lot of early house stuff and remixes of pop remixes that were remixed by like Chip Pettibone. It was illegal to have gatherings. It was during the apartheid time still. So they had all kinds of curfews installed by the government and stuff. But I mean, we would still have parties. The police wouldn't know about it, of course, but it would be in someone's house, the back of someone's house, and it should be in the back of someone's house or something, and they would just... erect something and everybody would come. I was in high school and I was like the second wave of the revolution and we used to have demonstrations and we used to be marching and not going to school, having sit-outs to change the government. And, I mean, I was part of that more so than... You were quite a political person. Oh, yeah, of course. I mean, I guess you almost have to be. Yeah, you have to be. Of course, I was in high school, and our generation were the ones that... Because there were two waves, one in the 60s and then 70s, and then that's where Nelson Mandela came from. And then they arrested him because of the ANC and stuff, and then everything kind of calmed down, and then they had another wave in the 80s when we had all the sanctions, and I was in high school, and that's when Nelson Mandela was released, and the government changed. more the pressure from everyone, really. And like all the people of my generation, we just went to school, but we used all the high schools and schools were used as, we'd leave school and there would be huge marches in the streets demonstrating and that was through the government and change. Were you up front or were you just sort of... No, I was with the political movement. I wasn't a speaker or anything. I mean, not at all, but I was there. Because you had to be. I mean, we were oppressed. It seems like what you talk in interviews about your music not necessarily being political, but that all music is political in a way. This personal politics comes through. that you don't want to preach. But I find it, I mean, interesting. All personal politics is preaching in some way, I suppose. Would you agree with that? Yeah, I mean, yes, of course. I mean, on one side, you don't want to be preaching or anything. But at the same time, I mean, like this last album, for example, Fade Away. Fade Away was actually a track I wrote for my housemate at the time. And he was going through really bad problems with his girlfriend. And actually, he's the one, Johannes Schoen is also on the album. And it was a track written for him. And it was a poem actually So, I mean, it wasn't... Of course, you're saying something and you're not preaching, but, I mean, you don't want to preach, but it's... Of course, it's difficult because if you're not saying anything, if you're not doing any kind of political sort of personal... If you're not doing any kind of political... stance then you're not doing anything you have to even if you're not wanting to be preaching you still you end up doing it anyway but for good cause sure sure what would you be preaching if you were preaching i mean what i guess love is the is the message of this album Yeah, I mean, what can you be preaching? I mean, I can only talk about what I'm actually going through. That's really the only thing. But I mean, those are sort of cliché things, but at the same time, we all go through it. Do you not take characters or, you know, like sort of inhabit personas? No, I don't really. I mean... Not really, no. I think also from the start of my electronic music side, it's always been a personal element. It's always been some kind of therapy for me. So it's always come from my perspective. It seems like more producers could put more of themselves into their music. I think that's one of the things that... seems to be a problem. Or maybe they just don't know how to properly express that. I don't know. I mean, everyone wants to... It comes back to my IKEA situation where everyone wants to make music and it sounds so easy to do it. and then if you're not putting any effort into it, you're not going to get any effort out. It's not like it doesn't take... It's easy technically to make it. It's easily... You can easily make something in 10 minutes but you can hear that it's not... that it's taken you 10 minutes to make. And you're not going to open yourself up. You're not going to get anything back. I don't know. That's only my perspective because I can only say what I feel. I can't really say what anyone else should do. Some other people could have a perspective of not having to... They don't have to open up at all and they could still come up with something good. I mean, that would be their perspective. But... But they have to put in the time. That's why there's so much crap around because it's just this easy... I mean, you can say it in a lot of other genres. It's not just music. It's just... How much time did it take you to write the album? Two years. About two years in total, I think. Because all the tracks are all from different parts. but I would say to around two years because I started just after the last album. Was there a song that came particularly easy? Making holes, I'd say, came quite easily. It just flowed for me. So in that way, I mean, it came easily. this was not easy. I mean, easily as in none of the songs came easily. I mean, they were just, they, it came naturally. It came really, no, um, struggle almost you know some other tracks while but like some of some of the tracks actually i started maybe a year ago already because i'm firm believer and if you if you were starting on something and you just just sit with the same track for a while and then And many times I would be sitting with it too much and not have... Because I would have rhythms of working. Some weeks it would really work and some weeks it wouldn't. Sometimes I would start something and it would really be working for a few days and then I would just lose it and then I'd just leave it and go back to it. It's just something you also learn, you know, if you're composing for so long, you learn to not actually force it because sometimes you just lose the... train of thought as it were and then I would just leave it and come back to it another time do you have hobbies I mean that you got like a read or something hobbies yeah some of my hobbies movies of course bands What movies do you like? Horror and science fiction movies. Reading, of course. Science fiction reading. A lot of science fiction reading. I think it's my favorite. Technology. Gadgets. What movies? What movies? Foreign films. I mean, of course, like, last one, three things. Anything with... Tilda Swindon. She's got a new movie coming out in a few weeks. What do you like about her? I don't know. She's got this... I mean, it's... She's got this otherworldly sort of thing about her. And she's also... I've known her for so long. I mean, I've known her at work for so long. She's only really been famous for the past few years. But she's been making movies for ages. And one of my favorite films, actually, she's in called Possible Worlds. It's done by... Canadian director who's actually more famous for doing operas Robert Lepage and I saw actually a piece he did in the UK he did like a 1984 opera. It's very, very good. But he directed this movie and she plays, it's about this guy who gets killed. It's sci-fi kind of thing. He gets killed but only his brain is kept alive. So he thinks he's alive throughout the whole film. And she plays his wife but in every world she's a different kind of character. It's very, very good. Do you want to take people into different worlds with your own music? Sort of have some sort of sci-fi quality to it. Do you think it has that? Yes, I think so. I mean, I don't think I would... I don't go intentionally doing it. But at the same time, when I'm making a track or something, I would... For example, I would use something that I find quite sort of easy, like an easy sort of thing. I would start with something easy and then I would try and interpret it in a different way. So I think the alternative, trying to come up with a kind of alternative for the same thing, that kind of maybe adds a sci-fi. element. I think that I think okay I want to make a track that's like this right and then I would say I would try and interpret the same thing in a different way I was saying okay this was just too easy let's try and how can I change that and make it look at it from another perspective. Is there a good example of that on the new album? Yeah, like, I mean, many of the tracks, like the, like, Island of Thought, like the basic, I wanted to make something that's kind of cumbia, you know, cumbia, that's cumbia sort of rhythm. But a lot of the cumbia stuff, I mean, it's also quite, you can't listen to it too many times. So I wanted to make a cumbia track that's... Really deep and really from another world. Same thing with Fade Away, with Onwards. I wanted to do some dancehall sort of influence thing, but not just talking about guns and sex and stuff. Making Holes just kind of came out that way. It was weird. Making Holes is a really strange track because it was a poem that I wrote in the morning when I woke up from a dream. And it actually was from a dream. And it was lightning the night before and I was dreaming. lightning things and strobing light. And when I met my boyfriend now, my current partner, Chris, I met him, he was dancing under a strobe light. So that kind of connection came really nicely. And I mean, I wrote the track before I met him, like in the same week that I met him, like as a sort of premonition. You met him dancing under a strobe light. That's a techno love story if I've ever heard one. This cheesy, cheesy after-hour place we used to have in Lisbon, because we met in Lisbon. And really, because we have this, actually, they're all areas closed now, because I was back a few weeks, a few months ago. And there's like this old sort of, used to be a red light district, or easily a red light district, but they have all these old bars in there, really from the 70s. And they used to have a lot of after-hours. there which is real very nice it's in one of those next to the 70s mirror and so like Tell me about Lisbon's club scene. I don't know very much about it. Is Lux the club? The Lux is still the most popular club there at the moment. But when I was back a few months ago, it's kind of dire straits because there's an area that I was talking about now. It's all red letters together. They have to have all the after hours were there. And that whole area is... been closed down because there's some problems with the buildings so that's not happening anymore this looks of course but the looks is like I don't know how you would compare to the fabric or something of London it's really it's popular you know And I don't know if there's actually an underground scene. Although, I mean, when I was back now, I wasn't really going out. I was on holiday. So I don't really know what the situation is like except that right now. When I lived there, it was also interesting because there was always stuff to do, a lot of stuff. things to do but the things have changed just a lot of course with the crisis and you know there's a lot of other factors but I don't really know what's going on there anymore what are you working on now you said you were working on already working on a new album well I'm working on two things at the moment two I'm working on a new body code album for Ghostly for Spectral and I'm doing music for dance piece for TanzTage. It's a festival next year. I think it's in March. And I'm doing a music for a piece for Chris Shearer. Is this the first time you've done something like that? Yes. I mean, my boyfriend is a contemporary dancer. So I've been going to a lot of downtown shows. Very interesting. But I also found the music to be very dated. really kind of music concrete sort of things, which is okay, I think, but there's also a huge world of other music you can actually use instead of that sort of droney sort of stuff, which is okay, but I also think you can do so much more. I haven't actually sat down with it. It's just I've been doing stuff on the plane and stuff like that, but no, I'm waiting for the weather to change. Is that... It's important. Yes. I mean, look at the weather at the moment. It's too warm to be sitting at home working. You want to be out and about the lakes. I mean, it's going to happen next week, isn't it? Yeah. So, it's fine. I know it will. And once again, three miles past the sky.
