Thank you. you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Earlier this month, I travelled to Ibiza to spend time in the company of Sven Vaith, who, if you didn't already know, is one of the world's biggest techno DJs. We met at his villa in the Ibiza countryside. and after some small talk about London, which is now his home during the winter, we settled at his kitchen table. Sven seemed slightly hesitant to begin with, but he soon found his groove, and the stories began to flow. He told me about Cocoon's upcoming Ibiza season, and then traced the line right back to his first visit to the island in 1980. The experience of dancing under the stars to DJs like Pippi and Alfredo showed the then 16-year-old Sven the open-ended possibilities of DJing. Back in his hometown of Frankfurt, he established a career that saw him become a respected DJ, open a highly influential club called The Omen, and gain international fame as the lead singer of a pop band, Sven spoke openly about the ups and downs that eventually led him to setting up Cocoon in 1999. The brand came to incorporate a booking agency, a record label, and most significantly, a party at Amnesia in Ibiza that changed the face of clubbing on the island. It introduced the scene to new underground sounds, and with Sven as its charismatic leader, Cocoon established the after-party culture that's still rampant in Ibiza to this day. My main takeaway from the conversation, though, was Sven's enthusiasm. Even as he approaches his 50th birthday, he still brings a sense of childlike adventure to everything he does. So, 15th season in Ibiza you're gearing up for at the moment. It seems like there's maybe been a few changes this year in the lead up to the season. Have Luciano playing for you a fair few times this year? We're very happy about this, yes. Yeah, and Ricciardo not playing this year, perhaps? No, he's going to play. He's going to play. I mean, does it feel like it has been an off-season of change for you? You know, it's since the last... Three years or more, let's say four years there, things are changing in Ibiza really extreme. And I think that we have a... let's say, a very strong followers here in Ibiza, fans from all over the world. And we were at the first place 15 years ago here with the flag in our hand, techno in house, that's our mission. but talking about quality house and techno music and we had a big big roof it's called cocoon and under this roof we have lot of DJs and after so many years of course they are all individuals with their own career and own missions and nowadays days with their own managers and growing egos here and there and yeah there were some some situations in the past and as I said the last four years we had to take it that some of our DJs who were under the roof of Cocoon that they started with their own nights fair enough why not But with this, there was a lot of tension started in the scene. Competition, where's our posse, where's your posse, and do we still party together or not? And all the things we never faced before in the past. And yeah, so we had to somehow manage the situation for us to say goodbye to our friends and colleagues, to Richie and to Marco and Luciano started. He was the first. We're happy he's coming back now. And then all these hypes and new managements who wanted to push more, the artists, everyone wanted to have his own night in Ibiza. All this created a lot of tension in the scene. But as I can see it now, after these four years, and the last two years were a little bit tougher. And I think that we are facing now a very relaxed 15th season for us. Everything is on the table, everything is clear. And yeah, so I think also each of the artists made his own experience now on the island. It's not easy, like finger snap. You can make your own knight and it's going to run from the first second on and you're going to be successful and so on. Was there perhaps a sense last year that the people were spread quite thinly across the island so obviously if you've got more nights than ever before with more resident dj-led nights than ever before was it maybe a case that it got to something of a tipping point last year yeah it's also as you said is the the party people suddenly they had so many possibilities and options And suddenly free tickets and guest lists, huge, huge guest lists. Yeah, and then you could feel the competition is going on. But for us, it was somehow very interesting because we lost some people, but we had a better party on the dance floor. The quality of the party was for us and, of course, for the party people was much better. Everyone came to us and said, wow, that was a proper season, especially on the dance floor. space or more space and more let's say more ordering a drink and going to the toilet the simple things simple ways they're much easier After 15 years, you're obviously still enjoying it because I assume you wouldn't be doing it otherwise. But do you enjoy it these days in maybe a different way than you did to begin with? Yeah, well, we have an excellent team and we are somehow proved our machine is working properly. I'm proud that we still work with the same people together, some since the beginning working with us. And we have very strong followers and people can trust us. We're always good for a surprise. And people know that we are taking care of good music, sound, visuals. a nice decoration and of course again we're going to do it for the 15th season we are even more motivated for for this one and yes i mean i see it today after the last three years more relaxed i would say Yeah, I mean, in terms of your personal buzz and your personal enjoyment, does it feel how it did 15 years ago? Different. Yeah. Yeah, different. I mean, 15 years ago, I was really alone here. Okay, yeah. You know, I was really fighting. I invested all my money I had, you know, and I was like, I don't care. I just want to do it because I love Ibiza. And I see myself so much connected with this island. And I always thought that our music is made for this island. It is perfect for this island. Yeah, here we go. And you'd been quite honest in the past or certainly in the last... interview I saw with you about the prices in Ibiza and you know the value for money aspect for people coming here do you think there is maybe a danger that it will become simply too expensive for people do you know is is that a real possibility do you think well it is expensive yes and in many ways But I think that people who come to Ibiza, they know what they get. And if they stay a week or two or three weeks... they're saving up when they come to the island they just explode and they go for it but yeah there's some some yeah some situations i still don't understand here in ibiza in clubs in terms of water prices you know the drinking is really expensive still We had so much discussions with club owners and promoters and what can we do, what can we change, but it's like it's... It's a nightmare. So those type of conversations do take place. Yeah. Yeah, so everybody comes together. Yeah, especially when we do after hours, you know, and then we have to rent a place. And then, of course, we're taking care of the costs. And then, as always, there's conversations about prices of the drinks at the after hour. And we said, hey, we cannot take night prices. daytime parties you know and and all these things people don't know but we discuss things like this in the back you know yeah i mean i guess it's tough because it's something that would have to be done collectively almost everybody would need to be on the same page so to speak yeah yeah but beach club owners club owners promoters they have their own vision you know running places and nights and daytime parties yeah to kind of reflect on when you first came to the island when you were 16 is that right yeah that's right it must have felt very very different back then i wanted just to kind of set the scene for us if you could kind of um summarize how you found the spirit when you first arrived in ibiza it was uh completely new for me coming from germany to let's say kind of tropical island where people were smoking and dancing on the street and This hippie feeling was everywhere, present on the streets, on the beach, in the clubs. The clubs were open air, Amnesia, Koo, Pacha, Gloris. I remember these clubs. I was lucky. I was 16 and they let me in. I was like, oh, please, come on. Look at me. Begging, basically. Yes. But the spirit, especially in the morning times in these clubs, was just magic for me. I was crying on the dance floor because I had no idea that something like this exists. Alfredo was playing his kind of... trippy African percussion sounds mixed with Pink Floyd and Italo disco and reggae. I was just blown away. Was this the vibe among all of the prominent DJs at this time? Was everybody doing such a kind of free-spirited mix of things? Yes, yes, yeah. Completely eclectic mixes the whole night, yeah. Did you heard anything like that at that stage in your life? No. No. I mean, I was 16. Yeah. Never before. Are we quite a hardcore music fan already at this time? Not hardcore. I was too young. Records were quite expensive. I was listening to radio. You know that my parents had a club at this time. And I was listening to seven inches a lot. Disco, pop music, a lot of Philly sound. And there was a time when... Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Delegation, all these disco bands came up. Chick. Yeah. It's so funny that the sound of jig is back here on the island. I was not a hardcore music fan, but I loved the new music. I mean, would it be a fair thing to say that it was here that you maybe decided that you wanted to be a DJ? I mean, was it that? important for you? I really never thought about it before even though we had a club my parents because I knew that if I would ask my father he would say no way but when I came back from Ibiza and I told my mother all what I experienced and she was she saw my sparkling eyes and I was really so flashed and touched. She was asking me if I want to become a DJ. Wow. What was the nature of the club that your parents owned? What type of venue? It was called Queen's Pub. It was an English pub with a little dance floor. Okay. Built by my father. He built the whole club by himself. They played from rock and roll, pop music and... bit of modern dance music. Okay. So you ended up playing there yourself? Yes. Okay. So I guess you would say that your first residency or break was with Dorian Gray, which I guess was also... First it was with my parents and then I started in the year of 81 or beginning of 82 at the Dorian Gray. Do you remember how you got the gig? Yes. I knew the DJ who was playing there, Uli Brenner, and he always watched me when I was dancing. And it was the time he came to me, he said, hey Sven, you're dancing all the time, you have such a good feeling for the music. Can you play? Can you DJ? I said, of course I can now. What a question. Could you DJ at this point? And then he said, well, why? Where did you learn how to DJ? I said, I'm DJing here, not so far, in Noisenburg, in my parents' club. And then he said, yeah, you know what? I have this thing. I'm going and taking a winter break. I'm going for skiing with my family. You think you can jump in and become the... resident here for three weeks I said of course I try my best I will I was 17 you know I wasn't even allowed to enter this club and then he said okay well then that's the deal you start next weekend six o'clock in the morning till 11 o'clock I said from six o'clock in the morning till 11 all right I'm there And this was my, I started on torrents, turntables with no pitch control. So I had to... pitch them by myself my fingers and you know this was there was kind of work to get this tunes in in tune in in the mix and it was a was a was an interesting time for me because i've learned a lot about mixing because in my parents club either they're also the turntables there didn't have a pitch control So this mixing was for me something I really had to learn from zero. What was your style like back then? What kind of things were you playing? I played disco classics mixed with new pop songs. Did this fit with the music policy of the club? Was this kind of in line with what they were doing? In a way, yes. But I did my mix the way I interpreted the music I was playing was for them very fresh. They were really freaking out. that I created such an atmosphere seven o'clock in the morning in this club. What were you doing to create such an atmosphere? I was, I don't know. I was just dancing with the music. playing the disco tunes I really liked. And it really worked perfectly. Did the club itself kind of take its inspiration from what was going on in New York in the 70s? Was it kind of modeled after that type of... Exactly. It was also the same sound designer, Richard Long. He designed... the sound system at the Dorian Gray in the end of the 70s. I see. I mean, did it feel somehow connected? I mean, I know there was a remove. I mean, I don't know how much you guys knew. The Dorian Gray was the Studio 54 of Germany in that time. So I was playing already my 17 years old in this club. You know, which was somehow in Germany very glamorous. And in the main club, in the big club, there was DJs, Bichan Blum, Michael Münzing, Freik, and they were playing really, I mean... on this sound system with a laser, they had a laser installed and they played the music. When I first heard Kraftwerk on that sound system, I really freaked out. And it was also the first time that I saw DJs working with the band machine, with the TEAC. and they cut their own mixes. A few of them played 10 hours the whole night. And I was then really inspired by their work. An interesting detail. So the club was under Frankfurt Airport, right? How did that affect the vibe of the place? Actually, it was even more special. because he could go there by train. People all came dressed, you know, trances tied and the gay scene and new romantics. And they all come really dressed and they all came by train, by tubes. And I don't know, the airport feeling was 24 hours open, you know, and it was... first club in Germany who had a 24-hour license. Oh, because it was situated in the airport. Exactly. Right, I see. Just a couple of years later when it came to opening your own club, were there maybe things you learned at Dorian Gray that you applied to opening Omen? Of course, yeah. I've learned to pay attention to a lot of details, especially when it comes to sound and the DJ booth. It's so funny because those days we were sitting to play. All the DJs were sitting because we played all very long sets. And so when I started with my partners to design the club, we also designed the DJ booth with a chair, the perfect high of the console and for the turntables. But then after a few years, I said to my... we have completely we have to change the whole thing here i cannot sit anymore the music is too good well you may be the first dj in germany to stand up so i mean when you around the opening of the club where would you say that germany was in its development with electronic music This was 1988. I was a pop star at that time. I did this project called Off. And I was touring a lot around Europe. I made a lot of TV shows and gala evenings and had some two top ten hits. And the electro pop from Germany was quite, that moment was quite successful. And could feel as there was something going on because there was a lot of new young people who came to me with ideas. with demo tapes, especially in Frankfurt. I felt like, oh, wow, this city is now really... Because we have this history with the Dorian Gray and with the DJs, Thala, Thorsten Fenslau, Michel Münzing, Bijan Blum, and they were all big DJs in Frankfurt, and they all started with their own production, and they were all successful. And so in Frankfurt, somehow we had this history of DJ culture, but not only also DJs who started with their own labels, with their own production. And at that time, there was Frankfurt with our own, let's say, level. of output and compared to other cities in Germany compared to Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart, Cologne. And I stopped at the Dorian Gray in the year of 1987. I ended my DJ career at this club. hardcore industrial DJ with played crazy stuff like Skinny Poppy, Agar.oom, Split Second, Front 2 for 2, Nightz.A.B, Bogasia and bands like this and I also invited them to play there. And this was really an experience for me because I really enjoyed this dark music at that time. But it was so strange in the context of a glamorous club. And so we turned this club into a black hole. So we had people in Doc Martens coming in the morning time to Dancing Pogo on the dance floor at the Daring Gray because of me. And that was a little bit strange somehow because I missed the girls on the dance floor. Suddenly there was one morning I said, what's going on here? What I have done to this club? I felt like, wow, probably I pushed a little bit too much. And then I decided to stop working as a DJ and to rethink about my work. And then I decided to open my own club with Michael Münzing. with Matthias Martinson. And then I said to these guys, I said, listen, but I'm not going to continue to play the hard stuff at the Omen Club. I want to, I want to, I had this one way direction at the Doreen Gray. I said, I don't want to, I don't want to do the same step again. And that was, that was really good for me that I had a half a year break. I mean, when I was playing all this industrial music, I mixed some Metroplex records in between, from Liz Torres to Dance Mania, interesting house music. And when I opened the Omen Club, then I said, I'm going to dedicate my night to the house music, house and techno, the new techno. Yeah, and this was then the end of 88. And this was a change for me and for the club scene in Frankfurt and for the club scene in Germany, because at that time there was no club like a strictly techno house club, except the UFO in Berlin. And yeah, the rest is history, I would say, you know. Of course. I mean, do you feel as though Frankfurt was quick to embrace the sounds coming out of the US? Yeah, because we had the American bass in Frankfurt. I see. And we had American record stores. we had an easy access to the good, good, good vinyl, good music. I mean, in your kind of personal take on it, did this music feel like it was part of a lineage of things that had come before or did it feel like something very, very new? No, this music definitely was for me very new. I mean, I was always a fan of disco. But when house music became more, let's say, let's put it this way, when I played the first house music tunes, I felt like that this is it. I said, that's the new, that's the new, this is DJ music. Yeah, and so I really followed. The omen, as I said before, was Mecca. of techno house music then that time in Germany. So it quite quickly got to a place where people would come to Omen to hear this music specifically. Yes, from all over Germany. DJ Hell, DJ Westbem, DJ Motte, they all came to the Omen to party. And I invited them all. I had Richie Horton with his first Plus 8 label night 1990. So we had a Warped Label Night 1990. We had Prodigy there. We had Underground Resistance. I invited them all. That was really, really special. But it was so extreme. We had no air conditioning in this club. And it was, I don't know, it felt like it was 60 degrees and we were sweating for hours. hours and the music was so intense and yeah it was just going stronger and stronger have you felt anything as intense since then yes I did I still do But the first days, they were so new, so new and fresh. And I could see I can, this was for me so. so special that the people they were also hungry really hungry for it to just dive into the sound and and dance the night away and go just mental and crazy on the music So in terms of Hausen Techno and its spread throughout Germany, is this something that kind of caught wildfire, so to speak? Did Germany very quickly catch on to what you were doing? Yes, I mean, there was the fall of the wall and this was the start of everything, the love parade. the half-legal clubs in Berlin and the scene was just exploding. And after the second love parade, we were showing the world. the Germans can dance. And that was really something. I think there were a lot of people from different nations who were quite surprised. So you're busting stereotypes. Do you remember roughly what the attendance was like at the first love parade and just how that was for you as an experience? I was not joining the very first love parade in 1989. I joined the second love parade. It just felt like we have to do something for our music. And Dr. Motte called it Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen, which is very silly. Peace, love and harmonies. Something like this. But we had the right to demonstrate the Kurfürstendamm at that time, which was really something really, really special on this biggest shopping street in Berlin to do a love parade. people who loved house music and techno and screaming acid on the street. No, that was really something special. Yeah, I miss that vibe today. And that was something, it was somehow... uniting the whole Germany, Europe, the world. People came from all over the world to dance a weekend with us. There was something really... special no i mean i guess um politically socially it was a very unique time i mean a free party on top of it yeah and yeah and then year by year by year we were getting stronger bigger bigger and stronger and i don't know the peak was 1.3 million or 4 million people in berlin Yeah, it was very special. Yeah, but that was the beginning of the 90s. You know, I had my labels, IQ Records, Hardhouse Records, Recycler Die. I started doing my solo projects. I started. Started with an agency and was creating platforms and we opened an office in London. We opened an office in West Hollywood in Los Angeles and I called it Hard House and Techno Trance Music, 91, 92, 93. Suddenly, that was the sound of the clubs. Do you recall the defining motivation for beginning iQ? It's because with the Omen Club, I felt like I have to start. a label to release music, what's happening in our club. And as I said before, people that time, they came to me, young producers, and giving me promos, Heart Flora, for instance. And I had so much good demos. I wanted to release them. In retrospect, people discuss IQ in terms of being a very important trance label and for pioneering that sound. But I wonder, at the time, did it feel as though you and Frankfurt was doing something that was kind of removed and was something a bit different? Yes, it was. We were a bunch of artists, including Chairman Spoon and... and DJ Dark and many others, Resistance D, Spice Lab, Marco Zafferano, and many, many more. And somehow we were the pioneers of that sound for a long time. And we were proud because... We had so many good songs coming up, one after the other for a long time, until I reached a point where I said, "Okay, now it's enough. I want to change the music. I want to change the style." Because it became more and more, you could hear it everywhere. Suddenly, many many producers started producing this direction in holland from from belgium um and so on and and we were like oh okay i was dnr and i said To myself, to my team, hey listen, I think it's time to change and to do something else now. Was there something about the time and place that kind of felt right to be using more emphasis on melody? I kind of, I guess I'm interested to know like what the kind of, what place this came from, because obviously there was a kind of united aesthetic to the music that was very melodically rich. I just wondered if there was something about that time that felt right. It was definitely, it was, we were working, especially me. I had a bunch of musicians around me. And I introduced the musicians here in Ibiza to this sound. And I invited them to go with me in the studio. And so we were working, you know, years. And I think that was the special touch. A DJ brain with a musician. And that was giving the music this rich, composed feeling. This is also still very unique, you know. And nowadays, you know, DJs, they think they are musicians. Many DJs think they are musicians. If I look back, and especially talking about the trance scene, I had the feeling that we reached a stage somehow where everything is repeating. Copying and repeating and copying. And I was like, wow, it seems like there are no musicians around anymore. I was just wondering if you recall like reaching a point when you thought, okay, it's time to move on from this thing. It was the end of '95, beginning of '96. That was really then I felt like I was tired. I also spent a lot of time in India, beginning of the '90s. And somehow I also was getting in touch with the Goa Tron scene. I met some people in Goa, they said, "Oh Sven, your label." You produce the best Goa trance. And I say, I'm sorry, we're not producing Goa trance. We are from Frankfurt. This comes out of a club. Well, it was somehow funny to see how many freaks went crazy on our music in the jungle. I enjoyed it. Were you playing those parties a lot? No, no, no, not that. I made my own parties. here and there in the jungle, 93, 94. I was the first DJ who brought his turntables into the jungle. Oh, wow. And they were looking at me like, what is he doing with the stabilizer, you know? I had an Indian family, you know, they were caring, taking care about the generator and the power. And I explained to them everything, how it works. And it was really, I had a lot of fun. But the music there, there was a time which was really, it was really going on there. from 91 till 94. I really enjoyed it. But then again, I felt also there the music not developing and music is standing still. They all, they want to party always on the same sound. I guess you were running Hart House. how would you kind of define the difference between the labels that you were running? As you said, IQ Records was more melodic, what we called trance at that time. And Hardhouse was more techno and perimental here and there. Better Ego was on. One hard house, good friends of mine. I've also produced a lot with Roman Flögel and with Jörn Ellingwood. And I think we also had with hard house over 100 releases. We just had with Cocoon. I mean, was the sound of the labels being reflected on what was being played at Omen? Were the two things very interchangeable? Yeah. But towards the end, it was much more hard house. Okay. When I closed the Omen in the year of 1998, it was a trip running a club 10 years with this music. And the music was changing constantly. I also, you know, came back from India and said, hey, we have to change decoration. Now we need the OM sign everywhere. You know, I was fully on the spiritual tip. So you're always trying to stay one step ahead of this. You know, I invited this band from Denmark, Coxbox, and some... crazy weird psychedelic musicians. And it was, for that time, it was all right. It felt good. So what did eventually lead to Omens Closure? It was because of the property. We were based in a garage and this was this garage. was Park House, we call it, was sold to any company. And then they told us we have to leave. We have to go out and, yeah. And they were stretching it. I know you can stay another three months. And we said, oh my goodness, okay, but we have to make the bookings and this and that. And then they said again, I know you can stay another half a year. And then I said to myself, no, I don't know. This is... I cannot plan the club and the bookings and everything, what is so necessary also for the staff. So I decided to myself, I said to my partners, I'm going to close the Omen in October 1998, which was with a big boom, three days party. The police closed the street for us. funny moment when they realized that we do the closing party and then they came and said hey listen how do you want to handle all the people on the street and we said to them yeah what can we do and then they said to us can we help should we close the street for you guys for 12 hours and I said yes please and they did so cool That was a nice experience. And it was a sad, sad, sad playing the last record in the club. It is not easy. I was playing the last record and I was just running out. Never came back. That was it. So newer fans of yours, maybe the people who know you for your days with Cocoon and your part in Ibiza, maybe don't realize your full history as a recording artist. And you kind of mentioned earlier you had success very, very young and had some... big selling records was fame something that you kind of felt comfortable with was it something that you kind of took to were you comfortable in the spotlight I was really comfortable in the spotlight I always enjoyed performing And that was for me my main motivation was always to dance. I'm a dancer, raver from my heart and still today I enjoy it so much. I just love dancing and this is what I miss sometimes today on the dance floor. People are more... They are more with their mobile phones and conversations in their chats. Sometimes I have the feeling people are not really with the music anymore. I don't know. It feels a little bit strange. somehow but anyhow for me was performing performing was always something I'm very good in improvise in improvisation this is probably my biggest how you say my biggest art form okay yeah I can improvise very good I I need this positive stress you know Even today, before I start playing, I'm getting nervous and I don't actually like when people talk to me then five minutes before I start. Just to breathing in, breathing out. Do my little concentration breath. No, but when I started as a DJ and then starting with production, starting using my voice, starting not really singing, more talking, I really enjoyed it. There were new territories for me. Also then performing in front of cameras. We made a lot of video clips. I recorded 13 artist albums. I was with BMG Areola, with Warner Brothers, with Virgin and with Cocoon, of course, Cocoon Recordings. So that was a lot of work. Back in the days, you know, you had your contract. And with this contract, you signed this contract for the next five years. They were included for artist album, for videos and so on. So that was... a different thing compared to today. You know, how easy you can make a record today or you can release two albums on two different labels, no problem. How easy did you find it? to balance these two very almost opposing worlds that you found yourself in where on the one hand you're pushing this very esoteric underground club music. And then on the other is the, you know, the commercial viability and the big record contracts. Like, is that a line that's been difficult to negotiate? More at the beginning. It was so new, I was not really thinking about it. But then when I felt my love growing more for the underground music, somehow I was in a bit of a conflict with myself. But you have to see, I was 21, 22, 23 years old, and I was already a pop star. star a dj in the best club in germany and it was for me something special and i could not tell you how it's going to be for the next the next steps the next years but i try to make my best out of it until the point when i quit this project off and i i decided to to reset my career and start again as just as a dj and then I bought myself equipment and I started with a little MIDI studio, rented a small little room in the same building where Logic Records was based and the master music production. company and then I met these nice musicians I was talking about before Matthias Hoffmann, Ralf Hildenbeutel, Stevie Bissett and then we started to know each other better and better and then I invited them to Ibiza Yeah, we had some serious fun. And then we started with this music, IQ. And with my first album, solo album, An Accident in Paradise. And then I had a side project called Barbarella. And that was for me then, honestly, with Warner Brothers and also with Virgin, I didn't have this pressure. I didn't have this pressure I had before with Off, where the record company was saying, hey, Sven, but we need a hit. We want to have a big hit. So was there an understanding between you and the label that you would have creative freedom? Yeah, because they were also kind of positive shocked at how big this music became in that short time. How is techno? So somehow, yes, they trusted me and I had this creative freedom in a way. But still, of course, I had a contract and I had to deliver. I'm kind of interested to know, you talked about the desire for dancing and the excitement that that creates. Is this something that you would look to kind of translate into your music, into your solo work and your work in groups? I mean, was this something that kind of drove you in a way? In a way, yes. But also I have to say I was... I am a big ambient fan since the 80s. I'm a big fan of the early works of Brian Eno and Harold Butt. And especially Brian Eno's work was really inspiring me to go a little bit left field, also with my production. And I had musicians next to me, you know. And I was telling them, hey, listen, no beats. Let's do something else. And it worked. And I really enjoyed that work as well. So today I could imagine I would love to produce one day a nice ambient art if I go back to the studio. As a solo artist, as Sven Fede, as a recording artist, I was not focusing the dance floor 100%. I wanted to try also new things out. Do you listen to your older music much these days? No. Not at all? No. Rarely. I'm not a nostalgic person. There's so many new music out there. It is so, for me, find the time to listen to old music. Then I ask my dad, why don't you take this time to listen to new music? Sure. So to maybe jump ahead slightly, when it came to starting your own venture with Cocoon, your own brand, your own enterprise, however you'd like to label it, what were your kind of personal circumstances around that time? What was the motivation? What was the need or the desire to start Cocoon? I had the idea already with Cocoon in the year of... In 1995, I visited this action theater group from Catalans. They're called La Fuda del Baus. And they did a huge action theater performance at the Tempeltrom in Berlin. And this was all about cocooning. And this was such a hard, in-your-face performance. I was shocked but really positive and inspired. I was asking myself, I said, wow, this theme cocoon describes my life. The only consistent thing is change in life. I'm not afraid for change. I was never. And that's the perfect symbol for what I want to do. I want to create metamorphosis in the music, with the events, with the love I put into in the night. And you can always... come out of yourself in the night and become whatever if you just let yourself fall. And so I created this name and I started the first Cocoon Party in 1996 with Underworld Live and DJ Hell and The Advent and B12 Live out in the acoustic garden with Alter Ego and I invited even some Japanese DJs. And I mean, the party was great, but I was so, let's say, ignorant or maybe arrogant. because I did not want to work with sponsors with no sponsorships I said I invested all I invest all my money I have because for me that was a statement you know for underground and and idealismus and I believe in this thing exactly For me, it was like a disaster. I lost everything. But there was a lesson for me, a good lesson. I said, okay, well, it's probably not the right time. Why did it go badly? It was on the 1st of May and there was this May Day party, you know, the huge rave event and I charged a lot of money. I had a high entrance price and to cover all the costs and everything and it was just for the people. That was just too much. But it was a good party and when I look back, I was happy that I did it. We all have to learn our lessons. And we even learn more when it goes wrong. Nothing is perfect. I've learned this. And that's important. And then after I quit with the label IQ and Hard House in 1997, I closed the Omen Club in 1998. And then it was my very first time that I was independent. No partners, no contracts. I said, oh, that feels good. And then I was asking myself, and now? Well, then I had a little bit of time to think about it. And then I started with Cocoon as an agency, as a booking agency. Then I started like some random events in Frankfurt. And then I started 1999 with four events in. Ibiza. Okay. So when you started the booking agency, did you kind of have a plan at the time for this very like 360 degree enterprise? No. there was no blueprint you know there was no no one there was just going by auto detective intuition i was just i just felt like doing it this way and everything every step after was just logically hey, now we need this and maybe we should start with this now. And we were not in a hurry. I was alone. I had my team around me. And that was... It felt really good and still it does. I was happy that I made all these decisions. Why did you start with a booking agency? Because after I closed the Omen Club, I had a bunch of artists who were my residents. the Omen, they were all from Frankfurt, Frank Lorber, Tony Rios, Anthony Rother, Johannes Heil, Pascal Fios, and many others. I was like, oh my goodness, I cannot leave them alone. You know, I have to take care of them somehow. And that was the idea. So when it came to the pitch, you eventually received from amnesia to begin a house and techno party in ibiza did this seem like quite a radical idea not for the amnesia because i was already invited by amnesia a few times before by the english promoter called bugged out okay yeah yeah they invited me a few times and and amnesia the son of the boss, Martis Junior, he was a big fan. And he said, Sven, do you want your night here? Can we do something together? And I said to Talida, she was my booker and she was taking care, she was organizing everything for me. I said, come on, let's give it a try. I want it. I just want it because I have to give something. I have so much to give. Let's give it a try. The Monday was not open. There was a competitor, it was Manu Mission at Privilege. I mean, it was no competition for us. And I think it was, I don't know. On Mondays, I think they were the only ones. Yeah, I said, okay, we start on Monday and very naive and enthusiastic. And we loved it and it was good. Yeah, we had a good time. I mean, do you feel as though it took some time to establish the kinds of sounds that you were pushing? Of course. Yeah. Of course. I mean, how was that process? I mean, in the beginning, it was like this, that, of course, that I had a lot of people coming from Frankfurt and from Germany following us to support Cocoon in Ibiza. But then when we were going in the very first season in the year of 2000, in the full season, suddenly we had a lot of Spanish people. The Spanish people were our biggest supporter then. And all the island people were talking about the music of Cocoon and what's going on there and something different. Yes, step by step. And then in the first three years, I had the German Telekom as a sponsor. And I was really happy about this because they helped me a lot. Because running an event from Germany, here in Ibiza, costs a lot of money. So they helped us out. And we had also, they were not just a sponsor. Somehow they were a partner. They came also with some fresh ideas concerning, you know, about the visuals and decoration, objects and stuff. And we enjoyed the partnership with them. But then we reached a point in the three years, they said, okay, they have to move on. And I said, okay, well, I think I can do it by myself. Let's give it a try. And I said to Amnesia, hey, you know, maybe you have to help me a little bit, but I want to continue. with this concept. I don't want to make a compromise and I want to be straight and it's just the music and then it was the year of 2003 with Ricardo Villalobos, 2003-2004. Because in 2001, 2002, 2003, I had German house promoters hosting the Terrace. And Ricardo was also, you know, was a part of it. He was playing, but then I was kind of tired of their style of the promoters. I said, no, I don't want them. That's not cool. And then I said to Ricardo, hey, Ricardo, why don't you take the terrace, become the boss of the terrace and make your thing and show them what you can do. And yeah, and this was also something very new. Inside, I was playing the techno and the harder stuff. And Ricardo started his Ricardo House sound on the terrace for hours and hours. And this combination was very unique. And that was the time then, 2005, when suddenly... I mean, suddenly the club was packed. Before that, we were like, we had 2,000 people. The peak was maybe 3,000 people. And then suddenly thousands of people came. And we were happy about it. And we said, yes, yes, you know, finally it worked. Like childs, honestly, like happy childs. I was just going to ask, was there something about Ricardo's sound that you think made it a particularly good fit for that space? Yeah, definitely. Especially for the terrace, especially for the morning time. You know, this morning time on the terrace with the sunlight, you see the olive trees on the terrace and you have this tropical Ibiza Balearic feeling. holiday, you know, you see the people and with Ricardo's morning sound, that was really special. Do you think it was kind of something that was in the spirit of the old days almost? Yes. I think Cocoon. This was exactly what I wanted to, you know, to transform with Cocoon to, you know, to experience the island. Back in the early 80s, I wanted to bring back this feeling about the music, the dance floor, in this called a spiritual experience together. So I guess around this time is when you opened Frankfurt Cocoon. Did you feel maybe that this was a way to kind of bring everything together in one place? You know, everything that you were kind of about, was this your baby in a way in the most kind of pure form? Yeah, there was the opening of the Cocoon Club 2004. It was for me such a project, man. I was happy that I found the right partners who believed in this vision. And I was happy to have this amazing architect and design company, 3Deluxe from Wiesbaden. It helped me. We were working on this project for two years and then we opened the doors. That was something. I wanted to bring this night clubbing into the next century with this club and with the high end of design, sound, light, food. And I wanted to invite my generation again to go out, have fun. Maybe they enjoy more the fact that they can come and having a nice dinner, a bottle of wine, and then they're just walking three meters and then they're standing on the dance floor, you know. And this concept was quite ambitious and new, especially in a city like Frankfurt in the industrial area. Everyone, I mean, at that time in Germany didn't have a good time. Everybody was just mourning. how can you open a club like this 2004? What should I do? Should I wait till you all feel better? I'm sorry, we were planning to do this club and opening is our opening date, you know. And so in the beginning, I had to fight, you know, also with... some people in Frankfurt are saying, oh, this is a super club. This is too much. This is for you. Take it. Experience the sound. Experience, you know, the design and, you know, there is so much love in this club. You know, feel it. But I think for many people it was a little bit too much at the beginning. But then the ice was broken and we had such a really, really, really good, good time. Then we closed the club after eight and a half years. But the problem was for us that we could not run this club with this concept in that area. The industrial area in Frankfurt was not the right spot for a club like this, especially not for the restaurants. So we had to decide. to, you know, try to change the concept completely or just to say, okay, that's it. Do you feel kind of satisfied to look back? on those eight years did you achieve everything that you kind of set out to do yes and i mean i still love clubbing and the clubbing culture and i'm i invested so much in the last 35 years in in into our scene and for me this was something like a masterpiece i wanted to create for our for our scene Maybe it was for some people it was too much, for some people it was too ambitious, for some people it was not underground anymore. But I really did not think about it, you know. I wanted to do something, I wanted to create something for the future, you know. We talked a lot about it, you know. If we had the Cocoon Club in New York or in Paris or in London, I don't know. But I'm very thankful to my partners. I have to say that they all believed in this project and we had a really wonderful time there. But again, it's cocooning, it's metamorphosis, it's moving on. You just kind of alluded to the fact that it's been kind of getting on for 35 years since you started playing. and you're still performing with vinyl i assume of course yeah with two turntables a mixer yeah i just wondered what is it about this very simple art form that's kept you entertained for so many years it's the music it is just the music and there's no point for me why why should i why should i change there's so many good labels out there releasing good records, taking care of everything, of the manufacturing, of the design, of the cover, of the quality, of the mastering and so on. And as long as I can buy good records, I'm going to play them. That's so simple. And having my two turntables and a mixer and creating physically a mix with sweat on my fingers and feeling the dynamic in the mix when it comes together. And that's, for me, yeah, that's the... Cherry on the cake, you know when I when I when I when I do my when I do my thing I still feel like you're still learning new things about DJing and playing to people who the after all these years I Did the good thing is it? Cannot getting boring for me because I'm buying and consuming new music all the time And my highlight is to introduce new music to my crowd. And the good thing is that they follow. They trust me. I just played a 12-hour set at Robert Johnson. Tell me one DJ who's playing 12 hours of vinyls. before I played a 12-hour set at the Watergate. A week before I played a 14-hour set at Granz Montana in the mountains. Actually, there were three parties in a row in one night. But I'm just enjoying it, you know. And yeah, the younger generation, they see me, you know, and they look at me. I think they feel, they can feel that I love my... my work and when I'm waving with my records look at this record this is on the screen whatever I'm making a show you know it's a part of my performance but The quality of the music, it's only what counts. And I can create a big drama in the night with the music. And I can play a strong techno set for hours, but I can also play like a 12-hour after-hour set. I don't have this. barriers I can I have because of my experience through all these years I can create special connections with music I listening the way I listening to music is quite advanced in a way I can combine sounds and grooves and atmospheres and yeah I'm celebrating my 50th birthday this year imagine and I'm talking like a child No, but honestly, I'm still enjoying it so much. And I support the labels and I support the good music. That's for me the most important. If I see the sync button DJs, you know, everyone can, with respect, everyone can play what they want, but loops and effects. and sync buttons, this is not my DJ world. Yeah, I see. I mean, it almost felt like, in terms of the extended sets that you were talking about, it almost felt like Cocoon helped kickstart this whole after-party culture here in Ibiza. Definitely. I mean, are you someone who's always kind of not wanted the party to end? Yes. Yeah, because I love it. And that's the thing, you know, because I just cannot stop. It's okay. Sometimes it's like I ask myself, I said, come on, you know. But I still have to give something. And talking about after our parties, we started the after our party culture here in Ibiza. three parties and Johannes and I, we know that people, it's a part of Cocoon, our after hours, but it's not always so easy to find the right location to, you know, deal with. authorities and and that's becoming increasingly difficult of course yes we have to pay the fines and say okay let's swallow that it's okay we pay it and this and that but we want to we want to continue with this yeah and last year we had this amazing after hour that this new place destino which was unexpectedly it was the bomb that was it was just a A stamp on to the end of the party season and cocoon, bam, after hours. It was very emotional, yeah. It's interesting to me because, you know, if you think of most people, they will reach a certain age and then they start to feel very self-conscious about partying hard. But you're someone who's always kind of enjoyed themselves in a very like, you know, clear conscious, very like free way. Yeah. Well, as I said before, For me, I am very connected with the island and this spirit, this hippie spirit, let's call it like this, I experienced here. This was for me something I always wanted to share with my crowd and to give. Yeah, of course. They're all stepping now in my footsteps and they all want to do now after hours and this and that. And of course you can. You're all free. You can do what you want. But then people are asking 30 euros for the entrance fee for an after hour. Or no, these DJs only play on private villa after hours. Yeah, I'm thinking they don't get it. They don't understand the whole thing. So I guess over the years, you've obviously had extremely full-on summers and all the after parties we've been talking about, but then there's been this counterbalance with very restful and relaxing winters. Why did you feel that this quite extreme model kind of worked best for you? Why was this kind of a good method? Because I'm living a crazy life. My lifestyle is extreme. If you give so much in such peak levels all the time, you need an oasis. You need a time for yourself. a quiet time yeah when it comes to you know your body mind and soul and in india as i said before i lived in india i had a house there down south in goa and yeah i was introduced i was introduced to the Ayurvedic life philosophy of Indians. And I started with this 17 years ago. And I found that this is matching perfect my lifestyle if I take like three months, four months a year, no alcohol, no meat. temporary vegetarian i'm a temporary alcoholic you know my life is so extreme that it's in a way it's it is um it is worthy to find out your your perfect balance which is the hardest job in your life i think finding your right balance There are always a lot of temptations everywhere, especially when you travel and when you are moving around and everyone wants to share with you and everyone wants to invite you and everyone wants to give you, you know. best for instance you just go once a year to bonus iris of course the fans waiting for you and asking you swan where's the after hour i'm saying hey people i cannot you know i cannot continue because i have to catch my plane and and move on yeah but we have aware Wolf, Kata, Finca everything is prepared for you we have decks we have a mixer you know situations like this you know and then you have to say no you go oh my god you know but it's it's somehow a bit of a discipline that you say okay and here I have to say stop And otherwise, I love to do my sport. I have my massages. I have a beautiful, I have two kids. My daughter is 24. Tiga is three and a half. And also, you know, I have a family life. So I have... DJ life, business, running a business with Cocoon, family life, have to look after myself and so on. To get everything under one roof, that is a bit of work. you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
