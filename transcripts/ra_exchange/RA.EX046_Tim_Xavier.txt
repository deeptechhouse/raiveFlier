Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Will Lynch, and I'm the news editor at Resident Advisor. For this week's Exchange, we sat down with Tim Xavier, an American DJ and producer, and behind-the-scenes player in Berlin's techno scene. Xavier spends most of his time at Man Made Mastering, a studio he built from the ground up that's cut hundreds of electronic records, including Plastic Man coming box set. Nonetheless, he considers himself an artist first and foremost, and rightly so. He's DJed in clubs around the world and put out his debut album, Viperfish, last year on Clink, the label he runs with his girlfriend, Kamiya. Sitting in his studio one recent afternoon, Xavier led me through his life story, from eyeliner in the 80s to parachute pants in the 90s to techno ever since. you I was born in Portland, Oregon in 1977. And my parents divorced when I was really young. And my mother remarried, so I moved to Houston, Texas when I was like six or seven. Portland is like this really lush place with trees and nature. It's super liberal. And I mean, I don't know, that's where I came from. And so to move to Houston, Texas. was completely strange for me because it's like as a kid it's like moving to Mars you know however you could swim all summer and all that stuff I don't know say when I when I turned 13 I was in middle school and I had these friends who were like I don't know kind of vanilla ice hip hopper kind of guy and you know we wore Z Cavaricci's and these Pace Pace Z Cavaricci's were like these kind of baggy pleated balloon pants that were really popular and I guess it was must have been like 1989 or so and we wore like paisley rayon shirts and had like vanilla ice here but There was a nightclub called Etcetera and it was like, you know, it was like the teeny bopper club in Houston in my neighborhood. And it was 15 and up. And, you know, the whole goal was to get inside. ♪ ♪ I remember the first time I went there, I was 13, and I totally, okay, so we're standing in line, and we just felt like such nerds, you know, me and my two buddies. And we get to the door, and the guy goes, how old are you? And I go, 15. He goes, what's your birthday? And I just completely froze. Like, totally forgot everything in my head. And yeah, he was like, get out of here. You can't, you know, you can't come in here. Um, so I don't know, a couple of weeks went by and then I came back and he remembered me and he was like, whatever, come on in. Um, but I remember going in and like, there was, you know, it was like this nightclub with with a DJ and we thought the DJ was making the music and at the time it was Nitzareb and Frontline Assembly and kind of gothic and industrial mixed in with New Beat and Hip House and whatnot and I just remember thinking this is the most amazing place. Like, this is incredible. This is where I want to be. There's a lot of stuff that happened in between, but I lived in Houston from 6 to 13, got into some trouble, ended up moving back home with my father in Portland. That's where I got into raves. Lived there for a year and a half, got into some more trouble, and then came home and lived with mom, who, like, shaped me up. What were the raves like in Portland? So it was like mid, early 90s? I moved to Portland in 1991. I moved back with my father. And I actually hadn't been to a rave yet. I was just going to teeny bopper nightclubs before then. But when I got to Portland, of course, I was into, you know, I don't know, mostly industrial and like KMFDM and Skinny Puppy and whatnot. You know, you go to any little record store, there's tons of... for these parties. They looked ridiculous back then, but to us it was amazing. My first party was called Joker's Juice. There was this older kid from my neighborhood who was like, yeah, I'll go with you. I think I was about 14 or 15. And we went down there and it was amazing. It was like this huge kind of warehouse in downtown Portland. And, you know, everybody's raving it up and dancing. Still felt like a nerd, but I felt like this is like, this is amazing, you know. One thing that sticks out is, you know, whoever was DJing just kept blending and blending and blending. And like, I mean, a track wouldn't last for more than like... two minutes or so. Fast forward, you know, and I collected all of my Ray Flyers from around that time. When I moved back to Houston with my mother, I remember going through my Ray Flyers like two or three years later, and I pulled out the Joker's Juice Flyer, and I realized, I looked at it at the back, and I said, oh my God, it's Jeff Mills. I can actually claim that my first party was Jeff Mills, but the funny thing is I had no idea. Like you wouldn't have known who that was? No, of course not. No, it's just like, I'm going to a party. That's it. So, yeah, they were, you know, parties in Portland were, you know, I guess it was like the beginning of fat pants. Candy ravers weren't really invented yet. I mean, it was cheesy stuff like people doing neon body paint and stuff like that. Like, you laugh, but, you know, at the time it was, that was, that was it, you know. I can say that looking back in retrospect, the parties in Portland weren't that amazing, but they were amazing to me because it was new. Yeah. And probably a lot of the other people there, too. Yeah, definitely. I mean, we're all, like, super young, you know? I mean, there are some parties you go to and you hear, like, house all night but we didn't know his house was just umpsha umpsha umpsha and then other parties you know some some guy would just be drilling the dance floor you know um but yeah when i when i moved back to houston i mean i was a bona fide raver uh it was like 1992 and a half like 93 ish um But I made a commitment to myself that when I moved back to Houston, I would buy turntables and start buying music. Was there anything going on? Was there stuff to go out to in Houston? Well, yeah, there was definitely things going on in Houston. I mean, Houston and Dallas and Austin. I mean, ecstasy wasn't illegal until 1989, I believe. So, you know, the... There was just really, I guess, a heavy club scene and a heavy gay house scene that I didn't know about, but it was pretty concentrated. There were actually a lot of DJs that would come from New York and actually play at a famous club called Numbers in Houston. Numbers is like the old school gothic club. But yeah, there were definitely things going on. in Houston when I moved back. So do you think that it sounds like the club scene kind of in Houston grew out of industrial goth stuff? Is that, would you say that's true? Totally, yeah. Anything that's different from... or like Portland? Like, was that specific to... No, I think Portland had the same thing. I mean, I think, you know, the goth industrial scene wasn't regional. I mean, it was everywhere. But the transition from, for me, from the gothic scene to the rave scene was pretty dramatic. I mean, I shed the Doc Martens and the eyeliner and the fucking Tony Hawk hair. and replaced it with, you know, fat pants and, like, oversized clothes. But it was great. I remember the coolest record when I first started raving was Human Resource, Dominator. Joey Beltran remix. Oh, my God. I'm the one that only dominates. Where did you hear it? Actually, that was the first record I bought in a record store. That was in Portland, before I moved back to Houston. So how did you end up moving from what made you move from Houston to New York? Well, in Houston, as I kind of grew into my shoes, I met the local guys who were doing the big parties. They were called the Matrix Crew, and it was nobody you've heard of, but these guys who really were... huge part of my evolution this guy Chris Anderson Andre Morant um Abiel um this guy Bruno B and um yeah I just I got in with them and they they helped me get started like they're like okay you can open the party you know um and I I was DJing in in Houston for between like 1995 and 2000 but Around 1998, 1999, I was ready to move on. And Chicago looked like the next evolution point, you know. We had some friends that had already moved up there. And we're having a good time there and really like the culture and the city. So, yeah, I made my plan. I busted out. I'm glad I did. I mean, I guess when you live in a place, Houston's like a big metropolitan city, but it feels like a small town. So I think sometimes people can feel like they're stuck somewhere, and I think I felt stuck, and I needed an exit strategy. But I felt like if I went to Chicago that I could put the pressure on and really grow. The whole goal was to move to Chicago. I had an amazing roommate. His name was Charles Little. Charles was pretty much one of the biggest promoters in Chicago at the time. And we just happened to hit it off as friends. And I came to Chicago pretty wet behind the ears and kind of bright-eyed, bushy-tailed. And Charles really helped me dry up that wetness. kind of grow some skin and But he was a great he was a great influence on me. I was like his roommate You know I was allowed to like make plenty of noise in my little studio but yeah, I hit the ground running and and really started making Trying to make tracks like figuring out production and what were you doing with the productions like re? putting out records or like what was going on at that point? Yeah, well, I mean, I have, you know, the thing is, is I have a lot of people who are like kind of helped me along the way. For instance, I moved to Chicago with basically the person who taught me MIDI, who taught me, you know. certain things in his studio. His name's Andre Moran and we decided, you know, getting out of Houston was the best thing at the time. And, you know, he lived down the street and he'd already like made some records on Planet Rhythm UK, which was like a pretty popular hard techno label at the time. Yeah, I mean, I got a lot of, he helped me, he helped facilitate, like, tons of knowledge on how to do X, Y, and Z. But the goal was to get in that bedroom, you know, and just, like, crank out as many loops and things as I could. And I guess it came down to the fact that I needed money. I mean, I moved to Chicago. I paid, like, a couple of dollars. months rent in advance and I had I literally had like $350 in my pocket you know and You know, I guess when I moved there, we, you know, we immediately met different label owners and people who were doing stuff at the time. And I realized that if I could make some tunes, I could probably get paid for them, you know. But it was, it wasn't like an immediate thing. I mean, it took like two, two and a half, three months. But this is like, I mean, I spent sometimes 36 hours in that bedroom, you know, and would have like... or five, five and a half minute, six minute tracks. And then, you know, I'd go play them for either Andre and like get his approval and let him tear them apart. But I remember I had about four or five tunes. And there's this guy named Angel Alanis who had made tons of records, super talented guy. And I went to Angel's house, and Angel's like, hey, let me check out your track, let me check them out. And he presses play on the CD player, starts fiddling around with the compressor. He starts to compress it, get the sound nice and loud. He goes, these are good, these are good, man. Let's go ahead and get you a record going. And I was like, huh? He literally walked me up into Mix Connection. Mix Connection is Bad Boy Bill's label group at the time. Bad Boy Bill had a label called Contaminated. Angel literally walked me up there by the hand and was like, this is so-and-so, he does A&R, we listen to the track. and he goes, this is the next Contaminated record. It just happens so fast. But yeah, I mean, for those three and a half years that I lived in Chicago, I made like 26 12 inches. and a couple and a handful of remixes. I mean, I was just like an animal. But it didn't come easy. I mean, I really had to concentrate. I really had to, like... ask tons of questions, but I don't know, you know, Chicago culture, Chicago DJs really changed me from like rave guy in Houston to patient, calculating, slightly jaded, you know, I mean, yeah. you start to see things differently, you know, politically, you know, in the scene there and everything. But it was definitely, like, it needed to happen. You know, I needed to get out. It seems like that's when you changed from, like, someone like... participating in the scene. Yeah. Like creatively. Exactly. Exactly. Do you think you had kind of had a lucky set of circumstances or were things just different back then that you could make from just making a bunch of tracks? Oh, I couldn't, you know, I couldn't imagine being like a new producer now and starting from like zero. I couldn't imagine it. I mean, it's so tough for even like talented producers nowadays. However, it's different because software and all these different things are more accessible. It's easier to just get. you know, Ableton and a couple sample libraries and figure out how to, you know, craft your own sound, whether it be whatever genre, you know? Whereas then, yeah, I guess it was a bit easier, but you still had to, like, kind of kick your foot in different social circles and see who could, like, think you're cool enough and think your stuff is cool enough to hook you up. you know, or, you know, point you in the right direction. But once you were there, you think it was easier, like once you had an avenue in, maybe it was easier to actually make a living off of it from that point? Yeah, but it wasn't always sustaining. I mean, you know, I don't know if I'm answering your question right. I guess it just sounds like when you say, to Chicago with so little money and then you made a living basically from making tracks. To me, that sounds like a very different time than today where even successful producers would have a hard time. Yeah, I don't want to throw out numbers, but well, fuck it, whatever. The thing is that back then you could make a 12-inch and the advance. For an artist, in my situation, was anywhere from $700 to $1,000. That was the advance. And then, you know, if it got radio play, you know, on BBC or whatever, or licensed to a compilation, then you would get 50% of the licensing. And, you know, I quickly signed up as an actor. ASCAP artist. But I never really, I mean, when you're an ASCAP artist and you collect royalties from radio play and so on, you don't really get much. My problem is I was too stupid back then. I signed away all my publishing, which is fine. But, you know, yeah, I guess that was the deal. Like, I lived off of advances. But it didn't, like I said, it wasn't sustaining. In Chicago, there was a guy named Jeremy Jello, and he started this booking agency called Jello. And it was like me, Andre Marant. He was even handling like Marco Carolla's bookings at the time. There was Tony Rohr, Dietrich Schoenemann, like all these different kind of like American DJs. Lauren Flax. And Jeremy was a really promising like... booking agent and he had this amazing office and he was dead serious about like what he wanted to do as far as getting his artist up however it didn't work I mean all of these kind of like potential bookings and potential career opportunities were definitely like in the future and in the crystal ball But, you know, 9-11 really threw a monkey wrench into the whole situation with bookings. I mean, it really changed things. After 9-11, I think a lot of artists, including myself, you know, either lost a lot of bookings that they had or, you know, in my case, bookings that never really came into fruition. Why? Why did it have such a big impact on club culture and DJs? I mean, man, at the time I was working at Metro and we were canceling shows left and right. Rock shows, huge rock shows. I don't know, I mean, the whole country stopped. And everybody was, the entire world was, well, mostly Europe and the United States was just paranoid. And I think, I mean, can you imagine? I mean, yeah, stuff stopped. Yeah. And as a repercussion of that, I think a lot of clubs, for instance, in North America, I can remember Sona in Montreal was amazing. And Sona was one of those clubs that opened at 12 and it didn't close until 6 in the morning, or 7, which was amazing to us. I mean, Berlin's like that on steroids. And I remember Sona would book tons of great talent, and the talent buyers were like, we have to... you know, we have to cut back and start, you know, just booking locals, you know, and clubs could fill, you know, fill the place with locals. And you'd either have to be, like, a local or just, like, some huge talent to get. How did your time in Chicago end? Well, I, yeah, I guess, you know. Eventually, my existence there kind of fizzled out. It was weird. Like I said, I was working in Metro, Smart Bar. I was doing security. And if anyone who knows, like, SmartBar Metro and you're doing security, it's a dismal existence. I mean, it's fun because a lot of people want to work there, but you only get, like, $7 an hour. And, you know, it's a lot of hours for nothing. However, the experience was cool. And I eventually had to, like... just make my... Well, actually, I got fired. Yeah, I got fired. But it's not like, oh, I got fired. I mean, everyone gets fired from Metro. That's like the exit door. People get fired for stupid shit. But eventually, yeah, I got fired from Metro. And I started working at a record store called Wax Addict. And it was a great record store on Ashland Avenue near Wicker Park, which was kind of the cool neighborhood. And yeah, I was just working there like four days a week. And meanwhile, I struck up... a P&D deal with Inner Groove New York. What's P&D? P&D is pressing and distribution. It's basically where a label group will finance the mastering and the replication of your vinyl and distribute it on their own dime. And you have to provide music that sells, you know, and art and the whole... sort of brainchild of whatever your label will be. And I started a label called 773. So I needed to find a mastering engineer, somebody who'd cut my lacquers. There was a guy in New York, his name was Jack Biswell. And at the time, I flew out to New York to play a gig, like a techno gig. And I wanted to sit in on the first session. And I think Jack and I hit it off. And he cut the first record. It was great. It was loud. It was punchy. All that stuff. But when I came back to Chicago, went back to work or whatever, and I got a phone call one day. And he's like, hey, you know, I have a room open and you know a lot of techno labels and a lot of techno and house labels. So why don't you, you know, would you be willing to solicit some business? And, you know, you can live here and move to New York. So. I was like, sure, give me 24 hours to think about it. And I didn't sleep that night. I was like, oh my God, I have the opportunity to move to New York, learn how to cut. This would be amazing. And so the very next day, I came to the record store and was like, hey guys, we've got to talk. I think I'm going to move to New York. And so I did. Just like that. Within ten days, I was, like, gone. You know, without really having any kind of pretense. Just, like, I'm out of here. You know? I think I would have stayed in Chicago, you know? Yeah, he was going well enough. And I even had, well, I guess I did have, like, kind of a, like a... I don't know, like, I guess I was a little intimidated by the idea of moving to New York. Yeah. But once I got there, I mean, within the first couple weeks, I was like, this is amazing. It's actually a little bit more relaxed and a little less, a little less teeth than Chicago in some ways. But I moved in with Jack and we quickly got started. I started working on getting labels over and talking to people about our service at the time. And Jack was talking me up and doing sessions with me every day, like teaching me how to use the machine. How did things go from there with the job and everything? It's complex, you know. I mean, a lot of stuff happened. On one hand, there's me. I kind of put my production on the back burner. And then, on the other hand, Jack, like, had this great machine and studio. And we actually lived, you know, we had bedrooms on either side of the studio and a kitchen and a bathroom. And it wasn't a huge place. It was a typical, like... New York loft. Yeah. Um, but yeah. And, and, you know, Jack had like kind of his, um, Raga drum and bass thing going on and he was making his own records on his chopstick dub plate label. Um, pretty like prolific stuff. Um, and we had, like I said, we had, you know, vocalists coming through from Jamaica and whatnot. Um, and... And meanwhile, I'm like learning how to cut and whatnot. There were times when, you know, he went on tour and I got to put on the big boy pants and like run the studio. It took me, I don't know, he kind of threw me to the wolves, you know. I mean, I taught my colleague now, Grinzer, who's got like, you know. seven years on me i taught him how to cut and um i spent more time um teaching him the finer details of what i learned but most of what i learned was on my own in a way um and there's certain things about cutting lacquers that you can only learn by experience and actually using the machine and like basically messing up here and there. But, yeah, things went pretty well for, like, a couple years, and then Jack went on tour, and he met a girl, fell in love, and meanwhile, I met Camilla. in New York. And it was great. She was like this local minimal techno DJ. And she made the mistake of leaving her records at my house one day while she went to work. And I made a mixtape. But going through her record bag, I was finding Perlon records and all this really great stripped-down tracks. Like I said, I was removed from whatever was going on in the scene. So sort of rediscovering those labels and realizing that they were like... boss in New York at the moment was a great revelation and she was like, you know, you should try to slow your tempo down and stop making tracks at 138 and see if you can fuck with this 125 kind of tempo. And I did. Was she already doing Clink? No. No, no, no. We hadn't started Click yet. Well, I think we started... Okay, well, I started Limited 400. I had this idea that I would start a label. Like, how do you do a label that's kind of artsy-fartsy but doesn't have a lot of overhead, you know? And I got this hip-hop CD where the hip-hop artist had stenciled... like their logo on the CD, and I thought that was really cool. So I thought, okay, I'll start this label, and it'll be limited 400 pressing with, you know, like a cool stencil design. And so I started LTD, and the first track I made actually was Deception De Real, and it was like 125, but kind of... kind of dark, but still really just clunky and chunky. And she's like, this is really amazing. And I put it out as LTD 400 number one. A couple weeks later, it got licensed by Ricardo on, I think, Blue and Green. It was getting charted, and it was getting lots of play. And I saw the light again. I think I was getting a little bit depressed. Just getting a little bit over making super hard tracks. Not super hard, but just making hard tracks. I needed to sit down and work on stuff that had a bit more soul. And actually make myself do it. But I met Camila. I was in love. So, and I think, you know, you can ask any producer, they fall in love and shit changes, you know. So it was definitely like a good, a good like new chapter. And a couple months later, she, you know, we had this friend Grant from Atlanta and he moved. He moved to New York. And we were just, like, the three of us were just all, like, really good buddies. Tony Roard lived down the street. You know, Dietrich worked, Dietrich Schoenemann, who runs Complete Distribution, you know, actually worked down the street. So we're all kind of, like, a tight little community. But Camille wanted to start Clink. And her idea was different. She wanted to blow up this cool minimal label at the time with really great cover art. like really putting her ear to the ground when it came to like music selection and what we're actually putting out. First couple records were like a pretty emotional experience for us because I think all of, no, I mean seriously, it sounds cheesy, but like all, you know, we put out, Tony and I did the first record with like an Inside Out remix grant. And, I mean, that record sold like 3,000 copies in a time when, you know, selling like 1,200 copies was amazing. You know, we sold 3,000 copies, and it was licensed and all that stuff. So we're really happy. And we just kept rolling with it. I mean, we're still going today. However, we've definitely evolved our sound from the way we sounded then till now. So when did Klinka actually start? I want to say 2005, like the end of 2005. It's all kind of blurry. And what was the scene like in New York at that time? cool parties with a lot of cool artists coming through and stuff like that? Yeah, we were out. You know, Kamiya introduced me to a lot of my core friends, actually. Before Kamiya, I knew Jack, who taught me how to cut. I knew Dave Sumner, Function, who's amazing. Yeah, you said when you first moved to New York. Oh, amazing, amazing. Dave was like, well, see, I met Dave in Chicago. Yeah. And, you know, I was always a big fan of user and utility plastics. What was that? Okay, User was like an old label, a collaboration between him and Regis and these different guys who were associated with Integral Distribution in Birmingham, England. And they were just really tracky, cool tracks, a lot of sort of Todd Terry loops that had been lifted off of other records and whatnot. I hope I don't get in trouble for saying that. whatever. Um, and, and I was always a big fan. I met Dave in Chicago with this right before I moved actually. And, um, you know, I was like, Hey, I'm, you know, you're a user or whatever, you know, and went up and tried to talk to him. I thought he was such an asshole. I thought he hated me actually. Um, I was like, Oh, this guy doesn't like me, you know? "That's cool, whatever." We kind of chatted, but then it just fizzled out. But when I moved to New York, I made sure that he knew I was coming and whatnot. And we turned out to become really good friends. Like I said, I moved there, I didn't know very many people. And I can remember one time, like I went to his studio and it was just a mess. I mean, it was just stuff everywhere. Like an ARP, like halfway falling off of the table. Tons of dust on every keyboard, every drum machine. And I said, dude, I'm going to come in here and help you clean up your studio. And we spent one full evening from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. And we totally rearranged his studio. He has this amazing... He had this amazing view of upper Manhattan. It was just unbelievable. So you could be working on a tune and look left, and poof, there's the city. But no, he grabbed me up one night after I'd been there for a month or two, and he's like, I'm going to show you the real New York. And he picked me up. And he had a car. He was the only person I knew in New York with a car. So he picked me up in his car in Brooklyn, and he threw on Suicide, which was absolutely amazing. And then drove me around in this perfect, crystal clear night in Manhattan, and just listening to Suicide for the first time. and getting major goosebumps. It was really a nostalgic thing. And then he topped it off after the drive. He took me to the financial district where nothing goes down. You know, I mean, it's the financial district. And he goes, we're going to go to a cool party. And, you know, we roll up to this big steel door and he knocks on the door and the guy, like, slides a little sliding glass thing open, you know, sees if we're cool, lets us in. And he took me to this, like, private party that was, like, totally private, you know. And it was just incredible, like, meeting some of his friends and whatnot. What was the, like, atmosphere like inside? I think DMX was playing, like, an electro set. And you had to buy drink tickets from, like... some random chick, not random, but some chick in the corner. So, like, if you wanted a drink, you had to buy tickets from her to go to the bar. And it was set up so, like, if the police came, you know, the girl would leave with a fanny pack full of money and, you know, the party could, you know, they'd say, oh, no, you know, we're serving drinks for free or whatever. It's a private party. But, yeah, it was and people seemed to be older and more mature, a little bit more international to me. But it was harmless, yet totally intriguing. Just like, oh my God, where am I? This guy's showing me some real New York shit. Like there's some kind of... underground network. Oh, it was the silver lining, like the underbelly. Yeah. It was not like, um, there's a flyer or something on, uh, rhythmism, you know, which was, uh, which is a website you could find upcoming events and whatnot. But yeah, at the time in New York, there were great things going on. Robots was on Friday night. Meanwhile, Bunker was happening in Lower East Side Friday night. Robots. That's Bill Patrick's thing? Bill Patrick and Nick Ashley Cooper. It was like you walk into this restaurant and then you go to the back and you go down the stairs and it's like a subterranean bar. And I mean, you could put like minimal amounts of sound in there and it sounded amazing. And, yeah, I played there a couple times. Bunker was great. Played live there once. I guess there were, you know, I mean, you could go to Avalon, which was the old limelight. It was kind of lame. You know, Pasha was happening. Pasha was also, like, a pretty commercial kind of venue where, you know, a beer is, like, $10, and then they still expect a tip. It's unbelievable. I mean, there's always, the Manhattan mega clubs, but there were definitely like, you know, cooler lower east side spots to go to at the time. And so how did, why did Klink decide to move? Well, Klink, Klink didn't decide to move. You know, Camille and I, we, you know, we kept doing releases and whatnot. And we caught the attention of Dave Turov, who was doing, he was doing Nights at Watergate here in Berlin. And, yeah, Dave was like, you know, we really like what you're putting out, so if you come to Europe, I want to book you. And he said, no, I take that back. I just want to book you. And Tony Rohr hooked us up with a booking agent at the time, and she got us a booking at Batofar in Paris. which is like a boat party. So we were to fly over and play Batafar and then, you know, chill out for a day and then come play Watergate for Dave Turav. And I think Camille and I knew the whole time that when we get to Berlin, you know, we're going to be kind of sniffing it out. and seeing if we like it. And, you know, just getting off the plane, you know, it had shown a felt you have to get off the plane and walk, you know, and just getting off the plane, it was like the air is crisp and just, it was just this feeling in the air, maybe because we were just excited, I don't know. But we went out to dinner and just rolled around the city before sound check. And the joke at dinner was, so are you guys going to move here? Which is the normal thing. So you're going to move here now, right? Why do you think you already had that expectation? Because, you know, we... I don't know, like, our Clink records were on the wall at Hard Wax, you know, and those guys had a great deal of respect for what we were doing at Hard Wax as an institution. You know, we did our homework. We were already fans of, like, so many great artists and people who had moved here and who were kind of... you know, like living a good life and much, much happier. I mean, we loved New York. New York was great. There was tons of things going on. It's international. You know, it's a little expensive, but, you know, at the time we were like, I think we were both ready to try something new, you know. But, yeah, within the first couple hours of being in Berlin, we were definitely, like, 80% sure we wanted to be here. And so how did the water gate go? Great. Totally packed. What, like, immediately struck you as different? from playing in New York or something like that? The fact that they wanted to do soundcheck. I know it sounds so cheesy, but no, the fact that they wanted us to come and actually do soundcheck was like, oh. They take us seriously. I mean, New York is serious, but New York's like, you just show up and like, I mean, I guess in New York we didn't really use Serato or Traktor. We used Serato for like the last couple months in New York. But, you know, you show up with your records and poof, that's it, you know. So they wanted us to come and do soundcheck. And the first thing Dave told me was, hey man, don't... Drink too much. You know, stay cool. And I knew he meant business. He's like, I want you to play. I want you to bring it and really concentrate. Like, we're not fucking around over here. And then you see the guy testing the lights on the ceiling upstairs. And you're like, ooh, nice lights. You know, and then you drop your first bass drum. And it's like, ooh, nice sound system. You know what I mean? Like, it all. It was all like, I don't know. Yeah, it all kind of delivered. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it was great. It's like, okay, this is serious shit. And we, you know, of course, we went out after Watergate and continued on. I think the next day we played Bar 25. When Bar 25 was a little less refined. I mean, I think towards the end of Bar 25, they had a pool and the circus and weird backstage areas and whatnot. There was none of that. Yeah, after our shack and, like, you know where the DJ booth is? You know, there was no place to sit in that window. There was actually glass there, except there was, like, tree branches broken through the glass, you know, because the tree wanted to get into the party. But, yeah, that's that. How did your, how did the cutting records fit into all this? Well, I guess, you know, sort of rewind to New York. You know, Jack, my roommate slash mentor in cutting, he went on tour and he fell in love with this girl in Belgium. And he moved away for like a year. And he's like, you're going to run the company. And, you know, I was like, okay, cool. So I did. But meanwhile, I met Kamiya and we got serious with LTD. and clink and shit just started to evolve and change you know and eventually you know I realized that you know I guess I could move over here but I really wanted you know I married the machine I married the business of cutting lacquers cutting dough plates and masters so you know I I proposed to Jack that I was like, "Hey man, you're out there, I'm here, I'm kind of in a different headspace. Here's a chunk of money, let me purchase your machine." And he went for it. And I think even when he was teaching me how to cut, he said, you know, he's like, I'm teaching you, but I want, you know, he said, it's really great when you're teaching someone something like a black art like this. He's like, I want the student to surpass. the teacher and one day this could be yours I suppose you know depends you know he kept alluding to like one day this could be yours so he kind of understood that I think so we had some weird vibes but um you know if you take away some of the the hardships we had with the business and different things we were we were actually we were good friends um we were okay business partners But, you know, I think for him, he saw the capital and was like, okay, I think I could take this money and do something really great with my Rocket Jungle stuff. I mean, this is a guy who was, him and his friends would fly to Jamaica and go into studios. you know, and, you know, white guy going into, like, Jamaican studios recording, like, amazing artists and then bringing the vocals back on dad and jungle-izing them. from scratch, and it was pretty incredible. But yeah, I bought the machine, and I wanted to use the machine as a vehicle to supplement some money along the way, and I guess it worked. But I didn't just go, oh, I'm going to move to Berlin with the machine and be a mastering guy. When I was here playing for Dave... Dave hooked it up and we went over to Dub Plates and Mastering and I met with Christoph at Dub Plates and kind of met him and got the feeling from him, where's this guy at, what's his deal, and tried to toy with the idea of moving here in our conversations. You know, he was really kind of ambivalent to... He was like, well, you could move here, you could not, but nowadays that I'm here and the studio's set up and it's running, here at Man Made, we have a really good relationship with the surrounding studios. A decent relationship. I mean, like, Dub Plates runs out of lacquers. They'll call us and we'll send over blank plates. Every now and again, Christoph will come over for a beer and we'll drop the needle on some records or whatever and get all nerdy and talk about audio. But it's been a journey. I mean, getting the lathe over to Berlin and actually setting up the studio was a huge feat. How would you describe it? Yeah, not everybody's seen the lathe and everything. How would you describe the machine? It looks like a giant sewing machine. But basically, it's a giant... It looks like a giant refrigerator turned on inside, and then on top of the refrigerator you have... a big, like, 16-inch platter, and then there's, like, a carriage, which is like an arm that moves across the diameter of the platter and attached to the arm. It's a cutter head, which is basically the cutter head that transcends the vibrations onto the plate. It looks like a big tattoo gun. It's like a tattoo gun. But yeah, it looks like a giant sewing machine and then it's surrounded by the electronics that we need to be able to control the audio to the cutter head for cutting the master plates. So how did you get it over? In pieces. Yeah. The entire thing, it's different. We have a Scully West Trek system, which is the American lathe. However, it's the American lathe calibrated by the amazing Swiss engineer Ivo Studer. And Ivo is responsible for calibrating a lot of the Neumann, which is the German cutting lathe, a lot of the Neumanns here all over Europe. So it's like if you own a record collection, you can pretty much guess that 65% of all of those records you own were cut on lathes calibrated by Evo. And that's not an understatement. It's pretty accurate. However, yeah, I had to take the machine apart, and it's a bit different than Annoyment. Annoyment is a little bit more compartmentalized. compartmental. Whereas my machine, the carriage comes off the top, which is like the arm, and the cutter head, of course, disassembles. The platter comes off. And then the tabletop is connected to the main chassis. And in the main chassis is the motor assembly. And the motor assembly is like a series of pulleys and bands and a big giant motor. But the motor and all the pulleys and all of those things are resting inside of a huge steel box. And in that steel box is about four inches of sand to weight it down. And so the chassis itself weighs like 400 pounds. I don't know what that is in kilos. So 400 pounds or so. And yeah, we had to take all the parts off the top and then we had to like, you know, it took like a couple friends to get the tabletop off, which is connected to another huge mechanical part. And there's three major parts just, you know, boxed up. But there are companies that help people move internationally. It's funny because they don't even call them movers, they call them technicians. And so these guys came to our place in Brooklyn, and I had the machine almost completely apart, and everything, all the small parts and boxes and everything's labeled and perfectly stored. But these guys were all like... old school, you know, Queens, Jamaican guys were like, oh man, the plate, oh, the plate cutter, you know, so they thought it was kind of amazing that that's what they had to move that day, but. We were on the second floor of a corner, like iron, like a little iron flat. And getting the lathe down those kind of like Dutch stairs was just, it was hell. We had to build a ramp and actually use ropes and pulleys to get it down. And the guys worked so hard, I bought them pizza and beer. I was like, okay, you know what? I know you're supposed to go back to New Jersey with my stuff, but I'm just going to go ahead and buy you dinner and get you all tipped out, you know? So that was cool. But once it got here, once the machine got here and all of its parts and all of our stuff was crated and packed, it came into Rotterdam. And so these Dutch guys drove it over in a huge truck, and they were super nice, and they spoke perfect English. And when they showed up with our stuff in the new building where the studio is now, we were able to put it on a lift, like an elevator, a giant industrial elevator, so it was a lot less work. All of that was actually kind of a big deal. Not very expensive, but a big deal. How did Native Maid Mastering get going? It's really simple. When I purchased the lathe from Jack and I took over, it was my time to change the company name. previously called Chopstick Dub Plate, which was his thing. And I don't know, I just wanted something a bit more serious. So what kind of stuff are you cutting these days? Mostly house and techno and stuff like that? House and techno. We also do quite a bit of reggae and dub. Basically anything kind of in bass culture. like anything in the vein of bass culture, you know, whether it be, yeah, reggae, dub, techno, house, whatever, not so much drum and bass. We don't get any, we don't have any like drum and bass clients these days. It's not, I don't know, it's not so, drum and bass is not such a thing in Germany. Yeah, yeah, right. Why do you think, why is cutting records appealing to you? Why do you think you're good at it? Well, if I can rewind, like when I lived in Houston in 1999, I was working at kind of a famous local record store called Chemistry Records, owned by Chris Anderson. And at Chemistry, within a couple months I started buying the techno section. So I was ordering from our distributors in New York who deal with their distributors in Europe at the time, like European distributors at the time, like Prime, Integral, News, Belgium, what's it called? So yeah, I was always a big fan of loud cuts. And I guess when you're a techno DJ, you want loud, ballsy cuts. So my friends and I, we would always look at the scribing on the Matrix, which is like... the writing on the spiral out on each record. And usually you can see where an engineer has signed his name. And at the time, Simon and Nils, Guy, these were all like rock stars to us from The Exchange in London. Not only were the records... and we were fans of the music, but we were fans of the guys who were cutting the music. You know, I mean, that's what makes cutting so beautiful. It's not just like the producers who make great tracks and put out records. It's who they cut with. You know, and the way... the way these engineers transcend the music. And it's an art form. I mean, if I cut a record and three other studios cut the same record, there are going to be slight differences. But I was always a big fan of loud cuts. So when I lived in Chicago, I dreamed about having a lathe. I think there was even a time when Andre Marant and I tried to look into buying our own machine. And of course it was like, okay, $30,000, you know, which, you know, which is a nice sedan or something, you know, a nice car. Um, but yeah, so that wasn't going to happen. So when I, I guess when I, when I did get that phone call from Jack in Chicago, I was like, oh yeah, I gotta go. I mean, I got it. I got a car pay DM and the shit or else it You know, I'm going to blow it, you know. So it would already be something you'd want to do for a long time. Yeah. And then opportunity knocked. Yeah. But earlier you kind of used cutting as a black art. What do you mean by that? I mean, there are only so many cutting studios left in the world, you know, and I would say it's just, yeah, there's only so many cutting studios in the world. I think there's, like, as many cutting lathes in Jamaica as there are in, like, the United States, actually. which is a nice cute little quinky dink. But the thing is that likewise with the engineers who own these machines and know how to operate them, there's only so many engineers left in the world who do calibrations or repair cutter heads. And the cutter head on the machine is the most delicate part of the machine. I mean, these coil forms are vibrating, and they're getting hot, and they don't last forever. They go through metal fatigue. And once you do so many hot cuts over, like... The course of like a year nowadays, you know, you have to get the cutter repaired. And there's like five or six engineers left in the world who do that professionally, maybe even less now. Ivo Studer from Switzerland is one of them. And there's like another Italian guy. I mean, you can't go to SAE and go to audio school and sign up for dub, plate, and master class. It just doesn't exist. And moreover, it's a completely different process. I mean, mastering music is... Once you get a grip on what you're doing and you have a basic knowledge, mastering is easy, but transcending... that mastered music to the plate efficiently without high frequency loss or without muddiness you know with like with like clarity and to be able to listen to the music on the speakers um and trim away the things that may make the cut offensive and um it's it's definitely It takes experience and time. So you're saying mastering a record is one thing, but then mastering a record and cutting it to vinyl is a whole different set of challenges. It's not a whole different. There are limitations in cutting that we have to abide by. So why do you think it sticks around at all? Well, I mean, I don't know. Vinyl's gone through some really strange ups and downs. I remember when I was working at Chemistry in Houston, and a year later when I moved to Chicago, I also worked at a store called Supreme. which is another record store. And that was like 1998 through 2000. I mean, you had bedroom DJs who just loved music and they would come and spend like a hundred bucks out of their paycheck every week on records. And you just don't have that anymore. I think CDs and MP3s are just more accessible. However, I think in the 2000s, people... found a more efficient way to buy music, i.e. buying stuff online or burning CDs or whatever. But nowadays, I see artists kind of getting sick of, some artists are getting sick of MP3s and CDs and just saying, oh, what the hell with it, I'll just go back. It feels good to go to the record store and like go through tunes and actually go through the motions of like Taking an afternoon and digging for records Also the you know in the States the rock scene like the LP kind of rock scene Has really made a comeback, you know white stripes a lot of indie bands, you know, if you're a and are for a label like How many CDs end up on your desk? It's so boring. I know if I was in a rock band, I'd go get a 7-inch made of the two biggest tunes on our so-called album. And I'd plop that down on someone's desk. It means more. And it's physical. You can hold it. I'm very passionate about vinyl, however. I also love technology. I'm not going to just be a purist for the sake of being a purist. I love it all. It's music and it should be delivered to everyone. Hopefully, well, no, I think vinyl will sustain. It will always be there. I don't think it's really going to go anywhere unless the one company left in the world who makes blank discs. discontinues their service the same way tape ended, like reel-to-reel tape. So there's one company that makes... Well, there's two. There's one in Japan called Adamant, and I'm not really sure if they still manufacture. I don't use them. That's a Japanese lacquer company. They also make styluses for cutting. I don't prefer their product. It's too soft for me, the actual plate. But a couple years ago, I'd say more like five, six years ago, there was a company in New Jersey called Transco. They were making plates. And then on the West Coast, there's Apollo. And eventually Transco, they didn't go out of business. They sold the company to Apollo. So now Apollo owns Transco. So you can get Transco lacquers or you can get Apollo lacquers, but they're all coming from one conglomerate now, one company. And nowadays in Europe, when you want to buy lacquers, like a supply, you have to buy from this. one UK distributor. So, I mean, it's, if anything's going to kill vinyl, it's not because people don't love it enough. I think it's, it's, it's a mechanical issue. You know, either we're going to run out of engineers who can't repair the cutter heads or service the pitch computers or, or different components on the machine or, you know, the suppliers are going to drive. eye up and just say, "Hey guys, we can't afford to make plates anymore." When you're cutting someone's record, what's your relationship like with the music? What would make it a good job or not? Like what you do with the music? Well, at the end of the day, the mastering and cutting process As far as quality goes, I mean, I stand by our work. We do great work. We get the music. Everyone here who, my colleague Grinzer, we're both... seasoned DJs. We've heard sound systems all over. He's graduated SAE, so on and so forth. But really, the quality of the music is up to the producer. I mean, we're instrumental in accentuating whatever they produce. So you're mixed down. or your mastering is totally reliant on your mixdown, your audio mixdown. But we cut a lot of music day in, day out. And of course we love the music, but there's a part of my brain that kind of turns off. And it's the... It's the like or unlike part. Sometimes we get a client every now and again on our new label and they'll go, hey, what did you think of the music? And we won't respond to the email. Not on purpose, but just because we're busy. And it's not because we don't like their music or something. I mean, it's just more tracks. Great. But it's hard for us to like, we don't sit around and form opinions. I mean, there's a part of it that's kind of mechanical. But we still put our soul into what we're doing at the same time. Does that make sense? Yeah. Well, because I guess what I was thinking was earlier on when you were saying these engineers were kind of, you kind of idolize them the same way you idolize an artist. But then the... itself is pretty mechanical at the same time. Yeah, I mean, like, back in Houston when I worked at Chemistry and we were, like, worshipping, you know, all the exchange cuts of all these great labels we loved, you know, we, by default, we thought Nilsra and Simon and these guys, we thought they were, like, really into techno, you know? But it turns out, they're just really good engineers. I mean, I think they care, but in a way they could kind of give a shit. They're like, we know how to compress this properly, and we know how to get the most. out of this waveform, cut efficiently onto the plate, period, that's it. In our cutting, time per side is everything. So, you know, if nowadays it's crazy, like some newer labels who kind of don't know what's up yet. We'll try to do two, you know, they'll do four track EPs and, you know, each track will be seven and a half minutes. And when we cut over 12 minutes aside... For every second over 12 minutes, we have to reduce the volume of the overall cut in order to fit the music. And today, just like back then, people want loud records. I think loud records today is a little less important because people are a little bit more into just quality rather than balls to the wall, like I want my... track to be blisteringly loud or so on. But we have to equal parts like educate our labels like, hey, you should really cut this down to 13 minutes. And of course our favorite thing to do is to cut 8 and a half, 9 minutes at 45 RPM. RPMs, like really nice one-to-one sound. 33s, it depends on the production, but it can sound a bit garbled or a bit more punchy, so we have to attenuate for that in EQing before we actually run the side. You remastered the Plastic Man box set and everything. When you get... When you're kind of faced with that task, what exactly is the challenge to, like, what do you want to bring out of those tracks when you're working on that? Well, I mean, the cool thing about the plastic band job is that Grinzer and I actually love the music. And in a way, we both... You know, we both came up on sheet one and recycled plastic. So we married the music years ago at one time, you know, before other things happened in our genre of music or whatever. So to get the job from Rich, you know, he gave us the first six albums first. And, you know, he's like, let's see how you're going to do. We were able to listen to the original label copies from back then, the way they were mastered, the way sheet one was mastered by the exchange back then. And then right away with our new tools and with our new valve EQ and our new valve compressor and all of our other great devices, we were able to go, okay, we want to do X, Y, and Z with this and really bring out, I mean, sheet one has a whole new polish. It still is true to its roots. However, volume-wise, it's totally consistent. It's a bit more compressed, so you can hear things in the tracks that you couldn't hear before. Back then, and, you know, sheet one, for instance, as an example, is kind of like a mix. It's not a mix like a DJ mix, like beat matching, but the tracks flow into each other. So it's not like... mastering each individual track and then checking for consistency. It's like you actually have to like start mastering from the beginning by using markers and marking off. specific parts of this larger waveform that makes up the mix, and then actually go forward and then go back and revisit certain parts to make sure that you're all consistent. But you can really hear things in those tracks that you couldn't hear back when I was delivering pizzas in Houston, listening to Sheet One for the first time on some little crappy stereo. And when it was mastered originally, the software at the time, you couldn't mark off all these different sections of the mix. I mean, you had to find a cool setting with whatever EQ they were using at the time, and compressors, so on, and you find a good setting that applies to everything somehow universally, and you press play. And maybe as it's recording back... You do some minor adjustments, but that was it. Nowadays, with the type of software we use for mastering, we use Magic's Sequoia. We're really able to go in and mark off individual things. We can remove pops that we weren't able to remove then or weird artifacts that exist in the original recording. Yeah, I mean, we really loved doing that project. It was like a six-piece vinyl box set and 15 CDs, including the first six albums. So is that like the biggest single undertaking? I think Plastic Man Archives is one of the biggest projects in techno history in general. I mean, I'm not kidding. It's a huge package. It's a massive thing. I'm not trying to sell it here on an RA exchange, but it's a big package. And I think halfway through all the work, I mean, this is like hundreds of tracks, three, four hundred. tracks, including the vinyl cuts. And halfway through it, Mike and I are like, man, this is a you know, this is huge, and he's going to sell this, and people are going to love it. But there was a couple, there was one CD in particular that was really curious. It was John Peel Sessions on BBC Radio, the late John Peel. It was amazing. And really, like, FM-sounding recordings. But there's, like... There's these sessions where Rich goes in and does a live session, and he plays spastic for, I don't know, 15, 20 minutes. And we mastered all of these sessions with John Peel announcing, you know, like, so-and-so's coming on, check it out, da-da-da. It was really interesting parts of the project. So we definitely married that project. How long did the whole thing take you? Off and on for about I'd say four months. Yeah. But, yeah, I mean, off and on. A lot of things had to happen. We programmed a lot of information is encoded into each track. So if you pop the CD into, like, a newer modern head unit or CD player, it will actually read. title and artist so on and so forth so we wanted to give him the best possible like current technology um so you said earlier that um the really fun thing about that was that the songs for so long but um how does that actually affect um what you're doing like did you already have ideas in your head of how this could sound better or something or um No. I mean, like I said, I had to revisit the original label copies, like the original CDs. I had to revisit them. And actually, funny, I ripped all the albums, the first six albums, and I put them on my iPod. And so before the project really started, I was able to, like, every day taking the S-Bond to work, I was listening to all the albums and getting to know, like, okay, this was like that. Oh, we can do that so much differently, you know, like. certain snares can really pop in these mixes. So I had to revisit it before actually sitting down. But when you sit down and do mastering, you're discovering things in real time and making decisions based on what you hear. very quickly. There's no premeditated kind of calculation, like, oh, I'm going to do this tomorrow or something with this setting. It doesn't work like that for me, anyway. Do you feel like it's important, like, do you feel like you really understand the way how your techno drums sound or should sound? or something or would you be able to master like reggae or something just as easily? Yeah, I mean, I think that all comes with experience, you know, as far, yeah, I mean, there's a universal, like, there's a universal way I hear music and it's like a mold and when I hear reggae or if I hear like a new well-produced techno or house tune, there are certain frequencies that fit that mold and I try to bring everything I do to that specific kind of like peaks and troughs and try to get these tracks like warm bass, you know, the highs aren't too sharp, but it definitely has some presence. It's a little bit punchy, but not too much. There's kind of a general feeling from engineer to engineer about how they go about achieving a specific sound. What are other engineers that you admire at this point? Oh, man. Well, first and foremost... I'd say that Mike Grinzer has been absolutely, incredibly instrumental in these new, in some new techniques I've learned from him. I mean, so I definitely, by default, I admire him and we have a great relationship. Yeah, I respect Rashad. I don't know Rashad. He's a cutting engineer at Dub Plates. I've been playing records that he's cut for years. I should go. make an effort to meet him, definitely. And he's also loved by so many other engineers. He gets it. He totally gets it. I respect Christoph, of course, because he's the godfather of the Gashaf sphere of dub plates. I think I really get his philosophy, and I relate to it. Plus, he's just all around a cool guy. And, like, again, I don't know Nils or Simon, but, you know, I've heard from the exchange, I have heard those guys' cuts for years. You know, I'd say I pretty much respect any engineer who knows how to cut. There's this kind of, like, dinosaur grandfather kind of vibe that happens. I know you love that word, vibe, but... There's kind of this, you know, when you get in a room with other guys who know how to cut and have been doing it and they've had the machine break or do weird shit on you in the middle of some important thing, you know, we've all had kind of similar breakthroughs and similar problems and there's just this natural connection, you know. How many mastering studios do you think still cut vinyl? Not a lot. I mean, it's weird. There are some studios in the world that actually have a working lathe in a room, and they may cut two things a month or a year or something ridiculous. A lot of those studios that have a machine or a cutting room... and then they have other suites that do other types of mastering, usually the first thing to go is the cutting room. Those are the more commercial studios, I think. Do you think it's more common to hold on to it in Berlin? Yeah, definitely. Here in Berlin, I don't want to be the spokesperson for Berlin. studios, but I mean, just concentrated in Quartzburg, this neighborhood we're in right now, there's one, two, three, four, there's four of us. You know? Why do you think that is? I don't know, man. I mean, I don't know. I don't really have an answer for that. I mean, it's just here. Vinyl culture still thrives. I mean, we're in the techno house electronic music capital of the world. That city, with that title that I'm giving it, should have four or five great studios. I guess it seems like the way you feel about it is cutting records is... central to the whole culture in a way. Definitely. I mean, it's a huge part of it. And you don't think it could just, like, there's something? Like, like people, no, I mean, if people stop making records, yeah. I think a lot of the studios now, including ourselves, we're equipped with nice analog signal chains. And I'll speak for us, we really wanted to prepare ourselves for vinyl to slow down and to start really pushing analog mastering onto all of our clients. requirement because with the analog mastering we're able to take your digitally recorded files and give them a nice warm sound that comes close to emulating what you would hear on a vinyl record. I mean nothing can replace the sound of vinyl. You can get a nice warm clean master files that are sold on whatever digital website, and people play them through their Traktor or Serato systems and get a similar warmth that you would get with vinyl. You're kind of ready to adjust. Yeah, I mean, we've been ready. So how does... The cutting records side is only part of your, since as an artist and everything, but do you feel like it kind of informs the way you produce records, or is it pure? of how to build tracks or anything? Yeah, definitely. I mean, when I was living in Brooklyn, I was cutting a lot of Spectral and Ghostly, and at the time, Audion, Matthew Deere, was just putting out some amazing stuff. and I was cutting those Audion records for Spectral and that was a huge influence on me. So yeah, sometimes more times than not there's a lot of good music that goes through here that I'm definitely influenced by. But for me, living in Berlin now, I'm slowly pulling away from having to be a full-time engineer every single Monday through Friday. I mean, I have to have time for myself and let my brain breathe. My thing now is producing my own tracks and getting records out. If you look at Discogs, there's this huge hole in me putting out records, and I want to make up for that hole. I'm working with... you know, Mike Grinzer, who's great and he's amazing. And I've really given him the reins, not only because I trust him, but because he really is, he's a great engineer. I'm just the doctor. He's the fucking surgeon, you know. He did a lot of really great work on, you know, I did about half of the work on. I'd say about 40% of the work on archives and he did the other 60 and The results were amazing But yeah, I mean, when I first got here and setting up a studio and working every day, I would go gig on the weekends and then, you know, have fun, of course. But, you know, you're still traveling and then you get home Sunday and you chill out. And then I wake up and then I'm here Monday, either laying brick to build these, you know, to build our main studio room or I was... flying audio panels that I had built by hand, so on and so forth. And later on, it was like actually cutting and working Monday through Friday. And then, you know, Friday afternoon, afternoon comes and you know I'm going through promos and stuff to get myself ready to fly out Saturday again you know it's been amazing but it's been kind of tiring and you know friends of mine who know me have been like hey Tim why don't you you know manage your time a bit better and I'm just like what? Dude, what do you mean? Oh, well, manage your time better. If you cut records and master jobs all day, and then you have to make the invoices and write 35 emails to everybody and get everybody sorted, and then you're like, all right, I got three hours before I should go home. After all of that, your brain's just warped. You're not going to be able to sit down and make some tracks. No. Even when I worked in a record store, hearing music, hearing tracks and releases all day and dealing with clients, which is great, but at the end of the day you go home and you're like, I'm just going to go chill out. So now I am organizing my time better. There are certain days I know for a fact I can wake up, grab my coffee, go in the studio, I can zone out for an hour and a half if I want to. There's no pressure. And then maybe I can work on something. And if I go home at the end of the day and I finished a new remix or I made a new beat or I just toyed around and made some weird soundscapes or something, at least I'm doing something. And it feels good again. So I'm definitely getting back into my craft. Still loving the studio, but having both working in tandem, but just a little bit more organized and with less stress. Do you feel like producing or DJing, do you feel like that's more your craft? That's my thing. Yeah, I love, I mean, coming up in Houston as a DJ. You know, being technically good was really important. You know, beat matching was a given. You know, but after that, being technically good and getting good, that's... That's how you were accepted in my circles that I grew up around. You had to be able to hold it together and on like a massive 50,000 watt system in a warehouse, you know, with delay and you had to. technically hold it together. Through my evolution of Chicago, New York, and now Berlin, I've picked up different things along the way with my sort of DJing craft, but definitely that's my thing. you
