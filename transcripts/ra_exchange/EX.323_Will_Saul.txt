Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Will Saul. He's known to be a great DJ and producer, but he also excels at A&Ring. He's now the head of A&R at K7, and his house music label has clocked up over 100 releases, a milestone he celebrated with an extensive tour earlier this year. In conversation with Carlos Hawthorne, Saul offers an insight to his extensive experience running labels and working with artists. But despite his success, Saul still considers his work a series of happy accidents and continues to let artists and circumstances shape his output. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Will Saul is up next. So, Will, I mean, we're kind of approaching September now. What kind of summer has it been for you? It's actually been quite a quiet summer in terms of gigs for me. Just off the back of the tour for the 100th release and 10th anniversary of Ouse. So I had a very busy April, May and I've just had a, just come back from a holiday in Cornwall with my family. And yeah, just very quiet August. gigs front so that enables me to really focus on K7, the label management and other bits and bobs that I do. There must be some sharp contrast I mean with the family life to kind of being on the road and then coming back and Monday getting straight back into a different routine altogether. Yeah, it is. I mean, I've got two kids. Eldest is nearly five. I've never been really one to party extensively. I choose my moments, which is very few and far between, unfortunately, now with kids. But I'm pretty disciplined. So if I've got a gig, I'll always usually get the first flight out straight after finishing the show so that I can be home. and get a weekend with the family. The only way I get over it is in terms of the sleep deprivation through travelling and being up late at night is I just try and keep fit, just run a lot. And that seems to knock my body clock back into shape as quickly as possible. So in terms of the K7 stuff and working on the label, you do that from home? I do that from home. Come up to London fairly regularly, go to Berlin. fairly regularly their head office is over there but yeah I've been self-employed working at home for 15 years now and you must like that yeah I don't really know any different to be honest with you I think I'd probably get a lot less done if I worked in an office because I'd be so like distracted just speaking to people and at the moment I can get a lot done in a short space of time working on my own But it is good and important to come up to London regularly to sort of meet people and actually face-to-face stuff is really valuable as well. You mentioned the tour there. I mean, what were some of the highlights? The best shows were in Lisbon and Barcelona, actually, for the Picnic Electronic guys. There's nearly 8,000 people in front of one stage in the Barcelona one, which was, they've got it really locked down in terms of incredible events. And also Lisbon was really good because it's just an amazing city. I really love Lisbon. But lots of good shows. Yeah, those two were the highlights. So yeah, I mean, 10 years, 100 releases. Was it coincidence? Complete coincidence, actually. Primarily, it got to 100 much quicker in the last three years since doing a deal with K7 and having them manage the labels for me. And just being much more streamlined and efficient and I ain't on the label, but someone else does all of the admin stuff. So that means we can release more music because it's not just me and my wife juggling all of everything that I do. So that has meant that we probably released. on average 15 to 18 records a year in the last three years whereas before it would probably only be about six so that sped up the the hundredth release over the last three years way quicker otherwise we probably wouldn't have reached it for another six or seven years I read you say that kind of six to eight was I mean it was the kind of the max that you were able to do physically yeah but it was also kind of the most you felt the label should be putting out at that period? Yeah, it has tripled actually. I think what happened after we hit... a really nice run of form I call it run of form but we hit a real hot spell of releases with stuff from George Fitzgerald Bicep Joy Orbison Dusky we hit a real run of form when I was still doing it on my own without K7 And I think that sort of catapulted the label into a lot more people's ears and eyes. And as a result of that, I had a lot more artists approaching me for... wanting to release on the label and I was hesitant to increase the output but then a lot of the people that I wanted to work with all very much had their own identity very much had their own sound I sort of looked at it and thought well if all the artists can stand on their own two feet they're not competing with each other for a spot on their schedule it's more about artists doing their own thing really and I think then it became apparent that it doesn't matter how much music you release if everyone's doing their own thing and has their own focus and sound so I increased the output because there was so much good music and I could actually release it that yeah it just made sense yeah i mean if you kind of break down kind of day by day how your role at the label has changed since k7 came on board uh completely um in terms of yeah i spend a lot more time searching for music and keeping in touch with with things and obviously now i'm head of anr at k7 as well i spend time doing that So all of the general setup of release is done by my label manager Jody who's brilliant and I'm literally just signing the artists preparing the deals and I then hand it over to him to release manager I'll oversee the whole thing in terms of you know when it comes to press You know selecting media outlets to premiere something or things like that. I'll still be aware of what's going on and sometimes stick my or in but Most of the time I just leave Jodie to it and just sign the music and then give it to him to administer. It's nice that you have more time to A&R because I imagine that the more successful a label becomes, a lot more people... come to you it must be easy just to rely on that kind of influx of stuff but to actually go out there and yeah it's important it's definitely really important to keep in touch but having said that this might sound a bit controversial I've never really been a big listener of demos that have been sent into the record label primarily because even when I was doing it on my own I still had a lot of work doing it all on my own. And I was making more music, and that's the one thing that's suffered really in the last few years is the amount of music that I've had the chance to actually get in the studio and make. literally the amount of demos that we get emailed into the record labels would be a full-time job if you're just listening to it all. So I've always gone out and found artists, picked up an early release from somewhere or seen them bubbling in some way and then approached them for music. Even from the start of the label, it was more about approaching artists that I really liked and creating something with the label through them. So I've never been a... listener of demos. I imagine your methods for ANRing have changed a lot. Yeah, as the label becomes more visible you get sent stuff. by managers who you kind of know and trust and who are looking after a great roster of artists. So more music comes to you from trusted sources rather than having to go out and dig around for it. But I still think it's really important to go out and keep very much in touch with everything that's out there. I mean, in 2006, the likes of SoundCloud and stuff weren't up and running in the way they are now. Totally, yeah. What were your methods back then? That's a long time ago. I very much created Ouse around a friend of mine, Fink, who was releasing on Ninja Tune and released for us as a sideshow. One of his closest friends, Lee Jones, who was my, my, and still obviously Lee Jones, because that's his real name. So the label was really created around those two guys to release their albums. So it was kind of A&Ring through a social circle, really. I was working at Sony Music with Finn. That's how I met him. And just felt that their music needed to be released, because I loved him. It was brilliant. So it was, yeah, you definitely couldn't A&R in the you do now through digging around on SoundCloud for sure because it obviously didn't exist. Will you ever go down and check out a kind of new artist set? Well because I still DJ quite a lot I still hear a lot of music on my travels in that way but less easy now I've got kids that live in the country to get into London and go to a gig. I used to a lot more obviously but... again you can still see live performances online very easily usually from anyone that you stumble across so I think that's kind of less relevant in a way but obviously if you then find someone that you really think is good you want to go and see them perform live but that initial contact point I don't think is is essential to to be at the show and in terms of Bringing new artists into label, that's always something that's done very successfully. Where's the balance between honing the ones that you have and bringing in more? Yeah, that's a constant balance, really. This year we've brought in a lot of quite established artists while still having what I would class as development artists, so people like Poana, Chinope. in a way you and you and say i would all classes artists that are developing but i've still been there a little while fold is another one um and bringing new people in to keep the direction of the label sort of fresh and interesting and surprising to people there's a bit of a balance really if you're constantly releasing music from new artists then the reality is is that you probably won't make very much money for a small space or medium space of time because they're not going to sell as well. But without bringing in new artists, your label's not going to sound fresh, stay interesting, and it's a constant evolution. So it's a really important balance to staying in business, to be honest with you. One of the kind of... more interesting projects or one of the more surprising projects maybe was Cassie's album. Yeah. It's her debut album. You know, she's an artist who was associated with, you know, Panorama by Resident and quite like a kind of dark Berlin sound in a way, minimal. And then, yeah, she's put out a kind of almost singer-songwriter thing. Popped up an album. Surprising to me as well at the time. Yeah, really interesting. Just tell me how that whole thing came about. Being completely honest, it came through, I mean, a few steps before that, I approached Cassie relentlessly to sing on my own music and it wasn't right for her at the time or whatever, so I've been a huge fan of her. The album came about with us was that actually it came through Luke Solomon. She was talking to Defected and they couldn't quite agree on terms or the album. That's interesting. Luke reached out to me and said, you know, put me and her in touch. And from then it was, yeah, it happened very quickly because I'm a big fan of what she does. And that's where K7 definitely helps is that. I think partly why I did the deal with them is for infrastructure they have and reputation they have as releasing albums. For us, I think perhaps if we hadn't been working with K7, we wouldn't have been able to do the deal with Cassie because she looked at ours combined with K7 in terms of what K7 had done with albums and sort of saw it as a really good fit. So for that kind of artist that... is bigger and ambitious and requires a really strong marketing team and an album pedigree from a record label, K7 definitely bring that to what we do as a record label. And where the label is at now, is there still as strong a feedback process as there used to be? Do you mean from press and people? No, I mean in terms of just from you as the label manager towards the artist. Ah, yeah, so you mean in terms of relationship with the artist. Because, yeah, obviously with someone like Cassie, there's been no sort of development for me with her. It was a finished album when it came to me. Whereas with Midland, we released its first record. It's an ongoing process of seeing them develop as producers, so it was a very different scenario. There's still a lot of that involved in what I do with the house on the EPs and everything else, and the artists for sure, there's still a lot of that with me and the guys, but in that instance with Cassie, it was a slightly different process. But also with some of the bigger artists that have been working this year, people like Paul Walford, we've got something coming out with Tom Trago. Clues, that's been very much them sending me music and me going, that's amazing, let's release it, rather than sort of, you know, obviously they're established artists. So this year we have actually worked with some more established artists, which is a conscious decision in terms of me reaching out to people to sort of just tweak the direction and the sound of the label, you know, where people were based. It was a very UK sounding label beforehand, which is completely accidental. in terms of the artist that we started to work with through that hot spell that I mentioned, whereas consciously reaching out to... In fact, that's not necessarily true because the Cassie cat happened totally accidentally. Tom Trago was definitely someone that I'd wanted to work with for a long while. Recluse is an all-time hero of mine, so that was a relationship that has developed over many years. It's just sort of... Most of the label is kind of happy accidents with some strategy loosely implemented by me. In terms of the kind of feedback sessions you might have with an artist, they might be quite interesting exchanges. I mean, how do you kind of negotiate telling an artist about their own music and having the authority to... It's a very delicate process because, yeah, obviously it's something that's very personal to them and some people aren't open to it at all. From experience, most people are always open to hearing your opinion, but they might not necessarily agree with it. But I think probably because I come from a production place myself in terms of making music, you do it very sensitively. and you can sometimes hear things in terms of an idea for a sound or an arrangement tweak that might help. most of the time people are really open to that, you know. And if it's smaller artists or newer artists, I should say, that usually they're hungry for feedback on their music and they trust you because you've been around and listened to a lot of music and they want that feedback from you. But I think as an artist finds their feet and really takes hold of their own sound, then you don't need to give them feedback. but because they're delivering great music and it's just like, well, that's brilliant, you know, done. Or maybe shorten the breakdown by eight bars or 16 bars or... you've got a bit self-indulgent with that or this and that but most of the time it's not most of the time as they develop and become comfortable in their own shoes as it were you don't really need to give any feedback who gives you feedback on your music? my wife and yeah I don't really actually that's a very good point most of my stuff recently has been with collaborators and with friends anyway so it's a constant feedback process as you're making it. Actually, yeah, Jodie, Jodie will say to me, no, that's shit or that's good or I like that. He's a pretty good sounding board for my own stuff. You mentioned that your own music, your own productions had suffered a little bit since you joined K7, but this year you did put out an EP. Yeah, EP on Compact, yeah, with Kieran Common, who's a good... Good friend, and we've got more stuff coming out together actually, but it will seem like relatively we've released quite a lot of music this year, but it's taken about three years to make the two EPs that we've released. So yeah, we've got something coming out on ours in October with a Recluze remix and something early next year on the label as well. It's quite interesting coming together, you and Common and Compact. It is, yeah, I guess quite an unexpected collaboration process. To be honest with you, I've met a lot of people that I've worked with on a number of levels over the years through Laurie Appleblim. He's kind of my gateway to, or has been my gateway the more I look back on it to a lot of people and good people. I reached out to him when I heard his mix for Temper. which was way back and that was how I ended up working with Ramadan Man and that was how I in turn then started working with Harry because David and Harry were good friends at uni together so Laurie's from Bristol, I moved back to Somerset to bring up my kids with my wife about six years ago and when I moved back he introduced me to a lot of people Jules October and Kieran were two of them and we ended up becoming friends and jumping in the studio together So yeah you mentioned Laurie Appleblim there and that you listened to his Temper CD but before that you'd kind of incorporated quite a lot of bass music into your balance mix Yeah I'm trying to think of the timings though I think no the balance mix came after Yeah, because I actually remember I had included a track called Sula Sabla by Laurie and David, which we released on house. So I hadn't really released any. I mean, I released stuff from Sideshow, which was very dubby. And, you know, I used to DJ play breaks 15 years, a long time ago, even with Simple. So I was always into hip hop and breaks before house music, to be honest. That's quite a natural connection for me. But yeah, Laurie was my first touching point to, I guess you would classify it as the post-Dubstep sound when Dubstep sort of started becoming more about, in my opinion, a little bit more musical really and soulful rather than sort of quite tear out, I guess is probably the technical description for it. I wasn't really massively into a lot of that early stuff, but when Martin and... a lot of those guys started making their sort of early forms of dubstep hybrid house whatever you want to call it um that was when i started to get really interested and i heard that through lorry so yeah lorry was my connection to that for sure i mean If you kind of take yourself back to that period, what was it that was so exciting about the music? It just sounded like people making house music that had never really listened to house music, which is a really good thing. I think whenever you get people making a style of music without any preconceptions, it works usually. They don't work in your opinion, but you always get fresh takes on it usually. That was definitely happening in that patch in the UK. when a lot of guys that had been really into going to forward and a lot of that early dubstep started discovering house and then making their own takes on just making music that they love, but it was drawing from house and very definitely from, you know, bassline-driven sound. That was creating some really lovely new hybrids. Yeah, it was kind of one of the last instances of a totally unique, fresh... sound I think I think so within within house and techno yeah for sure that's pretty fair to say I think when things started to move over more towards fall to the floor was there any kind of was there any part of you that felt sad to leave behind this kind of hybrid or leave behind a more broken style and just easing back in towards a kind of... I've always let the artist shape the sound of the label really and those guys as they sort of started... listening to more and more house and techno, that was the direction that they kind of went with the music that they were making. So it didn't happen consciously from my perspective. It just happened because the artist that we were working with started making more house music, really, or techno. But yeah, I'll always sort of love and... want to release more broken, steppy music, you know, if I find someone that I think is doing it well or in a fresh way, then I'll definitely put it out. So, but in very, you know, that was why I ended up stopping Simple Records was because, you know, the first Dusky record came out on Simple. And I felt that the labels were converging in sound and it didn't really make sense to have two labels releasing similar sort of sounding music, whereas previously they'd been quite different. It's definitely gone in that direction. Why did you stop Simple instead of stopping House? I think because the artists that were releasing on Simple at the time, Ewan Ewan, Saye, Dusky, really wanted to release on House. And it just felt natural to. It felt like more people were interested in Ouse rather than Simple at the time. I guess trends at the time were dictating that. So it felt easier to switch the guys releasing on Simple onto Ouse because they wanted to release on Ouse anyway. So it wasn't really a difficult decision to make, to be honest with you. It happened really quite organically. Looking at the artists that have released on Ouse and that you've kind of nurtured, You know, it's an incredible list. How are you finding these guys? How are you doing it? When we released the record from Joy Orbison, which came off the back of a couple of really interesting records from Appleblim and Ramadan Man, which obviously now David has become Pearson Sound. That stage of the label meant that we suddenly as a record label became really interesting and a lot of younger producers were aspiring to release on it without really... me being aware of that so when I got the first promo for Joy Orbison's Hot Flush record, I instantly reached out to him on what was MySpace at the time and said, hey, I'd love you to do something. And again, that was at the time before, well before that record had even been released. So it was impossible to tell the reaction that was going to come from that record. But instantly it sounded like nothing else out there and incredibly fresh. And he was really interested in working with us because of those records with Ramadan Mann and Appleblim. Then the George Wilbeson record came out on Hotflash, went massive, and then ours came out not long after that. And then you only need to string a couple of records together like that and suddenly you've got a lot of really interesting... I then approached George Fitzgerald. Harry's music suddenly was ready to start releasing off the back of it, development with him. The rest was just, yeah, just a happy coincidence of stuff happening at the same time. And Leon Vaino wanted to do something, and again, you know, that was one of his first records that... Yeah, I guess it was just right place, right time for a little one. But it was a nice patch of a year or so where it was really interesting. Is there anything that kind of ties all these artists together, do you think? Or anything that they, as artists, have in common? I think all of those guys that we've been mentioning now have the ability to write really strong hooks in their music, memorable hooks that stay with people. That is kind of what I'm always looking for in music is more than just a chord progression or a bassline riff, although sometimes either of those two things can be incredibly memorable. But Juz's ability to write a really memorable hook is what separates them in terms of reaching a lot of people. So that's subconsciously what I've ended up looking for in music, and I think it's probably crystallized for me as a... That's what I'm looking for. I don't have a set of rules. I just hear something and it connects to me. And I think I've realised that I'm able to hear that in people's music and identify it. It's what I like. It's what I look for. What do you think it was about, the label, and about you and House? that was attracting these artists? I think it was the fact that we were doing something pretty... With the first Apple, Blim and Ramadan Man records, they were definitely... new and unique and hadn't been done before in terms of that hybrid of house and techno and, you know, really strong baseline. The way that they were doing it was definitely fresh and unique. And I think that it was a timing thing in terms of all those kids that were going forward and listening to Dubstep by hearing something new for the first time as well. And I think that definitely resonated with them. So, yeah, it was just lucky timing. But I don't forget, I'd come from... releasing breaks and being into that sort of music rather than house music although simple was primarily a house music label and that had come from working in phonica simple had really started as a breaks label albeit at the deeper end of the spectrum releasing stuff from people like precision cuts and stuff like those guys so i'd come from really being into a break beat and a broken rhythm and that was what attracted me to that stuff with you know that problem why it felt right for me to release it on Ouse because Ouse was the offshoot to Simple which was the house label so it all kind of weirdly fit together. When they all merged into Ouse I suppose it kind of became just more of a dance floor outlook? Again subconscious it was very much we'd released albums from Lee and Lee Jones and Sideshow which still fundamentally dance music, dub disco from Sideshow or, you know, stuff that fundamentally dub music, but in 4-4. And Lee's stuff was always beautifully intricate that you could listen to at home as much as, you know, on a dance floor. So we'd always really been a dance floor-focused label, but I guess they're definitely the... the weight and power of some of those records from, you know, the Joy Orbison's and George Fitzgerald's and stuff is definitely more, it's a peak time dance floor record. Yeah. But at the time of releasing, it was still left field in terms of it wasn't a house record or it wasn't a techno record. It was still kind of a little bit left of. of what would be the norm, whereas we've almost ended up releasing the norm in terms of that's the way that the producers have gone. So it's just cycles of trends. So from the kind of post-dubstep era, Apple blimpies and sound, you then found yourself in the kind of eye of the storm of this kind of new UK house sound. Yeah, and we were there for a little while, and I guess now we've... just tried to develop more artists a lot than the UK base with, you know, with people like Fold and Shinoda and stuff, stuff like that and artists. But then other artists are from different places in the world. So yeah, I guess we've, we've naturally sort of, I'm still releasing, you know, I'm working with a lot of those guys, Bicep, Midland, but also consciously trying to bring in different sounds and. different artists so keep the label fresh what's the biggest selling record on the label ever yeah i think it'll be a toss-up probably between joy joy albertson's record and the dusky careless record digitally the dusky careless record by a long long long way yeah Because I ended up being number one on people overall people chart with people like Tiesto and stuff like Yeah, wow so that that was yeah really weird and ridiculous, but I said that were definitely best seller Dusky are a good example of someone who really have kind of caught the imagination and done a really good job of riding the kind of overground and underground. Ever since we started working with them, they've had an incredibly loyal fan base of people that buy their music. Those guys are a prime example for me of people being able to write a really strong hook, whether or not you like it or not, in terms of its commerciality. You can't argue that they're... music connects with people on a pretty big level actually we've seen that for sure just the amount of specialist radio play they've had on radio one and everything else was was we were blown away by it it's never we never had anything else like that and that's through yeah writing a really strong hook um which stood them very well i spoke to them recently and they They said that they like doing the big live shows and the album they've got now of Gary Newman and Wiley and whatever, a major label, but they also want to do the club EPs and labels like House are probably good platforms for them to do that on. Yeah, for sure. I mean, they've developed massively in terms of their ambition and the way that they've ended up releasing. The album, I can't wait to... I've heard some of it. I hope it does as well as it should do for them. Alfie is very much a classically trained musician and knows exactly what he's doing in the studio in terms of being able to craft very special records. And again, I say that it might not be your thing if you're listening to different types of music, but they've written music that has definitely continued to connect with a lot of people. I did realise that you know we had become a record label that was was definitely riding or releasing a lot of UK sounding music and I'm very proud of that in the sense that you know they're all friends and had come from a scene that I was involved in, and writing incredibly fresh music, but at the same time, yeah, if you carry on releasing the same kind of record over and over again, people will become very bored of it and won't want to buy your music anymore, so you have to kind of... try and keep surprising on a certain level I think so that's a balance for sure but at the same time you don't want to alienate a fan base of people that are buying your music but I think that's why if you just try and keep releasing music from artists that you believe in they're not going to keep writing the same record over and over again I mean if you listen to Huxley's album for us in relation to the last couple of EPs that he's released with us very, very different records. So hopefully the artists that you select can evolve over time as well. Looking at your kind of career and your output more generally, you know, you're a DJ, you're a producer. but I feel like the labels have kind of been your main focus which is rare for artists you know usually the labels are kind of a compliment to a DJ career or production career I mean why is that? It's always been a safety net for me in terms of the record labels I've always felt that it's kind of to a certain extent normal is the wrong word to describe it because running a small independent record label is definitely not a normal thing to do but it's always felt like a If I'm running a little business that gives me an element of control over generating an income for myself that gives me the security to keep doing what I love, then somehow running a record label that I kind of knew how to make work had more security than just stepping out into the abyss of producing music and seeing where it went. I've tried to combine the two definitely over the years, but I have always fallen back to the record label. So I mean, there's that in one side, but also I love doing it. I've been doing it really for as long as I can remember now in terms of A&R and music, so ever since leaving university. So it's kind of, I have probably realized how to do it and do it. relatively well so was it something that you always wanted to do was it kind of when you went to really no I mean I knew I wanted to work in the music industry because I love music and was passionate about music but I kind of I ended up starting my own record label simple because I had a really horrible boss at Sony Music and I couldn't stand working for it anymore. So I was thinking in the back of my mind it would be nice to set up a little record label and there was a couple of guys I was working with at Sony that were up for it. my mum and dad were like, well, you've not got any kids or a mortgage, so now's the time. So, yeah, I had a crack at it and managed to sort of supplement doing that with working in record stores and making ends meet for a fair few years before it was able to support me. But, no, I didn't know that being an A&R was what was going to define me in terms of what I do, but it's just ended up. I think it's fair to say that it has ended up being the case. In terms of your DJing, I mean, is it fair to say that you just stopped touring as much when the family started? Not really. I still probably average three or four shows a month, but I'm just more tactical in terms of making sure that there's always weekends off every month and always time to... never being away for too many weeks on the trot on the weekends but then at the same time I work from home and I'm there every morning you know to to be with my kids and to give them a bath at the end of the day and then put them to bed so in the week which I think the majority of not the majority but a lot of people can't do so I'm still there a lot more you know if I'm away only three or four nights a month That's not that much in the bigger scheme of things. What's the relationship like between your DJing and being a label boss? How much does one feed into the other? Pretty much a lot. It's one of the elements of what I do in terms of a DJ that has given me an edge or whatever you want to call it in the sense that I've always... got a pool of music that no one else has heard to play so there's always I would say 50% of my sets are forthcoming music on the labels that no one else has heard so there's always if you come and hear me teach you there's always going to be a lot of music that you've never heard anywhere else before because I'm the only person that has it which is quite a nice position to be in and I love that also you're testing it out to feedback to artists but also then you know You're throwing in lots of old stuff that you've loved for many years and I think that's, for me, that's a nice balance. Do you feel like you're representing the label when you play? Definitely, yeah. I think you're getting a big part of the label when you come and hear me DJ as well, for sure. So, yeah. Let's take it back. You mentioned there that you started out DJing breaks. Yeah. More broken stuff. I mean, when was your, what was your first interaction Because I grew up in the country, in Somerset, there wasn't really a club you could sneak into underage. So I had to be able to travel to get to said club, which meant 17 when I could jump into some. one's car that could drive or my parents would trust me enough to let me get on a train to London and I guess early early clubbing days were going to turn mills to hear like Chemical Brothers DJing in the but there was a really they had a really good back room called Eklektronika so that was some of my early traveling to go to clubs but yeah when you know obviously when I was growing up you literally or you the only way you could listen to new music was radio and reading music magazines reviews and hunting down that music and then trying to buy it so I mean I got turntables probably age 17 or 18 after working through the summer to get them And, yeah, as soon as I had turntables, I was then able to start tracking. You sort of build up trust in music reviewers' taste that you kind of connect with and you used to have to hunt down. Of course, they've got four or five stars, which was, when you're based in the country with no sort of online internet way of buying music, was challenging. A lot of trips to... really ropey Somerset-based record stores and just sort of pulling out bits and bobs. And there was a really good secondhand store in Glastonbury that was filled with Cannes and Vangelis and, you know, anything slightly like that, which was great. But clubbing-wise, it was getting in the car and on a train and travelling. Right. And I mean, what was the kind of next step for you in terms of your career? Getting the turntables, I always knew that I wanted to sort of DJ and put on little parties. So once I went to, when I started going to university in London, just doing little nights, promoting little nights in and around London, I think one of the first little residencies I got was playing before. the party that played before Giles Peterson's night at Bar Umbra on a Friday. So I used to literally start playing as soon as I finished work at six o'clock and play till nine. And then the party that played before Giles Peterson would start at nine. And then Giles Peterson would start obviously at sort of 11. So, but it was really good because you got the after work crowd in there just sort of fresh from work wanting. to let their hair down and you know just to play hip-hop and down-tempo stuff for a couple of hours But I did that every week for a couple of years. So yeah, just doing little parties and then got the job at Sony and started Simple a few years after that. So working at Kubla, which was the shop before Fonica during that time. And that was when I was really opened up to house and techno because you were listening to all of the house and techno records that came in. And yeah, so Simple started off before I was working at the record stores, Precision Cuts. breaks and stuff as soon as I started working at the record stores listening to all the amazing house and techno that was coming out definitely influenced the way I was sort of thinking about the labels and I got Matthew Johnson to do a remix one of his I think it's probably his first ever remix I'm hearing his first it is what it is records that came out and yeah just getting informed by working in that shop which is great So it was kind of when you were in London around uni that you decided that the music industry was for you? Yeah, I started doing work experience at Sony during my degree. So I would go in there for a couple of days a week and just make tea and lick and stick envelopes and just generally soak it up. At the end of my degree, they gave me a job as a cross between sort of a junior product manager and junior A&R for Sony International. Did that for a couple of years before getting beasted by the horrible boss. And then that was what made me leave and set up Simple. So if I'd had a really good boss, I may not have set up my own record label, to be honest with you. So it was a blessing in disguise. I mean, what were the lessons that you took from working at Sony to running your labels? It was really invaluable just from seeing how to release a record, from creating the ISRC codes to promoing a record at Radio and Club. You just saw how record was released internationally in each territory from bottom up. So it was a really valuable couple of years of learning how the record and the music industry work, really. Were there any record labels that you kind of idolised and just were the inspiration for what you were doing? In terms of my own labels, not... I mean, I had lots of record labels that I loved. It was like talking loud. Yeah, I wasn't so much... I wouldn't say I was inspired to start a record label from other particular record labels. It was more just wanting to release music and music from people that I really loved. We mentioned earlier on that you... put a record out this year for the first time in a couple of years. And in 2013 you put out your second album. It was a different project. Close. I mean, is there another album in the works? Can you see yourself doing that? Not really. I definitely don't have the time to... I have the time to sometimes jump in the studio with Kieran and friends, but since having kids, since having a second kid... My studio has been exiled from the house. Oh, really? Yeah, there's no space in the house anymore. So all my kit's over with Kieran in his studio in Bristol. So, yeah, I think probably I've got another baby on the way that's due in December. So, yes, I will make music with Kieran in fits and starts. But... I would like in maybe sort of three to five years' time, five years or so, when my wife's back fully in work, to sit around making techno in my pants and not have to worry about supporting the family as much. So I will probably become an old, graying producer, I imagine, because I would love to go back to just completely... writing music and just fiddling around in the studio, I would love to end up doing that. I will end up doing that. It's just when. How comfortable do you feel in the studio these days? Pretty uncomfortable. Yeah, just because I haven't done it, you have to be sharp with it. You have to be doing it in big chunks for long periods of time. For the last, since finishing the Close project, I haven't done anything really significantly. I've had big chunks with Kieran in the studio, but of, you know, a week here or there. Yeah. Or a week of evenings here and there, but not much. It would take me a little while to get back up to scratch. I mean, when did you first start dabbling? Probably during that period of being at uni, really. I got an Akai sampler and... and Logic Cubase actually I think I got first that was when I first started dabbling for sure you know we've had 10 years of house yep what are we what are we thinking for the next 10 years will there be another 10 years I hope so, yeah, I'd like to think so. I mean, I'm still loving releasing music as much as ever. I couldn't tell you, I never really know what's going to happen beyond the next six months. I'd like to try and release more albums from artists, but that very much depends on the music that I end up finding and whether it works in that context. Why would you like to do that? Just because it's a bigger, more challenging sort of medium and I think it's a nice way of I still believe very much in the album in terms of a way of expressing, an artist expressing themselves. How it's consumed is still very much open to interpretation. I think the whole digital landscape has shifted so that I think people, except for real probably music lovers, I think people consume albums in an album way, buy a CD and listen to it from start to finish. But I like the idea of releasing albums from people because I think it's a really nice medium of artists expressing themselves. As a label manager, how do you combat that problem that realistically maybe... just not as many people would be listening to it as would have listened to it 10 years ago. Yeah, I mean, you just have to put it out and believe in it and cross your fingers, really, in terms of you have to try and, from a business perspective, keep the costs really low in terms of not... We can't take huge risks on giving artists huge advances and letting them sit in a studio for six months off the back of that advance. It's definitely check the music, the way people make music and... So yeah, we've got to try and keep the cost down in order for that format to still be a viable option for us. But at the same time, I think if there's a way of presenting it, I'm sort of coming around to the idea in my head, I haven't really figured it out yet, but I think if there's a way of presenting EPs in an album way, so sort of spreading them out a little bit, but still getting across the artistic... idea that the artist has but not presenting it in one big chunk Yeah, I mean, how would you do that other than kind of just volumes? Yeah, it would just be volumes, but I think there would be a thread that you would explore throughout the release process so that you wouldn't maybe give away the full story at the beginning and it would sort of spread out in terms of the artist's intention of the music and the artist's idea would only really become apparent by the time you get to the third EP and it would be a way of consuming it so that you would, I don't know, I still haven't fully realised it. I mean, are you imagining the artist to present you with the full 12 tracks? You probably have the album way before, but it's the way that you would release it and the way that you would present it through press and to fans and music buyers is what I think needs to be done in a creative way. One of the artists that I manage, Buona, his record on Lucky Me was released recently on the deep web and tracks were given. It was an album that was based around Kira, the anime movie, and the whole album was made entirely from Sample the Movie. So there was a really interesting concept behind the music itself, but it was the way that it was presented. You could get a track a week via the deep web and it was just an interesting and exciting way of experiencing the music and getting the music and people really connected to that. So there's still interesting ways of releasing music but I think it's very difficult to release an album unless you're that. it swings and roundabouts I could talk about this all day in terms of you know you look at established artists and they still have a very hungry album you know Flying Lotus for example have a very hungry fan base of people that want to consume an album I suppose he's established that from the start, hasn't he? Yeah, he has. So, you know, labels like Warp Ninja that are known for releasing albums have that luxury. And I say luxury, don't get me wrong, they've worked really hard to have that luxury. Of course. And they've done brilliantly in releasing albums, but they started... releasing albums when albums were being consumed as albums whereas if you're coming into trying to release albums now without that pedigree and that reputation it's harder to do it for sure like I said we could talk about this for the rest of the day is that something you're thinking about more consciously now or are you still just yeah I'd still like to try and release albums it was fundamentally how we started or close to how we started or why I started the label with Sijo and Lee Jones Just finding the right artists that make that format make sense, I think, is probably the best way of describing it. Thank you. so Thank you. so
