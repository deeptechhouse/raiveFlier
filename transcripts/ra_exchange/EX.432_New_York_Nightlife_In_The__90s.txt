My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor of Resident Advisor. This past July, Resident Advisor's 24/7 party series touched down in New York City. Brooklyn fanzine Love Injection was tasked with presenting panel discussions covering five decades of New York dance music history. Today, we're hearing about the 90s. An era when mega clubs in Manhattan saw thousands of revelers passing through their doors each weekend. With Strictly Rhythm co-founder Gladys Pizarro, DJ and producer Lenny D, and drag superstar Kevin Avianz, R.A. staff writer Max Pearl charts the rise and fall of the city's club scene, from the community's halcyon days through to the slow decay of the Giuliani era. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange on New York nightlife in the 90s is up next. We're going to get started. I'm Paul from Love Injection. Thank you. Really. Thanks to RA again for having us. Welcome to the 1990s. In a booming economy, New York's landscape was arguably one of the most dense times in history. Mega clubs are on every corner, packing in thousands every Friday and Saturday night. Places like the Original Sound Factory, Limelight, Vinyl, Twilo, Palladium, Funhouse, the list goes on. RA's very own editor Max Pearl talks to Gladys Pizarro, co-founder of A&R and A&R of Strictly Rhythm, which many directly associate as the sound of the 90s. Rave pioneer and industrial strength records co-founder Lenny D. And dancer and performer and New York Vogue ball legend Kevin Allianz. I'll let Max take it away. Hey, everybody. First of all, thanks to Love Injection for hosting this. They put together all of the panels. They did all the booking. It's been an incredibly star-studded lineup of talks. And thanks to you guys for coming. They already did introductions. I was going to go and introduce you, but I want to just start by asking, okay, 1990, New Year, January, where are you? I'm in D.C., Washington, D.C., and I just graduated from high school in 86, so I'm in Washington, D.C. I'm jumping in and out of trash cans, trying to become the club kid, and then becoming the club kid of the world later on. And I achieved that. House music was definitely starting to boom in 1990. I mean, I remember freestyle was beginning to die down. And in 1990, there was a surge of house music. And I guess the Paradise Garage was at the end of that, right? I didn't know where that was. It was the beginning of that. And I had just started at Strictly Rhythm, and I began to sign some house records. And that's when I started to discover people like Roger Sanchez. I was already working with Todd Terry. I started working with Kenny Dope. And I was starting to go to the club that I started. to go to was Zanzibar. So that's where I got all my... Yeah, New Jersey. That's where I met Tony Humphries and that was just the beginning for me. Once I... I started hanging out at Zanzibar, like everything started to change for me in the house movement. So before I get to Lenny, I just want to ask, how did you get hooked up with Strictly Rhythm? How did that come about? Oh my God. I started off as a receptionist at Spring Records. And apparently that movement, at that time, Millie Jackson and Joe Simon, these real soulful artists. in the Midwest, like Milly Jackson, the Fatback Band, Joe Simon. Those were the premier artists on spring records. And at that time, the music was fading out because in the 80s, the New Jack Swing came, and Uptown started just signing Guy and Teddy Riley, and then Puffy came, and all these great... a new sound came in and those guys started to die down and this music started to emerge. So Mark Finkelstein, who I worked with, he was like, look, I want to remain in the business because the label I was working for was no longer. And then he saw that I was going out all the time. I was going to freestyle clubs. I was going to house clubs. And he's like... I want to open up a label. So I was like, yeah, and I need a job. So he opened up an office and we were everything. We were like A&R, packing records, doing everything, just a two-person operation. And then that was it. I was going out to clubs all the time and I was looking for the DJs or producers that were producing house music. And it took me... It took me a while, like five releases. I put out five releases until I met this guy named Wayne Gardner, and he was the one that gave me the warning, and that was the record that opened the door for me. Okay, so you were out in Jersey partying. You're in D.C. Lenny, you were down in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn? That's where I was living, but New Year's Eve in the 90s, I was in Europe, probably in Germany or something at that time because I was really starting to play in Europe. I started at the end of the 80s. I was producing all this electronic music that here in New York nobody really liked, actually. you know, I'll be honest, thank God for Europe, you know, it opened me up to a lot more than just what was happening here. And once I started, you know, I started having a lot of hits. Funny enough, I listen back, I don't know. But yeah, I had a lot of hits at this time. And then basically. I experienced, I think, electronic music in a different way than everyone here, actually, because I experienced it here in the 80s with one DJ, the fashion, all of these things. And when the 90s kicked off for me. all that superficial stuff was out the window and it was about making music and pushing electronic music beyond what the 80s was already doing. Because at the time, I produced my first record in 83 and I think I produced about 950 records, you know. So at this point, I look back at it and I said, you know, all the disco is what really got me into it. then the electronic, EBM, and early industrial. And I was young, so I started absorbing everything and everything and everything. And by the time it came to the 90s, man, I think I was... pretty well experienced in listening to a lot of music. So what I brought to the table, which was these generations before the new producers in the 90s, were not exactly into disco and all these other things. So I always felt I had a little bit of an advantage. You know, and just my hostility towards finding new music was crazy. In the 90s... really, really, really, really was the breakdown to everything. There was no more one DJ anymore. If you go to Europe, there were 50 DJs. You can call it a festival, but it was a rave. So, you know, and then this came back to New York a bit. I took all the guys that were later to become doing all the limelight. I took them with me to a club I used to resident at in London called Heaven, which was owned by Richard Branson. Funny, funny enough And yeah, I brought all the guys, gave them loads of pills and everything else that I was experiencing. We were doing parties in Staten Island that were completely packed. You know, like Manhattan didn't want anything to do with us. So when we were doing it, while everyone was doing, while I was already doing the house music, we were making parties. Brooklyn, funny enough, we're all here now, right? And a lot of music at that time was made here in Brooklyn. In fact, not too far from here. Like Mentasm, Joey Beltram, Frankie Bones, Tommy Musto, Damon Wilde. I mean, I could keep going on and on. and on. So we had this scene where it was like, we're making great music, but no one's letting us play. So we're just going to do it ourselves. Screw it. Just like what we were doing in Europe. You know, half those parties were not legal, in fact. So, you know, here, I think Giuliani and all those bastards that were running New York City fucked this country up big time, especially here. Because I felt like it took 10 years of the 90s, every party, police, this, that, crushing this music in California, Chicago. I was playing all over the country at that time. So at the end of the day, it was like, yeah, I kind of think that the, you know, I've never seen the police ever take so much attention on like, you know, and there was hip hop too. And that shit wasn't, you know, all, you know, nicey dicey either. So they were just picking on us. I think it was a little easier for them. But yeah, that's my little 90s thing, I guess. You bring up hip-hop, and one of the things I wanted to talk about is I get the sense that in the 90s, it was still sort of like a mix-up of people would play freestyle, they'd play house, they'd play maybe high energy, and a lot of people were moving back and forth between multiple worlds. I was definitely doing that. I was producing freestyle records. I did some like high energy records as well. You know, I was really, I used to work at a distributor up at Northcott distributing European imports. So that's what really got me even more motivated from doing the disco to stuff like from that. And then it started getting into like my own music, then Chicago music, all that stuff was mingling around, you know, and I was playing at roller discos back. end of the 80s, so I had a lot of, you know, I was still doing a lot of crazy things, but yeah, it was a lot of a shift. But with hip-hop, I don't know, for me, I kind of took what they were doing, really, because I said, you know, they were just making shit, stealing shit, putting it out, and it was real. And that's what we were doing here in New York and in Chicago and all these places, you know, it machine but yeah that's how we expressed it or there was some silly vocal or shit I used to rob the hip hop tracks fuck it they would rob everything too so the music itself was kind of a montage of a lot of things especially for electronic music if you go back that far you know you'll get simple tracks and then i made these tracks with frankie bones which just like dj mixes really we just like took everything we could and just made sense of it in some other way so I think the 90s were pretty creative when it comes to the music. It just kind of grabbed everything and just shoved it in. So, Kevin, you came to clubbing via the ballroom scene? No, I came to clubbing because I started in Washington, D.C. at the Trax Nightclub. I'm kind of like the traveling queen club, so I just go to all the clubs on the East Coast, starting in D.C. and then going down to Miami when Miami was hot in South Beach, and then getting my drag... I met some kids from New York that had moved to South Beach, and they pretty much got me together before I got to New York, which means, you know, makeup, hair, all that drama. I used to wear big hair and big tits and everything like that and thought I was just everything. And got to New York and found out I wasn't everything. New York became a... where I took it all off, the wig and then the... I did the club kid scene first and the club kid scene was, that's what my thing was. We had a party in DC called Kindergarten. We've bring the kids down from Project X magazine. Amanda and Michael, everybody would come down and put them on a bus and make them come down, pay them. send them back. And then we used to come up to DC, come to New York with three busloads of people to the sound factory. And that would happen every weekend. It started with just a van, then a bus. Then we got up to three buses every weekend to go to the sound factory. And that was where it all like. turned it for me. You know, that's... Then finally I moved to New York, and it was like, wow, it's hard here. It's very hard here. It's very weird here. It's very crazy. But it was so fast, and it was so different to what I was used to. And then, you know, I met some really nice kids here, and Cesar Galindo, and I had, you know, a little club kid thing on me, but I was a sound factory person. That was my whole thing. I met, well, that's how it is. So, you know, the rest. At what point did you join the House of Avians? I've been at House of Avians since D.C. So we're all from D.C. And I was discovered by a gentleman named Juan Avians. Junior did not discover me. Junior did not discover me. Junior did not discover me. Could be a good track. I'll tell you right now. Junior did not discover me. I could do it for you if you want. Junior did not discover me. It's a hit, everybody. I can tell you. Remember this day. Juan Avianz discovered me, and he said that I held something fierce, and he gave me the name Avianz, and I was to do as I pleased with the name. And I decided to change my name to Kevin Avianz. And back then, you know, queens had girls' names. So it was like, God. But I never looked fish, so it was just like, you know, which was looking female. I was always a beast looking like a woman. It was just not good. It was not cute. I was never going to look feminine. It was never going to happen. But my whole thing was that my silhouette was fish. So I like being in the dark, and there was a silhouette happening, and that's me. When the light turned on me, rawr! So that was the effect. It worked. You know what I mean? People loved it. Club kid. You know what I mean? That's how it happened. So Gladys, was Sound Factory home for you too? Is that like one of the defining? Yeah, definitely. Yeah, Sound Factory was awesome. You know, I had a relationship with Junior, so that was awesome because whenever I had any record, I just go see Junior and he'll play it. So I had a great relationship and that was definitely one of my top clubs in New York. So that was sort of part of the promo process. It's like, if Junior plays your record, it's a big tune. Yeah. He definitely liked everything I would send him. I'll send him with DJ Pierre. Any of those tracks, he just killed it. That made me cry, girl. Hello. 15 minutes of Generate Power or just anything I give him in regards to... I'll forget that. Yeah. You know. Can you tell us about Junior Vasquez's style a little bit? Like give us a sense of what made him so special. Oh my God. I just remember one day, I'll never forget. I didn't hear Gypsy Woman by Crystal Waters yet. But he played that. It's just, I'll never forget. I was on the dance floor and you hear that. And then when the beat came in, it just completely, everybody was just like, ah, la-da-dee, da-da-da. I mean, you can still hear that record today, and I still get, yeah, like my hair stand up. Because it was just the sound system like this, like the tweeter, it was just the way he played it. There was just a specific. Passion of how he took records and and and mix them for like 15 20 minutes, but I'm not brown Oh my god. Yeah like tingling It was just an experience that you had to be there to experience that. And that was just something special that Junior brought to the table. And it's unfortunate that once in a while he still plays, but when he does play and you want an amazing experience, really try and go here and play. I think, well, Gabe probably finished. He does certain parties from, like, maybe he plays once or twice a year in the city, but please don't. No, it's nice. That time, that moment, that sound system, that analog, that boom, boom, boom. It's like going through your system, and you're just like, girl, work. You know, and it's just like, you have no idea. The tracks will come in, and it'll just be like. you would wait for one record to play. That's all you needed. Your one favorite record. And everybody had the same record. So it would be like Gypsy Woman or Christian W's Feel What You Want. Oh, Lord, girl. Feel What You Want. I mean, these records were like. so iconic in hearing love dancing or devotion. I want to give you devotion, girl. I know, yeah. Just talking about it, you can see that we're still like, oh my God, you still get that chill. It's unfortunate. I mean, it's not unfortunate because you can still get that, especially overseas. There's specific clubs that still have that kind of sound system. And when you hear that record that, of course, was mixed properly, I mean, there's Francois K right there, who's one of my amazing remixers right there. I mean, I got to give him amazing credit. It's funny because I used to look at the records and be like, man, these guys are cool. And then when I actually met him, I'm like... I was like, wow, I got to meet Francois K. Like, that's really fucking cool. So, you know, it's like, it's all, again, also how you mix your record. Because, you know, in order to get that sound the way you hear it in a club, I got to give credit to those guys that... Mix the record, you know, because that's really, really important and mastering. But that's a whole different other. And they used to play the record. Like the record would start from the beginning to the end. And you would hear the whole song, whether they mixed it or not, they would always play the beginning. or play some sort of a beginning, their beginning, and then bring the track in, and then you would hear the vocals or the beat or whatever, whatever you're living for, and they would bring that song right out, and then the next record would start. There was no repeating that record again, you know what I mean? Unless it was like really, really, really, really big. You know, we got to hear that record again, but it would be like only a 45 single verse or something like that. But, yeah. So talking about remixing and labels and the label side of things, I think of the 90s as a place that you still had some major label money being thrown around and someone from the underground might be able to do a major label remix or they might get scouted and signed to a major label and there was more of a connection between the underground and the overground. Is that something that you thought was a defining fact? I mean, I'm a huge Masters at Work fan. And whenever you heard a remix by those guys, I mean, there were nine out of ten, right? I mean, there were always, like, to me, my personal opinion, they will always make these amazing remixes. And also, Hex Hector. You know, Hex Hector took an R&B song and just turnt it. Like, you know, made some amazing remixes. You know, Whitney Houston. Oh, my God, there's so many. Deborah Cox. Right? And of course there's so many others, but those are the only ones that I could think of at the moment. I was very lucky to actually have a recording career. by meeting a gentleman named Steve Travolta, who introduced me to Jharrel Black, who happens to be on Strictly Rhythm. And they brought me in and asked me, did I want to do a track? And I seen some of these little kids at the pier, and these two little kids, one Latin, one Black, and they were like in a mirror, and they were doing all this stuff to it. And they said, girl, I'm Kanti. And I was like, I just, you know wrote it down. We didn't have phones back then, so I was just like logged it. And then they asked me about, you know, do you have an idea for a song? They played the beat for me and I was like, oh girl, that beat is cunty. He said, what's cunty? And I said, well, I saw that and it was cunty. And he said, oh, well, that's too cunty. And that's how we got started in doing tracks and stuff. And then that's when I met Aura Lee, which used to work for Franco and ended up signing to Wave Music and having an album come out, A Box of Chocolates. Lenny, did you ever do any major label work? Yes, lots of work, actually. I mean, what got me into it was Francois, Jelly Bean. When I was buying records in the 80s, when I was younger, before I was really DJing, I was intrigued by what that even meant, mixing and doing all this. I knew they were DJs. So I then pursued audio engineering. I have a degree in that. So I kind of went more the music end. But that's what really got me enticed to everything. It was just, wow, what are these sounds? How are they putting it all together? I knew what DJing was because I already was starting to play. I couldn't figure out what that meant. So that's what really pulled me into it all from there. And then the remixes and all the other things. started to come over time you know i wasn't really thinking about remixes but you know when when a good band came along and i've had some really good ones so yeah for me it's kind of a personal thing with the remix i don't just take any anything i have to be able to think what am i going to be able to do to this that's not already there and so yeah i've had a lot of mixes and stuff i will say that um during the time of me recording um I remember recording the first time with Junior Vasquez and he said to me that, you can't sing your way out of a trash bag. And I was like, okay, you're going to eat your words one day, okay? So I did Conti and then I met Orly and Orly Francois. I remember working with Francois and meeting him for the first time. I've never met a man so into music the way he was. He, we did Dindada, recorded Dindada and I got to meet George Krantz, which is like, who gets to meet the guy who actually gets to do, I mean, he was very, he made sure that we got to meet to get his approval first. to see whether he liked the song or not, to even put this thing out. And I want to say thank you to Francois for that, because that was like, when George Kranz says, yeah, I love it, and you remember that day, right? It was just like incredible, you know, to see the song that we used to dance to, Dandara, that I'm actually lip syncing it in a drag show, that I'm actually doing it. And performing, and then George Krantz tells me he gives my approval for it. It was just an amazing moment. The moment, I can't... I did a remix of George Krantz's second single, so... Figured I'd throw it out there. And everyone's connected by Francois K. Yeah, no doubt. Helmut Kohlestadt. So, as mentioned in the 80s panel, I think we should talk about Giuliani. Wow. Uh-huh. Bah! Boy, you can see the microphone just went up on me, huh? So, 1994, Giuliani becomes the mayor of New York City. Right. Enacts this new campaign to clean up the city. Right. Do you feel the effects of that in the club world and in the music scene? Well, to me, it pushed everything back here like shitloads. You know what I mean? I mean... Even now you look at EDM and you just think, well, you know, that shit was happening here all over America back in the 90s, you know. But it wasn't just Giuliani. It was everybody out in L.A., man. That shit was bad, you know, cops and all these things. So I think it kind of pushed kids away from listening to it a bit. And, you know, the whole culture didn't really take off until just recently, really. So I kind of think it really pushed everything back. I mean, put everything back in the underground, that's for sure. And, you know, to make a party, you might have to get arrested for it back then. I was the queen that closed the club. So all the clubs that were open, they were running really fiercely. I was the one that was actually the last queen there. They're like the Palladium closed that one down. The sound factory closed that one down. So that's what I felt from Giuliani. I was like that queen, the boy bar closed down. I mean, but I do have to say though, like the limelight, which I was one of the residents at was pretty much, I, I don't care if Giuliani was there. When that door was shut, fucking everything went on in there between like multiple fucking, you know, juice things full of ecstasy and freaking everybody freaking out. I think that was the closest I've seen to Europe was the limelight and the whole culture, the club kids. Yeah. Yoki and all of us guys there really, you know, pushing music in a different way. Like I remember playing like, you know, T99 and Quadraphonia and all this rave music, which was really the dominant thing in the rest of the planet really at that point. I kind of felt that that was a great home base for me to come back to New York and to play all these new records that, you know, you can maybe get in one or two shops here in New York. So it was, yeah, it was like a really kind of a resistance. I kind of felt like, fuck you, motherfucker. I'm going to just make music and just go out and I don't care if the cops come because, you know, then they change these laws about selling water and all this. Yeah, I was not in the clubs. I was in the battlegrounds. So it was a little different for me. I got to say that at that time, what I could remember, there was like ecstasy overload at the clubs. And I think that really, really pissed. I don't remember if there's someone overdosed over it. And then I think that's. It was a combination of things. They didn't drink. That was it. They started charging for the water, I think. And people weren't drinking the water. So people were drying up really fiercely on the dance floor. I remember people started sitting on the dance floor. I remember the Palladium, and they're sitting on the dance floor. And I'm like, why are you guys sitting? Because they couldn't move. They were just like, catatonic, and Special K hit. And then it was like, you know. Unfortunately, we have to talk about these things because drugs who had designer drugs. the Kiki drugs, those were the cute things back then. I mean, it was just like that was the look. It was a messy look. It was for some children, yeah. But for some people, it was their way to transcend the music too. The people were there for the music. to do it. Unfortunately, people weren't dancing. They were like feeling they were all in marshmallow legs. You know what I mean? Hold on, girl. Hold on. It was very that. I just think of the 90s as a time of excess and overload and intensity. In general, across the board. And silver. Yeah, it was totally excess for sure. I did a show with the Prodigy out in England. And man, if you wanted to see kids totally excessing on fucking pills, man. It was like, pew, straight down the line. 10,000 heads right to the end. Everybody beamed. They gave me more light than the lasers out of their eyes. I was like, fuck it now. And then there was a point where if you can't beat them, join them. And that definitely made me dive further into electronic music, I have to say. It was a very... Ecstasy was a... It changed a lot of things for a lot of musicians, producers, especially in Europe, where I was pretty much... It was my home base at the time. So, yeah. You know, people used to go to the Sound Factory, and before you would get there at... 4 o'clock. You're there at 4 o'clock. From 4 to 6, that was your time to get yourself together. So literally, you would... Why are you laughing? This is true. You used to get yourself together, collect your coins, whatever, and then you go stand in line to get your la-la-la, and then you go away, and there'll be a line, really long line, and you sit there, okay, and then you wait an hour, hour and a half. That's when you heard, dun-dun, let's go, let's go. When that song came on, it was on. let's go, let's go. They'd be like, okay, all right, let's do this. And for the next 12 hours, you were like, you know. Do it. Do it to me. 12 hours. Good song. I also think of the 90s as the end of the big room era. Like, I think in New York City now, we don't get anything beyond the capacity of this. Like, even this is pretty big for the current scene. Did you guys do a lot of big room partying? Like, were you doing these, like, 1,500 capacity? Yeah, I was used to performing for at least 3,000 people. I mean, on Saturday night, that was, like, the Palladium was, like, they would double it. I mean, when they hired me at the Palladium, it was to scare the straight people so they could have the gay after hours. So I'd have to be there at 9, and from 9 to 3, I scared the straight people. And then, no, seriously. And then, literally, they told me that. And then from 4 o'clock, when the other girls would come in, the other children. Then I could be nice. But then there was a whole thing about the straight kids. Like the straight boys would like want to stay and the girls would want to go because they'd be drunk already. And it'd be like this other switcheroo. Drama, drama, drama, drama. Drama, drama. I love Jersey, by the way. In the 90s, I played a lot of big rooms. This is a club in Italy I still play. And I'll never forget it. I broke the record when I played there. I was the headliner for this party. 22,000 people in one club room. In one club? That's like a festival. No, it's a club. It's the biggest club I've ever seen. The guy who owns it, he just... crazy. He just buys things and the club has a coliseum. It has like two, three swimming pools. It's indoor. It's outdoor. But I'm talking 22,000 people inside the club. Also, that's the time of the circuit party started too. Circuit parties also started in the US. So that was another thing. Big phenomenon. The raves were happening. The gays started these things called circuit parties. They were like destination parties. And that was the botchery at the craziness. So that's... Did clubs have tough door policies? No. You know what? At Sound Factory, everybody paid $20. Everybody had to pay. But was there like, you don't get in. There was some picking and choosing going on for sure. I mean, at the Limelight, it wasn't easy to always get in there, you know, in the earlier days. But I think it got kind of easier in the end of the 90s for sure. People had to wait, especially at the tunnel, you know. I think, wasn't Vin Diesel like the doorman there? He was. Wow. He was. You heard it here first. Wow. That'll be in the book, I bet. And yeah, people have to wait. He was there, yeah. In the shelter? I mean, you had to make an effort to get to the door. I mean, I never had a problem at the door, but thank God. But you had to like, you know, I remember like the Roxy had problems with. I know all the black kids couldn't go in the club at one time at the Roxy. So if you were a black kid, you had to go with a bunch of white children to get into the club and you met your black friends inside. And that's the true story. Huh? Yeah, it's still kind of happening. So, you know, it's kind of crazy that this is 1990s and things like that are happening, but you find a way to deal with it, you know, and do it. Because you want the dance floor. In these panels, we've talked a fair amount about gentrification and rising rent prices and the effect that that has on music scenes and on nightlife. Was that something that was in your mind in the 90s? Like, were you actively thinking about how... Were you already thinking, or is that something that's... especially acute now? You're talking about, I was a black, bald-headed, not tucked, wearing high heels, a skirt, a G-string, and could not care less what people had to say to me. The only problem I had in the 90s was at the Roxy, they asked me to, the girls that were my backup dancers, they asked me, could I get white girls? And I said, they are white. They just had dark makeup on. That was the only really, that's the only kind of, because like, you know, doing Latino, black, that was like darker makeup, like that's the look. So, you know. You weren't aware of like the fact of clubs getting pushed out of neighborhoods or neighborhoods no longer being possible to party in because it was too expensive or. That wasn't in the awareness yet? In the 90s? No, no. I don't think anybody... I think that's something new. It wasn't... I don't recall any of that kind of thing. That's not what brought us service. Yeah. Let's talk about bottle service. Oh, my God. I went to a winter music conference. Yeah. I couldn't believe it. There was a club that Eric Murillo was playing. They weren't taking anybody unless you were doing bottle service. And it was a pair. It was a couple coming in, and they had to pay like $150 a person each. I've never seen that. I was like, you can't be that desperate to come to this club. We used to go get a bottle down the street and bring that in to the club. But I was like, I couldn't believe it. It was just like... I don't know what they're talking about. And believe it or not, there were people outside waiting to get in. And they were just picking people like, you know, almost Studio 54 policy. I mean, that's what I think the 90s also kind of, for me, kind of, you know, was a little different. After a point, all that because I was playing in fields, parties, in warehouses, and all these things, all that stuff, just for me anyway, wasn't really a, there was none of that. If you wanted to get a bottle. well, if you didn't bring it in the party, then you ain't got a bottle. So at the end of the day, you know, it was kind of like really you were roughing it, kind of like almost like some of these festivals, but with no bathrooms and all kinds of things. So bottles were. the least of the problem, I think, for me, you know, because the 90s for me showed that it was kind of, you know, because I was teaching a lot in Europe, it was the club thing wasn't important anymore. There were a few legendary clubs in Europe that we were playing at all the time, like the Rex Club and, you know, like I said, Heaven and all these things. But at the end of the day most of the parties were taken to the people or they were put in a location that's not supposed to have a party in it. And it's sort of like, you know, sort of kind of like hip-hop I guess in a way. That's how I kind of experienced like electronic music. I was kind of too young, not old enough, but you know, so to me like a lot of the... clubs when i was just just getting old enough every time it seemed like i was old enough to get in fucking giuliani or some motherfucker would just raise the alcohol level so i couldn't get in so kind of going to raves and all that shit kind of made more sense uh you know to me anyway but then i was old enough to drink so it's i can still made sense really i don't know it was about really more music and you'd hear all these different things from different people And so it was more cultural, I think, in a way. Like when people went to a rave party out in England, it was more like, hey, we're not hearing this music on the radio. We're not getting this anywhere else. What the fuck? We want to go see what this is. And it just overwhelmed some of these towns, you know, where they got like maybe 10 cops. What are you going to do when there's 5,000 people? Are you going to arrest everybody? You know, you to go outside of the clubs, you know, than actually in the clubs. And for me, like, the clubs in Europe at the time were kind of old. You know what I mean? Like, I was playing at the Dorian Gray, which was inside Frankfurt Airport. Like, you can go to the club, party, get them out of the club, and check into the fucking gate. And, you know... Yeah, but the sound systems were older. And I think all the new music, we were looking to get better sound systems. Let's go to a club. Let's make a warehouse. The Hacienda started out kind of that way as well. So all this stuff in Europe wasn't really coming here because we had all these great clubs. I think you guys have a better look on the clubs here. In Europe, it was kind of the opposite sort of thing. I had residencies all over different clubs in different cities. So during the week, I would either fly to Paris or fly to London or go to Atlanta, go to Backstreet or go to LA and go to Circus. So I was kind of like traveling when I was here on the weekends. And when I started gigging a lot. performing the songs and stuff. I really wasn't in New York at all. So it was kind of weird because I was just working so much. I was missing out on Saturday night because they wanted me for the Saturday night gig. at these other cities so it's kind of like i kind of missed that whole i guess the end of like 90 no yeah like 99 i missed because it was just i was working too much so i wanted to ask you about the the ball scene um The ball, okay, so the thing about the ball seeming me, I walked the ball in 1990 before I moved to New York. And we, the House of Advance, we got on a van, we came here, and I walked the ball at the Mark Barroom in Junior Square. And it was for the extravaganza ball. And we worked, me and my... my friend, my co-house person, whatever. We walked Butch Queen up in drag and we thought we were so fierce and they said to us, giddy up, giddy up, Clydesdale, Linda Blair, Linda Blair. And they chopped And I was like, oh, no, we are really made. We need to go back and redo this. This is not cute. And then I never walked the ball until then. My thing in the ballroom is that I had Kunti. Kunti became a femme queen, a song to show gender. I mean, it was just like feeling Kunti was like a... feeling was the thing. That beat was Masters at Work and it was the ha dance and stuff and then Kunti, the word Kunti became such a scandal to people that it kind of like liberated a lot of people and then when I did Dindada it became the new way of Vogue and that song actually changed hand performance and so that's my them writing my name in the history of the ballroom. I didn't get my 10s until many, many years later because I have to get my 10s. I had to get my 10s because here I am. I'm part of a community that I really wasn't walking in, even though I was Kevin Avianz and I was representing for all my brothers and sisters. But at the same time, it was like, you know, they used to call me the Uncle Tom Drag Queen because I was the only, you know, the black girl, the black. Queens to sit and, you know, performing for all these, you know, white, you know, big dance floors. And a lot of people didn't like that or didn't understand me, but they didn't understand that I was, you know, that was where the money was. And so that's where the money was. And they got it. You know what I mean? It wasn't about black or white for me, but. When you're being called that and you realize that, wow, these kids are... Because they weren't accepting everybody into the clubs back then. You know what I mean? It was very, very, very different. Eventually, people started going to clubs. You have to understand, there were black clubs back then. There were black gay clubs. Latino clubs. And so everybody went to clubs and they were comfortable for them. You know, when they went to the big clubs, it was just like, you know, okay, let's venture out. This is different kind of music. Wow. This is, you know, it was just different times. So, yeah. So I think we have like five minutes left. So I want to ask. Looking at this now and the current landscape of what's going on, how do you feel the health of the scene is in comparison to what was happening in the 90s? Well, you can't really compare the two, really. It's just like comparing the 60s and the 70s, really. So I think it's healthy now. I see Brooklyn really happening. I haven't spent too much time in Manhattan as of lately, so I'm a little unsure. This generation has really, you know, I mean, look around you, you know, you're in a different space, you're feeling different things. And I think there's a lot of these bars and a lot of trendy things that are happening. And I think it's really good. And, you know, back in the day, you wouldn't hear all this different kinds of music. You can hear, how's this? go techno shit even hardcore here now so so you can hear all this different music everywhere where in the 90s i felt like you had the you had the clubs and that was where you would go you know it's it wasn't like oh shit i'm going here in brooklyn i mean unless you were doing rave parties or something in the 90s the clubs were really really good here um you know it's just that the 90s itself you know like For me, anyway, it was about kind of breaking the mold of everything before. It just felt that way anyway. I don't know if I did it or not. I tried. So, yeah, I think it's healthy as hell here. I mean, look at output over in Williamsburg. That shit's pumping. I played a couple weeks ago, and it was great. So, you know, you couldn't think in the 90s you'd go to, like, a little place in Brooklyn and think there'd even be people there. You know what I mean? So the limelight, all the big clubs, they, you know. So I think it's coming good, I think Of course, you can't even compare. There's just no comparison from the 80s to the 90s. to today. I mean, I'm happy that I was able to experience the 80s, the disco era, the freestyle, the hip-hop, the house. And of course now it's not the same, but it's evolving and they're doing their own thing. And I see that the future is going to be bright in terms of the... house community, the house, the house hits, they're going to do their own thing and they're going to experience their own, you know, their own productions and values or, you know, whatever they're going to do. And it's the way the kids consume music now, too. They actually want to go out and hear this. But in the 90s, hit or miss, you know, like I'm talking the majority, you know, you had your people into it. But now it seems to hit much wider. group of people. And it definitely came back. I was waiting. I was like, you know, because the EDM movement came and then I was like, oh man, when is house? What's going on with house? And definitely the house from the 90s is almost what's happening now but kicked up a notch and um and it's good to see that there's a there's all you guys enjoying it um and Brooklyn is definitely happening not happening like before it was in Manhattan but you know you guys got it going on over here so yeah I see that the future is bright for you for the house community um I don't understand what's going on at all um Oh, really? I am someone that's just like, I want to walk into a place and feel the beat and be taken over by it and feel it and go home and go, girl, that record turned me out. I don't get that anymore. So now, but recently, recently, this man right here, him, that guy right there, I swear to you, God, even though it was an old record that I heard forever, I literally cried on the dance floor. And I haven't cried in so long. And it was so beautiful. So incredible. And I just want to say thank you for that night. What I will say to you is that, you know, a lot of art, a lot of beauty, a lot of really incredible stuff can come out of the club. don't give up on the clubs. Don't give up on the spaces. Don't give up on yourselves. Don't be so, don't be so just like, you know, don't, when you see a fierce queen or you see if someone are being artistic, go up to them and say, you like it or say you don't like it. Give them some response. They need that. That's what, that's what makes the energy, you know, don't be rude and nasty. But at the same time, You know, they're being a visual for you. They're giving you something. They want to know what's going on. Now, we do that all the time with Facebook. Stop doing the Facebook thing. Stop doing the thing. It's something about this meeting people. Music and dancing and touching and getting on the floor and grooving. Get off the damn phones. Take the phones and stick it up your butt. I swear to you, God. That phone is the worst thing in the whole world. Leave it at home. The clubs need to take the phones from everybody, lock them up, and call it a day. That's what will save the clubs. Get off your phone. Stop Instagramming. Keep it personal for yourself. If they had pictures of all what we did in the 90s, none of us would be here. We'd be in jail. Well, that's something I wanted to touch on, too. The 90s visually is really underrepresented. across, I mean, if you guys would have even seen the parties that I've been playing at that are not even, like, filmed, you know? If you think about the technology, right, if you wanted to film that good, the frickin' camera was like this, you know what I mean? It wasn't like a little cell phone. So this generation's getting a lot of visuals. In the 90s, you didn't see... If you saw a camera coming, you'd be like, oh, girl, all You know what I mean? It was like crazy. But I think that's one of the problems that I have. That's one of the problems right now. You know, you don't get to enjoy the sound. I mean, you don't get to enjoy the party because you're constantly looking at the DJ and you're taping it. So it's funny from the perspective of the DJ looking at the crowd, instead of dancing like how we used to do, everybody's like this. I mean, the whole scene. If you're at a nightclub, okay, and you're there for anything else but just to dance and listen to music, take your butt home. Give the space to somebody that wants to be there, okay? I'm serious. Yeah. Like, just leave it at home. Because if you come to the club to release yourself, take it to the dance floor, and then feel something, and just let it go, so you can be up in the next moment, fine. Come to the dance club. Otherwise, come on, y'all. Really. Think about it. Come to a club. Get sweaty. Yeah. You know, lose some of that out of your body Get into the music, get into the DJ, get into what's around you, and stop bringing your world when you can live in another world and separate it and just, like, come on. Life has got to be so mundane if that's the case. If you're not really taking hold of these nightclubs, you know what I mean? Like, you have got to... We need you. They need you. I need you. Your brain holds these elements way better than a picture. You'll always remember a great night in a club in your head. A feeling will always be there with you. That's why we can still talk about it. That feeling will always be there, girl. That feeling will arise. One more thing I wanted to say. I lost my train of thought. Because you were feeling it, girl. That was the 90s. You were feeling the moment. You got to pay to You were feeling a moment, honey. It's real. It's real like that. I'm going to leave us on that inspirational note. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Come on, come on, come on Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
