Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. back for another edition of the RA Critics Roundtable. This time around, I'm joined by news editor Will Lynch, who just arrived back from a vacation in New York City, where I followed with rapt attention his visit to Katz Deli via Twitter. Will, can you tell us a little bit about the most surprising thing about Katz, in your opinion? Well, I guess if I'm being honest, the most surprising thing was the price of the pastrami sandwich, which was $16.50. But at the same time, I don't want to say really anything negative about that place because it was incredible. Pastrami was... Completely lived up to the hype, which while I was in Miami doing the piece with Seth Troxler, he and Bill Patrick, for some reason, were on a pastrami kick and wouldn't shut up about it. So when I went to New York, that was kind of my number one tourist destination. I had to check out this pastrami sandwich. And, yeah, it completely blew away my expectations. Sounds like quite a sandwich. Yeah, it was a hell of a sandwich. They are big sandwiches, right? I mean, 16 bucks, kind of two people can eat one? Yeah, I split one, and then they give you some really surprising pickles, two different kinds, each with very complex flavors. Yeah, the only problem with Cats was that I was, you know, everyone I met, I was raving about Cats, like, oh, man, Cats is so great. And I thought I was talking about the musical. They would say, like, really? Like, yeah, you didn't strike You're like the cats. The other voice you just heard is Phillip Sherburn, an RA staff reviewer who's off to Menorca in a little bit for vacation as well. Phillip, if I remember... a long time ago on your blog you talking about the record shop scene there yeah amazing what what is there one you can tell us about well no i'm not going to tell you about it because because you know then you might uh go there before me but there's a couple great shops i mean there's a there's there's a couple thrift stores then there's there's this weird uh little shop in in maun and it's like uh of a sewing machine shop and a record shop but i mean it's you just walk in and it's like sewing machines all over the floor it's hard to find anywhere to actually put your feet and then anywhere there's not a sewing machine there are crates and crates of records and it seems like he has you know the stock of a record store that went out of business um i don't know 30 years ago they they have a bunch of classical they had I don't know, like 30 copies of the Superman 2 soundtrack and tons of disco. I mean, I bought like Ashra records and some like cool synthy krautrock stuff. And then like a lot of disco I didn't really know, but just look. like it was worth taking a risk on. I mean, a lot of kind of weirdo Italo stuff. And yeah, made some scores. So clearly you need to bring an extra record case. Definitely. This time on the Critics' Roundtable, we're doing three topics. First up, we're talking about booking. We'll be joined by Goli of the Geist Agency here in Berlin to talk about the artist she represents and what sort of challenges she faces. phases with her job. Next up, we're in conversation with Ewan Pearson about the idea of a career in the DJ world and in an industry so concerned with the new, how do you sustain one? Last, we'll talk about 2012 and what's been particularly exciting and interesting thus far. So sit back, relax, and prepare to get a bit nerdy. We're joined by Goli from Geist Agency. Thank you for joining us. I appreciate it. I guess I just wanted to start with a very simple question. What does a booking agent do? Oh, a booking agent. Well, I guess it depends on the type of booking agent, but... Just a dry definition is someone who finds gigs for artists and makes sure the artist has a full schedule and does everything that needs to be done so that the artist can get to his gig and perform successfully and get home. without any problems. Are you doing a lot of pitching artists or artists coming to you? I mean, how would you pitch an artist? Do you need a booking agent? Like, at what point do they need one? I don't really do that so often. Usually I'm already really, really busy. I only really do it in very, very rare occasions and only if I really have the feeling that the artist is going to be a good fit. I say I'm not into headaches. Artists can be headaches if you're not on the same wavelength on a lot of things. Me personally, I'm not really the type of agent who will go around and scout and look for new talent all the time, partially because I want the agency to stay small. We're a boutique agency. I don't want to have 50 artists on the roster. I want to keep things manageable, personal. It's kind of like Jerry Maguire. Yeah, Philip mentioned this earlier. How did you amass all the sort of personal relationships necessary? Like how did you get to know so many promoters and people working at clubs and everything in order to make it possible to be a booking agent, to have all the connections? Oh, well, I was, before I became a booking agent, I was the first. first official Cocoon employee, Sven Veit, who I owe a lot to, asked me to take care of, well, co-pushing and co-creating the brand Cocoon with him when... Cocoon didn't really exist. There was a logo, and then there was Talita and Katrin, who's doing Clonk right now, and they were doing Sven Fate booking. That was what it was called back then. So I was in Frankfurt for, I think it was, gosh, I'm so bad with years, late 1998 or 1999 until 2001. And then through that, I just met so many people. Part of my job was, you know, introducing the brand Cocoon worldwide, traveling with Sven for, you know, a part of the time, was in touch with tons of promoters. I wasn't doing any bookings, but the mission was to introduce Cocoon and introduce... that type of music that we thought was quality music back then and break that in into the world of progressive house and trance that had basically taken over all of the UK. and everywhere. So I already had met a lot of people and knew a lot of people, was an active person in the scene before I started becoming a booking agent. That really helped. And how did you get started as a booking agent? I mean, it's unlike, you know, being a musician where you just do your thing or being a promoter where you get a space and you start booking parties. I mean, is that... you're going in between sort of two entities, right? I mean, how do you get your first artist? How do you start making relationships? I never wanted to become a booking agent because I was, well, part of my job was also to program the Cocoon events, and through that I was working with a lot of booking agents. and some of them were okay, and a lot of them I just thought were not okay. It was difficult to work with them. There were double bookings, you know, messes, et cetera, et cetera. I don't really want to get into detail. So it was never my dream job. When I left Cocoon, I basically had artists who were... looking for some type of booking plus situation. It wasn't just booking, having like this, you know, conventional booking agency, well, sorry, artist-agent relationship, but someone who can, who has, you know, a little bit more know-how and can consult. help them through, you know, different stages and different levels of, of their career. And I had a few artists come up to me, um, and. They basically persuaded me to start a booking agency. You said booking plus. So, I mean, a lot of what you do is also offering advice on, like, where to release things and, like, when they come to you or, like, you know, you need to have more releases, I can get you more bookings and things like that. Just general career advice as well. Well, I mean, I think a lot of artists that want to work with me personally know that I have a very specific way of working. It's more about quality than quantity, and I pay a lot of attention to longevity and making the right moves, maybe waiting a little bit, but then working with the right promoter, playing. It's a game. You just have to play your cards seriously, but smartly, and make sure you're not. messing around with anyone and you know you have to protect the artist's image so it's not just booking gigs and making sure that someone's playing somewhere and making some money you know it's about creating long-lasting relationships with promoters who are going to book the artist again who are hopefully going to fall in love with who the artist is as a person and that can turn into something beautiful later on and you know, kind of sustain itself. So yeah, a part of that does mean that the artist would have to listen to the agent and take advice. Otherwise, it's just, for me personally, it's, I can't even work with somebody who doesn't, who can't be bothered to listen or is like, you know, an unexperienced artist who thinks that he already knows the answers to everything because it's, I mean, sooner or later it just ends up in us parting and our relationship hitting, you know, a dead end, so. What's one of the most common things that an artist, you keep finding yourself having to tell them, you know, the thing that they don't know coming in about? you know, the business. Oh, wow. Right now or just generally? Sure, right now. Right now, nothing really. I'm really blessed to be able to work with a roster of artists who are very conscious of what they're doing and don't have any crazy expectations or misunderstand the market or misunderstand their position or compare themselves with others. and all those things. So I don't really have to go through the painful process of telling people this is actually what's happening. This is what you need to be. You know, we don't really have conversations like that so much. So there was a time in the agency where I was. working with a few artists who were difficult to manage, and there are tons of different things that, and most artists don't want to hear it, and a lot of artists, that's basically the end of the working relationship, so it's tricky. In terms of... You said comparing to people that you shouldn't be comparing to or like unrealistic expectations. So that was something in the past that you had a lot of and that you were dealing with. Yeah, you know, artists come to an agency, they think the agency is doing really well, they think you're a hardworking agent, and they have one release, and you sign them, and we don't work with contracts, it's, you know, a good faith relationship. a lot of them just become complacent. They can't even be bothered to do press pictures in a year. They don't create any kind of buzz around their person. They can't be bothered to pay a press agent to do anything for them. They just sit around and wait for things to fall in their laps. And that's just a... a very general global syndrome that, you know, it's just people are can be very, very lazy, and artists are, you know, no exception. Do you think artists don't understand, or maybe I shouldn't put it that way, but do you think artists need to be able to market themselves for something more than they realize at first? Well, yeah. I mean, artists that can't market themselves or aren't marketable by... the press or their label are more likely to not succeed, you know, in comparison to artists who are easily marketable. It just really depends. There's, you know, people ask what's the key to success for artists. There's so many different factors. There's, you know, there's luck, there's... There's, you know, the contemporary sight guys, the magic that's going on, other artists, what are they doing, what kind of person you are, you know, what you say in interviews, when you release your stuff, what you release it on. There's so many things. There's just not, you know, one. basic formula that you can stick to and then be like, I'm doing everything right. I'm definitely going to make it. And then also there's also the question of how do you want to make it? Do you want to be respected? Do you just want to make money? It's complicated. Do you get a lot of artists trying to get signed to your agency? Do you have people sending you demos the way they would to a label? Yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot, yeah. Do you let them down gently? I do, yeah. I'm very honest with all of them. I tell them we don't have the capacity, and 99.9% of the time it's true. don't have the capacity, don't want to really, you know, decrease the level of service we're giving the artists that we're already working with and are committed to. So unless, you know, and also there's, you know, the occasional artists or artists that you make room for because what they're doing and who they are is so exciting to you. that you just make room for them, and it just comes naturally if that's what you do. But those are exceptions, and it doesn't even feel like work anymore, but it's not like that with every candidate. Who's a recent artist that you brought on that you said, I have to work with this person that will make room? I'm not actually. I'm in the process of talking to a few people that it's not, I can't really disclose any information right now, but it's basically always, you know, me feeling, you know, observing an artist for a while, realizing, you know, taking a look at how they perform, what kind of people they are. how they present themselves with interviews, meeting up with them, you know, even if it's just for dinner. And then if I have the feeling that this could actually really be a good working relationship, then I take the step and, you know, I'm kind of the person type. a person who will give all if I think that, you know, it can be a success story. And otherwise, it's just doesn't really make sense. It's the type of relationship where the fit has to be extremely good. And then it can be a really great relationship. Otherwise, you know, it's just going to be another artist talking behind. how many artists do you guys know who talk behind the backs of their agents and agencies? It's just a regular thing people do. And I don't know, my artists might do that as well. I try to avoid that by making sure we keep the environment, a healthy environment with who we work with. Since you are active in the United States, I was curious what changes have you seen in the last couple of years? There's so much hype around electronic dance music or EDM in North America. How is that impacting your own business? Are you getting more offers from bigger festivals in the States? I mean, what's really happening there? There are offers, and let's say somewhere like... It's kind of crazy because, let's say, four or five years ago, a city like Miami, nobody would have thought that it was going to turn into the hub of electronic dance music. A club like Electric Pickle has become the go-to place for clubbers. The parties are always amazing. The vibe there is great. New York... You know, it used to have a dry spell. I don't know, three or four or five years. Artists always used to come back from the U.S. and say, gosh, can't wait to go back to Europe. You know, the parties are boring. So now there's definitely a lot of new movement and more opportunities for artists to play. And, you know, the market is probably realizing that there's money to be made, and with that there's more. There's more drive to make events happen and to book artists and more. Promoters are becoming more daring and sponsors are becoming a little bit more willing to spend money on, I guess, the dance music scene there is what Europe was like 15 years ago where there was a lot of sponsorship money for festivals. So the roster that I take care of, though, doesn't really, none of the artists would want to or actually would ever get requested for, like, let's say, you know, 60,000-person floor at the Electric Daisy Festival. So it doesn't really, you know, affect us. But it does seem like there's a shift there. I mean, you know, Electric Daisy, like I think Richie Houghton's doing this year, he's doing his own stage or something like that. Ultra Music Festival had, you know, Jamie Jones. They had Maya Jane Coles, people that a couple years ago I wouldn't. and necessarily seen in that context. For sure, yeah. Cassie, you know, so I would assume there must be some kind of shift for you in terms of at least the number of calls you're fielding from the States. No, for sure, for sure. But, you know, I heard this year that, you know, the Ultra Festival, I heard a lot of good things, but I heard that the turn up, the amount of people. you know, the clubbers, and you can probably confirm that because you were there. I didn't go there myself. Most of the people who played there that would have easily filled, you know, larger floors at dance festivals in Europe ended up playing for, you know, 200 people in a tent that was, you know, set up for, I don't know, 3,000, 4,000 people. So there's wrong placement. Yes, there's a shift. There's a lot of things that are moving around and trying to figure themselves out right now. But it's good. We'll see where it goes. Well, first of all, I can confirm you're basically right. Ultra is interesting. They had one stage that was weirdly like they got it. Like it had space for maybe 400 people in the audience. It was more or less the kind of size venue these artists would normally play. But then there was also a bunch of them got booked in an airplane hangar early in the day. Would, I mean, do you ever run into the choice of you could give them this kind of dry gig and they would have an incredible fee or you could have them play something a little cooler? All the time. And is that ever a hard decision? No, no, no, no, no. Well, it's because of the roster and the people that I take care of. They always go for the vibe first. Obviously, we try to make sure that they don't miss out on good income, but they're always more interested in a good party. an audience that they can actually intoxicate with their music instead of playing for, you know, a bunch of people who couldn't care less. Or that occasion, those occasions happen so often these days. And that's the, you know, consequence of. electronic dance music becoming so big. There are all these huge offers for artists who don't fit or don't work in a room for 5,000 people at a festival that's catering to kids that want to go and listen to Skrillex. doing those things once in a while, artists end up doing them, and they take home the money, and they're like, okay, the money was good, but I just really felt like a douchebag playing there for no people. One of the artists that I feel like is really interesting that you represent is Nicholas Scharr, and it seems like he's playing more and more places that aren't club spaces, and I wonder if that's... hard or interesting for you to like figure out you know where to try to place him sometimes and because he's trying to do slightly different things and different with a live band as a live act yeah well when nico started out um most of his live set consisted of you know um his edits and the tracks that he had released that people, you know, a lot of music that went into that disco-y, slow-mo, but, you know, very danceable kind of vibe. And then he released the album on Circus Company. and the album was so slow, and he needed to promote that kind of music, and then the question came up, how do I promote the album, playing the type of music that's on the album within a normal club context, and then we just had to shift it, and then overnight, basically, he came up with the idea of the band, and... Within two or three months, the band was formed and they were rehearsing. And I think it was four months or five months after that, him and the band, Dave and Will, were playing for 6,000, 7,000 to 12,000 capacity floors. In Europe, the acceptance was huge. People were really up for it because the album obviously did so well. Nico already had a profile where people were expecting the live show to be something spectacular. And so it wasn't, I mean, no, it was just, it was a necessity and it doesn't even seem like it was such a challenge anymore because... It made sense and we did it and it worked out beautifully. From your perspective or in your role, is there an important difference between booking a live act versus a DJ? Well, you just have to pay attention to different factors. The sound is more of an issue with a live act. What time the live act plays, who plays before and after the live act. There's a tiny little bit more logistics that you have to pay attention to in comparison to a DJ. But with our DJs, we place them very, very carefully as well. Like I said, the roster is just, we have a bunch of very, very picky artists who really, they are, they're not about going to a party and just picking up the money and going home. They're about going to a party and actually creating an experience and going home and feeling like, okay, this made sense. We were able to communicate with people musically and you kind of have to create that scenario. with the promoter. This is also another reason why I don't really like, Geist doesn't work with sub-agents anywhere in the world. a point to work with promoters directly so that the exchange of information is on a one-to-one basis. I know exactly what's going on, where the artist is going to be playing. If there's a change, the promoter updates me. If we don't like the update, we move the date to another date. Things don't happen without us knowing. So yeah, we're very, very picky. And that's also part of, you know... Being boutique, you get to be picky. You have the time to be picky. Once you're too busy, you can't be picky. And that affects the quality of what you're doing and what you think you should be doing within the context of the vision you have for your artists. And all the artists that you take care of, they're different. They have different needs. They have different dreams. They're different people. Is there much consolidation happening in the industry right now in terms of big agencies buying up other agencies and that kind of thing? I mean, are people trying to buy you? Can you just do your thing as a boutique agency? Oh, yeah. Yeah, no one's ever contacted me to buy. That'd be funny. but it hasn't happened yet. No, they just go, there's some agencies out there right now who are realizing there's a lot of potential. There's less potential in rock than there is in electronic dance music. What they're doing right now is they're expanding or building up their electronic music departments. I don't want to name any agencies, but there's a lot of artists who've been... you know, um, signed to these bigger agencies that don't really have much experience or any know-how. And they all work with sub agents in different countries. Um, I don't know what that's all about, but it's, it's interesting. What, um, potential problems for the artists do you think that could create? Well, I mean, at the end of the day, I always say it's not necessarily the agency you sign to. It's the agent that you work with. So if you're working with an agent that's smart and really cares about you, the agent will still. end up, you know, doing a good job for you and making sure you're not missing out on anything. And we'll try to make sure you're not running your career against the wall. But, you know, the danger I see is that a lot of these bigger agencies, there's just not so much. The personal relationships that promoters need with agencies or agents are missing. Things become more of a business transaction, which is fine for a lot of artists, and I'm not going to judge that. But for other artists, it just doesn't really work. I guess what they're doing is these bigger agencies are hiring different sub-agents that know what they're doing in each territory, which basically just adds to the number of people who are working for you. So in my opinion, there's a huge source. of error or confusion and uh just like a logistic tongue twister logistics connected to having 15 different agents in 15 different European countries working on an artist and not stepping on each other's toes and all the cross coordination just thinking about it gives me a headache not be something that I would ever remotely go close to Bigger agencies have bigger structures, I guess. That's how they like to work. It's very hard to introduce this topic, I guess, because it's a wide-ranging one, but we're joined by resident Twitter comedian, Ewan Pearson, and we're here to talk about... careers in general in electronic music, I suppose. You recently wrote an article for your regular groove column about sort of just recently a couple people died. So we're kind of reminded of in general. It's been a somber few weeks, actually, because pretty much every week when I've been getting ready to DJ, I've been preparing some kind of memorial. Tune or tunes or edit or something. You know, there was MCA, of course, a couple of weeks ago, and then there was Donna Summer last week, and then there's Robin Gibb. just a couple of days ago. So it's kind of, yeah, it has been sort of, it has been a peculiar few weeks in terms of that. And also, I guess, the last couple of years, there's been lots of people. I mean, there's been some very sad and untimely deaths. There's a friend of mine, Kenny Hawkes from the UK, who used to be one of the resident DJs at Space. And, you know, it's really... DJ with Luke Solomon, a good buddy of Luke Solomon's. I've just done a remix, actually, for Classic, which is a sort of... a release that Luke's done, which is essentially a kind of in memoriam to Kenny records. So it's, yeah, I mean, I guess it's partly a function of our age, you know, that none of us are getting any younger. And also dance music isn't getting any younger in the sense that it's in its, I suppose we take it from the start of disco. We're going back to, you know, it's in its fifth decade, you can say. It really seems like though that. Right now you're getting this first generation of people who are dying of old age. Yes, you're looking back and taking stock of careers and Obviously, people have been writing about dance music for a long time, but it seems like this moment where we're really taking stock of things and trying to define careers and what a career is. Yeah, I mean, it partly is the periodizing thing. And that sort of, I mean, that set in even 20 years ago. Each time you get an anniversary, you get that kind of... that instinct and now there's this whole thing of yeah i mean it's i guess if you think about the way pop music started and when pop music started it was very much invented for teenagers you know it was a new form for a new a new concept you know the idea of the teenager that the teen as a specific age was a kind of was a new idea in the 40s and 50s and um And then as kind of pop and later rock got older, the idea of being an older, a middle-aged person or an older person involved in that job has become less. appalling and ludicrous. Although I think we're still, we culturally are still suspicious of it in a sense. I mean, all of the jokes about Mick Jagger. Yeah. And it's also different for men and for women. I mean, you know, with Madonna having nothing to do with the merits or lack thereof of her new album, you know, a lot of the hate was focused on what is this 50 year old woman thinks she's doing? Oh, absolutely. It was misogyny, just plain and simple. Right, which is what Mick Jagger doesn't get when he's wearing some tights also. Oh, yeah. I mean, you know, people who are aging have it harder than most, and women have it, you know, as usual, about four times as hard as men. So, yeah, that's definitely, definitely an issue. But I think, I mean, if we are not, I mean, I think if... hopefully the slightly more enlightened of us are thinking in terms of there are lots of role models in terms of pop and rock and even electronic music and people who are ageing and making fascinating music into their 40s, 50s, whatever, you know, lots of kind of... lots of Germans. I'm thinking about people like Wolfgang Voigt and Gudrun Gurt and people like that. Eno's still, you know, it's Harold Eno. Is he... How do you age gracefully, then? How do you age gracefully then? Wolfgang Voigt takes it back and does limited edition releases. I think somebody like him, he thinks about it in the way, say, a fine artist would. I think he just gets on with doing his thing and pursues his interest in it. in a consistent way over time as his curiosity takes him. I mean, I think if you're looking for sort of tips, I mean, I think the sort of classic things are stay interested, you know, stay aware of what's happening, but not beholden to it necessarily. Partly because people can tell, I think, with your sort of... I think people can tell if you're just kind of peddling quietly to try and keep things going. I think they can tell if you're not really interested and you're just repeating what you've been doing in the past for its own sake. One thing I was thinking is the people that you mentioned, like Wolfgang... King Boy and Gudrun Gud in a way they have it a little easier than some other artists because they're quite plugged into sort of an art form that doesn't have to take place at 6am in a nightclub but do you think it's a lot harder to age gracefully if you're primarily a DJ? In terms of not having to stay up late and not getting much sleep well I definitely feel that I definitely always have to go to bed for a bit before I have a late night and then go to bed again very early the next night. You were asking for pizza around five in the morning. I was. I did eight hours of Panorama Bar last week and I was fine, but apart from about half past four in the morning, I got really hungry. And you were on Twitter asking for pizza. That was my, that was, yeah, I broke the never DJ, never Twitter when you're DJing rule in order to make Did you get one? I had a few drinks at that point as well. No, sadly, sadly not. I survived on fumes. I think, I mean, I think, again, there are lots of successful DJs who are in their, certainly in their 50s. Carl Cox, Kerry Chandler came back. How old's Harvey now? He must be pushing. Pushing 50. Andrew Weatherall. Soon, if not yet. Sorry, Andrew. I hope he never hears this. I'm sure he won't hear it. But again, somebody like Andrew, I think he's a brilliant role model in terms of how to stay... interesting and interested in your career. Every time that he's... I think every time he's figured that people have got him down and sort of know exactly what he's up to and what he's about, he makes a little shift. And he's sort of... He's changed in terms of the styles of music that he's been interested in and that he's produced. And he's kind of made these little shifts throughout his career. and not in a kind of opportunistic way. in a, oh, I'm going to do this now way. And he's, I mean, I think he's a brilliant role model in terms of how to carry on just doing it and stay relevant and stay vital. He's my sort of, he's my role model in that sense, I think. Something I think is interesting about the electronic dance music scene right now is it may, I mean... I'm probably overgeneralizing, but I do think it's the first time that we've had kind of multiple generations of fans and artists kind of coexisting to this extent. I remember a couple years ago before the boom right now, especially the American boom, I was thinking to myself, wow, like the dance music scene is aging. You know, everybody I know that's into house and techno. is basically of my age. We're all getting older. I didn't see any new blood. I didn't see 16-year-old, 18-year-old kids getting into the scene. I thought the whole scene is going to be a dinosaur. And all of a sudden you have this infusion of young blood, to put it. in a vampiric metaphor. And I think that's interesting. That's odd. It's something that we haven't really seen before. Yeah, I mean, in terms of, I can only say anecdotally from traveling and stuff that I still see a lot of quite young. crowds so it's sort of i don't know i mean it's it's hard that i mean it it seems to be expanding but again i would say that was a function of yeah partly just a function of the fact that it's it's an aging thing but there's definitely but there'll definitely be this massive infusion now i guess but it's not like a music of one generation you know like 60s rock and roll was the voice of a generation you can't say rock well is now and i think the interesting thing about pop was always that it actually you know the best pop appealed to seven-year-olds and grandparents and and everybody in between and that's the thing it was what that was actually you know it was only really the realm of the teenager a fairly short period of time that kind of exploded but um yeah i mean in terms of dancing and whether it's been socially i mean you know social dancing was always kind of was always the preserve of lots of different ages as well you know um and you still go to places like i don't know go to spain and go to places where people are kind of like seriously going out dancing obviously it's in different styles and stuff like that but they're you know of all ages and this idea that only young people should be allowed to go and dance to music certainly isn't the case well I guess something that I'm sort of surprised by your responses. It seems like you really don't think that the situation of a club is an inherently young thing or that, you know, as a grown person, you can go clubbing with dignity or something. Well, maybe I'm just in denial. I mean, I've only just, it was my 40th birthday at the start of last month. So maybe I'm going through that kind of, you know, the growing a ponytail, getting a leather jacket kind of phase. They're like, if you see me riding around Berlin on a Mahali or something with like a 17 year old on the back, then you'll know that I've gone into serious sort of. Serious crisis mode. The thing is, for us, it's okay because it's my job to be there, you know? So it's all right. I get a pass. Nobody's going to kind of look at me and go, what are you doing here, granddad? It's like, well, I'm actually here to play the record. So it's sort of, I mean, in that sense, I'm allowed to be there. But I mean, I was still... I mean, I don't go out for the joy of it without having to play as much as I used to, but then that's probably not been the case for a few years. And that's partly because, I don't know, life and other things take over. Have you found yourself doing more and more, you know, and writing and other things over the years as well. And have you been doing that in a conscious way of sort of... saying in the back of your mind maybe i can only dj for this many years longer i've always been a bit um interested in different things i've never been very good at focusing in one area um sometimes you could say that maybe to the detriment of things and then other times it looks like a kind of a good career move um you know there's that sort of fissure i guess in between in the sort of don't be a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. And I don't know, I mean, if I think about the way, I mean, my sort of career has been, it has been a question of sort of, it's been arbitrary at certain points and making the best of certain points. And the sort of periods of my career when I've been, you know, there was a period sort of... in the kind of mid 2000s where things kind of went a bit haywire for a bit. And, um, I got offered like an awful lot of remixes in the course of sort of a year and a half, pretty much everything that was going. Um, And I did seven remixes in that year. I could have done 70 or 80 or 90 or something if I'd have done the sort of higher engineers and studios and run between them being the sort of executive producer thing. And I think at the time there was a definite conscious decision not to rinse it too much because I'd seen other people in those situations just... saturate everybody you know saturate the whole market and just sort of do too much in an effort to just kind of make the money while they could and yeah I mean my the time I was the only other thing I was really thinking was actually I'm a really interested in longevity you know do the work that you care about do work that you're genuinely proud of that you can put your name to and build up a body of work and I think that's still really sound advice for anybody really I think people can again I you know I I have quite a sort of high opinion of the public and I think they can they can tell when you're doing it for the wrong reasons or the right reasons I think they can tell when you're just kind of bandwagoning or attempting just to rinse it um in that way and they can they appreciate um the work you do being you know you haven't putting all your sort of heart and whatever into it i hope that people still think that if they see my name on something is at least a sort of mark that there's some kind of care that's gone into it and and that they even if they didn't like what I did particularly they would kind of acknowledge that. It seems like I mean the decisions that you've made I hope you don't hate the phrase but sort of a slow and steady wins the race you know you haven't very slow but you haven't flogged your name I think even a year or so ago you told me you were actually taking fewer DJ gigs than you had in previous years you haven't you haven't foregrounded yourself as producer making tracks under your own name. You know, you've preferred generally to work producing other artists or remixing other. people and being a DJ but you haven't been out there with you know you and you and Pearson's greatest hits volumes one through ten no I mean I've done sort of compilations of the remixes a couple of remixes compilations but yeah I mean it's again it is that thing of my I mean it's partly my personality but it just I guess The idea of being too in everybody's face is a bit much, really, for me, but just sort of quietly getting on with things and doing work. And if there is a period, I mean, a couple of people have said to me recently, oh, you know, you haven't done anything, you know, you haven't been as active for a while. Then there was a big flurry of remixes last year. So, you know, it comes in fits and spurts according to what you're doing. There's been years when I've been doing production. So you do disappear slightly in terms of dance floor and stuff. And you have to do fewer DJ gigs because you just physically can't do everything at once. So, but it just, yeah, from year to year, it kind of, it flips back and forth. To be honest, I'm just. I'm just glad and vaguely and relieved and kind of surprised, really, where every sort of day that I think, wait a minute, you've been a self-employed musician for, I mean, I take it going back to sort of 98, 99, when I sort of left kind of university finally and gave up doing a PhD in various things and actually was only doing music. to be still subsisting. And I, you know, sometimes it's, you know, especially in the current climate, the last couple of years, I haven't been. you know they haven't been as easy for lots of people I think but um but yeah just to say that I'm still doing it I'm still a 7th grade musician is uh is an amazing thing and I feel sorry for it I think sometimes I feel sorry for kind of some of the younger folk just because it's really really hard to get your head above the parapet these these days just because of the sheer volume of stuff i mean we're in this weird time you know best of times worst of times it's like accessibility in terms of studio equipment and opportunities to you know you can transmit your music around the world but how can you guarantee anybody's actually going to hear it it's tough it's really tough and there's no answer to that really I mean people ask all the time you know well how do you how would you get heard and how would you what would you advise me and I don't know I really don't know I don't have a sort of silver bullet for that. Do you think that social media has kind of given people unrealistic expectations of what's feasible, what's possible from their careers because they see, I mean, it's easy to sort of broadcast yourself and it's easy to make it look like you're... Do you think? I think there is a certain class of people who are making their money in digital media who have oversold the current situation in terms of its... in terms of its benefits, based on a best-case scenario. They've sold what is possible and made it out to be what is probable. And we have to say, honestly, what's probable. And it was always the way. The fact was, most people didn't, who wanted to try and... do this kind of thing, didn't manage to make a career out of it. And if they did have careers, they were for relatively short periods of time. Nowadays, it's, yeah, it's even harder. In some ways, the base income in terms of, I don't know, the base expenditure you might need might be less. But even then, I mean, I... I was at a conference or speaking at a conference earlier this year and there was a guy speaking ahead of me and he was in advertising and he was going through all these kind of different videos and he was showing things like the Arcade Fire Google Street Maps video and he's showing all these basically different sort of different things people have done to get themselves noticed. And they were all gimmicks. They were all one-off gimmicks that would work for maybe for an established artist or for somebody, you know, they might work once. These things didn't scale for people. And I kind of sat and I was talking, you know, did my talk. And as usual, people ask about, you know, what's your advice? You know, what would you say to people who are starting out? And I would say, you know, take this stuff, the stuff you saw in the hour before, with a pinch of salt, because I'm afraid a lot of it is snake oil. And a lot of it is basically sold to people by new media, people whose best interests are served by it. You know, these are the people that are trying to sell. I don't know, websites or different things that offer different services, new media services. And ultimately, you know, you've got to be damn stubborn, you've got to be talented, and you've got to be very, very lucky. And this may have always been the case, but it's the case now more than ever. Earlier on, you said the Jack of all trades, master of none thing. It seems like you're kind of like, you know, you fly in the face of that notion. Do you think sort of another piece of advice would be to hedge your bets or have, you know, various things going on at once? Yeah, trust fund. Would be good. Professional gambling. I think it's partly, I mean, I think it's a temperament thing. It's like I've always been a bit scatterbrained in the sense I've always been interested in too many things. So to a certain extent, you do have to actually focus. on one thing of you know at a time and try and get somewhere that with that i don't think in that sense it's necessarily good advice to be doing too many things but i think what is useful advice is to have a b project at least or have something I mean you have to think about these things the image that I've used to people when I've been talking again when I sort of do talks or or this sort of career stuff is it's the idea of thinking about it as a kind of vocation as opposed to a career in the way that you know sort of I don't know the religious life or whatever. You know, this difference, the idea of a vocation as being something you feel you must do. And a career is something that hopefully you find yourself having at some point. It's in the same way that you can't really sort of, you can't really wake up and say, I'm going to be happy today. You kind of, you sort of realise that happiness has kind of sneaked up on you from. behind through the pursuit of doing the things that you're interested in. I think that's the same with careers. I think the thing to do is to, yeah, find things that you love, find things that you enjoy doing, pursue them to the best of your ability, and fingers crossed that that turns into a career. if that's what you want. That was almost a heartwarming end. Yeah, I call it my unmotivational speaking. My favourite... artist of the year by far is Fizz and I wrote about him for Resident Advisor for a breaking through feature and he's this New Zealand artist who I first heard on a Rinse FM show that was done by D-Bridge a guy who runs Exit and did the Autonomic Podcasts with the Instrumental guys a while ago. And I couldn't hear the name that he was pronouncing, and I couldn't figure out who it was. So I went on Twitter, and I was just sort of like, who is this guy? And then... D-Bridge said it to me and then some guy just emailed me and was like, I see you've been talking about Fizz on Twitter. Like, here's, you know, who he is. Here's some links and stuff. And ever since I've been absolutely transfixed by his stuff. It just doesn't sound like anything else to me going on right now. You've talked about it in terms of drum and bass. Yes. I think it's a context thing because I think if it hadn't been Dee Bridge who had this guest mix on his radio show and I also think because of the releases that he's had have been done by drum and bass people. The guy who sort of did his first or his second release is a guy who owns, who owned a record shop, then specialized in drum and bass. The record label is Drum and Bass. It's all New Zealand. And I think, but it could have just as easily been Warp. It could have been just as easy. And if you put it in that context, you would have been like, you never really would have thought, I think, so much. Although, when I talked to Fizz for this piece, a lot of his references were, you know, I went, here are these drum and bass guys, and, you know, because of who I got talking to, that sort of a thing. But it doesn't sound like drum and bass, really. Yeah, I wonder if he's in some sense kind of represents the moment at which... Drum and bass artists from the drum and bass scene stop making music that's identifiable as drum and bass as happened with dubstep a few years ago. You had artists in the dubstep scene and suddenly they're not making anything that can really be called dubstep. And that caused a fair amount of friction. because on the one hand, we like to categorize people and, well, you hang out with other dubstep people, therefore you're a dubstep person. But there's a shift, and the category lingers, but the music is something else. The thing I've been really... It's great that three American guys are talking about the drum and bass scene, I have to say. I've been really getting more and more into it over the past year. And the one thing that's really fascinating to me is how sheltered, how cloistered, sorry, that like a lot of these guys seem to be, there doesn't seem to be a lot of open-mindedness in terms of tempo, in terms of what they're playing. As opposed to techno? Yeah, I mean, I don't know. It just, it seems a lot more... Well, especially for something so open-ended in reality, which, you know, like we're saying, there's this stuff that's like, same thing with Dove 7 Drum and Bass, where you find yourself sort of saying drum and bass for lack of a better term or something like that, you know. In a way, it's really... It sounds very open-minded, but then there is a kind of tradition or something that's, you know, intractable. But I guess, for me at least, I was kind of fascinated by how revelatory the Autonomic Podcast seemed to a lot of people that were... within that scene it's like oh wow finally and you know like the at least the all the talk all the narrative about this drum and bass scene is you know there's a reason why it's kind of gone down in popularity somewhat or at least hasn't been able to get an enormous amount of new fans like because these guys are kind of like rehashing the same thing and trying to a new way to a bigger drop or whatever and i think fizz especially it's like a breath of it's, he's not like, I don't think he's the beginning of any movement or anything, but I think just that amount of difference is a huge amount of fresh air. Yeah. My reaction to hearing Fizz, which is only recently was that I thought it was kind of an interesting coincidence or not, I guess that he's in New Zealand and at uh dro carry it's from australia and sort of the first artist that sprung to mind when i heard fizz was dro carry um because it's they both have this sort of um you know it's it's out there it's pretty left field but you still have you know that impulse to group it in with you know bass music or whatever but um it kind of makes me wonder um you know at this point um with such a sort of globalized environment, anyone can find out about anything with the internet. Does it still, you know, how much of an effect does it have on your music to be so far off the grid? And I think there are just so few places now where you are off the grid in that way. I think Australia and New Zealand, even though they're obviously touring acts going out there quite a bit, there's no shortage of it. However, It comes on a much less regular basis. I'll be interested to see what happens going forward with them. Will, you wanted to touch on a label in, well, we don't technically know where it is based, I guess. Stablo is a house and techno label. I guess the reason Stubble is interesting to me is because There are many labels that are these sort of semi-white label, you know, fairly mysterious. Nobody really knows the artist is or are. And it's basically just the label name and a catalog number. but for whatever reason, Stablo really picked up a lot of, I mean, I guess buzz on a very underground level, but it became this sort of monster or something where at this point, even though... quite underground. It's popular enough that the records are more or less just impossible to get even though they you know they seems like they print 500 based on the you know catalog numbers or how the records are marked but still You just can't get your hands on them. One of the most recent ones appeared at Hardwax and was gone in a few hours. And then that night it was on Discogs starting at 60 euro or something. And someone has one on Discogs for, you know, this is clearly sort of a symbolic price or whatever, but it was 9,999 euro and 99 cents, which is... I guess like the maximum amount you can, you know, list something on Discogs for. And, um, the interesting thing is, I mean, well, I still haven't gotten, I haven't gotten a chance to actually own one of these records. I've only listened to them on YouTube, but, um, they are, uh, they have kind of a special personality. They're basically just very attention grabbing. DJ tools, each with something kind of weird going on, but that would definitely work in a club. But you still have to, even though they're really cool, you still have to wonder, like, why this label or why did this happen this way? It's kind of a, seems like kind of a self-perpetuating phenomenon that once it picks up enough sort of mystique, you know. just it doesn't matter what's on the record like there's the idea that someone would go to hard wax and buy it as an investment you know like they certainly didn't go home and listen to it and decide they didn't like it and then put it up you know the goal is to just snap it up as quickly as possible and sell it it's like flipping records Yeah. I mean, I think the interesting, aside from the music, the really interesting thing is that it really brings up the Discogs thing, which is, you see a lot of this, but it's a really exaggerated example of people immediately going and buying things as a, I'm going to flip this. do we blame the record label for not pressing enough at that point? I mean, this isn't a new problem. The speculation thing has been around forever. And I mean, I remember 10 or more years ago, you had the same issues with eBay before Discogs had their marketplace. I mean, the problem is definitely kind of it's taken off. You know, it's out of control, I think, as a record buyer and somebody who would like to get my hands on some of these things. But I don't know if you can necessarily blame the label because, you know. When you're on your sixth release, though, you have like an amount of knowledge. like this is happening. Sure. I mean, you're going to start with pressings of three or 500 because more than that just doesn't make economic sense. Once you get into your sixth release and people are buying them and flipping them, I don't know, because, you know, maybe how long is that going to go on for? You know, you're, you're already seeing diminishing. I was looking at the releases on Discogs today and you're already seeing diminishing returns by the time you get to release number then they're selling for €30. And I would imagine pretty... And there are a bunch of them selling for €30. In another couple of months, they'll probably come down quite a bit. But it's interesting. Yeah, the most recent one is pretty much a normal price. It's about €20. But there are also comments saying, like, the quality has really gone down. And I don't know, a part of me, I guess like a cynical part of me, wonders, like, has, you know... If the quality hadn't gone down, if it sounded identical to the first one, would it just be that the fact that everybody knows about it now doesn't have as much value as a secret weapon or something? Maybe could that be the quality that's gone down as opposed to the quality of the music? I don't know. It's an interesting sort of experiment and hype or something. They remind me a little bit of... the Mountain People records from a few years back in the same kind of like they're tools with character. You know what I mean? Yeah, exactly. And I seem to remember there was those records, right? Like, obviously not the same idea, but tools with character. Right, yeah. I mean, there are a dozen labels doing that. Yeah. Dozens. plural of labels doing that right now. But an interesting thing is like with Analog Solutions, they repressed everything and eventually they had pretty slick, it was in like colored vinyl and this cool clear sleeve with a sticker and they sort of adjusted to the fact that like, well, I'm not going to lose money on this. But you sort of wonder if your initial goal was to... start a label kind of as like a little personal project and you know you sort of i guess does it make sense to want some level of scarcity like you don't want to run a name label you just kind of want to release these mysterious little records and um I think with Stable you see that it's kind of an awkward thing to try to pull off sometimes, I guess. Some people say, like on the SysCogs comments or the YouTube comments, just like, you know, if you really have your heart in it, you want to get your music out there. why not just release it digitally? Like, it seems like the only vinyl thing is this, some people feel like it's just self-evidently what you should do, but what's the point if you're preventing people from hearing the music that you believe in? Although at this point, you're not, I mean, you're not preventing, you're preventing people from owning a vinyl copy of it. But at this point, I mean, you just said. You listen to them all on YouTube. You don't own any of them. The music is getting out there. I personally think it's nice when people have vinyl labels and they also release it digitally so everybody can have it. I mean, realistically, if you really want it, you're going to be able to download it somewhere. All of this vinyl is getting ripped and uploaded. The whole scarcity argument, I think, in some ways is, I don't know. I mean, to me, ultimately, it's up to the artist's decision of what he or she wants to do. You know, that Rave record, Ivar Rave that came out. It's rumored to maybe be shed. Who knows? I mean, it's a big tune, and it's not getting repressed, right? And I don't know. I kind of... it's an amazing record and I'm very happy that I own it. And like, so I guess I'm in this case, I'm willing to say, yeah, it's up to the artist. You know, they want to put out this one thing. It's a special record for them. They do a single pressing. And that since I have it, it's okay. Well, it reminds me that this thing I always think about was somebody, I forget where I read this, but somebody said that, you know, pre you wouldn't even really know it was called Basic Channel. You would see in the record stores it has this weird mark on the label. You don't know if any have come before. You don't know when the next one's coming out, if this is the new one or the old one. All you have is this record. It's really cryptic. that in a way, even though the music ended up having a lot of staying power and was very influential, that sort of mysterious experience was not a superficial part of the experience. It was important. And so now there are artists who really go through a lot of effort to sort of still pull that off, even though, you know, everything's working against them. Like Shed intentionally creating new names to, you know, distort people's idea of which records are his and which ones aren't. You know, it's really kind of... It's strange in a way for an artist to not want to take credit for what he did and actively prevent people from finding out this is his work. Just talking about the basic channel and chain reaction and hard wax aesthetic, I will go on record and I will say as much as I love a nice hand-stamped white label from an anonymous artist, blah, blah, blah. I wish that we could get a little more creative and come up with new ways to get people excited about records. I mean, I love a nice chipboard sleeve, a suggestively smudged stamp. That's all great, and I have tons of them, but I wish... that, you know, we could, it's just, I mean, it's a cliche, right? It's like, hmm, yeah, limited to 300. It's a label. It's an artist you've never heard of. Like, we can do better. We can come up with other ideas. And I don't know, just like, I'd like to see people challenge themselves a bit more. Well, I know Intervisions has basically the complete opposite approach, which is they feel that if you're buying records at this is clearly your thing. Like, you know, normal consumers don't buy records anymore. Only connoisseurs do basically. So, um, they make the record itself an exciting product or they try to where, you know, any 12 inch they've put out recently has, um, some kind of striking artwork or, you know, the, um, it's like a stencil style sleeve with another bit of artwork behind it. And they try to make it, um, and a collector's item to some extent, which I think in the end is the same thing that the rubber stamp guys are doing, but just they're taking the minimalist approach and, or, you know, in a sense of like, you know, in your opinion, kind of the traditional approach. Sure. But, but it's also just, it's very easy to do, you know, like, Hmm, I want to start a rootsy techno label. What kind of design do I want? I know I'll have a white I mean, I don't mean to harp on this point, but in a way it's kind of the phenomenon of totally anonymous producers or techno artists or whatever, where it's like just hearing their given name wouldn't have been that exciting. You know, the effort to conceal their identity is more showy and more conspicuous than if you just knew who they were. You know, it's kind of like red shape. God bless you. Who is in fact Dixon. You heard it here first. Philip, your pick of the mid-year is, well, it's just kind of a bunch of people. Yeah, I mean, I guess it's a regional pick. I should preface this by saying I don't speak with any great expertise about this. I've started getting a lot of records coming out of Portugal, and I think specifically Lisbon. that are pretty exciting and make me think that there must be something cool going on in Lisbon. Photons, a duo from Lisbon, I've been getting their records for several years and just recently, I think... Not so recently, in 2010, I guess, they founded their One Eye Jacks label. But they've just come out with a great record by a new producer named Pal Plus, who they tell me is from Faro Algarve in the south of Portugal. kind of, I guess, sort of the same thing we were talking about with New Zealand and Fizz, sort of a bit removed from things. They say that he was just kind of like doing his thing and they found each other somehow. But the aesthetic that I'm hearing from them and also this other label, Principe. which is some of the people from a record store called Floored and some of the people from Galadrop, which is kind of a psych disco band. They're on international field. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I'm getting this interesting vibe from all of them, which is this sort of, they've got the analog techno and analog house elements. but they also have little bits and pieces of sort of bass music in there. There's breakbeats. There's odd sound design. There's a real melodic component, especially on this new Pal Plus record. Just these big, gorgeous melodies that I'm a sucker for. And then Principe also has a record by this guy, DJ Marfox, who's basically a Kuduro producer, which is something that you don't really see much in the house and techno scene. Kuduro maybe comes in through the Diplo end of things, but I don't feel like we get that very much in our side of things. And it's really not techno with a Kuduro edge. I mean, it's straight up. this, you know, this kind of angle and Portuguese hybrid dance music. I mean, there was a piece in Juno Plus that was quite nice about the Principe label, but I found it very tough to kind of like get, take out information from it that I could kind of go, okay, this is why this is happening here. Or like, this is why these guys are doing this and it all. kind of, sort of sounds like it's coming from the same mentality. Have you talked to people, or have you kind of... Yeah, I mean, I've been in touch with some of the guys from Photons, and it's funny, actually, to talk about Basic Channel, because, you know, they are in techno, you know, they, Underground Resistance, these kind of iconic collectives, and maybe I'm totally misrepresenting this, but I do get a sense of... of collectivity coming out of the Lisbon scene. I mean, there is the Filio Unico, which they describe to me as kind of a cultural organization, association they have. They do shows. They've had Mika Vainio, Hype Williams, Joe McPhee, and Chris Corsano. I mean, they're really all over the place. And they're also involved with a record store there. And in talking to these people, I've actually had a really hard time figuring out exactly who does what. You know, there's lots of names and lots of people involved, but none of them seem to be terribly aggressive about making their names or identities or roles. You know, it's just like... I've gotten a very interesting kind of communal vibe out of them. They send me records. They're really good. I get excited. I write them back. They kind of give me some more information. But I don't know. It's a cliche, but it seems like a pretty organic. which I appreciate. The thing that I really enjoyed about some of these records is exactly what you're saying, is that it has this raw analog thing that's a thing, but it's shot through with a lot of different influences that I'm not hearing in the raw and analog. Yeah, it doesn't sound like they're just trying to make a Lego Welt record, you know? And not that I'm saying that everybody who's doing raw analog stuff is just trying. I mean, there's lots of raw analog labels I really like. But I do like the fact that I'm hearing something from them that sounds specific to them. I mean, I can hear links a little bit with what Iver and Disc is doing in Barcelona, which maybe that's natural. You know, maybe it's kind of a regional thing. I don't really know. But I do like the fact that it's surprising. and different and I'm super excited to see what they do next. Kind of similar thing to with Fizz and Joe Carey that when I heard that stuff I was sort of it's kind of interesting to me that music could have a kind of locality that you can hear or whatever, that that's still possible. Like you said, it sort of has a similar flavor to Iver and Dis, and the fact that it's Portugal and Barcelona is nearby. I don't know, it kind of fascinates me how that can still occur when there's sort of cross-pollination between any two cities at this point. I'm constantly intrigued at how the internet has not killed that. has not killed a very local sound emerging from a lot of different places. And I think that's the one thing that gives me hope. Yeah, I mean, look at LaVon Vincent and that fabric mix. I mean, what a testament to the possibility and the necessity of a local scene and community of people. to continue defining their own sound against kind of a global backdrop. you you
