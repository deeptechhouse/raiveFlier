so Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. One of the key traits of classic American deep house is creating introspective and personal moods that move the listener to look within themselves in a life-affirming way. When Fred P released the album Reactions of Light, a black jazz consortium in 2007, it was clear he had a special gift in this department. When DJs and dancers liked his work, they tended to fall for it hard. Many seemed to develop an affinity with this producer who'd so clearly put his heart into his work. Ever since, that signature Fred P. feeling has become a staple of house and techno. He's made the most of his success by evolving his sound with the suitably titled Evolution of Light album, which draws a link to his debut that only shows how far he's come in the past decade. He spoke to Carlos Hawthorne late last year about the realizations, experiences, and philosophies that have made him the artist he is today. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Fred P is up next. Hey Fred, thanks a lot for coming in. Thank you for having me. You said you were feeling a little bit dazed from the weekend. Yeah, just came back from a North American tour that continued into Europe. So it was like one day of maybe a few hours sleep and then back on the road for three more countries. Is that a kind of normal kind of thing you do or is it you're trying to avoid that if possible? Oh, no. Well, the thing is, it's sporadic. It happens like that at times. Sometimes it's a little bit more relaxed, but it just so happens at this point that, yeah, it was a bit of a hectic schedule. And I mean, when you're kind of... tired and you've been on the road for a while, how does that affect the way you play? Does it make you play better? It actually does. Really? I've heard that before, right? Yeah, Paris was insane. Like La Machine, oh my goodness. In fact, I'm not like super known for playing disco, but I played like an hour of disco and it was crazy, man. So what would you kind of put that down to in terms of like playing better when you're kind of just more worn out? I think it's more of me not like being in super control, just letting the music have its way because that's the thing that's motivating me. Right, you kind of feel more raw and emotional. Yeah, yeah. The people really, really had, they were really dialed in. And then a lot of my friends were in town and they showed up. So it was like nice to have that support. And it all lent to the moment. Nice. You get to have a break this weekend or back on the road? Oh, no, I'm definitely on a break this weekend. Nice. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, we're here in Berlin. You've been living here for how long now? I think now it's going on eight years. Nice. Okay. Fully settled. Totally. I got furniture and everything. I read that you kind of moved because you were just playing so much in Europe, it just made sense to be here. But nevertheless, you moved reluctantly. Well, I had one foot in the States, even though I think I was in denial because I spent more time in Europe than I did in America. And it seemed as the years went by, there was less and less for me to do in America. Then there were less and less things keeping me coming back. And now it's to the point where... I might go there twice a year to do some shows, and that's about it. So it was a case of your music just, I mean, you just weren't getting the bookings, it just wasn't as big over there, what was... Well, I mean, the scene is a little bit different, and there's that old saying where, you know, if you are successful, usually it happens somewhere else, and then where you're from will accept you. It seems like, with the exception of New York, America is reluctantly accepting me as being an international artist. But it's cool because I love where I'm at. Nice. Yeah, you said that it's the best decision you've ever made. Yeah. Well, I think to a certain degree it was kind of made for me because the circumstances, I mean, to look at it for what it is, every time I would go back to America to, like, say, resume whatever life I had there, I would be immediately called back to Europe to do, like, another run of dates. And it went from... a couple of weeks to a month to two months to three months and then I had to change my passport. So it was like, you know, universe saying, hey dude, look at this and take it a little more seriously. And of course, the more you play in Europe, the more your profile grows over there. So kind of the more time you're going to have to spend over there. So it's just kind of inevitable. And I honestly would have to say I kind of grew into it because, you know, I mean, it was all new back then. And then I would say around 2012, when I got rid of, like, the possessions that I didn't really need, that it all hit home where it's like, yeah, man, I'm changing my passport. I look for a place to live. All of these things, you know. Was moving to Berlin the first time you'd been a professional musician? Like, was that the switch or had you been doing that in New York? I would say that would be somewhere near 2009. Because before that, I was like temping and doing things on my own. I wasn't so much professional. I was kind of like, you know, just doing stuff. It's been that way the 90s till about then. Nice. And did you come here, was there any community you could come here? I know there are a few kind of New York artists living over here. Yeah, well, yeah, there are a few definitely from New York and other places, Detroit, Chicago. I linked up with, and one of my earliest connections was with TiVo Howard. He actually showed me around Berlin, took me on a train, and took me places. showed me, like, yo, there's KFC over there, there's the Berk church over there, you know, that sort of thing. Nice. It was cool. Like, he really took me under his wing. I appreciated that ever since. And what is it that's worked so well for you living here? Well, I'm able to make music, like, really, like, my music. Like, you know, not music that I have, but the music I want to make. That's priceless. And is that just in kind of in a financial sense? Like you're just simply, the rent, the cost of living is just low enough that you're afforded that freedom? Or is there, or is it something else? Well, I would say in comparison to New York, it's the only other place I can compare it to. I would say... The standard of living is different. Therefore, the cost of living is different. And I live a particularly simple lifestyle. Like, literally, all I do is make music all day. You know, I go to the supermarket, buy groceries, I come back and continue to make music, and then I go away on the weekend. So it works out. where I'm able to maintain that is a bit of a sustainable lifestyle. And to compare it to New York, that would be impossible. For sure. Do you feel like, would you say you live a solitary life? Yeah, I would say so. I'm a very quiet person. Even considering what I do for a living, my neighbors have no clue I'm in the building. because I do everything so quietly. And it works out because I'm in a neighborhood where it's really, really quiet. So when I come back from the weekend and my ears are going crazy, I get the chance to level out. So yeah, solitary is, I like peaceful things. Nice. Then of course you spend your weekends. in a hectic environment, so it's kind of nice balance. Well, see, that's where the balance is, because I love that too, and I get it all out in these tremendous bursts of energy, you know, so it's really cool. Nice. Yeah, let's talk about your kind of music making because, as you said, you're extremely dedicated, spending 10 to 12 hours a day. How do you characterize your relationship with making music? Is it something you simply have to do every day? Is it just a way of life? Yeah, I would definitely call it a way of life. Yeah, it's something I have to do. I have to. Life doesn't work right if I don't. I'm fascinated by that. Is that kind of, exactly, you're not working, of course there are projects in mind, but I'm sure you make more music than you could probably ever release. Yeah, that's one right there, because I have to find ways to release music these days. In the early years it was a little bit easier because I was able to work with other companies. And I could, like, do as many remixes as I want and release as many records as I would like because, you know, I'm relatively new and so on. But these days, reaching a certain level, you kind of have to pull back because now a release has a lot more weight than it used to. So, yeah, I have to, like... use some ingenuity to get these things out. That's where the kind of aliases and the lulligals and that come in. So, I mean, you're waking up. Are you, when you make music, are you kind of translating how you feel? Is it a very cathartic process? In my opinion, I view, like, music as a form of communication. And the science of how sound works is based on energy. So, me being first the being, experiencing life, then being an artist, translating those experiences. It's a matter of taking the information that I experience, like, you know, just my reality, and then translating that into a term that is relative to people's ear through my medium, which is music. And that's a daily process. I wake up in the morning, I do my morning routine, and then I sit in a chair and try to go through all of that information and turn it into something people can take in and get something. Nice. What's your morning routine? Wake up, shower, coffee, go up to the deck and... Just clear my head, organize my thoughts. Like, if there isn't anything pressing to do, like, you know, a meeting or, you know, I have to, an appointment or whatever, then it's okay. Where did I leave off last night and how do I start today? That's usually the process. It takes, like, maybe an hour, hour and a half. Nice. And are you making a similar amount of music every day? Or does it vary? Yeah, well, you know, the thing is, I don't count. I just do things. Sometimes those things go all the way to a conclusion. Sometimes it just remains a sketch. But usually by the end of the week, I can go back and there's either something clearly there or a lot of food for thought. I think this relationship with production is quite rare. I'd compare it to the way... Picasso famously just endlessly painted, you know, not to blow you up too much, but just in terms of the approach is exactly the same. He didn't paint to make money. He didn't paint for any material gain, even though that came. He just did it because that's what he did. He woke up and that is how he expressed himself, how he lived his life. So it just sounds very similar in terms of you just have to do it. It's not a choice. It's not, oh, God, I better get back in the studio because of this or that. It's just I'm always there. Yeah, well, that's the thing. It's like if you are an artist, there's really no rule, but I think the bedrock that artist's worth is sought. is bound to is being true to themself. And that's like how you feel. More than anything else, I love the process of creating and giving myself up to that process because what comes out ultimately... will be something substantial. Sure. Let's talk about the new album, new Black Jazz Consortium album, Evolution of Light. I heard you say this album is about songs, not tracks. I wonder if you could just go into that a little bit. I feel, you know, with most of music, it's, you know, over the years... The term track is more or less this thing that comes and goes. And that's cool if that is a way of defining a moment, that's fine. However, when I look back at the first Black Jazz Consortium album, Reactions of Light, that was definitely the truth for that because I was attempting to do something that I didn't know how to do. truth of that was that project and when I look back at it years later wow there's no way to truly answer that without saying what it is so when this album came about I basically said to myself No matter what, I have to be true to myself and tell the truth about what this process is. And the process is an evolution because so much has happened between then and now. I've learned so much. I have become better at certain processes. And some things have remained somewhat similar to the beginning. Definitely more in the way of being middle and end, which most songs have. And this album reflects that. The first album didn't really have that kind of narrative. It was just kind of just this raw expression. And this is more like it's... It's expression. Not as raw. A bit more arranged, a bit more musical, a lot more, let's say, as far as engineering, it's done much better. And there is a consistent narrative that changes throughout, so it's more of a complete story. So when I say it's more about songs, it's like... You go from one place at the beginning and then you can clearly feel the transitions to other areas before you get to the end. And then when you get to the end, it's like full circle. And yeah, to me, that's how a long player should work. Right. Well, interesting you said that the first album, you were kind of doing something that you didn't yet know how to do or trying. But you said with this one, you've also felt out of your depth because you were, why did you feel like that? Well, for one, I've done collaborations before, but never with musicians, like session musicians and stuff. So that's one level because I had to learn that that's a particular type of relationship and there's a particular. going about doing these sorts of sessions. And then also, too, going out of my comfort zone, adding a couple new vocalists to the mix, because I usually work with the same people all the time. And the same thing applies. This is likable to how to do that. And these are all processes that I learned along the way. Were you bringing the musicians into your studio? Were you guys able to interact together or was it more of a... In some cases, yes, but in the majority of the cases, no. Well, I'd say, no, it was a little balanced. I would say More Blessings and Another Path, those songs were done in a studio with the musicians in Brazil. Right. And when it came down to Sacred Son, a lot of the stuff that Slick Tim, a.k.a. Gary Gritness, appeared on, that was mostly done online because he's in France and I'm here, and it's a lot easier just to go back and forth. And same thing with Sacred Son. It was Bruno's in Sao Paulo, so it was easier to do that that way. Salvador as well, which she just totally went insane on. Yeah, I guess we should say that the album has a strong Brazilian theme. How did that come about? Where does your love of Brazilian music come from? Brazil has a very rich music culture that lends itself to so many different forms. They have their own unique form, but then also... on take on jazz, blues, etc. Folk music as well. When I hear those tones, it resonates with me on a level that I can totally identify with. I was touring there quite a bit last year. Over the years, I've been there a lot and realized that I hadn't wrote a single track. Every time I was there, which was kind of funny because usually when I'm away from home that long, I usually want something because it's going like way out of my normal routine. But the last time I was there, I was like, you know what? I'm going to make this happen because I can't sit here and not do something. And got in touch with my guy, Keitano, me in contact with all the musicians who appeared on those songs. And history, in my opinion, history was made because that opened up a whole new door for me creatively and has opened my mind to the possibilities of... collaborating, orchestrating, arranging, things like that. Wow, okay, so this is something you'd like to build on. Oh, absolutely. But I see the possibilities for so many different things. Wow, okay, nice. Potential for a kind of band, perhaps? Yeah, totally. Wow, nice. I want to talk about kind of, you know, your big philosophy is this kind of just staying true to yourself. but very powerful and I just wondered it kind of just runs through everything you do you know you kind of exude it I mean where does it originate from when did you first start thinking about making music and life in general this way as far as making music goes I would have to say I started when I was a kid so I used to bang on pots and pans and stuff you know, try to emulate drummers on records and listen to the radio all the time, all the way through to, like, making pause tapes and then overdubs and all types of weird stuff that never left. It was always the most comforting thing. So music has been, like, a very consistent thing in my life since very early. You know, there's a... A couple of ways to approach existence and is the way that comes natural to you and then there's the ways that you adopt to to be accepted or whatever. Coming from where I come from, Flatbush, Brooklyn, I didn't really have a choice of adaptation because whether I adapted or not, I'm still me. So figuring that out early, I'm like, well, I might as well just be me and not try to adapt. Just do what works in reference to how my mind works. Now, that's not the easiest way of getting along, but you can live with yourself a lot better when you're expressing things because you know it's your truth. that's where that really, like, comes from. I didn't really have that much of a choice. And then when it came down to artistic endeavors, it's very difficult to copy an original and then, like, try to be the original you copied. It's like, you know? So it's so much better to be inspired. try to find your own expression of that inspiration, you know, which is very difficult because the person that, or the artist or the experience, whatever it is that inspires you, the purpose of it is to literally turn you on to yourself. Like, where did that feeling come from? And then try to explore. the mechanism that makes those feelings happen. And that opens a whole different world of thought. So, yeah, I mean, for better or worse, if your expression is genuine, it's going to be a benefit to somebody somewhere. Well, it's interesting you talk about kind of, yeah, the early years in New York and this philosophy of staying true because you grew up around an amazing era for hip hop in particular, where I imagine, you know, that's the kind of... guiding principle of a lot of kind of hip-hop is just like being yourself staying true um you kind of you know you hear rappers say that a lot what was it like being in the kind of heart of that hip-hop scene back then um well i was lucky because i i mean i'm a kid i don't know nothing about nothing and then one day hear planet rock on the radio and life changes forever It's like really literally just like because, you know, again, it started in the Bronx. So I didn't know anything about it until I, you know, because Brooklyn and the Bronx back then, the Bronx might as well have been another country. Right. You know. Because of just the distance or you would just never go there? I was too young. Right. You know, I was like a baby when it happened. So it was like I couldn't go to the Bronx and experience what was going on. However, it was happening and you saw the subtle changes. And then when it hit the radio. Everybody got it at the same time. And then culture changed literally overnight. It went from soul, R&B, rock on the radio to words that are not sung. So yeah, at that time, it was exciting because it was different. Imagine growing up, all your life things are one way. And then one day, literally overnight, everything changes to something else. And growing up in that environment, I think just from how we use music to escape and entertain our minds to other possibilities, I guess the sociopolitical climate as well played a backdrop to that. Because as you move forward from the 70s, to the 80s, you get to the Reagan era, Reaganomics, trickle down, all that good stuff, the crack epidemic, so on. I mean, the narrative between the reality and what we were using to escape from that were like hand in glove, had a direct effect on everyone. So, I mean, even so much from, you know, what you listen to, what you wear, who you hang out with, types of parties, so on and so forth. By the time I got to high school, I was like, you know, anti-everything. Right. Because this is what I'm being fed. This is not going to work for you, that's not going to work for you, and you need to be this way, that way. The thing that I think brought out the artistic side of me was that climate and the energy of it. What I was being told is not possible. And then when I discovered dance music. I was like, that's all BS, man. Anything is possible. And I could express myself and be who I am and people will love it because that's the general nature of it. It's like, you know, when you meet someone, you want to experience them, not your idea of them. And then you usually, you know, have a connection from that. So, yeah, I think. The early years of hip-hop, electro, inspired a lot of what I did then and even still now because I still make hip-hop tracks and I still do weird out there stuff for myself, just for my own mental well-being. That influence never went away. So what you're saying is there was something about hip hop and the kind of culture around it and the scene and having to conform maybe to certain things that meant that you didn't feel like you could express yourself musically? Well, yeah, because hip-hop is music of the people, man. And that's probably the only place you can stand on a soapbox and be honest. I mean, today is a lot different because it's a different world. is not so much a soapbox kind of thing. It's more of what the music industry started out being, which is a lot different from what our ideas of it is now. So... I would say back then when, for example, you take a group like Public Enemy, it's a public service announcement, as where today, you know, there are no public enemies in the sense of general consciousness. It's a part of history. It happened, but those moments are there and we're here and it's a different world. And what is taking that place? That's up to anyone to decide because there's so many different ways to look at it now. So you hear Planet Rock. I mean, how do things change for you? You start investigating this new music. Well, I mean, Planet Rock, in comparison to what was being played, let's say like on WBLS, which is in New York Station, 107.5. Man, never forget that. It was different. I mean, you go from hearing the Isley Brothers' Earth Went On Fire to this all electronic expression. Like, it was alien at the time. But it resonated on a level that at least gave me the inclination, like, I think it's possible. Because before that, it didn't exist, or at least it wasn't present in front of people, you know, on a general... consciousness level and then it just appeared everything changed so it's like yeah anything is possible was a part of that that you know pop rock soul it's made by bands it's this idea that you have to be this kind of diamond in the rough talent to kind of make it whereas this was people from the hood making music with computers that was kind of more accessible Well, it's exactly that, because before it was all bands, and then it wasn't. And today it's even more so, where it's like you even have now AI making music for you. So it's like, we have to really look at time period. We are literally talking about every century. We're almost 20 years into the 21st century. Now, just think about that for a second. 20th century. 21st century. What is a century? You dig where I'm going with this? And then decades, almost two decades into the 21st. So if you look at the period when that happened. We were thinking in terms of like Buck Rogers flying cars and being able to travel to other planets. Now in the 21st century, there are people actually working to make that happen. Yeah. You know, like SpaceX and all these different things. You know, supercomputers in our pockets and stuff. Let's go back. Planet rock. So do you see the correlation? Sure. Yeah, man. That's why then and now, anything is possible. It's just a matter of staying true to yourself and seeing your vision through to its conclusion. Nice. I mean, let's talk about your kind of early rave experiences, dance floor experiences in New York. Was it a case that kind of house music became popular among your social scene and so you started going along to things or were you seeking this stuff out on your own? It happened for me first in high school, going to hooky parties and stuff like that. Then I think the turning point was... listening to DJ Disciple Thursday nights on college radio, taping his show. It was him, Stretch and Bobbito. That would be my music for the week. I would stay up all night and just record both shows, and then all week long just listen to that, going to school. I didn't think anyone else that I knew was into it. And, you know, to be quite honest, When I started seeing folks coming to school, dressing a certain way, looking a certain way, I was like, oh, okay, this might be some common ground with some folks who might have experienced something. I didn't think of it in a way that was so well thought out, as at the moment you see something that's familiar and you're attracted to it. Yeah, I wound up like, you know, sharing my findings on the radio with some friends and stuff like that. And one of my best friends at the time, cousin, was in a group called Craze. They made the record called Let's Play House. And he was like, yeah, dude, my cousin's performing at the Alphabet Club, um, Pyramid, I'm sorry, in Alphabet City. And I'm like, okay. And we went there. They put us on a guest list. First time I didn't know what a guest list was. That was it. And I was too young to go to a club at that time. But because we were on a guest list, it was like, yeah, whatever. That was my first experience. And from that point on. I started gradually going to clubs like every week. And then it got to a point where it was like Sunday to Sunday. Really? Because I was much younger, way more athletic, and I loved to dance. What age was the alphabet city? Oh man, I was like 19. Okay. And what were you hearing there? Well, there was, well, of course, immediately when he told me who his cousins were, I'm like, okay, well, then what are they doing? What's that music? So it was them and then... Of course, I was listening to DJ Disciple, played a lot of early Kerry Chandler, which was like his, one of my favorite projects of his was Dee Dee Brave. And I loved all of that because it resembled a lot, a mixture of R&B, hip hop, overtones, but danceable. Casio where stuff was like crazy. I would like worship that sort of thing. And, you know, this was the music I was like really into. So. going out with my friend at the time, it was like, anywhere that doesn't have that, we're not going. But everywhere that has that is where we're going. And this kept us on the hunt. We would go looking, like literally in people's backyards and stuff like that. You know, it was crazy. But it was probably the first thing that... kind of gave me a deeper look to how meaningful music can be and how, if you keep an open mind to different forms of how enriching it can be for yourself, because... I mean, I wouldn't imagine going to nightclubs dancing just because, just because. And this is like a part of my life experience, you know, like I draw a lot of inspiration from those days. Right, of course. I mean, yeah, I guess before that. In terms of seeing music live, it's kind of, you know, a two-hour concert or you see someone play on the street or something. This idea of dancing for eight, nine hours is totally... Absolutely. Well, you think about it, like, you know, you experience music, like, in those days on television, like music videos and stuff like that. And I never aspired to anything like that. I mean, it's cool, it's entertainment, but I didn't aspire to be in a music video or anything like that. So the idea of being in a dark place, strobe lights, blaringly loud music, dancing until my clothes are completely drenched, you couldn't pay me to believe that. But I did it, you know? Who were some of the early DJs in New York who really moved you? Early years, I would have to say Junior Vasquez, Frankie Knuckles. What period is this, roughly? We're talking like early Sound Factory. He was like one of the residents there. And that was the Friday night spot because if you got flyers, you could show up and get in for free before 12 o'clock. And myself, all my friends really abused the flyer system. Like, we'd be the first. We would be standing, like, around the corner waiting for them to, like, you know, come to the door, literally open the club to be the first ones online. Get in there. There is nobody in there, you know. And we would be those guys, like, every week. And interestingly enough, when Whistle Song came out, the very first place I heard it was on DJ Disciples' show. And he was playing an acetate, and you could tell because you can hear the feedback. Then the second place I heard it was in Sound Factory, and it sounded like that very same acetate, because you could hear the feedback from it. And I mean, I knew the difference between a finished record. And I knew this wasn't out yet. I couldn't just go get it. So it felt special. And those moments, there were a lot of moments like that. at the Sound Factory. It was one of my favorite places to go. Nice. So at this point, you were already buying records? Nope. No? I had no interest in collecting, being a DJ. None of that stuff crossed my mind. I'm just going out, living life, and enjoying the moment. And so this sense of being a musician wasn't something, even when you're involved in hip-hop and stuff, it wasn't something you were never interested in making that your life. There was no sense that this could be done. Well, that came a little bit later because I had stopped going out to clubs. Life got real. I graduated and had to get a job. Right. So... When that happened, I realized how much I missed going out clubbing, and that's when I started buying records, because I needed the music all the time. When I did collect these records, I made these mixtapes. Because, I mean, I've DJed since I was like 15, but not professionally, just for family, friends, around my neighborhood and stuff like that. Because it was something that was always in my family. Like, my dad did it and stuff like that. So, to make a long story short, I started buying records and making these tapes. And I would listen to these tapes all the time, share them with my friends and stuff. And I always feel like, you know... There's something missing. There should be a bridge between this song and that song, but that song doesn't exist. But I know what that song sounds like. And that was the early seed that was planted in my brain somehow through universal consciousness, I guess. And that started the ball rolling in that way. Eventually, I would get some equipment because I did a lot of wild stuff in my younger years. And I bought a keyboard and sampler, a Korg O1W, and an Akai S950 sampler, and a Tascam Porter Studio, which is like four-track multi- that you would do on cassette, so you can imagine how messy that sounds. However, I was able to take the first step and, you know, put some ideas down, and my very first tracks were house tracks. But then the opportunity came to get free studio time. It was kind of like this contest. My cousin came to me with this because he knew I had some equipment. And he was like, dude, man, if we do this, we get some studio time, make it much better. And I'm like, you know, the idea of not having to pay for studio time was very attractive because, you know, obviously I'm way better stuff than I did. I tried it, and even though that scenario didn't work out, I met the guy who mentioned me in production. that situation. Right. Amazing. Yeah, it was deep. It was, again, the universal consciousness, man. And I mean, this obsession with production that you kind of find yourself in now, is that something that struck you from the start? Okay. At that time, I was operating basically on instinct. Just what I felt, what I feel, etc. I didn't have... Any idea of philosophy of how or what that is, is just the power of music and what that does to me. And I didn't know that it would shape. my way of thinking and motivations as time went on. But now, many years later, I realize, like, yeah, this thing is shaping my motivations. The things that I do in life is based on this energy. So I couldn't say I knew that. It's just, it happened. Did you feel that kind of, when you sat down to make those first tracks, what do you think? wow, I actually really feel comfortable doing this. Even though I don't necessarily know exactly what I'm doing, in some sense I'm getting something from it. This feels like me. No, it always seemed like it's just something I'm supposed to do. This is what you're supposed to do. If you feel like there's something missing and you know what it is, you're supposed to put it. You know, that kind of thing. You were part of, in the early 2000s, you've mentioned a kind of broken beat, new jazz scene in New York, which is interesting because people talk a lot about the scene in London. I didn't realize there was something kind of similar going on in New York. Do you want to talk a little bit about that? Okay, well, to put that in perspective, all the credit to any kind of influence from new jazz, broken beat. has to go to J-Lock because this guy, who is one of my best friends, worked at Dance Tracks in New York. And in my opinion, you know, is one of the most innovative thinkers in terms of selection when it comes down to new things. At the time, New York scene was soulful, deep, etc. There wasn't anyone really bridging the gap between that and what was going on in West London. Nobody had any clue. He was the only person saying the giant neon sign. look at this. Listen, this is how this works. I'm going to do it in front of you. And in the story, he would just be making music with these records and would pick up on it. I believe he's the catalyst for that. There were many others that did assist in that. Like there was this party called Hamster that had a heavy emphasis on new. innovative music, different music, and they played a lot of IG, a lot of G-Force, Modaji, things of that nature that wasn't particularly the big room idea. They were like really blazing a trail for new music in New York, and that was very exciting. But yeah, J-Lock was the guy who turned me on to 4Hero, IG, Seji, Domo, everyone that I love today. I mean, I still love all of that music today. You know, I mean, 4Hero is a huge inspiration for me because if you look at new jazz, broken beat, it has... I believe, for me, in my opinion, it has at its nucleus a part of the idea of what hip-hop could have been in its golden era. Interesting. Because of the musicality, but yet... rawness of the broken drum you know I mean the syncopation and the soulful aspect of slapping the bass line with you know rich moog like textures you know I mean it reminded me of future hip hop but in a danceable form but you know that was just my take on it and inspiration I got from that caused me to go even deeper into my own expression. So, yeah. You know, you're kind of one of the poster boys for the classic deep house sound. I mean, when did this... Was your music always like that? Was it always very rich, very musical, very emotional chords? Is that something that... Where do you kind of trace that back to? That comes down, again, I gotta give credit to my man J-Lock, because the thing is, like, there was a period where I stopped doing music for like two years. It was a very dark time. Like, you know, it was dark, but he had... gone on some travels in Europe and compiled a ton of music. And he comes back, and I'm on my way to work one day. And again, this is a very cosmic moment. I'm on my way to work, and we hadn't seen each other in a while. And I run into him, and we reconnect. He starts coming by my job and bringing me these compilation tapes. And on it... It's everything from Detroit techno to like Deep House to drum and bass to ambient, new jazz, broken beat, experimental, all types of things. And I had no equipment, nothing. I wasn't doing anything. I was just sitting on some crates, no turntables, just sitting on some crates. Right. And... I would listen to these cassettes going home, and it just kind of reconnected me. Like, you know why you don't feel great? It's because you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing. If something's missing, you put it in the spot that it's missing. What did I do? I started saving money, and it wasn't as easy to acquire equipment this time. I had to learn the value of why it is you do this. And piece by piece, I started getting back into it and realizing what it is I liked from everything that I was listening to. like what resonated the most and that's when I began to start focusing on more emotional aspects of stuff because that's really where for me that's where the substance is interesting so you were making music And then for whatever reason, life got in the way and you stopped for two years. And in your mind, that was kind of you just, you'd left making music behind. Well, I didn't have to force that to realize that, you know, there's more to life than meets the eye. Because, you know, how can you leave a part of yourself behind? You can't really like do that. It's like, I'm going to go across the street and leave my leg over there. You know, it kind So when you came back to it, that's what you realized had happened? I recognized a part of myself and life looked different. Amazing. And again, this is at a period, I have no inclination to make a record, make a project, call myself anything other than what my name is or DJ. No, this was just for me, the being, the person. feel a connection to this realm. You know what I mean? Because it's like, you know, I don't know, take anything that you do naturally and then take it away. You're going to feel a certain way. And however that turns out, it's going to affect other areas of your life. So it's like, the thing returns, you feel like, ooh, this is the way it's supposed to be. That's interesting. I guess, you know, we're not all artists. We probably maybe don't all have that. But you kind of had, it's kind of like, you know, an artist, it takes a certain amount of time for them to discover this craft or whatever it is that brings them this kind of complete feeling. Well, I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that. Right. I mean, I would agree with you, like the... The attention to identify these things, you go a bit deeper than the average person, but I believe everyone has something in their life that they can identify with that particular phenomena. It doesn't necessarily have to be an artistic expression. It could be an expression towards humanitarianism or an expression towards... It's like... a part of you that feels natural in doing a certain process. I mean, it can be as basic as what you eat in the morning. If you stop having coffee, that's going to make you feel a certain way. But then you bring it back, it makes you feel another way. It's just how deep do you want to go into your own experience, I would say. When was it that you realized that music could be a profession and this could go to the next level in that respect? I would say when I moved to Berlin, actually, because to be honest with you, okay, Reactions of Light came out in 2007. Now, that was supposed to be the last thing I was ever going to do with music, period. Why was that? Because I realized that I wasn't going to be able to make a living doing it. And I'm like, screw it. I got to go get like a government job. Easiest government job to get is at the post office. Because the rumor is if you work at the post office, you can drink on the job. So that was my life goal, believe it or not. And it's amazing how it didn't work out that way. Looking back, yeah, that was pretty ridiculous. But at the time, it seemed practical. given what my life goals were. It's like I just, you know, because the thing is, I knew exactly what I wanted to do, what made me feel best and made me want to strive to be better, and that was just creating. And at the time, digital was taking over. CDs were on the decline. And at that time, I didn't realize what was the mechanism behind these two things and the effect that they have on sustainability as far as a business model goes. I mean, I had no clue. All I knew is I was still looking at it from a consumer's perspective. oh, you mean to tell me I don't have to buy the entire CD? I can just pick the tracks that I like? And from that perspective, yeah, it's an advantage. But then if you had to look at it from the perspective of the artist or the person running the label, that's a huge detriment because now you're fragmenting a product. When I saw what that looked like on paper after doing some digital releases, I'm like, I can't even pay a phone bill with this. So I'm dedicating this amount of hours and it's not equaling to the value. in so maybe I should go work at the post office and then I could do it on my own time So I guess DJing wasn't what was going on then were you playing at all or? No I was doing like little small things I had an internet radio show I'd been doing for a few years and you know every now and again I would pop up at like a record shop like Used to play music at Liquid Sky when it was open, you know, and, you know, stuff like that. But nothing, like, professionally. But when Reactions to Light came out, I have to say, I did get my very first professional gig. Big up to E-Man for doing that for me. I played his party, and two people showed up. So, yeah, that was my, I thought, okay, well, that was it. That was my career. It came and went in one night. Now I can, like, really focus on the post office. Wow. So, yeah, I mean, I guess yours is a kind of classic story in the way, in the terms of the way the industry changed and that, you know, one day producers could make a decent living just from their music and the next day they couldn't. And the only way to support making music would be to go out and DJ. I didn't even know that. That's the thing. I mean, there was no plan whatsoever. Like, I had no clue to that. Period. Like, I didn't know nothing about getting on any plane, passport, none of that. What I thought was, okay, you make a product, consume it, and you either break even or you make some profit. You make some profit, you could make another project. That's what I thought. I had no idea. None whatsoever. Interesting. I mean, you'd seen these, I guess, so I guess you having, you know, obviously you were a fan of these DJs. I guess you thought that was one world. And I guess you thought what you did was a completely separate thing. Totally. That's exactly what I thought. Because the thing is, like, at the time, you still had, like, you know, mixed compilations, stuff like that. And I loved those because there was a period where I couldn't afford to buy records. And in the loops somehow and know what was going on. And I would buy like, you know, Mix the Vibe, you know, stuff like that. I would get like, you know, Ministry of Sound CDs, you know, you know, Body and Soul CDs and stuff like that. And yeah, I mean, I would follow like whatever I could find. on the DJs that were doing that. But I never aspired to it. Because, I mean, it was something I did at home. I did it on the internet, you know. I didn't think that that was a profession possible for me. Your first gigs in Europe were in Germany, is that right? Yes. With Move D? Yeah, at Cube, Heidelberg. Nice. Was that, by that point, were you kind of more established as a DJ or was that another kind of opening experience? I had a show, Motion FM, and Big Up to Pardos. That show was very important for me because the thing is, I did it religiously and it was definitely a love thing because the music that I was playing, it was all things that were feeding me. We're going to go beyond any artistic aspiration. So it's like what you need to hear to make you feel okay in life. That's what the music was doing for me. And it was, you know, Move D shows up at pretty much every show. And I had no clue who he was. All I knew was his music. It was like a lot of... stuff, Lawrence, so on. All the people who I know and love today was whose music I was playing. I never thought in any of that experience to include my own stuff, just what gave me a lot of that time. It wasn't something I thought about. I didn't think anybody was actually listening. I'm just contributing to a much bigger thing. And that was it. I left it at that. I didn't really think how that would transpire. I mean, did that have something to do with it? Oh, I think it was a little bit of that. And then I did this record when Soul People Music became a physical label. And there was a record on my first EP as Fred P. called Every Day that became a popular movie. He liked it and thought it was, I guess, interesting enough to bring. And that's my first trip to Europe ever. Had to get my passport renewed. It was cool, though, because it's like, this is going to be my one stamp. Right. I mean, when you were making music initially and before and after the kind of darker period, were you bouncing off other people? I feel like maybe you were just making it and it was kind of going out there and there wasn't much feedback coming back in. Did you have a sense that you were good at this thing? I was sure my music was my magic. like maybe once or twice a week, get together at his place. And we would just, first, we would listen to all the new stuff he acquired, like, you know, things that he thought was interesting. And then we would listen to my stuff. And, you know, he would give me subtle critiques or harsh critiques, you know, about it. And, you know, he would give me food for thought, which was very valuable at that time. Because the thing is, you know, it's a very difficult thing to, like, say, I'm going to make something and present it to people back then. Today, it's very easy now. That's not even in the general consciousness anymore. Like, the idea of hubris doesn't exist. You know what I mean? But back then, because there are so many luminaries with such a high level. Say you're going to present something. Right. It's daunting. And he would give me really, really good food for thought without changing my perspective of how to go about it. Because someone could tell you. you know, one thing and it makes you change the way you do everything and then you don't sound like you. Or it can kind of give you an idea of what to look at and make better without telling you how to go about that, which is way more liberating because then you begin to have a better way of thinking. For sure. It's just about guiding the person to make those decisions themselves. Yeah. So I got to get, I got to big up my man, Shay, for that because he was always there in the early years. Like I shared like all the really super raw, like before reactions of like, like the stuff that like was like, you know, making make a face confusion as to what that is type of stuff. You know, to this day, actually, to this day, I still share my music with him. He's like one of maybe two I do that with. Okay. And was he the only person back then because you felt self-conscious about it and you felt nervous to share it with people? No. It's just, I knew nobody else was going to understand. But I knew he understood because he's the one who, like, turned me back on to it. So it's like, okay, this is someone I could trust to at least be, you know, be a blank slate and just tell me the truth. Am I going too deep into my own language? And he would always say the right thing that would define it clearly. So that way present the best perspective that I could. Amazing. I think you sort of touched on it in your last answer, but something you said last year, with the technology we have now, dance music should be somewhere else completely. And I guess just to finish, I wanted to kind of expand on that. It's an interesting statement. I think the thing that's missing from dance music right now is musicality. There's a lot less orchestration, arrangement, songwriting. All those things seem to have disappeared. And I attempt to touch on that with this album, like, you know, bringing in musicians and doing some arrangements. All these things are kind of subtle because, you know, I'm still in the evolutionary process myself. But I believe that songs with words are important. I believe that not relying so much on a computer is important. However... turning the computer itself into an instrument instead of it being the means of it. Because ultimately, before things became so automated, before things became so digital, incredible life-altering types of music was being made with people with just their hands. with just their voices, with just the inspiration. So why are things less warm now? Why are things less moving now? Now there's lots of beautiful moving things. However, you have the technology literally in your to-go anywhere. Why not exploit that? So that's what I meant by that. Because, I mean, if you think about, again, the 21st century, we thought cars would be flying. People would be teleporting from one part of the earth to the other, you know, that kind of thing. Now, that might not necessarily be the reality at this moment, but in theory, thought-wise, you can say what you think and someone on the other side of the planet can respond to you in real time. That is a huge step. For humanity. So if we look in terms of music, I don't say everything has to be like hyper complicated or super intricate. However, musically, we can be saying a lot more. So as well as the kind of advancements in technology, is this also coming from you just listening to dance music these days and just not being so impressed? Just your usual, I don't know, maybe your usual labels, artists, or just generally stuff you hear when you're out in clubs, just not being so... It's fear, man. That's all. It's fear. You find something that works and you stick to it instead of, like, being fearless and just trying something that, you know, failed terribly. But that's usually where the dopest stuff comes from is when you let it all hang out, you know? So... We're now in this strange phase where... You know, you were a producer who couldn't make it work because you weren't a DJ, but now the best way to make it as a DJ is to be a producer and to get a tune out there. Funny how that works out. The thing is, you know, I mean, I figure, you know, it's like a blind man being a carpenter, you know, that kind of thing, because the thing is, it's like... Again, when I first started making music, making products, there was none of that. I had no clue of that. And now this is my primary way of doing my thing. It turned me into, I think, I guess, an adequate DJ. I mean, other people would have to judge, but it's funny how that works out. you know, one feeds the other. And I'm grateful that it does because, yeah, that's what I love to do. I love to make records. I love to make albums. I love to create sonic things and find ways for it to make sense for the people that like to listen to what I do, you know? And in some cases, there's a majority of music that I make that only gets heard in the club. And then in some cases, there's music that comes out that I never play in the club. But I mean, if I didn't have that facility, what would my reality look like? Thank you. you you
