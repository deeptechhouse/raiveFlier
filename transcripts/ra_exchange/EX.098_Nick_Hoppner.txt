you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Nick Hopner is the label manager of Asgut Ton, the label arm of Berlin's Berghain and Panorama Bar Club. He's also a fantastic DJ. and a producer, too. Indeed, you might just say that he's a jack of all trades. But it wasn't necessarily supposed to be this way. As you'll hear in this extensive sit-down with Hoppner, all of it happened pretty much organically. We caught up with the Berlin-based Hoppner earlier this week. I read that you grew up or you moved to Hamburg at some point. So were you born there? No, I was born in a small town called Cuxhaven at the North Sea, which is 120, 130 kilometers away. And it's like at the mouth of the river Elbe, which is going through Hamburg as well. strong family ties so my my my mom's family and my dad's family are both like mainly from Hamburg and so it was kind of an obvious choice for me to move there after after school because I had a I had a cousin there about the same age as me and And he was something like a friend. And so I moved there for the Zivildienst, which is what you do when you don't want to go to the army in Germany. I did that for 15 months. So people either moved to Berlin back then or they do this when they don't want to be in the army. No, I mean, if you don't want to do any kind of service at all, you would have moved to Berlin, but in the 80s, you know, because in the 90s, you know, it was West Germany everywhere. So you couldn't get out of it. This exception for Berlin wasn't working anymore. So I couldn't. have got out of the obligation at all. So, yeah, I mean, every German male is obliged to do this kind of thing, and I didn't want to go to the army. And so you do this kind of civil services, which is always three months longer, and I started that in Hamburg in late summer of 92. What were you doing in the civil service? I was at the Werner Otto Institute, which is like a sociopediatric center for all sorts of psychological and also physical problems. I took care of... There were like two... stations or wards if you want where kids would go for a longer period of time and stay there and then it had like all like the whole variety of therapists like logopedists can you say so No, I'm not sure. When kids have problems with speaking properly, like starting to speak very late or like lisping, I don't know the English word. Have a lisp. Or like a really small vocabulary or something, then that's a therapist like teaching. them like techniques to speak properly and psychologists, doctors, nurses, teachers, like all this kind of things. And it was like from pretty mild ADHS or whatever you call it in English to like multiple multiple handicapped kids. But then luckily I got the chance to intern for a small music and events magazine, like the local office, Hamburg office. for a magazine which was national, based out of Berlin. It was called Flyer Updates. And yeah, I interned there for a while. And then the guys who edited it before me, like one got really sick, the other wanted to finish his studies. So I became the editor. And yeah, I did that for, I don't know, two, three years or something. And that led... To use listings sort of thing. Yeah, listings, events, event news, and a bit like resident advisor in printed form. And yeah, but... of course just on a national scale but there were like offices in Hamburg Cologne Munich Leipzig Berlin of course and Tilo Schneider from Groove Magazine was working in Berlin. And then one day I got a call from one of my Berlin editors, Olga Blumhardt, if I wanted to... work for meet thomas koch djt who was publishing groove magazine if i was interested in meeting him because he was looking for a new um for new editorial staff because he fell out with his uh with his uh former former editors And then I met him and we got along. You were already a big fan of Groove. You were a big fan of the magazine Groove before that. You knew about it. Yeah, of course. It was pretty popular and for free. And whenever I went record shopping then... Like every two months I got the magazine. Were there particular writers that you were interested in or was it just the writing? No, it was just a source of information, you know, like around mid to late 90s, you know, that there was like... front page later on Debug and Groove Magazine those were and Specs as well you know they did cover dance music and electronic music in general as well but it wasn't like today where you had like all sorts of information at a fingertip, at a click of the mouse. So it was really important to read it and a lot of the times it was pretty interesting. gave me a lot of clues of, I think, the guys who ran it before us did a pretty great job. What do you remember? Like, was there a genre or a particular artist that your, like, groove magazine introduced me to that thing? Was there anything that... Oh, I can't think of anything in particular. like i always they sometimes did like bigger background stories like traveling to detroit and meeting all the players and giving you quite a good impression of the overall situation and how everything was intertwined or not, you know, like they also like didn't spare out on the beef people had with each other. So, and yeah, I liked those kind of stories and in general, like reading the reviews, you know, although that was... Always a bit frustrating because whenever I read about something, they were hyping a lot. It was really hard to get hold of it in the record shops in Hamburg, although we had some pretty fine record shops in Hamburg. Where were the record shops? I mean, what were the record shops that you were going to when you first started doing stuff? There was Container Records, which was pretty huge. They were a distribution company at one point as well. And their shop was directly located on Reeperbahn, the center of the red light district. And that's where I bought a lot of stuff. They stocked everything. I bought a lot of jungle and drum and bass there because that's what I was mainly interested in in 1994, 1995. That was my first proper connection to club culture. I was going out to jungle nights. the time. Were there a lot of jungle nights? Yeah, yeah. I would say it was pretty popular. A lot of local crews and then some bigger clubs like Mojo Club for example was at the... at one end of the of the reaper barn who did like a jungle and drum and bass night every friday i think and they like booked all the big names and i would go there like almost every friday and i i kind of saw them all and then there were a couple of local crews like doing it in in very small like places first the first jungle night i ever went to was at um Störtebäcker, which is kind of the club and concert location of the Hafenstraße squad. And it was a night with Silly Walk Sound System, which was a big, or still is a big, reggae and dancehall sound system in Hamburg, and when Jungle was dominated by... like rugger and dancehall influences they they had a rather short phase of doing um jungle nights as well and i ended up there and it was pretty small like maybe 150 people super super crowded like sweat dripping from the ceiling and people with spray cans you know like lighting them off like huge huge flames blowing across the room and yeah that's that's I was really impressed by it that was really that really got me into it and then I was following it as a fan and also started buying records without the ambition of being a DJ or something. But I just had to get the music and listen to it at home. It was really hard to find tapes. There wasn't this kind of tape culture as there was in the UK, for example, where every big rave issued... whole recordings like a week after six tape collection or whatever so um i i'd rather buy 12 inches and listen to it at home so how did you when did you first start djing Well, I was hooked right away, but I was pretty broke all the time. So I was interested in it, but I always had like an old Torrens record player at home, which had a seamless pitch from 33 to 44. put the handle in different positions and adjust the tempo. And then I had a CD player and then I got from the flea market a really shabby mixing desk with those cheap sound effects which were used in reggae and dance. hall sound systems as well you know dropping bombs and gunfire and and I got that for a couple of Deutschmarks and then I started mixing at home with CDs and records but I could only do one seamless mix like from CD to record you know because I could adjust the tempo and then when I was doing tapes like I had always one seamless mix and the other direction I had to find just pads, beatless sections. I could mix back into the CD player. It must have influenced some of your record buying. You need to get these tracks with pads in them so I can mix. Yeah, I mean, that was like early to mid-90s, you know, like horizontal dancing was a big buzzword and I had like those kind of CD compilations. I was interested in a lot of stuff and in a lot of downbeat and ambient kind of things. A lot of tracks with beats would always have a section where it all went down. without any beats. But that was, I mean, it was just for me, you know, like I didn't even give those tapes to anyone. It was just for me and for fun. And then a bit later I started playing records, I wouldn't call it DJing, at a place in Hamburg called "Egal Bar", which translates to "whatever bar". It was at the Karowiertel in the city center, like part of St. Pauli. And in that bar, they had a calendar behind the bar where you could just sign yourself up for a gig. and no one would ask what kind of music you would play. It was pretty anarchic in a way. And I did that with two friends. And at first, just a couple of times. And then it was so nice because... we would just do what we would do at home anyway, you know, drink beer, play our favorite records we have just bought, or, you know, it was like really three friends getting together, and there was no money involved, you know, drinks were free, and we could play music, and it was a pretty basic rundown place, you know, with a Tisch Fußball thing, and... Pretty punk in a way. And yeah, we did that. Was there dancing involved? Sometimes. Later on, because that's what I was trying to get at. They had two... two turntables there, not even Technics or something, like really cheap plastic bell-driven things, a little mixer with a phone thing to cue or to pre-listen. At the beginning, we just played record after record, you know, like from post-rock, like we were really into Tortoise and The C and Cake, this whole Chicago thing. And then also Warp and FX Twins, Squarepusher, but also the occasional techno and house record, you know, like... And just because we could, you know, we started to try and mix there. You know, like I think I started it because I was getting more into techno in the house and then I thought, why not try it? And I kind of did my first mix there, like without... you know just trying i was rehearsing in public so to say but it was it didn't matter you know because it was the place was quite aptly titled egalba it was it was like whatever and um yeah and then uh it slowly evolved into something more techno and house based and one friend Dropped out later and then only Kai and me, Kai is my oldest friend from Hamburg and even from school times, he runs Liebe Detail out of Hamburg and we continued to do the night there. We would sign ourselves up for one Thursday every month for a year or something or half a year. And yeah, and then we took it from there. Then some people noticed us and asked us to play at student parties or private parties. Were you already doing the events thing by that time? The flyer, the magazine. Were you already doing that by the time you'd started DJing? I think a little later. We did that, or maybe it was around the same time. I can't quite remember. I mean, then after a while, Kai moved to Hamburg, actually. Now I remember. to do the marketing side of things for our office, for the Flyer magazine. And I edited it and he was selling ads. And so we would work together during the day and DJ together at night. So when Thomas came to you about working for Groove, you needed to move to Berlin? No, no, no. At that point the office was still in Frankfurt and I would go to Frankfurt always to produce the issue because it was bi-monthly. I could go to Frankfurt for a month and then go back to Hamburg. And, yeah, I did, like, the first issue I did, I did with Thomas Lötz, who was, like, a journalist, but he was more kind of an emergency editor, you know, because I couldn't have possibly done it on my own. You know, I was quite a greenhorn and super... super excited and I anyway like we did the first issue together and then he dropped out again then Heiko Hoffmann came in and he was coming from Berlin obviously he was like a freelance music journalist already and then one or two issues later Thilo Schneider came in And then we did a couple of issues out of Frankfurt. Then for another two issues, we had an office in Hamburg. And then... Then the idea came up to open an office in Berlin because Thilo and Heiko were coming out of from Berlin already anyway and on a national level this kind of concentration process of the dance music industry if you want had already started and it seemed like a like a good idea to move there. And because I really enjoyed my job and I made the decision to move to Berlin as well. And that was in 2001. Like I came here April 1st, 2001. Started working for Groove in 99. and then did the job for another two years and then left. What did you do there? Were you the head editor? No, that was Heiko already. And I was kind of the reviews editor. And then later on, I edited the festival guide and, of course, did a couple of features. But I was in charge of the review section. Do you like writing reviews? I liked it at first, but then towards the end of my job there, I felt I was... running out of the right vocabulary and phrases and metaphors and similes so i i at the end i really grew to hate it you know because also because i had my personal tastes and but i had to try to cover a whole range of reviews you know i would have liked to do it differently, just stuff I really like myself. But of course you can't do it with a magazine like that. And also I had a problem with... like with politics behind the scene in a way, you know, it's like it was always different. We got into serious trouble sometimes when we really spoke or wrote our minds or if one of our authors did, you know, it was always. There was quite a huge expectation of us always being friendly in a way. And when we tried to take journalism seriously, someone was hitting our fingers or trying to. It was, yeah, that was a little frustrating. You know, I think it would have made sense to be a bit more outspoken about certain things, but it wasn't really working. Of course, it's problematic when it's a free magazine. You're depending on advertising. When someone's spending a couple of grand sometimes for the back page or something, it's really hard to, it's near impossible to be, to criticize something that's actually feeding you. It's quite a dilemma. You were DJing around this time, all throughout this time as well, I assume, in Berlin. Yeah, I mean, I came here as a hobby DJ, so to say. Like, just before I left Hamburg for the last one and a half years, I DJed. on a more regular basis because a couple of friends and me really, really fell in love with UK Garage and Two-Step. and we were, which a lot of people in Hamburg didn't understand. They just thought it was cheesy and cheap music, which is true to a certain extent, you know, but I thought that was also one of the attractions of it, you know, not taking things too seriously. And also, like, it wasn't just cheesy and cheap all the time, you know. I found a lot of stuff very intricate, to be very intricate and elaborate and deep. And, like, the beat was just... was just too too good you know i was always a friend of beats and the two-step beat like this super swung out beats and those heavy syncopations was uh was like really nice and we did that on a on a weekly basis quite successfully and and uh that's kind of where um yeah where where where i uh got a better dj i think like i was a good training in a way But still, it wasn't really professional or I still hadn't an ambition of becoming a professional DJ. It was always out of the love for the whole thing and the music. And then I came here to Berlin and a couple of months after, like early summer 2001, we got invited to host a groove night. in the garden area of the old Osgut and Panorama Bar. They already had a small garden area, which was usually just open on a Sunday morning to afternoon. But for that night, we already started DJing at night. It was DJ T, Dorian Pike from Frankfurt as well. who ran or still runs Raum Musik, I think, and me. And then the owners quite liked my set, invited me again months later at Panorama Bar. And again, they liked it. And a month or two months later, I sort of became a resident. And then it got a bit more serious. And that was kind of my starting point like 11 years ago. And before that, it was like a hobby, fun, friends. What was the old Ascot like? Amazing. No, I mean, for me it was the first, it was kind of a new, a fresh start for everything. You know, I just moved to Berlin. I haven't been going here like throughout the 90s, you know, somehow I felt... felt very happy in Berlin and in Hamburg and never really like got the signs in a way. Like a lot of friends were going to Berlin on a regular basis, but I didn't. So yeah, I mean, I came here after the 90s, you know, when techno grew into like insane. proportions and it must have been like mayhem madness whatever like in the end of the 90s 1.7 million people for a love parade and And I came here, I think, in the aftermath of that, where everyone was kind of going back to their basements and offices, maybe still a little shocked about what has just happened. I think there was kind of a feeling that things were over big time still in the air. But on the other hand, there were... clubs like VMF which had a pretty eclectic approach to clubbing. Of course they had the main floor with techno and house and residents like Dixon but also a second floor where they would play hip-hop and IDM, electronica, pretty... pretty wild mix of things so but yeah I mean I came here I had the feeling like it was pretty pretty varied on the one hand but very subdued as well you know there wasn't like a there wasn't like a notion of proper hedonism in the air and then Then I went to the old Panorama Bar for the first time in my life. It was April 30th, 2001. Metro Area were playing live. And I just couldn't believe it. I felt... Although I hadn't experienced all the crazy and great clubs in the 90s in Berlin, I had the feeling that this was kind of in the line of what was going on here in the 90s. And I had a strong feeling of, how do you say? of things being possible there and not being judged for who you are. You could go in there and reinvent yourself completely. You could leave your personality at the door and be someone else. And I didn't feel... checked out or anything you know it was quite anonymous in a way but in a very uh in a very uh liberating way you know and uh so uh yeah i i And then I started going there on a regular basis and then I got the chance to DJ there. And then during that time, Panorama Bar got more and more popular. You know, before, like when the play started, just as Osgood with the techno floor downstairs, it was pretty exclusively gay. And then over the... course of two years or three years like a lot more um like ravers heterosexuals like other people like um noticed it and started going there and then something i think uh yeah something very special evolved there like it was uh to this date i think i haven't seen uh a place more special than that, actually. It was pretty great, pretty amazing. Maybe that's also because it was the first time I got immersed in such a scene. In Hamburg, it was always very different, a lot more quiet and controlled in a way. at least for me, and that place was completely out of control in a really good way. What do you think the owners noticed about your set and liked about it when they first heard you playing? Did they say, "Oh, that track," or something? No, I think, I mean, I don't, I have never thought about that, actually. But what I think is that I just did what I did, you know. I didn't have a history as a DJ, especially not in Berlin. And I wasn't aware of which music was allowed and which not, you know, which kind of tracks were no. go or overplayed or something so I just played I just played as myself you know not thinking about the history of tracks and whether people would have heard them too much already you know I mean I didn't have like a like a super huge record collection, you know, like I tried to make my set work with what I had and I think maybe that left a fresh impression or something because I wasn't thinking in schools or genres or do's and don'ts. I don't know. Maybe that was it. I'm always very curious to see first time Panorama Bar or Burgheim DJs play because I'm always interested in whether or not they... you know, play things that you're kind of like, well, how can you play this here? Or whether they get too nervous and maybe overthink it. It's really interesting to be at a club that has a reputation and then, you know, have these DJs who may or may not know or think about it in that way. And I always think the best... sets I see are the people who probably don't think about it. Yeah, totally. Very much. I mean, after all, Panorama Bar Berghain is a nightclub, you know, and although I know a lot of people are projecting a certain sound aesthetic or aesthetics in general onto it, you know, I don't think there is. a sound of Panorama Bar or a sound of Berghain. Of course, the place is focusing on residents a lot and they have a very strong and identifiable sound in a way. But if you look at them all, they're so different from each other that... I don't really know where it's actually coming from. And I think you're right. People shouldn't try to adapt to an idea of a sound they think is relevant for that place. They should just do what they want to do. I think what people should... should do is be aware of the fact that they can get away with stuff there which they wouldn't get away with in other places. I think that's something that goes for Berghain and Panorama, that you can take risks easier, I think. But maybe that's not true as well. But for me, I've got the feeling. That's true for me and I hope that goes for a lot of other DJs. The OSCOT closed at a certain point because I guess the city wanted to build this enormous O2 arena. Yeah, there was this redevelopment plan for the area. The old place was right there where the O2 arena is today. So it was always clear it was temporary. So around the time that it had closed and they hadn't opened up a new place, you were just DJing around wherever? Yeah, I was. By that time, I... I was like on the local circuit, if you want. There was like one of the bar guys of the old Panorama Bar started a party series at Pfeffer Bank on Schönhauser Allee. And that was once a month, I think, called Labrador Bar. And Boris would play there and me and Carsten Kleemann, which I later started My My With with Lee Jones and a couple of other local DJs. I think Tom Clark was playing there and sometimes Jens Bond, you know, it was like... Yeah, it was like a local DJ circuit and that went on for... exactly that kind of gap time. And then I would play like one of parties in different kinds of locations. But yeah, I got, I played quite a lot of times locally here in Berlin in that time. And then maybe a year after, after the old Osgood closed, which was like the last party there was January 4th, 2003, and maybe a year later or nine months later, I heard that the guys have found a new place and were planning on opening a new place. And that got me thinking because I wasn't really happy in the job I was doing back then. And I remember they were always already talking about a label during the times of the old Osgood. And I thought maybe I should just approach them and suggest that we're doing it now. You didn't have any experience running a label? No, I was working for a label, but not with a lot of responsibilities. kind of running the warehouse and doing bits of promos, but more like really low-key function at that place. Why do you think they took a chance on you? I don't know because I think because I like the fact I I just went there and suggested it and they felt I was motivated and they couldn't think of anyone else. And also that never was their kind of thinking to lay out a business plan and then find the best and most skilled person for the job. you can find I think a lot of their decisions were gut decisions in a way. And that's what's so great about the place. They gave me a lot of trust in advance and then we just took it from there. And in the summer of 2005, I started licensing. the Berghain 01 by André Galluzzi without a clue, you know. And then he was pretty complicated, like giving me track list after track list after track list. Like in the end, I think I have licensed like 40 tracks, so we could have done like three mixes at once. And you thought that was going to be one of the only releases, right? Yeah, that was the only idea, like a mix CD. And I thought maybe we'll do a couple of mix CDs. But I said, let's do a mix CD and then see how I do my job, how it goes. We asked Compact because they had their... They had a club night there, like a label night every Friday once a month, like a couple of other labels. And so that was quite natural to ask them because they were involved with it already. And they said yes, and they didn't want to see a release plan, a business plan or anything. They just said, okay, like... manufacture that CD, deliver it to us, we'll distribute it. And that was it. And that went really well, like immediately without a lot of promotion. We did promotion on it, but in a very short amount of time, you know, because we were very much behind schedule and la la la. But yeah, and then that was out, and then we didn't really think or work about the label, but a couple of weeks later, Ben Clock and Marcel Detman showed up at Michael's office, one of the owners, and dropped a demo, and that became the first. Vinyl 12-inch. You've focused quite a bit on residence music, though. Was the idea always, I guess, with the mix CDs that you were thinking in the beginning, maybe we do always residence just to showcase the sound of the club? I didn't think in terms like that. I just thought it was a really great idea to... work with local talent and only with the ones involved with the club. I just love that. Not to buy into established structures or DJs or producers, like DIY in a way. Like Ostgut and the old Panorama Bar in the early days of... although it was much bigger and a much bigger infrastructure and of course it must have cost a lot of money to build this thing you know there wasn't ever a feeling of financial pressure or anything it was like the early times was very much influenced by this kind of DIY thought, you know, like, let's do it, let's try it, and let's do it with the guys around us, the guys and girls around us. That was really the only and the first idea. And then it, I mean, we would... we would have never thought it would turn into what it is today. You know, it was, yeah, it was like a great... I don't know how to say. Of course, we all knew that the Berghain was a special place and it should become successful in a way, but it's not like I... I would have thought like seven years later, parties would go into Monday morning and every newspaper in the world would have written their shitty piece on it. It became, with the label, I guess, you were talking about defined the sound of the club, and the label has helped define the sound of the club in a lot of ways, I think, for people outside of it. Yeah, of course. And I wonder if that's something you thought about at any point and said, man, we need to... No, really honestly, at the beginning, I never thought about sound or image or anything or how... how there was a cross-pollination of the label and the club, you know. I was providing an infrastructure people could use, you know. And honestly, at the beginning, like, we sent some of our records into mastering without us having heard them, you know, because it... It was like, you are the artists, you make the decision, you need to be happy with the music. If you think this is... What's one that you sent without listening to? to the mastering? I think I haven't heard the first one, the Dead Man and Clock one. And also, I'm not sure I heard the... the Prosuma and Murat Tepeli debut album. I think maybe, I mean, that was also at times when Michael was still more involved with the label. Maybe he heard more than I did, but I'm pretty sure like the first couple of releases, I hardly heard anything. Because I understood myself as an officer, you know, like really, I didn't want to, I didn't have a master plan. So there wasn't any influence I could exert. Can you say so? Can you say so? So I was there to like make sure deadlines are kept. Invoices are paid, sleeves are manufactured, everything's at the distributor in time. That was my self-understanding, you know, and anything artistic or creative was more taken care of between artists and Michael. So for me, it's true. I haven't heard a couple of things, but maybe Michael has heard everything before it went. But still, there wasn't ever a case of him or us saying, this isn't good enough, or you should do it this way, longer, shorter, different arrangement. It was always 100% in the hands of the artist. When did you know that the label was a success or a thing? I mean, was there a certain release where you're like, wow, there's a lot of response? Yeah, for the first Deadman & Clock, you know, we just released it. Really, for 12 inches to this day, we hardly do any promo at all. We have a couple of white labels for our residents and DJ. DJs passing through the club and we send out a couple of press packs to media and to a couple of other DJs but we don't do a large scale big promotion for 12 inches different for the mixes and albums but So we just manufactured the record, no promo at all, and the response was huge, you know, immediately from a lot of different fields of techno in the house. I think, like, I was really surprised. I think even, like, someone like Steve Buck played and charted it. Maybe I'm wrong, but... Like one of those guys you would have never expected to feel this kind of record. So that was a big surprise already. And I didn't see that coming. That was early 2006. And the club was open for a bit more than a year at that time. And so you couldn't really speak of a huge hype. Of course, it was interesting for Berlin, but that international thing hadn't even started. So that's where I thought, okay, wow, now we got a label. People are actually into it and buying it and charting it without... us, yeah, just on the back of the music because we didn't push it, we didn't push it down anyone's throat, so to say. And then, yeah, and it's so... sold really well and then the second one by Paul Bridgett same thing again no promotion we put it out there sold really well again and then Muscle Deadman's first solo record was the next one and it was pretty much on point from the beginning But then the fourth one was Len Farky's Rainbow Delta, Mekong Delta, and that completely blew up and sold a lot of records to this day. That's one of our best sellers. I think that even that kind of crossed over a little because it was a very accessible techno record and a very contemporary one. You know, it wasn't so much influenced by like 90s techno. It was like a pretty contemporary one. And I think that that got us a lot of attention from... from DJs and people who haven't been aware of the label before. I guess you're quite lucky that all of these residents seem to be quite talented and that they weren't really working. Some of them were not working with other labels before. I wonder if you knew that you... something early on I mean did you think that it could be as big as it is has become no no I mean that I mean in that only came in 2008 when when we put out the first set album And then you, like, we ended up at the top spot of labels. You know, I didn't see that coming, to be honest. But that's, 2008 was clearly the breakthrough year, if you want. And that's when I fully realized what was going on. But before that, it was... Yeah, I don't know. I didn't have the... I had the feeling we were doing something great, but I still didn't have that vision that it would become something like it became. How have things changed? Well, it has become more of a business. We have released a lot more records than we did in the early days. In the early days, gaps between releases were pretty long, so it was really easy going. And then, yeah, the more releases you have, the more work you get, the more routines you get, the less exciting it gets. in a way although the music is always good but you know when you it's the process behind the scenes is always the same so I and so it yeah it got it became more of a job for me you know and because and responsibility grew bigger and Of course, then, like the whole way of thinking about it changes when you realize. that a lot of people are aware of the label and certain expectations form and then you realize you aren't fulfilling those expectations because you're releasing a lot of different music and people think the label stands for a certain sound and not every record is catering for that sound. Yeah, then you, all of a sudden you get a lot of, respect and love and then those times end you know and then everything is going back to a bit more normal situation you know and you just yeah the label's still there the good music's still there but not everyone is as excited about it anymore as they were like two years ago So things go. And yeah, a lot of our guys and girls becoming very, very popular, traveling a lot, spending less time in the studio. And yeah, I mean, things change, but that's what... makes it interesting too. And I mean, this year we cut it down a little, we're releasing a little less. Only three big projects, like my mix CD, Norman Notch's mix CD, and Barker and Baumegger debut album, which just got mastered, which I'm really, really happy about. It's going to be a really good album. And yeah, planning next year, which will become busier again, I guess. So yeah, I mean, things... have changed and changed and changed. And I don't know, it's, but I think that's natural for. This mix CD that's coming out soon. One of the things that you said in an interview a while ago is the label. with the mix CDs is hopefully moving to more exclusives on these mix CDs to make them something special. And you have a couple of exclusives on this one, right? Yeah, four. Yeah, I was thinking about what to do with my mix, you know, like, for example, Ben Clock with this mix. CD went the exclusive route completely almost like there were like maybe three out of 17 or 18 tracks have been released before and the rest was exclusive or not previously unreleased at least and But in the end I decided to try to find, of course, exclusive tracks because I think it's always a great thing to discover. music you haven't heard before through also through a mix cd but i was a bit afraid of the situation when you ask a lot of really good producers for special and precious tracks and then not being able to gel them into something coherent you know i think i I was a bit afraid of that situation. I didn't want to risk that, you know, like asking tons of people for tons of tracks and then having to say to them, like, although I love it very much, I can't use this and this and that because I can't make sense of them in a way. So I just kept it to those four tracks and decided to use... quite a few tracks that have been important for me in the last decade or so. Like a lot of the stuff on there literally hasn't... left my bag for ages. I mean, by now, I don't have all of them with me anymore, but every one of those rather personal tracks have been with me for years and years. I was glad to hear that DJ Gregory song again. It's surprisingly on kitsune. I don't think a lot of people... are going back into their catalog to find a track that sounds like that. Who, you had The Mole, John McMillan, Matthew Stiles, and who was the fourth exclusive? Dexter. Dexter. Yeah. It seems like that's quite a... different mix of people yeah but that's that's uh yeah but that was kind of intended you know like because i like i i like a lot of different kinds of uh dance music you know and i always try to DJ like that as well you know like go from like go across a pretty wide spectrum you know that's what I'm interested in did you find it tough to do that in the span of a CD yeah I mean I worked a lot on it you know that like I had three three things I tried to achieve with it. I wanted to make it about tracks that meant a lot for me over the last 10 years or something. I wanted it to be a reflection of the panorama bar. And I wanted it to be pretty versatile. I wanted not just a deep house track. I didn't want to develop a tunnel kind of vision or feeling which is going down just one route. So it was pretty hard. But I think I pulled it off. I'm pretty happy with it. And I think I achieved my goals with it. What's next for you? Hopefully some... some original productions being released. After this interview, I'm going to the studio for the first time in... ages literally i became a father last october and had to split my time between like taking care of the family my label job djing having friends being a social being you know so i um studio time like uh went out the window um for yeah for the last six months or something so i'm And in the meantime, I'm sharing it with Steffi and she bought a lot of new gear and a nice new mixing desk. And I'm going in there today for the first time, like trying out. all the new stuff and like from and I still have a lot of promising unfinished business on my on my hard drive from when I was producing my Last 12-inch, which came out last year on Osguton. I started a lot of things there, which I might be able to finish. And I got the feeling that the next one will be a techno record. But I mean, don't take it for granted, but I have a lot of more techno. stuff on there to be continued exactly
