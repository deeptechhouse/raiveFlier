Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. When you go to see D-Tron, you're liable to Encounter House, Techno, and plenty in between. The major appeal, however, is that he does it all on three decks. For more than a decade, the Swiss DJs utilized the extra turntable to without the help of software. On his upcoming Balance Mix CD, Detron takes advantage of both styles of DJing in a two-disc masterclass. I caught up with Detron in July of this year to talk about DJing and producing music with his father and some of the tunes that shaped his career. You were born and raised in Switzerland, which is not normally known as a... house and techno sort of stalwart, I guess. I was wondering, you grew up and it came through hip-hop, your love of electronic music. Yeah, well, that's how I kind of heard about DJing first, because I saw the guy scratch and play records, and I was really fascinated by that. So this was very early. I think I was maybe 14 or something. And we had this little youth club that we would gather there. play records as much as that was possible. And yeah, so techno only came later, really. And what was it about hip-hop that was so appealing to you? Well, I think I got really fascinated by this DJing in the first place. I don't know for what reason, but it was just like, it really, I got really hooked. when I saw it and the whole hip-hop thing as well appealed to me because you know you had the you had the MC's and you had the sprayers and it was also a bit of a you know wannabe America b-boy thing like for many young guys so yeah that was it and I had read that your father though was Quite musical he was is very much into jazz. Mm-hmm. Well, that's his passion more so He's actually a professional musician But he plays classical music for the double bass in in the Bernie Symphony Symphony Orchestra still now he plays And jazz is just his free time. You were playing music only in your room. He wouldn't allow you to be playing hip hop. Yeah, he was quite open towards hip hop. But what he couldn't stand, I had my Prince and Michael Jackson period. And he was going mad at that. I wouldn't be allowed to play that on the stereo in his room, in the living room. Has he opened up over time? Actually, yeah. I think actually he lowered his bar over time because he was really hardcore, kind of, yeah. How do you describe that? Purist, a real jazz purist. But then nowadays he listens to everything. And sometimes he can bear with techno as well, but that's on rare occasions. So we won't see him out at any of your shows anytime soon. He's been to two shows in Bern and he quite enjoyed that, but it was a small club and it was more a house kind of thing, house kind of vibe and a lot of vocals and stuff. So that was okay for him. He played on a track, right, of yours? Yeah, that's true. Yeah, yeah. But that's, oh, that's so long ago. That was a track which came out on a seven inch single. initially and then compost licensed it for my first procreation 12 inch that's like the alter ego that i had for them how did the recording process go getting into the studio with him well um i had my studio in the basement of my parents house and so he would just come downstairs you know it was easy and i he had a professional mic because he had it from the orchestra and also from his he did some random jazz gigs and stuff so we just recorded note by note like so i could actually play it on the keyboard the double bass that was the first step and then he played some lines as well And so at the end of the day, I chopped everything together and that's how it happened. Were you into classical music, the stuff that he was playing in jazz growing up? Well, I've never really been into classical music, unfortunately, I must say. Why unfortunately? I think I still have to discover so much in this music, I guess. And it's just something that I still want to discover. But there's so much music around and, you know, you make your own music. And then when you listen to music, you sort of have to narrow down a little bit. So this is a field where I haven't really didn't get into it yet. But jazz, yeah. In the beginning, I didn't get it in the Michael Jackson Prince period. I hated his music and I really didn't want to have anything to do with his music. I'm sure it was just as much of a, this is my dad's music. Yeah, rebellion. But then at the time when we started kind of recording together, we only did it like twice or three times. He would play me his favorite jazz tracks and, you know, like Pharaoh Sanders' Astral Traveling. I don't know if that rings a bell. some others my favorite things john coltrane and you know the real big ones and i was like oh i was open by the time i was ready for this stuff you know can you pinpoint what you like about jazz or what jazz that you like, what clicked for you? Because I think it's interesting, you know, I think jazz, like techno, there's a certain moment for a lot of people where they're like, and then I heard this and it was just like, oh, of course. It's hard to describe, but... I think I was also fascinated by the way that jazz was sort of a free kind of music, you know? It was not based around these, like, themes. It was based around themes, but themes would break up loosely and you could hardly tell, is this my favorite things or not, when you know the standard, for instance. And I think this freedom in the music really... at that time was like, wow, I really want to be able to do this as well. But, you know, it seems like, um, also maybe this is around the same time, but I've read an interview that you said over time, you're the music that you've made has gotten more musical. I'm wondering if that's sort of connected in some way, that this sort of listening to more and different types of music has really opened up your own stuff. To a certain degree, for sure. But actually, at that time, when I started listening to his records and we started working together, the first reaction was this Procreation project, which was very jazz-related, also with samples and stuff. And then afterwards, I really got into this hard loop stuff, you know, so it's not really logical. But then after a while, you know, I thought maybe I can bring the two sides together closer. So that's maybe how it got more musical over time, you know? I mean, it's really good. I still really love a good, you know, a good techno record which has like a bass line and a bass drum pretty much. But there has to be more to music than that, I think. So walk me through, I guess, the early days of your hip hop DJing career. What sort of hip hop were you into? Was there a particular type that you were really drawn to in particular? Yeah, my heroes were Gangstar. I bought everything from them and I was a huge fan of Premiere. Everything he would touch, I was like, oh, this is so good. And then I had some weaker moments as well, like NWA and stuff, you know. But it was predominantly a Tribe Called Quest, Gangstar, De La Soul, that sort of stuff. Sort of the conscious. yeah hip-hop yeah and a lot of jazz samples yes definitely and i couldn't like my dad had this sly stone uh lp the one where he jumps up i forgot the name i'm not very good at names with records but uh i heard the sample on de la soul's first album or the second album and i was like aha So it was really cool to make that connection. And was it the... You kept sort of naming producers first, in a way. DJ Premier, everything he touched. Was it the music more than necessarily the rapping? Or was it both of them? It must have been, yeah. I mean, the rapping was always cool, but to me it was more like an instrument, an extra instrument to the music. Also because it was so rhythmical, it was like not really, really different from the pop music that I was listening to before. So I was interested in the whole thing. maybe also why I later wanted to try and make my own music, you know. Tell me about the scene in the city that you were in. Was there, were there a lot of people into hip hop at the time? Did it seem like, wow, this is, there's something going on here? Well, the place I grew up was like a tiny, is a tiny village in the countryside, not far from Bern. And there were maybe five people interested in that. And we had this youth club that I mentioned before, which would host like parties every Saturday. And we had to play, you know, slow time and disco hits. And then we could like... sometimes we can throw in some hip-hop and stuff, but it wouldn't really work for too long, you know? So, yeah, but then as soon as I got to college, I went to college. That was in a different town, like between Zurich and Bern somewhere. And, yeah, there was a big, big scene for hip-hop, actually, and a very... I remember most people were really violent, like, you know, fights and stuff, but not knife and, and, and shotgun, but more like, yeah, I take, take, I take your shoes and stuff like that. Yeah. It's funny to think about. I spoke to Loco Dice and he said there was also in Dusseldorf. when he was into hip-hop, there was this sort of... machismo this bravado uh these people were trying to act like you know from brooklyn or queens but it was dusseldorf yes yeah same i think it's a very typical thing to happen in at that time in europe i'm not sure about now but i guess it's same again so yeah um So how, I think I've read the story that it was a time you went into a record shop and you pumped the move, I believe. Yeah. Yeah. This is the track. When was this? I always try to figure out, but it must have been maybe 93. Is that possible? 92, 93. Yeah. And you had never heard anything like it before? Never, no. Well, I had heard some Todd Terry stuff, but I've never owned a record like that. Because a friend of mine, he was from this town where I went to college. He was a DMC champion, and then he was in the promo pool of DMC. So he got all this stuff. So he played me like a Todd Terry track, which was like hip hop. I thought it was hip hop, but it had this straight groove, but it didn't really click for me yet. But then this Pump the Move thing, it was like, oh my God, this is so it. So when you bought this record in the early, mid 90s, when did you actually start? playing more strictly house or techno? Already towards the end of this youth club thing, because that kept going on even after I went to college in another town. And we also threw some parties in the region and stuff. So we started playing house. And we were really impressed by... Like there was a DJ duo or DJ team, Mr. Mike and Jammin. Never heard of it. Although Jammin had a record on Strictly Rhythm and it went number one in the Billboard, I think. Or in the dance charts, I'm not sure now. But yeah, so we were really looking up to them. And that's how we started to kind of play more house or techno. Well, it kind of was together at that time. Were you talking with Mr. Mike and Jammin? Never. You were just, oh wow, in awe. Yeah, exactly. What was it about the way that they played? Was it just the music? It was partly the music and then the setting of these big, like, warehouse places and lots of people, the energy of the room. And also Mr. Mike would talk on the microphone and he would do it in an okay way, you know, at least if you hadn't heard anything like it before. It was pretty cool. And yeah, they would play. The good thing was, I think nowadays you would say they played trance. You know, trance in the beginning wasn't such a bad thing. Trance and house and techno at the same time and breakbeat sometimes as well. So that was really cool. You said that there were parties with different floors. What was going on? On the other floors. Well, there was always, usually the concept would be a techno floor, what we would call techno floor, like Ritchie Houghton, for instance. And I remember Neil Landstrom and Christian Vogel, people like that. And then a house room, like a happy house room. Jammin' and Mr. Mike, they were kind of this generalist room. It was working for everybody. So, yeah, because they mixed everything together, sort of. And there would always be a Gabba room as well, which is bad. And what's completely died nowadays, what's completely dead nowadays, chill-out rooms, like Mix Master Morris and stuff. You were drawn to the generalist room because there was a lot of flexibility? Yeah, I think so. You could hear a lot of different things? At least in the beginning, yeah. It was like that. And then I was drawn over to the techno side. To the evil side. Who drew you over to the evil side? What was the... is there a moment or a record or something like that that really caught you it's a very um cliche dj to name but uh it was jeff mills who was like i saw him play in itigan that's another suburb of burn there was a very um legendary club called stufenbau and he would not even put his records in his sleeves like they were it was a box of records out of their sleeves and he would just pick the records throw them back throw them on only play like a minute of one track spin backspin and other tracks and that was like action that i've never seen i've had never seen before he played like a hip-hop dj pretty much a really fast Yes, but he was good at beat matching as well, which many hip-hop DJs at the time didn't really do at all. Would you say that he's, I mean, not that you're going into clubs and throwing records behind you, playing them so fast, but would you say he's... a really big influence on the way that you DJed electronic music for a while. For sure. And I think there's still a lot of his style in my DJing, even if you don't really hear it that much. the way that I use records because I like to use three decks and only some records I would only take parts of and others yeah there are moments as well where I let the whole record play you know but there's certainly an influence there's certainly an influence from that very first experience that was so groundbreaking for me it was there's definitely something left in there Tell me about DJing with three decks. It seems so stupid to say. It seems hard. It seems really hard to keep track of it. Well, I've been doing it for maybe 10 years now, so it's not that hard anymore. I just need, well, I have a kind of a concept. I match two records and then add the third one. And I kind of found my method of figuring out which one is slow, too slow or too fast. I can't really say how, but most of the time it works. Sometimes it doesn't work, because it can never be perfect that way. But yeah, practice pretty much. Are you usually, do you feel like you're picking a number, you said you're picking records and playing only parts of them. Do you find yourself picking records when you're listening to promos or something like that and hearing, okay, I can play that bit for a while and that'll work? Are you trying to find tools as much as songs? Yeah, yeah, actually, for sure. But tools, there was a time when you could rely on Purpose Maker for tools. And right now there's not that much that, well, there's a lot of stuff, but not really the stuff that I was looking for or I'm looking for at the moment. So sometimes I just make my own beats and stuff and burn them on CD, you know. What's not happening now? You said Purpose Maker was great. You know, it's just too similar. Everything is too similar, I think, when it comes to the tools section. The build-up is the same, the beat is the same, the bassline is the same. It's a one-tone bassline mostly, like a rhythmic bassline, not a melodic bassline. And yeah, pretty much the same samples. And funny enough, the same samples that were used back in the days when we did that hard groove stuff, you know, it's similar samples come back all the time again. It's so funny. So, yeah, I just find it hard finding tools that are worth playing. So let's go back a little bit. You said you saw Jeff Mills. He changed your life, so to speak. Well, that's a little exaggerated. Did you start making music soon after that as well? Or did it take a while for that to happen? There's the youth club coming in again because one of the guys brought in a Juno 106 and an Atari with the first ever version of Cubase. I don't know if you know about it, but it was a very basic sequencer. business and uh so we just started fooling around he was um he made an apprenticeship as a pc supporter i think and so yeah he was he was really into computers and everything so he kind of introduced me to making music and but I've only started with my own studio and my own material maybe four years later that would be 95 94 95 yeah and what did you start out making when you first started making Yeah, I was trying to make techno, but it didn't really happen. Why didn't it happen? Well, I just thought that it sounded miserable and stuff, and I couldn't get the sound that I was used to from the records. So that was really frustrating in the beginning. Did you have anyone who had made records sort of guiding you at all? You were just sort of alone trying to figure out how to make these sounds. There weren't that many people making records in Switzerland. There was lots of home studios and producers that would just do it for the fun. But nobody really showed it to me. But the label side of... things was luckily already happening in Bernd with a really good friend of mine Stefan Riesen he had this label Axodia together with Marco Repetto which is another a guy actually from Grauzone maybe you know this group their hit Ice Bear has been actual again people play it again anyway so he It was him that gave me an opportunity to release a record. So he released like one track on a burn compilation with five other people. cut on a record. Like, you know, imagine the space you have. Do you remember when you went to the record store for the first time and saw you in the record store? Actually, that's funny. I actually had my own record store at that time when this record came out, the first one. So we got like 20 of them and we were really trying to sell them, but they didn't really do extremely well. Because, you know, your friends, they wouldn't buy it. They would go, oh, give me a copy, come on. So it would be like, yeah, here we go. And other than that, it didn't really work. How did you come to own a record store? How did I come to it? There was a record store in Bern, which was run by people from Basel. Delirium. Maybe you know of the Delirium record stores in Germany that are now finished. But they were like a subdivision of them or a franchise or whatever. And then they went bankrupt. and we could take over, me and my friend could take over the shop for an okay amount. And so I put in one third and he put in two third. And we were open for two years. Why only two years? In the beginning, it was really cool because that was the time when all these Jeff Mills records would come out, like the first Purpose Makers and stuff. And they would sell so easily. 40 copies in a town like Bern which has a hundred thousand, a hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants and plus we had a Goa section which was the same. It's 20 each like these TIP records and any horrible stuff but it would really sell well but then all of a sudden two other shops opened in in burn and they did exactly the same thing because we were specialized in this detroit thing and all the axis records and implant and all of a sudden there was another store that had exactly the same thing and because we're such a small city and such a small scene it didn't really work out in the end And we thought we better stop before we start losing money. So there was quite a scene in Bern for techno. For acid as well, in the beginning of the acid house, there were these really big parties. I've never went to one. I've never been to one. But I've heard that it was really, really good in the Dampfzentrale. That was where the gas is kept. I don't know how to describe it in English, like a gas work. And they were really, really big parties with like a thousand people for a town small like that. That's pretty big. And then later on, there was a big scene in Bern, but not just techno. There was trance and house, really big for the size of the city, for sure. There were lots of raves around it. Rockville was a very famous place. It's in the middle of Switzerland, in an old industrial area. And yeah, the Swiss scene wasn't that small at that time. I always associate house and techno in Switzerland with Zurich a little bit more. Yeah, Zurich was always the epicenter, so to speak. That's for sure. But yeah, for partying, I would say. But there's lots of producers from Bern, actually, and from Lausanne, from Geneva, you know. Were you traveling quite a bit in the country to go to parties? Yeah. There was a time when I was playing every weekend in Switzerland. Imagine that, I would play in Fribourg, in Vevey, in Zurich, and then in these odd rave places, Rockville, in the middle of nowhere. So yeah, there was a time. And that was the mid-90s, late 90s? That was late 90s, yeah. And you wouldn't do that today? There isn't that infrastructure in Switzerland? It doesn't really happen the same way. I don't know for what reason. There are clubs in every city. But they tend to book their, every club has their own DJs that are like their homegrown DJs, Swiss DJs. And then they invite foreigners. And so it's kind of hard for me to play in Switzerland because I'm always regarded as a Swiss. And then, yeah, it would be a different story. You know, it would be like an opening DJ then. Did you ever find a club at which you were a resident? Yeah. Also, the end of the 90s, there was this club opening called Trax, Rostov Lager. Maybe you've heard of it. This is in Zurich. This is in Zurich, yeah. And I was offered to play once a month, a Saturday. That was really, really good. That was how I... That was when I was able to DJ in the beginning and at the end. So I was kind of experiencing the two different approaches. What were the different approaches? I could play... I remember starting with Journey of the Dragons, you know, in the beginning. And then play lots of... Mauricio and Basic Channel stuff, which I never got to play before, but which I dearly loved, you know. And the end was always funny because you could never tell how long are the people going to stay. You know, no matter what you do, you can never tell. Sometimes it was like they never wanted to leave. And other times it's like. yeah, they didn't really feel like they already started leaving when the main act was on. So yeah, it's interesting to see the whole span of the night. Did you also learn a lot about, I guess, DJing? different way when you were a resident that you got to sort of regularly go to the same place and kind of know a crowd they knew you a little bit yeah i think for sure because it's it's harder when you play for the same people pretty much every month you have to come up with new stuff to get them excited you know because when you travel a lot you can play similar stuff in one month you have four different cities you can play a similar kind of set every place and then there's two three months before you come back to these places so you'll be playing differently But then it was really like you have to pick up new records all the time. So you can be lazier now? I wouldn't say that. It sounds almost like that, but no, I don't think so. But it was more of a challenge, I think, really. Because you were there and people didn't really have a picture of you so much because there's always the main act. So you could also do more stuff, you know, but then again, you can't do the same thing the next time again, you know. It seems like one major association that you've had with throughout your, a lot of your career is Music Man. Yeah. And they actually... probably typify that quite well what you said about not really being associated with a certain thing it's just sort of been belgium yes more than anything else how did you get hooked up with music man originally uh just demo tape sent the demo and uh it was got a call very soon i was so happy And yeah, that's how it went. Why was Music Man someone that you wanted to send music to in the first place? Because I've known the label for a long time, of course. There was Damon Weil on this label and lots of legends that I was looking up to. And Steve Rachman was also one, or still is, one of my favorites. And so I thought I'll just... give it a go there. And I thought that the music fits in as well. What was the music that you were making at that time? It was still very loopy. hard groovy you know but i was already putting in some more like melodies and synth works so the first ep was already more melodic i would say than the stuff that i that we done we we had released on font music you said you're moving a little bit more musically uh inclined what what caused that were you getting tired of loopy hard techno yeah i guess so yeah I think I got tired of it. And I also tried to play, maybe also because of this residence, because it opened up so many other possibilities for me as a DJ. I really wanted to make tracks like that as well, you know? It seems like, I guess around that time... They were really instrumental in pushing you to a wider audience, to a more international audience. That was also because they released a mix CD from myself. That was actually the first time that I was really notified by... by the international scene, I would say. And that was, was it in 2000, I believe? 2001. So yeah, that was like the first time I actually got international bookings. But actually, I've had a couple of international bookings before, and that's funny. That's by another DJ that I really admired, and I still admire him very much so. Surgeon. was always playing every three months at this Rostov Lager at my residency and I would always open for him or close for him and so he got me to play at the House of God in Birmingham it's quite a quite a legendary place and I played there three times I believe but the craziest was the first time it was like There's this guy, Chris, who run the club, and he would dress up as a, how do you say, as a drag queen, and, you know, get the people, animate the people and stuff. It was really good fun. I guess I wouldn't associate you with Surgeon so much. It seems like kind of an unlikely partnership. Probably. Well, we kind of lost touch, unfortunately, recently. It's about time that we meet up again. But at that time, the way I was DJing, he said was really working well in the house of God. And that's why he really wanted to get me over. And I really liked his way of DJing and still do right now. So, yeah, it was that time when Birmingham for me was really, really big. Regis and Surgeon. There were like 10 downwards records in my set. What else was in your set around that time? Axis, M-Plant, I assume. Yeah. But then also lots of... old stuff like I would play Pump the Move for instance or old Transmet records, K. Alexi Medusa I remember that I was playing all the time or Fixed Flash was another one. So I was always playing classic tracks with current tracks which I kind of do, still do, you know, it's still the same. You don't seem obsessed necessarily with the newest of the new. No, not necessarily, no. I'm very interested in new music and I spend at least a day listening to promos every week. And then I'm not talking of record shopping. I do another day for record shopping. and uh beatport shopping for instance or itunes shopping so i'm very much interested in current current music but i think it's not so bad to play oh it the track needs to be good it doesn't need to be new you know that's why i i don't really see the panic of some people sometimes to always play that very newest stuff i don't get it because many of the people in the club will hear this for the first time that i'm sure you know there seems to be an obsession with the novelty and having unreleased things and that you're automatically irrelevant if you're caught playing something two years old yes it's very strange that like there's also seems to be a certain cutoff point like once it's four years old then it becomes a classic you can play anything in that cutoff point is somehow oh but i think two years is already uh that's almost classic already these days because it really goes from week to week sometimes it seems to me At a certain point, to go back, you became more musical, I guess. Is that the way you'd put it? You laugh. Well, yeah. It's just maybe more melodical. Can you say melodical in English? Melodic. Melodic. Because that was almost non-existent before. Because it was all based around rhythms and bass lines and samples. And when was this? Around what time are we talking? think this that was around the time when the second music man release was coming out outer world ep i believe yeah did your what you were looking out for did it change i mean did you go from downwards to other labels yeah uh i think so yeah but i was still following downwards as long as they were there and they're back i think But yeah, like I said, with this residency, I had a much wider horizon and that was before the 2000s already. So that's how I also got to know all these now classics, you know. And I've always had an open horizon, but something always kept me in this. beat kind of direction for some time at least because that was what I became known for and then later on there's always it takes a time it takes some time for people to realize that something else is happening so yeah and you would say that the second release on Music Man people finally started to realize that things were changing in your world Well, it was still techno and very hard and fast, but there was something to it, something you could more relate to than just the beat, because it was becoming so faceless for me. And we were craving for melodies, I think, us, me and my friends and people around us. So for stuff that you would recognize when you go to the club and not just, oh, that's a cool groove. Just say, oh, you could sing this. melody at home it's a really good melody or a cool vocal or anything did you find that people were ready to follow you I mean you said you around your friends were craving a melody yeah did people get it that had come to associate you with something else. Yeah, well, eventually they did, yeah, for sure. And I think it's something that people actually appreciate, and also when I DJ, that it's not just an ongoing mixture of beats and climax and... breakdown so it's also like some down some quieter parts and some piano maybe or some some saxophone some a lot of vocals that i play and yeah nowadays i think you're much more free than at that time in the beginning of the 90s it was very tough to play a vocal song why do you think it became much more free I was saying that already when I released the album in 2006. I actually thought that the minimal wave was great because it slowed things down and made way for lots of other things to happen. People were becoming a little bit more aware of other things as well rather than just this hard bang on techno. In 2006, you decided to release an album. What was the reason? Why was it time to do an album? Well, Music Man, the guy from Music Man and I had planned an album for a long time to be able to, like, show, bring the, as I said before, bring the two projects together, the procreation thing that I was doing, which was more jazzy, and then the techno thing, and kind of find a middle way to be, for it to happen in... in a house or techno club as well. And that was the plan actually. And that's why I've worked with singers from that scene as well. Ovasol before was mostly working with Spina or... Mark DeClive Lowe. So it was kind of a crossover thing, I think. You recorded it over a number of years, the album? Or was it a pretty concentrated short time? There were tracks that were really old, but they would be unfinished. And then I finished them maybe over the span of half a year, I think. And I've had these instrumentals. laying on my, or sitting on my computer for a very long time and then I would send it over to vocalists and get the vocals and send it back and forth. You know, it was finished maybe in half a year, I think. How did the vocal process work? Were you just send it to them, let them do anything they want or was it a constant feedback? It was like, send it to them, and then I get a first demo, and then I gave them my critics and what I liked and what I didn't like, and then they would record again, send it back. It's a constant back and forth until we were all happy. And in most cases, Oversoul actually was at my house. We recorded it at night. It was so funny because I had this bedroom studio and the neighbors upstairs, you know, they could hear him because he was singing really loudly. It was not so funny for them. Tell me about how you chose some of the singers. I mean, why one person over another? I guess it was just the track you thought, okay, their style would work best over there? Yeah, it was the track and of course I heard of them before and I really, really liked their voices. For instance, Justin Chapman who did Let's Get Over It, he was on Ain't Changing by Recluse. And that Recluse album anyway, that was one of my favorite albums ever, or still is. And yeah, that's how I chose. him and Ovasol actually was a dance teacher and he kept coming to Bern to teach lessons. He still comes sometimes, a little less because he's a normal teacher as well now in California. And yeah, so I took the opportunity and because I was introduced to him via some friends and I took the opportunity and asked him if he was up for it. And you have an album that'll eventually be coming out. Are there more vocalists to come on that as well? Yeah. Well, there's hopefully Seth Troxler. He's a bit hard to track down at this moment, but he's a very busy man. But we've already made this track for Circus Company. we really want to do a new one or I really want to do a new one. And so I'm still waiting for him to finish that. And then I have Andy Butler from Hercules and Love Affair. He's doing one of the tracks. And yes, many more, but everything is still in the process. Yeah. Are you having any instrumental tracks? Yeah, that's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. That's definite. So it doesn't all have to be vocals. No, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't say that. You. Do you play instruments at all? I played a piano, yeah. I played the piano for almost eight years when I was young. And then it wasn't cool anymore and I stopped it. It wasn't cool anymore. It was like other, you know, you become 14, 15 and you see turntables. You have other interests. But that was really good in terms of understanding how music works. It was a classical way of learning music, no improvisation. It was more like reading and playing. But it's really helped. me and I've picked it up again a couple of years ago and I'm now taking classes for improvisation as well with a friend of mine so I really want to improve my skills in that way as well. Improvisation must be hard after you've taken so much classical training to let yourself go. Very, very hard. Very hard. And it takes a long time until it actually clicks the whole system of improvisation. It's such a different approach to music. You know, the way we make techno as well is kind of improvising, but not in a very comparable way. So it's a really different way of making music. I feel like techno, in my mind, would be a very systemized way of making music, like that you know you have to have this much of an intro, this much of an outro. Yeah. You have to have a breakdown here. But I think the way that you can improvise is what... As long as you have the kick drum, you can do whatever you want, I think, over it. So that's how I see it as improvising. Of course, it's not instant improvising or live improvising, but it's a freedom that you have. Sure. The one thing I've also heard you say is that it, more than anything else, baselines. Among your favorite things when you're listening for something. I couldn't imagine music without bass. I mean, could you? And not just bass, bass lines, like actual bass lines and not just a tom which is in the offbeat or something like that. I think it's really essential for me to groove to something or to be distracted by it. It really starts, for me, music starts with the bass line and then everything else comes around. Is that how you're writing tracks yourself? Yeah, pretty much, yes. Tell me about DJing now. Are you still... doing three decks all the time is that you're you go to a club and that's on your rider it is basically on my rider but I can also do with two and two you know two CDs and two decks that's the the most often provided setup these days but yeah the nicest is three decks for sure It's the dream, you know. But lots of clubs are not equipped for turntables anymore. Like recently I played in Singapore and luckily we did a soundcheck because we played some records and they were just massive feedback and everything. We tried everything, but we couldn't get it to work. So I was just playing off CDs there because it wouldn't make sense, you know. Do you find yourself... thinking that you might have to move eventually to doing cds and even digital i don't think not that you want to but yeah no i don't think we will have to do that because there will always be records vinyl will not just go away and uh recently actually i feel the I feel that more clubs are more prepared again for vinyl and more DJs are bringing vinyl again. At least that's my feeling. And so I have, I'm hoping that it will stay like that.
