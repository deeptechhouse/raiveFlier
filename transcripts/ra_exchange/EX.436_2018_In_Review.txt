You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour! This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to the year-end edition of The Hour. I'm RA's editor, Will Lynch, and I'm sitting here in Berlin with a few of my fellow editors and... and esteemed dance music critics. We're going with a simpler format this time than we have in previous years, working with just a small selection of Ari's editorial crew, who I'll introduce you to now. First and foremost, Ari's editor-in-chief, Aaron Coltate. Hi, Will. Next we have Ari contributor, Steph Lee. Hi there. Ari writer and editorial assistant, Sybil Gillespie. Hello. and our editor of event reviews, Carlos Hawthorne. - Hi. - We've all spent the last week or so pondering the following questions. What's your favorite record of the year? What's something from 2018 you think has been overlooked? and of all the moments you had on the dance floor these past 12 months which one was the best so we'll start with number one aaron you chose ramos a track by the uk artist ploy came out in june on time dance pretty rowdy choice for someone as mild-mannered as yourself uh what about ramos caught your ear um it was actually both ramos and uh roy's rolls that that caught my Ploy released a record called Intrigue by The Drum before, and the drum intrigue levels on this particular record were through the roof. I think it was definitely a high point, I guess, for Ploy, in terms of just this tension and release for both tracks. I think JD Twitch probably described Roy's role as best. He was saying if it was... Carter invented in Bristol, which I think more or less sums it up. But one of my three DJ gigs of the year was at Giant Steps, which is, I guess, a listening bar that was set up by the people behind Brilliant Corners. And me and... fellow RA scribe Matt McDermott was sort of playing some quite percussive music, some quite out there music and I was very keen to play Roy's roles and the end of that story is that I chickened out and didn't play it. But I think it would have gone quite well with a lot of the other sort of stuff we were playing that day, Cuban records. Brazilian stuff as well, but it's something about the the record just sort of rewired my brain I was listening to on the way to work for a few weeks after it came out And just as soon as both of those tracks finished I put them back on straight away Like I couldn't stop listening to them for a couple of weeks the thing you said about the quote from JD twitch What did he compare it to? Batucada? It's a very percussive style of Brazilian music Steph, you went with one of the biggest records of the year and certainly one of my favorites, Oil of Every Pearl's Uninsides, the debut album from Sophie. Tell us what you like about it. I think personally, I'm always looking for new sounds. I know a lot of people might disagree with that because they like to go back and they're really big fans of classic vinyl and whatnot. But I'm always looking for sort of the next thing, I guess. And I think Sophie's album definitely is pretty different than anything else that's coming out recently. And I also think it does a really good job of combining a lot of different types of genre. Like it's pop, it's electronic, some parts are very ambient, some of it sounds like really industrial, experimental. Yeah, I think also this year I listened to a lot of... more kind of pop music, whether that's like hip-hop top 40s or like really going back into Whitney Houston. And also, I admit, after watching A Star is Born by Lady Gaga, I had like a whole month of just kind of going into Lady Gaga. I will say I don't think her music aged super well, but her... as sort of a performer, just seeing the way that she would dress and go out in public and offer shows, like, I'm really into this sort of, like, larger-than-life... type of performance where you just kind of like transcend reality because you're such a big personality. And I think Sophie, obviously like the lead up to her coming out with showing her identity, as you mentioned in your review, also like falls into that category. And I also think that the music, some parts of the album, like... I wouldn't really listen to the album to feel comfort. You know, like a lot of my favorite albums do bring that sense of, you know, feeling relaxed and like feeling something is timeless. I don't think Sophie's album is quite like that, but I think that she achieves some just crazy sort of like highs. Yeah. And like sometimes like immaterial, that track. I feel like a total just silly, giddy mess when I listen to it. And I don't think a lot of other music does that. And I think sometimes people in dance music are almost like ashamed if it does that, calls that cheap. But I think it really has this level of just fun and happiness that I think music should bring. I could be you. Always the same and never the same, day by day, life after life Without my love, tell me, where do I exist? Immaterial, immaterial, immaterial, immaterial Girls eat my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, Sybil, you chose one of the fiercest LPs of the year, Blauwan's Wet Will Always Dry. What did you like about it? Well, it's actually kind of an opposite reason to Steph's decision for choosing Sophie. What I really liked about Blauwan's album is what Ryan pointed out in the review of this record is that In 2018, it's very difficult as a techno artist to remain within that sonic palette and still sound distinctive and sound like a, you know, create a unique identity. I think it's significant because... It's managed to create something that still feels fresh and new out of a very traditional techno sonic palette. You've got discordant chords and aggressive percussion and drums. It's not really doing anything outside of that genre, but it's doing it very well. I also like that... as he pointed out in his exchange for us, like there's no gimmicks in there, there's no intro or outro or ambient track, which if you're making a techno record, I feel it's good just to be true to that form and there's not really enough records that come out at the moment that are just straight. dance records and do it where you know there's no all those tracks are good he didn't include like four sort of three bangers and then like five mediocre tracks like they're all good and they're all different so yeah hats off to him killer Actually something to add about I always have albums that I listen to when I want to get pumped up and go out. So this year, either I listened to Blah Want's Wet While We's Dry or Charli XCX Pop 2, which is produced by Angie Cook and some tracks from Sophie. So yeah, I also agree. That was one of my favorite albums of the year. Opposite ends of the spectrum, those two. Carlos, you went for Donato Dazi's... Cleo, talk to me. Yes, it came out on Mindless Fullness EP, which is on Marco Shuttle's Eerie label. It was one of only two releases Dozzy put out this year. And the other one was an album, an acid album called Philo Loves the Acid. And yeah, I think Sybil in her review said that it's kind of his most functional, most direct album or record yet. And Cleo is kind of opposite to that. It's this just like really beautiful, really serene record, which kind of the most striking thing about it is it has this kind of fast and slow thing going on where there's this kind of glistening, shimmering synth line over the top, which is kind of going quite fast, like 140, 145, something like that. Meanwhile, the beat underneath is like half that, so it's like 70 or 70. So you have this kind of really woozy effect, which is really powerful. And yeah, one particular moment where I heard it was at Grease Moolah, Ben Yofo played it when he was playing this party, Reef, and he mixed it. So he was playing DJ Sync's 138 track, which is like a... classic kind of 140 bassy like big room just a banger um and yeah and he mixed uh cleo into that and he was kind of like kind of mixed most of cleo into it and just the way he just the mix i mean typical ben was just like airtight and just the kind of the way they sat together and the drums and the the synths was just like it was really amazing And what was really funny about that, I can't remember the sequence of events exactly, but I think, well, I happened to, at Grease Moon, I was on top of the club. Well, not on top of the club, but there's a mezzanine in the main room where you can go up and kind of watch over the dance floor. And it was Benioffo was playing. It was absolutely packed. And I think after that, I went home and I read Angus Finlayson's review of the ep and he said it produces a feeling of weightless drift as if we're looking down on the techno dance floor from some serene higher vantage point and i was like that's bad it's like literally the experience i just had like you know as reviewers we try and um come up with these lines or images that kind of you know conjure thoughts in the reader's mind and that just like totally landed it was uh yeah, powerful to have that experience. For me, it's right up there with the very best Dozzy tracks of which there are so many. I heard both tracks from that record out quite a bit this year and they were both the kind of tracks that sort of leap out from a DJ set. The Mindless Fullness track especially sort of brings back nice memories of the Dozzy Plays Beemask record, which I dusted off again this year for a listen. I chose Pendant, Make Me Know You Sweet, which is an ambient album by the artist also known as Huerco S, or real name Brian Leeds. It feels kind of funny to choose such a subtle record as one of my top ones for the year. but I kind of based it on one of the more objective measures of how much you like a piece of music, which was just the number of times I listened to it. I guess it kind of says something maybe just about my day-to-day life with its frequent need for finding a kind of space of calm or trying to struggle to focus. room with dance music blaring in the background but basically the album has this kind of uh not to keep uh big upping angus but um he described it as a buffer zone uh between you and the outside world and i guess in the past few years there's been this kind of discussion of ambient music as therapy um this one kind of strikes me as more having to do with uh meditation I remember hearing this analogy about meditation that the way when you're in a plane, you find that above the clouds, it's always perfect weather up there is sort of like a helpful analogy for how... meditation your mind kind of recedes into this neutral tranquil place that's always there whenever you choose to kind of dip back into it yeah the pendant album kind of has that effect for me it's although it's less like good weather above the clouds more kind of like ocean floor murk but there's something kind of weirdly pleasing about murk about kind of records by basic channel or rhythm and sound which can be quite dreary but that effect of being sort of hazy and teeming with subtle detail uh there's just it has a very transportive effect that yeah i just i really enjoy in general um i find querco s or pendant brian leads is um definitely the best artist making ambient music right now i also saw him play live a couple times this year, which sort of like drove that idea home for me. And he also had one on Boomcat Editions, Untitled Track that came out earlier this year on that label. That was also among my favorites of the year. Yeah, I was with you when we saw Pendant live at Unsound. And I was wondering how you feel about that. music sort of translates into the live space. Did you enjoy it as much when you were sitting around with loads of people as opposed to like a solitary headphone experience? I guess that was sort of what impressed me about it was, yeah, I saw him there, which was pretty nice because even though it was, yeah, there were a lot of people around. It was the main room of Hotel Forum. And we were kind of in the back laying on the carpet, which, yeah, it was a pretty nice way to take it in. The other time was in the ambient tent at Nocte Guital, just sort of like right when the sky was brightening in the morning. And both times I was sort of struck by like, the kind of overall, you know, signal coming through the speakers was so understated, but somehow still worked in these situations where like there's plenty of people chatting. more or less kind of a party situation overall. But both times I was sort of almost surprised by how much something that's kind of subtle and minimalist was still having its intended effect. so One of the best parts of being a music fan these days is how spoiled for choice we are. No matter how much time you dedicate to finding new music, there's always too much for one person to conceivably take in, which means there's always more to find. For me, the best part of your end ritual with lists and whatnot is finding out about things you missed first time around. So, let's talk about what we think deserves a closer look. Aaron, if ploy was a little surprising for me, this one felt totally on brand. quintessential cool tape material. It's called Walk Walk Ga Min Min by Walk Walk Joongi. I hadn't heard it before last week and I'm very glad it's on my radar now. What can you tell us about this record? Firstly, I like that there's such a thing as quintessential cool tape material. Thank you for that. So this was an archival gem re-released by Australian label Efficient Space this year. Efficient Space is an offshoot of Noise In My Head, which is a really well-regarded radio show that just finished. And that's sort of, yeah, been like a really important outlet for getting and archival Australian music out there in recent years. Wakwakjungi is or was a collaboration. between three singers, Yonggu Songmen from the Northern Territory in Australia, who collaborated with a musician from Victoria. Yeah, I think it was just a really interesting example of a cultural conversation between Indigenous and white Australia. The track that I found myself returning to was called Mother I'm Going, sort of a sub-100 BPM slow-mo band. with really beautiful vocals. And yeah, it actually took Efficient Space three years to track down the artist behind this record. Hunting a CD-R in a community radio station's archives, as well as that record, sort of wanted to shout out Efficient Space more generally. They also put out a really great compilation called 3AM Spares, which was curated by... aka Andrus Fox and Instant Peterson who along with Michael from Noise In My Head have been like yeah sort of scouring community radio station archives and second hand shop you know record and CD bins for years to find all these really nice Australian gems and this 3M Spares is kind of like dubby minimal from 1990s Australia. I didn't know any of the artists on there with one exception. This guy called Andy Ranson who was half of a very famous or famous in Australia at least duo called Itchy and Scratchy. It was written Itch dash capital E and Scratch dash capital E in keeping with 90s humor I guess and there's a couple of his projects on there but otherwise it was all completely new to me. And as someone who grew up in Australia and hadn't really considered it to be like a country with a rich vein of archival sort of 90s dance music, it's been really illuminating for me. I feel like there's tons of great stuff coming from Australia and these like reissue labels and compilations and whatnot from like many different genres as well. I feel like I'm always hearing cool post-punk reissues and I don't know, it seems like it's, yeah, it has sort of a decept Yeah, well, there was a couple of years ago, Efficient Space also released the Sky Girl compilation, which had a track called Cold Cafe by Karen Marks, which is, yeah, like an absolute gem. Australian sort of cold wave track from the 80s. My favourite release of last year was On a Colourful Storm, which is another Australian label. It's called I Won't Have to Think About You. It was a compilation of kind of indie tracks from the 80s I think all I think all the bands in there were led by women female singers and yeah just really really exceptional music like and totally out of left field like I just had no idea just someone in the office was had the record on and yeah I think me and Will both bought a copy instantly that's a hot label Colorful Storm classic mix of reissued indie rock and abstract German bass That old chestnut. Steph, you chose to highlight the New York DJ LSD XOXO. What do you like about him? This year I also really got into the genre of... club music towards the beginning. Well, towards the beginning of the year, I didn't really know what to call it. It was like experimental club, sort of like booty popping, like house music. I don't really know. But then by the end of the year now, I feel like there's house, techno, and then there's club. There's a hashtag I just saw on Instagram from this artist called Question Mark, who's also a New York based sort of ballroom and club DJ. And that hashtag was Make Techno Conti Again. And I think that sort of relates to LSDXOXO and artists like that who are coming out of New York, although LSDXOXO is now based in Berlin. But in January, he put out a mixtape called Body Mods, and that mixtape got picked up by... A lot of DJs that I've been following, like Bambi from Toronto and Taiga Pa from New York. And I think it just sort of epitomizes this new kind of like more hip hop ballroom, booty bass inspired version of. house and techno or club music that's coming out. And yeah, I think this sort of community of producers who are doing a lot of self-releases and doing a lot of edits are something to be looked at in the next year. So we've chosen a DJ called Fauzia. What can you tell me about her? Well, it's actually interesting that Steph chose LSD XOXO because I feel like Fauzia operates in kind of a similar musical sphere. I don't really think she's been that overlooked this year as it feels like it's been a bit of a breakthrough year for her in London. She's got an NTS show and she feels like one of those artists who kind of popped out of nowhere. with this fully formed NTS show and gathered quite a big following quite quickly, maybe a bit like Elena Colombey, though in quite a different musical sphere. She started off on her NTS show, which I've just been following from the beginning, playing mainly just footwork. It used to be called Forzia's Footwork Friendly, and now it's... just called Fawzia. But now she sort of has mixed that up and she plays footwork, jungle, dubstep, bass music, breakbeat, club tracks, edits. I guess you'd call it club mainly because there's not really another word for that kind of everything goes style but I feel like that's like a style that's been kind of popularised mainly in New York and America. by artists like LSDXOXO and it's quite exciting to see young artists like Fawzia coming through putting a more like UK slant sonically on that style and yeah I just think she's someone that more people should know about check out her NTS show follow her in 2019 she's definitely going to be a name to watch Carlos you've chosen A really nice album I also spent a lot of time with this year. It's Mark Renner's Few Traces. Tell us about it. Yeah, I mean, as I mentioned before, kind of a lot of the records I've really loved in the last couple of years have kind of been on the fringes of our railand, I guess you'd say. Just electronic music records. Yeah, this was one of them. I discovered it just by chance. I came across the news piece on RA and we didn't review it. And yeah, just from the description in the news piece, I thought I'd check it out. Yes, really beautiful record. Mark Renner was a musician working in America, in Baltimore. He grew up in Maryland, in rural Maryland, but he kind of, I guess, cut his teeth in Baltimore. in the kind of post-punk scene there. And yeah, he's been making music since the early 80s. The release is called Few Traces. It's a compilation, so it gathers music from his two albums and then some kind of unreleased bits and some kind of soundtrack stuff because he's also a painter and makes other forms of art and he'd kind of make the music to soundtrack these exhibitions and people would listen on Walkmans or he'd play it out. in the open space and you know while people took in the art they would listen along but yeah it was discovered by Matt Worth who runs Revenge International he discovered it at Flea Market just came across it digging I guess he was very struck by it so it's nice you know it is a reissue of sorts but it's not kind of just reissuing the album directly it's a compilation that takes bits and pieces from his work. A lot of unreleased stuff that people won't have heard before. But yeah, the album is just really beautiful. It's kind of like an indie DIY synth pop. I think he made his music just with a... electric guitar, Casio synthesizer and a kind of four-track recorder. There's some ambient on there, there's some kind of, yeah, instrumental tracks, but just really beautiful melodies and really distinct sounding. Definitely some hits on there. Like, I think the thing about him is he was overlooked at the time and he was inspired by kind of... UK bands like Joy Division, The Skids, Ultra Rocks, things like that. But for whatever reason, his album just never made it into the right hands. And I guess that's happened again this year a little bit. I don't get the sense that it's a big album. It wasn't reviewed on R&A, etc. But yeah, fans of the Cocteau Twins, Yellow Magic Orchestra, or bands like Interpol, The Cure, you can hear all that in his music. Aaron, I know yeah i i love this one um i think the first half of the album's compilation or whatever um especially is really really strong yeah i agree with that um i think um like some of the vocal songs saints and sage and sages for example like kind of predates john mouse or something like that it's just like electronic post-punk folky songwriter thing happening um and the short like pieces are just beautiful as well um yeah i mean i feel like i've been a revenge fanboy for a few years now and each year they just keep managing to dig out these really fascinating interesting artists like this time last year i would be thinking they wouldn't be able to top the pauline anastrom um archival release but yeah this one is um especially nice and then you consider what else they've put out this year they put out lucretia dole album V she's a really interesting artist there's a couple others of course that I'm forgetting right now but another great year for revenge yeah I should add that there's a really nice five minute documentary that a filmmaker made about Mark Renner and it just kind of captures his vibe and his music and goes to a few other spots he used to kind of hang out in so it's worth checking out I also went for something I didn't say was completely overlooked because I heard it out a lot but I'm not sure or actually it's more of the It's a UK clothing brand, actually, that puts out the occasional 12-inch. Usually UKG and 2-step, often with... of contemporary producers like they've had sully and etch and whatnot um as well as sort of reissued um yeah ukg and two-step uh bangers surely the biggest record yet was this 10 inch from earlier this year where the a-side was dj deller romantic call uh this garage track kind of like well it's not a mashup it basically takes a sample from jd's plastic dreams with an acapella from 1993 dancehall track Romantic Call by Patra. Pretty irresistible, funky UKG track with a really big vocal hook. Never seen it not go off whenever it gets played. The latest Dr. Banana is also really good. It has old stuff from Ghost as well as the best ones are actually the new tracks by some producers I've never heard of, but it's already sold out if I'm not mistaken. All these records sell out pretty fast. I'd advise keeping an eye on Dr. Banana's social accounts to catch their pre-sales if it's your thing. I consulted RA's resident UK... garage expert, Stephen Timmons, about Dr. Banana, and he said, decent gums and decent bangers. So I think that's, you know, fairly decent support there. Yeah, also the thing I like about it is it's not, like, very throwback-y. Like, even the old tracks that they pick sound pretty smooth and contemporary. They have kind of, like, a lush... deep vibe that feels more 2018 than 90s, I would say. Well, I was just going to say, I feel like UK Garage has been really big for you this year, just from what you've been playing in the office and a couple of sets I've caught of yours. Yeah, it's funny. I guess I would say I owe it to Garage Vibes 98, the YouTube channel, which, yeah, I don't know. I've liked that music for years now, but something about this one YouTube channel kind of pushed me over the edge. I definitely recommend checking it out if you GarageFive98. All right, now on to the fun part. four moments from 2018. Aaron, of all the possible choices, you went for a Wednesday night event. It was Hyperdub's monthly party. Tell us about it. Well, yeah, those who know me will probably be a bit surprised that I was out on a school night dancing. But yeah, I think the monthly party at Corsica Studios in London absolutely deserves it. a shout out. I only went three or four and was kind of furious that I didn't go every single month because I think it's definitely the most interesting sort of midweek London dance music thing. Probably the most special moment I had was when Terza had her album launch for Devotion. She played live with Micka Levy and Kobe Say in room two at Corsica. Those who have been to the club will know there's a big speaker stack along the back wall in room two. I think whenever they... open up each of these parties. Code 9 or someone just steps on the button for the smoke machine in room 2 and continues stepping on it all night so you can't really see more than a foot in front of you which really added to the atmosphere with Terz's music. I guess it's a pop slash R&B record but hearing it at Corsica really reminded me. how closely connected it is to UK club music, basically. And that was really just one half of the event. Like in room one, every month at Hyperdub's parties, they do some kind of art installation. And on this particular month, it was an artist called Venus X Machina. She was formerly a golden teacher. And you kind of walk through a big curtain in room one and she was sitting at a desk with a typewriter and an old lamp. an old radio microphone, solemnly reading out some coordinates for where police had conducted stop and searches for young black people in London in recent times. And it was really affecting installation. well executed and just to be able to go to like a nightclub in South London on a Wednesday night and hear like an amazing artist performing live in room two and then a really interesting installation in room one is something that I don't really think many other promoters are reaching that kind of level on a regular basis. Steph, you've gone for Violet at Panorama Bar, which I also heard people buzzing about. What made it so good? Seeing Violet at Panorama Bar was a totally wild set, but I will say one of the reasons why it was... One of the best dance floor moments for me is sort of more based on the context. Like I've been living in Berlin for almost four years now. I've been to Bearcrime and Panorama Bar a lot. And I will say that. maybe in this past year I've been really yearning for more different types of music which I think I've expressed in my favorite album and my Slept On recommendation and so when I saw Violet in Panorama Bar Like Violet also, she's a Portuguese artist. She helps run a party, a queer party in Lisbon called Mina. And she also runs a label called Naive. And actually before I had gone into Panorama Bar this afternoon, I... Didn't really know who she was. I had heard of her through her party and her label, but I actually hadn't gone and checked out her music. And then I was very surprised to see how hard she basically heated up the dance floor, playing closer to the types of things. I would hear from like LSDXOXO or other types of club DJs but what really like got me going was she had played like a ha track like a like a ballroom track in Panorama Bar which I'm sure other artists have done when I wasn't there but in that moment I sort of just like screamed and started jumping up and down and I thought like the revolution is about to begin like to see this hype of music being played in Panorama Bar just means a lot to me, I guess, because it shows, you know, maybe booking policies are going to change. Maybe what people define as house music is going to change and maybe we'll see more queer or female artists being booked in these huge sort of institutionalized clubs. Of course, like I just went to Room for Resistance this past Saturday and... Dina Abouwahed was playing and also Ariel Zatina. And those are two artists similar to Violet. And of course, there's places to hear this type of music, but it's not as common. And so I think to hear it in a place as big as Panorama Bar just made it really memorable for me. Sybil, you're definitely not alone in your pick. I've heard so much about it I almost forget I wasn't there or I'm just so jealous I wasn't there Ricardo Villalobos at Howden Yeah, well, there could be only one answer to this question for me. This was probably one of the best sets I've ever seen. Probably was the best set I've ever seen. I mean, it was, I won't lie, it was the only reason I went to Houghton. Like, you know, I bought a ticket mainly just to see Ricardo Villalobos play in the woods. Because otherwise the only place I get to see him play is at Fabric. And like, that's good, but it So yeah, he was playing from, I think it was 4am till 9am on Saturday night. So it was sort of the centre point of the whole festival. And started the set off with maybe an hour or two hours of extremely subtle, trippy, squelchy, weird... more music which I could tell a lot of people weren't into like I was sort of that there was a lot of people just standing there not really dancing and I don't know maybe they didn't know what to expect but I think they were expecting like something a bit more banging and then he's just sort of like just playing with people I think that's what I really like about Ricardo. I don't really like minimal music that much I'll be open about it but what I like about Ricardo is the way he's using these these sounds as a tool to sort of psychologically push and pull people and that was just the beginning of the set that sort of you know, he kept just trying to play with people and like slowly blow your mind. So it's sort of two hours of like this extremely strange minimal music and then the sun starts coming up behind him and it's like it's a very grey day so it's not like an obvious sunrise but it's just slowly getting slightly lighter and I feel like musically it started getting slowly lighter and then he plays DJ Kotz's Pick Up. which is not a track that I expected to hear him play, I don't think anyone expected to hear him play, but it's suddenly light and everyone, you know, who'd stayed through this like two hours minimal is sort of bonded together by this strange experience then it's suddenly like, you know, joyously happy, smiling, listening to this kind of otherwise quite basic house track. I feel like this kind of underlies like Ricardo's whole, you know, it's all about context, everything that he plays. It's like any track works, it's just the context in which he plays it. This happened later in the set where he then teased in floor plans, never grow old, for about half an hour. looped over with strange minimal loops and like vocal edits and all sorts, you know, so everyone knows it's coming but it's you know, it's half an hour. So when it does finally come, everyone's just so relieved that it's finally brought it in. He also at one point played noises of steam trains or other trains rolling past. And the way they'd set up the stage, it was in the woods and there were like speaker stacks on all the sides. So you just couldn't even tell. where the sound was coming from. It sounded like this insane noise, which eventually everyone realised was trains rolling past. And yeah, he ended the set with bass queen overlaid with some strange little voice or vocal edit. He always has these little voices. But yeah, it was one of those sets where it felt like every single moment I was just looking at my friend like, what? What's he doing now? So I couldn't choose one moment from that set. But overall as an experience, I can struggle to think of a DJ who understands more how to mess with people and like really make you leave a set just feeling like, wow, I don't even know what just happened. Yeah, as a Villalobos fan, I think I was, I wasn't at Houghton, but I was happy and relieved to hear about this set that he still has it in him to, to really pull out the bag and, and wow. Because so many of the reports and, you know, the few sets I've seen in recent years, like he, he has a tendency to phone it in and yeah, he can just go one of two ways. So it's really nice to know that he's still got kind of theory on that side of ricardo is kind of like with the context thing that i sort of feel like how well he plays is a direct reflection of how much he's enjoying himself personally in that moment and which like fabric and houghton like that sort of his family like he's got tons of friends around him like he's having a really nice night himself um whereas yes kind of more hype pressure gigs, big festival stages, things like that. I think my favorite track by Ricardo is True to Myself. I always thought that was like a striking title coming from him because you can't really think of anyone that lives up to that idea more. And I sort of think like if he's not fully feeling a gig, he seems incapable of making it sound as if he is. The same thing, the best time. I've ever seen him is at Club Divisionaire in kind of the same situation, like his friend's club, playing with his friends in the DJ booth. Just like a place he knows inside and out. Just like when he's in his, you know, comfort zone. really you see this sort of um you see the side of him that made him this soaring cult figure uh carlos you've gone for something quite demented um i only saw the tail end of it from a distant hillside and while i'm sure it was great down you know in the action at the time i was quite shaken so yeah tell us about it I've gone for Techno Safari, which took place at this year's NAC Digital Festival. For those who've been to NAC Digital, they'll know that it's in many ways musically a very serious festival. Excellent techno, house, drone, kind of dedicated ambient tent. But it also has a very silly side. And every Saturday, I think they're kind of getting a crew from Leipzig. I don't really understand what their vibe is. They seem to just all be mates and kind of event organisers, Extremely silly, extremely cheesy, extremely fun event. Like it's kind of different theme. The first year was like an Ibiza 18 to 30s thing and I had like speed dating and on the beach. And the second year I couldn't even get into the tent because it was so full. That was, sorry, if I remember correctly, that was called speed dating emphasis on speed. Yeah, and then this year it was Techno Safari. And, like, I go, I've been the last three years with a group of friends who, you know, they like dance music, but they're not heads, so to speak, and they love this Saturday event. They, like... We kind of chanced upon it in the first year and it just totally made everyone's weekend. So yeah, this year it was reports of techno safaris, like outside the village, what's going to happen. It's like there was all these rumours going around and kind of expectations were a little low. Anyway, of course we were going to go. So we went there and it's like gathered in the car park. There's a bus, looks like a zebra, there's all sorts of animal paraphernalia hanging off the bus. There's a guy, a park ranger in khakis on a Segway just rolling around. I think he fell off and injured himself at one point. And then there's a tractor that's going to pull the bus, so that sets off. And then everyone, there's kind of 100 or so, 200 people, I can't really tell, just following the... the bus like a kind of like a procession like some kind of Pied Piper madness and this just goes through the nearby town village like village at most called Olganitz and as it goes through the town it's blasting you know DJs from the back there's like a set up on the roof of the bus they're playing kind of house bangers and I remember they played the streets that was great and then we were kind of yeah just parading through the town and all the residents were on their porches filming us, handing out, selling beers, kind of Carver sect as it's called, and just really getting into the spirit of things. And the vibe was insane. It was blazing hot all weekend. And at some point we kind of just did like a little tiny loop and then it kind of came back down towards the car park, at which point this DJ who like... He just appears every year. He's just like the main guy, seemingly. He's called DJ Nami Bisa. And he just started firing through the kind of EDM hits like Avicii, Sveta Chalasafya, Pridas, Piyanu, which was a personal favourite. And yeah, it was just like... I'm not a big EDM fan, but it was just pure euphoria in these cornfields with all your mates just drunk. It was just so much fun. I spent a lot of years in Ibiza and I kind of always regretted never getting the EDM experience. Especially actually when Avicii died. I looked down on it once from a... rooftop bar but I never actually went to one of these EDM parties I just kind of the thought of it on my night off was you know too harrowing to think of but I'd always wanted to and this kind of I've always thought of those parties like okay say what you want about music but people there seem to be having so much fun like they really do seem to be having the best time and this was a kind of taste of that it was like Just pure euphoria. And then Yob Yobsy closed it off when we got back to the car park and he was just firing off through Tiesto, ATBs, 9pm till I come. Meanwhile, Stefan Beneman, who books the festival and is one of the... guys involved um he's dancing on the kind of back of a pickup truck and yeah and then at 6 p.m or something it all finishes we all kind of stumble back into the site burnt friedman is kind of just started on the main stage and then we all just kind of enjoyed our saturday night but it was just that um real unpretentiousness about the festival like so many festivals are so concerned with their bookings and their image and you know they've never let any kind of a hair out of place in terms of the music they play, whereas Naked Digital is just pure, unadulterated fun. There's so much respect. It's also, that shows kind of how it's such a community event. That festival is really deeply tied to that surrounding community. You can tell by the fact that many people would find that Techno Safari quite obnoxious. It was insanely loud, this bizarre Mad Max kind of atmosphere. But the fact that people are coming out and like, yeah, passing out, wrote caption and everything tells you a lot about the nature of that festival. Yeah. Like Steph, I've also gone for something that had me jumping up and down. It was at our... RA's 24-7 party in Tbilisi at Bassiani, namely the very final bit, like, I guess, literally like the final few minutes of the entire party. I guess the context of it was, well, yeah, it was a 24-hour party and these are the final two hours and everyone was feeling pretty, you know, worse for wear. It was 40 degrees in Tbilisi and we'd been out on the terrace. dancing to Nicholas Lutz for a while. And then I was inside sitting down with the guys who organize RA's events, Ryan and Hugh. And we all kind of resolved like, there's no way we're going to dance again tonight. Like we're just completely spent. But we were obviously going to stay. Anyway, then we went down into Bassiani's main room where it was just three of the club's residents finishing up. Yeah, the DJs are called Concelli, Zitto, and NDRX. And yeah, I guess it was just one of those moments where kind of to our surprise, it was exactly what the doctor ordered. It was really nice and cool down there. It wasn't that crowded. The music they were playing was like kind of sleek, spacey, dreamy techno. It was properly techno, but it was also kind of... soothing and nice in a way. And to, you know, just the basic effect of having residents play their own club. They just knew how to kind of take advantage of that room in a way that none of the DJs at night really had. But the best bit was basically the very, very end. So after hours of this kind of... understated, lush techno. One of them played this track that's called Oh Superman Disco Spacer Mix by Marcello Giordani, which is basically a mashup of Charlie Spacer Woman, the Italo classic, and Laurie Anderson's Oh Superman. They had a much stronger kind of pop element than anything else. You know, like just really didn't see this coming. And it's kind of like a haunting. bittersweet, you know, kind of like sad and beautiful, almost something kind of eerie about it sort of track. It was just like a big kind of shift in tone that really suited the collective feeling of the dance floor, I guess. And that was kind of like a, you know, when you get kind of like verklempt on a dance floor, like sort of like tears in your eyes a little bit. And then... One of them kind of abruptly spun that out and played this like 160 BPM German bass track that I later learned was like a fairly recent one by Fracture called Take You. But it was just like, you know, this the Oh Superman had kind of like reeled everybody in. We're all kind of having this like. sort of sentimental moment, and then just sort of, you know, hard left turn into this like crazy over the top. honestly kind of tacky, but like, you know, in a good way or especially right then. Yeah, it's like euphoric rave track. And yeah, it was one of these moments where it was like, everyone was kind of like, like it was almost like a mosh pit on the dance floor. Just like there was plenty of room to move around. Everyone was just kind of like going bananas. I have this memory, which maybe I've embellished slightly as I've reflected on this. But of me, Ryan, and Hugh kind of like with our arms around each other just like pogoing. And then like the party ended, we all, you know, sauntered out. And for so long, we just like couldn't stop talking about it. And I guess, you know, as you get older and you start... really racking up your overall number of club experiences, those kind of really crazy over-the-top moments that are kind of seared in. into your memory and that you reflect on many times later, those kind of become fewer and further between, but they still happen. It's always kind of like, yeah, it's always good when you have that experience, it's good to know, like, you can still sometimes have that sort of almost childlike relationship with this thing, even as you become kind of a grumbly old nerd. I think there's something really special about a DJ set that comes at the end of a long party or the end of a festival. When you were talking about that, it kind of reminded me of Powder on the final night of Unsound this year. And as you were saying, when someone sort of captures the collective mood of a dance floor, I think Powder absolutely did that. Everyone was fairly tight. after sort of four or five, well, even a week, actually, of Unsound going on. And these, like, her sort of dream techno selections just had a, I don't know, it was a pretty ecstatic way to finish. And that was the same exact vibe where it wasn't just that she nailed the mood. It was that like that mood was one of kind of like vulnerability, like the crowd needed to be sort of taken care of by the DJ, you know, which, yeah, it's nice when you're kind of like you're standing there kind of. almost like a sleep on your feet. And then, you know, the DJ sort of like suits that mood. It's just, yeah, it's a relief. Okay, that wraps up our 2018 in review. Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts, everybody. And thanks for listening. So hold me now. You're the one. In your heart of paradise Your ill-earned kind comes in your heart So hold me now And you're like... Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
