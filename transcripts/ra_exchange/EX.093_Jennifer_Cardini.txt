Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Jennifer Cardini is one of the many DJs that have made their name via just that, DJing. In a time when production credits are the key to getting international bookings, she's gained residencies at Paris' Rex Club, done mix CDs for Compact, and toured around the world. Her home base for many years was Paris, and we talk extensively about the French clubbing landscape in this exchange. We also talk about her giving up some vices and settling into a new studio and home in Cologne, and the possibility that we may just hear some more tracks with her name on them yet. You're an early riser. Yes, I am. Have you always been an early riser? Yes. Like my dad, he was working in a casino. He was a croupier. And he was getting so mad because I was already up when he came home around 5. Like playing and being full of energy and being quite noisy. And he was getting to sleep. problematic yeah i wake up very early i like the morning a lot sorry for those who don't know you emailed me this morning at a very early hour and i was just so surprised that i don't get many dj emails that are sober but i actually right now what i enjoy the most is like for example when i play at monorama bar it's like just waking up around six, taking a shower, having breakfast and just go there and play. That's my dream gig because it totally fits my sleeping schedule. It must be strange to walk into that situation though. Well, it is. As a DJ and everyone has been there for hours. Sometimes for days. No, no. Yeah, it is. But it's also very funny. I like it. I think the last time I saw you DJ was at Panorama Bar and I caught like the last two songs. It was maybe a year and a half ago or something like this. And you were standing on the DJ crates. Oh my God. Well, yes, this has happened a lot while I was still drinking. You won't catch me doing this now. Yes, I sometimes get very enthusiastic. But you stopped drinking, though? Yes. Was this a lifestyle choice? Yes, a lifestyle choice and also wanting to do different things, like starting the label, maybe. So you stopped drinking right around the time you started the label? Well, I mean, yeah. Pretty much. I stopped drinking and then I needed to find something to do. Like, what am I going to do now? No, it's a lifestyle change, I think. I've been mixing since, what, like more than 15 years now. I had my share of parties and after hours and just decided to change also focusing more on other things like making music starting the label maybe starting podcast and stuff like this why did you start the label Well, I ran this party in Paris since like 12 years now. I'm resident. And since like 10 years, I have this party called Correspondant. And we invited lots of people. And I wanted something else to last from it. And I also got lots of demos from friends. And it just came like a natural thing. I already did an attempt. of having a label years ago, but it was at the same time that my career took off. And then I started playing all over and was not really regular with a job that running a label is asking. And so I gave up the idea and I thought that now... then I'm obviously more responsible. It would be a nice time to do it. But it came from lots of things, also from me moving to Cologne and being surrounded by people that I really love and want to work with. I'm talking about the Compact guys, of course. I really feel like I'm in a family with them. And yeah, I mean, being in Cologne and not having a label is kind of weird. Anyway, it's part of the citizenship. Once you move there and you're friends with Compact. You have to do it. It must be easy with them distributing the records. They're right there. You can talk to them and get their advice on lots of things. Yes, they're just around the corner from where I live. But, I mean, it's also easy to work with them because they are really, really open and interested. And you always find someone to talk to. And they were crazy enough to say yes. So that's the good. That's a good thing. I really enjoy it too. I think it was a good decision for me to move there. It seems like your relationship with Compact was the moment at which you kind of took off internationally, that the mix CD. came out and people were sort of like, oh, who is this? At least outside of France. Yeah, totally. I mean, I think I had a first moment that was really important is when I put out this compilation called Electronic Culture because it was the first time That's such a compilation, I mean, without wanting to sound pretentious, but like, was made with like artists like Losol or Superpitcher, but that was in 2000, you know, like when, just before Minimal. kind of arrived. And I got my connection with the boys then. And I started to invite lots of them to Paris, as well as the Pitch Control and other artists like Sacha Funke that I really, really like. And the fact that I met all these people allowed me to do the compilation on Compact and then to get bigger with Compact. has a major role in my career, that's for sure. It seems interesting that you were looking to Germany so much for music. It seems like, at least in my perception, a lot of French artists are very insular. They're very like, not insular, but they don't, they're very... nationalistic in a way maybe well yes but um first i think i'm the only friend i mean at this time i was the only french person who thought german was sexy as a language okay so that that helped and um there was this like profane record i think it was profane number seven with a little bit like Marlen Dietrich singing in German and I found it really, really hot, this record and that pushed all my interest. This is my new background as well. But no, yeah. I don't know, you know, like I have foreign, my mom is not French, my dad is not French. So, and I was born in a very international city, so I always was, and I traveled a lot when I was little, so I always was curious about other countries. Where were you born? You were born in Paris? No. Oh my God, this is embarrassing. I should never. I was born in Monte Carlo. Oh, okay. That is a very international city. Yes, it is. I have a Swedish mom and an Italian dad. Okay. And you traveled quite a bit as a child. Yes. At least to visit the family. Sure. Sorry, go ahead. This is maybe why I don't have this nationalist feeling about France. How did you end up in France? France then? Well, I was born there and like it's part of France. And then when I was 16, I started raving and left to Nice, which is France, and then moved to Paris. Okay. So you were raving in Nice. Yeah. At this moment in the south of France, you had like... All the region from Grenoble, where Michel Diaker and Miss Kitten are coming from, and all this from Grenoble to Montpellier, it was very intense with raves. We had lots of open-air parties, lots of guests from Detroit playing there. This was in the early 90s. So this part of France was raving. way more than Paris at the time. So this is also why most of the artists that are famous now, like Agoria, or Miss Kittin and the Yacker. We all come from this, from Grenoble to Montpellier, because this is where rave movement started in France. What style of music was being played for the most part, or was it, you couldn't really tell? You could, yeah, it was a mixture between hardcore, hardcore scene was really, like, free party, hardcore scene was really big, and Detroit. Like, I remember first records I booked were, like, Red Planet No. 5, Underground Resistance records. Detroit was really, really big. Detroit and Chicago, like, Green Velvet and stuff like that. Were you traveling quite a bit to go to these? parties as well no like this is only a half an hour from monte carlo yeah we were just sometimes we were driving like two or three hours then you were having like you know the like old style you know like like a piece of paper and like a guy waiting like you have to pick up the next guy on the next corner and it was quite fun we had like situation with the police and everything like Like really rave experience. Did your parents ever have to pick you up from the police? No, they didn't. They didn't. Did yours? No, but I remember Agoria saying that... He had plenty of times when his parents had to go pick him up the next day. No, my parents were busy doing something else than checking where I was. I was not giving so much news either. I was really into this like riot teenager, like, fuck you, stop mine. So I was raving a lot. And then I stopped playing and then I moved to Paris. When did you start playing? How old were you? I was around 22, 21. Yeah, 21, 22. It was just more like for technical reason, like you had no CDs with like, I mean, you had CDs, of course, because I'm not that old, but you didn't have mix compilations, for example, you know, you could get tapes from DJs, but basically the only way to listen to electronic music was to get turntables and to buy records. So this is what I did. I got turntables and I got records. So you just had to do it yourself, basically. Yeah. Or else the party was not going to happen. Yeah, I was not playing. I was just having records and turntables. Playing came later. I was way too shy anyway to get out of my living room. When and how did the shyness stop? Like record shopping. It was not so many girls in the record store asking for underground resistance records at this time. And like some promoters, they were hanging out around there and offered me to play. And then it just started a little bit like this. They just knew that anyone who's buying underground resistance records. Yeah, probably. Yeah, I don't know. I played on lineups where people were playing so hard that I was super scared. It's like, my God, what am I going to play now? It was like in between Manu Le Malin and Lisa and Elias, you know, like 140 BPM. But it was really fun. I have a really tender memory of this. I'm not nostalgic. I don't... I never think it was better before, you know. But yeah, it's like you really... I have a tender feeling when I think about this moment. When did you get to Paris? 1984. 1984. Yeah. So in my nostalgic mind. And Laurent Garnier is ruling the city by then. Yeah, he was playing at La Luna already and was making some... Maybe it was a little bit later. It was 98, because in 94 I was 20, so I came a little bit later. It was 98. Yes, yes. I mean, I was going to wake up at Rex, like listening to him. I already started playing Rex at this time. I'm just as old as... the Rex furniture. But yeah, we were, I mean, people my age, they're all fans of Laurent, that's for sure. What was it about him as a DJ? So many people have stories, but I always find it fascinating to hear. I don't know, like, you know, on his official Facebook page, I don't know why I was there like yesterday. yesterday, there is this amazing picture of him. He's playing live with Skanix and Skanix is behind the machines and Laurent is doing something but he has his head up and there is this light, you know. And this explains everything about Laurent. There is like kind of trance between him and the people. He's so generous. He gives so much. It's like, yeah, it's like wonderful energy. I mean, I know I was always waiting. I liked the end of his set when he was getting a little bit more dark and was getting into drag. like Tiamoud and stuff like that. This was magical. It was really great. When you first started going out in Paris, was Rex immediately the place that you went to? It was a little bit the only place, but because I'm gay, I was also going to a gay lesbian club called Pulp. It was really tiny. dirty, stinky. It was run only by girls and in the weekend allowed only to girls. But we started to have a night on Thursday there. And we started to invite Michel Meyer. And then, of course, boys wanted in, which we let them in. But that was the other place. Was it tough for you to book boys? No, because... I already had this connection to Compact and to the German artists because basically only German artists played there. But no, what I mean is that, you know, like you had this like Rex Club was like the temple of techno with like most of the time Derek May and people like this. And then you had like... Pulp, who was starting to go in another direction, where Ellen Allian played, where... who broke a little bit the techno identity Paris had, you know, this took another direction. And then all those people played at Regs. But you had only those two places. You had Regs, wonderful club, like institution of techno, and then it's like... alternative a bit punk where Pitchy's played for the first time. Bits like more looking for another way, club, which was pulp. What else was going on in Paris? What was the scene like in the mid-90s? Because you have Daft Punk, of course, earlier on. Yeah. And I feel like maybe... Their legacy loomed large over the city in terms of parties. The house scene was quite big. And when I moved there, actually the only thing that I recall was Rex Club and Pulp. There was not so many. I missed the moments they called Mosin-Or, which was like outside Paris, big raves. Most of the Parisian people attended too. I missed this. I mean, at the same time, Catapult also opened and started labels. And for Pulp, Chloé joined us. Ivan Smag joined the Pulp. Yes, the thing is that you have to understand that France, it's not like Germany where each city has a scene, you know. Like in France, most of the things, they are located in Paris. And at this time, it was Rex and Pulp. Now it's... Now you have more clubs, you have showcase, you have cabaret sauvage, aléatoire, you have more places now. But at this time, yeah, we had those two places only, but they were good. What was Pope like? I mean, when you walk in, you mentioned it was dirty. It was looking like a bordel a little bit. It was an old dancing club. And in the afternoon, you had only like... Sometimes when we arrived, we still had old people dancing tango there, you know, because it was a really wood dance floor. And yeah, it was looking a little bit like all like red velvet, like very dirty red velvet, like more going Bordeaux. It was a nice place because you had like straight people, gay people, transsexual, like all kind of people, which sometimes I found was a bit missing in the techno world, you know. And this was, it was a little bit more glam. let's say it was a bit glamorous people were dressing up yeah some of them yes without us asking just like very surprising and it was like something was cooking boiling there it was cool how long did it last? I think it closed like three years or four years ago. So it lasted about 11 years or something. But you eventually moved on from doing your night? No, I still was resident for the old period. It was open. I was resident at Perl and at Rex, which was really funny because sometimes, you know, it's on the same street. Sometimes I had to run with my racket case to play the next set in the other club. The same night? Yeah. It was quite funny. People in Paris, would people follow the DJ down the road? Or was it a case of, I only go to Rex, that's my club? No, but that was, again, like two different scenes. When one club was really more techno and the other club, it was, it was, the crowd was a bit different. It was really like the crowd for Rex at this time, sadly, was mainly guys, you know, like really like techno. It was really techno. a part when Laurent was playing but like for example Automatic was a straight like techno party like so now the people there were people mixing the two scenes but now I only This is also why I was allowed to do both nights, that we knew that some people would follow me, but most of the time, I guess the crowd at Pulp was a little bit older as well. Okay. Tell me about Rex then and how you got involved in playing there. I got involved there. I was only playing since like six months, so I was really scared. And I got involved there because... we had this magazine called Coda and Coda has a residency and I got close to them and I started playing there and yeah it was like that was the place you know it was the place like Laurent Garnier I remember I played in Dijon first which was Laurent Garnier's home city he was resident there for like a couple of years and then after I played at Rex so I was very excited but Rex is a nice club I mean the evolution is really good and right now I mean the the programmation is I found it amazing and I'm really happy also that they always gave me freedom to Like they always got my back when I took risk or when I, I mean, I have the freedom that I can just invite people that I discover. I don't need to, they follow me on choices. And, and. When have you felt like you were taking a risk with them? Well, I mean, you know, you always take a risk when you... For me, it was not a risk, you know, but they didn't... They didn't knew. You know, like, I don't know, at the beginning when I started to invite all people from Berlin, you know, they were like, ah, really? And I was like, yes, please. And then they saw that kids were actually following because they were waiting for that. So, and yeah, I mean, they always got my back. I found it really amazing that this club has been able to be the foremost club in a city for a number of years. Yes, like 20 years. I think we celebrated 20 years. Why do you think it's been able to do that? Well, lots of things. I think the implication of Laurent, of course, has something to do with that. That's for sure. And the fact that they went... They followed the music history, you know, they did rock concerts, they had disco nights. I mean, they always were involved in music, which is what I don't like sometimes about France is that we don't have clubs, we have discotheques, you know. What's the difference? The difference is a discotheque, like you have those seats and you can't put your feet anywhere. You can't get... I mean, there was a moment when I was young, you could not get in a discotheque if you were wearing sneakers. You know, and I guess Rex was also the first club that was a club and not like old-fashioned discotheque, you know? Like... Sometimes when you play out of Paris, there are still places you need to take a bottle and you get seated. It's super old-fashioned. We don't have this club culture. Like you have in Germany where you can do parties in buildings or old parkings or in Stadtbad. We don't have that. That's very hard to get in France. Music is limited to the club. I guess it's also the fact that they're willing to follow artists like you to say, Jennifer, book people. Modernize the thing and trusting the residents, of course, and having also a strong residence like Laurent, for sure, or like Agoria. I don't know if he's still, but he's playing there quite often. I also think that the French scene... is quite strong at the moment. I mean, if I have to think, like, records I play, I play a lot of French stuff. Like Chloé and The Hacker and Miss Kid. I mean, you know, like even Daft Punk. I mean, I think also, this also went with the... French scene growing in the same time. It seems like, obviously, that with Chloe and Yvonne, there was a thing that they were doing around this time that maybe was pulp. Yeah, yeah. It was a kill the DJ party. Yeah. What, I mean, did it feel like you were bringing something different? to the city well kids the DJ they have they're quite political you know even when they do projects like Dysfunctional Family and they get involved in lots of things so yes I think Fanny, Ivan and Chloé they have They like to do things but it has to mean something. Otherwise they are not like, they don't have interest, you know? Do you feel the same way? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Sometimes I just want to do things to do things. I'm more spontaneous sometimes, I don't know. But Fanny, who runs Kill the DJ, she's a strong character. I think that they try to push something, even when you check the releases of the... of the label. I mean, they try not to stay too much in what should be, what could work, you know? Like even like with artists like Jason Edwards, when they do pop or folk or they take risk. Tell me about the scene now. I mean, I know you're living in Cologne, but you're playing quite a bit. bit in wreck still so i feel like you may have a feeling for what's going on there well i tend to be very i'm a very enthusiastic person i mean like i was saying i have i have the feeling that the scene is like i have the i mean i guess it's a bit stupid because we said that i'm not like a nationalist person but I'm very happy when I see, for example, Diède, Chonky, Chloé, Yvonne, Cricor. I mean, there is a full list of French people that are actually traveling a lot and playing a lot of music and they are really involved in the electronic scene. And I have the feeling that the... the scene which is most of the time located in Paris is quite, it's slowly growing and it makes me happy. I mean, it's a little bit naive to say that, but it actually does. It seems like there's also a number of new sort of house and techno people coming up as well. Yes, it's like regenerating. The Get the Curse guys. Yes, they are super talented. Demented is also doing this techno thing. Yeah, it seems like. There's a new generation. There is a new generation, and I think it's also nice, because when I started playing, it was more or less always the same big names that were going around, and I found it very, very interesting that new people are coming. I mean, I work a lot with Clément and Thomas from Get the Curse. They also released records on my label. And I feel it like we need that. I mean, we need to open the door sometimes. I know that in Paris, for example, when you're a newcomer, it can be really tough to find gigs or to do things. Regarding my residency at Rex, for example, I was always curious of what was going on in my city. And I mean, not that I got the city, but what was going on next to us. like next, next, get the curse. I mean, everything is, what they do is really, how they write, what they do is really interesting. The music they put out is really nice as well. They're really good DJs. I was talking to someone from Paris recently and they said that... the artists that were making records for their label, you know, it was the Bergheim sound, but with a French touch somehow. Not the French touch, but a French touch. And I wonder if you also feel that the stuff that comes out of... Paris and France has a distinct something. Yes, of course. I remember once I played in Berlin. It was in the old VMF and someone came to me and asked me, are you going to play some Parisian stuff? You know, because there is this, well, this is something also that came from Pulp for example it's like we always laugh about playing very very slow And for example, Ivan is really a master at that, with like heavy basses and like this like darkness. And Clément and Thomas, I mean, we talk about it quite often and they really, this really got to them. Like, I think they are big fans of Ivan. I think there is this like kind of dirty, sexy sound from Paris, yes. Do you think your own stuff is, or is it more influenced by Germany? I don't know. You know, I mean... If someone said, play me some of that Parisian stuff, what would you... I could play you some, but like Fanny once, the boss from Kill the DJ, she said I was a... I don't know how to translate this in English, but when you're an isolated wolf, you know? A lone wolf, yes. Yeah, because I don't... I made records with Mobile, I made records with Crosswind Rubbers, I made records with Kill the DJ. But I don't... I would not say that what is... That it is only that for me. Of course I love this, like Remain and all the slow stuff that is coming from Paris, but at the moment I enjoy playing all Detroit stuff, for example. I could not... Yeah, I don't know. I probably have this because of living there, but I also like other stuff. I'm also influenced by Cologne, by other countries and other music. I like ambient. I mean, lots of stuff. Do you like that, not being able to be pinned down to any one thing? You know, when I think of Yvonne or Chloe, some sort of sound pops into my brain, but I'm not, when I think of you, I think it could go a lot of different. ways? I don't know. For a moment, I thought that I should belong to a family, you know, because also as an artist, it can be comforting, you know, and I don't think I can. I don't think I can. Well, maybe I'm building my mind with the label. I don't know. Are you trying to, or? I don't think so. Maybe it'll happen. I think it's... Organically. I don't know. I kind of like that you can't put a sticker on my back. At least it gives me the possibility to surprise people. Which is, I think, good. Yeah. Why did you move to Cologne? Well, without getting too personal, I fell in love. That was the reason. I kind of had enough of Paris at this time. We talked about it in the beginning of the interview. I was looking for something else, like maybe more peace of mind. And I just wanted to go. I mean, I was never, I have a very sadomasochist relation to Paris. I really love this city, but it doesn't bring you such a good quality of life, I think. It's very stressy. And I remember when I moved there, I was not feeling good there. And I think that somewhere deep inside of me, I never really adapted to the city. And Cologne is really a friendly place. And it's like, it's not that far. It's only three hours with a train. I mean, the condition when you're an artist and if you want to have a nice studio and everything in Paris, it's crazy. I mean, you know, just drinking coffee there is crazy. So what do you not like about Cologne? It's been all positive. Well, I'm a bit too much pro-Cologne. Well, I mean, it is quiet. Sure. It is quiet. No, but I travel a lot, so, I mean, I just take what I like in the week, which is having quiet time and being able to do music. And after when I want excitement, I get excitement every weekend. So, well, I would say maybe a little bit more of... cultural events would be nice but no no I just I don't know how to to explain that I just take it like yeah it's just like a harbor for me you know I get there and it's quiet and nice and then in the weekend I recharge my batteries and then I enjoy playing all weekend what have you been making now that you've had all this time in the studio these days Well, I did a remix for Cormac. I did a collaboration with NAR. And I'm making music myself, but it's a long process. Why is it so long for you? I don't know, maybe... I'm very shy. It's like very problematic for me to make music and to give it away. I don't know. I guess I got the wrong impression about you by going and seeing you up on the, standing on the DJ credits. I think so. You're always so shy and all of these things. Yes, I think so. Well, maybe there is a reason, you know. Maybe there is a reason to this behavior, I would say. Maybe I try to overcome it. With making music, what are you trying to do? Are you trying to create things for the dance floor, specifically? No, not really. Not really, to be honest. If it happens, it happens. You know, when we met in Cologne, we were talking about Triangle. Yes. And I've been making music for fashion shows like the last 10 years, like two times a year. And it's something I really enjoy because it gives me the possibility to listen to a lot of ambience. like lots of modern love stuff, triangle stuff. And there is an old side of me that is really interested in different music than the dance floor music. So you're DJing at these fashion shows? No, I'm building. You know, it's only 15 minutes of soundtrack, so I'm editing, cutting, making loops of stuff. putting them together and editing movies, not lyrics, but movies, moments, picking up words, and it's like a big collage. This must be a really interesting project for you to figure out. how to create something in 15 minutes that's going to... Yes, it has to change all the time. Like every 40 seconds, the atmosphere has to change. So it's quite challenging. 40 seconds, the time it takes for one person to walk down and back. Yes, kind of. So it's a lot. And it's also very heartbreaking. Because sometimes I'm just like, why can't I leave this track longer? And they go like, no, it has to change now. And I'm just like, but this is so beautiful. I don't want to cut it. So it's also very, very heartbreaking. How did you get involved in that stuff? The designer was coming to parties and he heard me play and I just... I know what you can do. you can DJ for 40 seconds every track. No, like he came when I was doing a warm-up actually and I played some like monolake stuff and stuff like that and then he knew me already but he didn't know that I could play stuff like that and then we got in touch with my booker and we did a test. to see, like I came with records and we listened to stuff and it's like I do it with him since eight years or ten years or something. So you've only done it with him? Yeah, I don't know if I would like to do it with someone else. So before every single one you look at everything that they have coming out and then you... Yeah, all year I collect ambient or like experimental or... Or like, you know, this like petit grimoire, like spooky music or loops or whatever. And that's a part of my job that I really like. You sit down with him. No, I listen to everything. I do a selection of what I think is nice. And now we know each other very well. So he goes like, yes. And which is quite cool. I even sometimes build the thing and send it build. And then he goes like, yes or no, change this, that, that or that. Are you looking now at his designs before you pick things? When I was in Paris, yes. it's a little bit more difficult but I go at least to one meeting so Well, you know, we're a little bit like your old couple now. We know each other. So, I mean, for sure, I know we would never put like lots of colors and, you know, it's quite classy, black most of the time. So, yeah, we have our rhythm together. But this really, this was amazing because I listened to so much music. I mean, and not, that has nothing to do with what I... play in the weekend and it kind of also changed my my well yeah I kind of brought also something else to to what I could eventually do if I if I succeed one day to put music out well I mean it seems like You should have something on the Pop Ambience series eventually, right? Yeah, maybe. But for this, I would have to send it to Michel. What's next for you? You know, you've kind of carved out this space in Cologne where you can work a little bit. It seems like it's quite nice. Well, the next step for me would be to put out music. There's not so much more. Like I'm trying to trick myself, you know. I was like, okay, now I could make music or do a label. Okay, I do a label. But it will come to the point that yes, I will have to be brave and to just do it. you
