White, Chinese, Asian. I used to wear costume. I was on the show girl. That's basically what it's about. The audience will be straight. Stage, birdcage, wings. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artist labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. A third of our live exchanges from the 2012 CommuniKey Festival features DJ Sprinkles, aka Terry Tamlitz, aka Kashi. That's a number of names to remember, but they're all worth doing. so. Sprinkles has made a career out of shapeshifting, making experimental computer music one minute, and then pleasurable house music the next. It's all shot through with a critical eye, however, as you'll hear in this conversation. Sprinkle's method is to interrogate the music he's making as he's making it, resulting in some of the most fascinating and full-bodied tracks in all of electronic music. Hello and welcome to the third and final exchange, live RA exchange, this time with Terry Tamlitz, DJ Sprinkles, Kay Shi, other assorted. Enough. Hi. Thank you for coming straight from the airport. Yeah, I should probably just say, like, if I'm discombobulated or whatever, it's, yeah, it's just, like, plus, no, it hasn't even been 20 hours. But anyway, long flight stuff, so, yeah, if I ramble, then. That's why. You have a new release coming soon that's been in the works for a long time, it feels like. Yeah, five years. What is it called, and what is it about? Well, the project is called Soullessness, and this is a Terry Temlitz album. Different projects get different... names ascribed to them. And this is, so it's basically like my first computer music album since Love Bomb. in 2003. And the format of the album is a 16 gigabyte micro SD card that has over 32 hours of audio and 80 minutes of video and then about 165 pages of writings and images in English. And there's also a bunch of other translations for the video and text. I think in all the languages combined, it's something like 765 pages. Ridiculous. But the reason for all of this sprawl of content and data and stuff is the piece is kind of a reaction to this kind of current MP3. The sprawl of the content. And data everywhere. Yeah, and the idea of that. I also kind of identify a peculiar labor crisis within this where you have the concept of, like, we tend to think of the album as more of a kind of a project theoretical framework device when actually it's something that is more rooted in... media formats and media durations. So in the age of vinyl, you had like 18 minutes per side. So that's why if you buy a CD of a record from the 60s or 70s and it's only like 35 minutes long, it's because each side of the vinyl could hold about 18 to 20 minutes audio max before you get bad audio degradation. And then... You know with the CD era then you had 71 minutes then 81 minutes and I guess now there's I've never seen when there's like this thing called super CD which is like 90 some minutes now or something and I don't know if anybody uses some sounds like something Pink Floyd would be involved. Yeah, like I don't know what but and then but then above that you also have So then you know when the format shifted artists got on board At first this was also a liberating thing to be able to make projects that exceeded the whole 35-minute framework and stuff. But then with CDs, and then now you have the CD plus digital exclusive downloads, plus podcasts, plus DJ mixes, plus blah, blah, blah, that everybody's really pushed to make all of this stuff that goes beyond the project itself. And meanwhile, with all of this pressure to continue to produce longer and longer projects, the advances and royalties are either the same or going down, if anything. And so for me, then, this kind of represents a labor crisis. And so I wanted to then do a piece that, you know, there's a kind of ironic gesture, of course, in producing a 30-year-old. 32 hours of audio and having that not be enough so you need like 80 minutes of video and blah blah blah. When you graciously sent it to me, you emailed me like a week afterwards and you said, well, you know, have you gotten it? it and I said to you yes I've gotten it and I can't even begin to listen to it because I like I looked at it every day and I was like today's not the day It just felt like a daunting task to even begin. Well, yeah, I like that kind of reaction, too. Like, if you can, if it really does confuse people for a minute or something, you know. But I guess I should, just to explain what the whole thing about going with formats and stuff. The length of this album, how it became so long too, was that in the MP3 era, we're kind of taught to think of MP3s just as quick downloads and this sort of thing. But I wanted to explore if the MP3 itself also had a kind of format limitation that would set its own maximum length. Although the MP3 format technically doesn't have that limitation, the operating system on Mac and Windows computers use something called FAT32 system requirements that limits the maximum file size to 8 gigabytes. And although that was up from 2 gigabytes and it'll go up to 16, I'm sure, soon, or if it hasn't already on some Unix stuff or something. But so the idea was like that this the the main audio body of this piece is a single four gigabyte mp3 file at 320 kbps which boils down to about 29 hours and 40 minutes and so I made a piano solo to fill that and then Yeah, I wrote a big a big diatribe about what the fuck I was doing that's a PDF file. You talk about, you know, it's going to get bigger. And I think that's a really interesting aspect of it, that even though you've created the first full-length MP3 album, as the press text says, it's only going to become, you know, it's an impossibility almost. Yeah. Well, the idea is also it means that at some point these files will become functional. I mean, of course, it is functional. Actually, today it should open up in any QuickTime or Windows Media Player, and it should play okay. But when I actually made that part of the album, that was back in 2008, and I spent the next four years doing all the video and all this text and stuff. At that time, it really was not even functioning consistently from application to application. It was really dodgy to even get it to play through. How did you make it? Well, you mean the recording side? Yeah. Well, I was invited to York University as part of this thing called New Aesthetics in Computer Music, which is... is a project that was headed up by Tony-- of the computer music department at York University and then Mark Fell of SND. And basically what this project of theirs was, was to take freelance non-academic people like me who do computer music and invite them to spend two weeks or so working, having access to their... equipment and stuff like that. And in return, then they would get to interview us and figure out like, how the fuck do you survive doing computer music, not being an academic? Because for academics in computer music, this is an incomprehensible, illogical, you know, it just doesn't happen, right? So I thought then, because, you know, I'm also a smartass and a contrarian, and so I thought, well, if they're inviting me to have access to their programmers and all of this hi-fi equipment and stuff, I also knew that they had this beautiful... beautiful Faziole grand piano and I love piano even though I can't really play it and I wanted to touch this piano. And so then what I thought was, okay, I'm going to come up with a project. I kind of really formulated it while I was there. I mean, the technical side of it was that, okay, I want to actually make this a completely acoustic recording, and then the whole technical side of it won't be about asking their people to help me with sound synthesis and all that sort of stuff, but rather to help figure out how to compress these really high-quality... We recorded it at like 96. K24 bit, I think. Something like 70 gigabytes of audio for that. And then how to compress that down into a single file and all that stuff. So for me, even though it is an acoustic recording, but for me it's also computer music in the most strict definition because it could only exist as a single file. on a computer. There is no other format that allows this piece of audio to exist. So that was also a kind of little joke of the piece. You say it's very strictly computer music, but... playing the piano, which is kind of-- - No, but I mean the result. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - I guess just getting to the idea though, like what is it that you love about the piano so much? You know, you're known for the-- computer side of things. I don't think people have explored that aspect so much. Of course I've done piano pieces before, but in the past they've always been computer programmed, even though they were programmed to sound deliberately not computerish. And like the rubato series on mill plateau and that sort of thing. And this, by contrast, is actually my first real acoustic piano recording, you know? But yeah, I mean, basically it was like, it was a chance to have access to, I thought of all the equipment they have and software and all this, what is the kind of most unusual thing that someone like me would never have access to? And it was this 70,000 euro grand piano. in a huge flat room with no reverberation and stuff. When the fuck would that ever happen again in my life? So I was like, I just want to touch it and do things with it. So yeah, that's how I came up with this. And I came up with it because I knew I'd be doing this thing for so many... It was recorded in sittings of about six hours each during the night when people weren't working. in the school area. So I'd work with them all day and then at night I'd be sitting there at the piano. So that's also part of the compositional strategy of the piece too. I don't know if you've, I assume you still haven't heard any of it yet. Some of it. The idea is like, yeah, it's in a kind of Cage-ian sense to have it be very anticlimactic. And there's no point at hour 27 where I get jazzy or anything like that. It's really sticking to rules and going through that sort of thing. Because that was also I wanted to think like, okay, if I'm doing this as a kind of comment on industry standards around MP3 duration and album form. and that sort of stuff. If I want to kind of play industry rules on defining this mp3 album format, then I should kind of adapt their protocols and like it's spelled out in the text like, you know, no flatulence, no burping, no talking, no sleeping, and trying to be like a studio musician when I'm playing it and stuff and like kind of... seeing what, on a labor sense, that would mean, you know, to actually carry out this labor practice of producing this. Was it tough? Was it intensive? Yeah, it was, and it was also a very strange acoustic space. As I said, it was... extremely dry. Like here we have this big reverberating echo on voices happening and stuff. And in that room there was just no reverberation. And there was more than one occasion where I was hallucinating voices and stuff. Just because it was such a strange space. And then you'd get these weird harmonics coming out of the piano by repeating these same phrases. Eventually all the strings are kind of going in this piano. Yeah, you just, you would hear things, you know, that was weird. As part of the piece, you also had these cantos that you added. Yeah, so it's a five, so there's, it's a five-part project, and this piano solo is part five. And there are also four other parts. And the main theme with this title, Soullessness, is like if Love Bomb, like the kind of soundbite synopsis is like, if Love Bomb was my kind of critique of love. as it's manipulated by the audio marketplace. Then this album is kind of trying to deconstruct how spirituality, religion, meditation, these sorts of soul music are also used by audio industries and stuff and trying to kind of unpack. that kind of coding around spirituality and religion and all this shit that, I mean, for me as someone who's not only non-religious but anti-religious and anti-spiritual, then, yeah, I wanted to do a project about that. So there's like four other pieces that kind of are focused on in the video. And the first canto is called Rosary Novena for Gender Transitioning, and it kind of sets up my take on religion, why it pisses me off, but then also thinking that, okay, I also grew up in a... strict Catholic family. My dad was a celibate monk for 19 years before he left his calling to get married and blah blah blah. And so... Yeah, read the text. And it's, so what I do then is I end up saying, okay, well, actually, because I do believe that, you know, I'm one of those people that believes that, you know, the things we go through in childhood do actually kind of give us the codings through which we perceive the world. I mean, of course, we, you know, old dogs learn new tricks, they do. I think that this way of codification of a process, how we perceive things, is something that we carry with us from a long time going on. So then I say, okay, I hate religion, but then how did my Catholic upbringing lead me to my own rejection of that faith? And I kind of go into this deep Catholic reading of transgendered images. within the Catholic Church and then leading that into a kind of getting back into this kind of gender cult type of thing that then in a kind of sarcastic way concludes with this kind of statement of like kind of leading to the logic of sexual reassignment surgery which is also something that you know I'm very critical of the medical industry and they're kind of of trappings around transgender communities and transgender people. So that's part one. And then part two is called Traffic with the Devil, and it was about ghosts. So if part one was about cults and religion, part two is about ghosts and superstition. And it has to do with some friends of mine that I've known since living in Japan. I've lived in Japan for a little over 10 years now. I've known people who were illegal overstays from the Philippine community there, and it always struck me as very strange that they always talked about their apartments being haunted. And, of course, you know, the Philippines is like a super Catholic Asian country. So it's not a surprise that there would be a lot of superstition and that sort of stuff. But I also do want to think about why this particular story? Why would this be a theme for overstays in Japan to have this theme? And my take on that was that, well, if you're forced to kind of live as a ghost in society at large, if you have to kind of cloak yourself so you're not caught by the cops, caught by immigration and stuff. the minute you step outside your apartment door, you have to kind of become a ghost. So then when you come back to that apartment as a kind of safe space, maybe you rematerialize, but you kind of exercise the self as ghost, and then that kind of creates this kind of inversion of the world outside. Do you believe in ghosts yourself? Hell no. But this was about finding material. This was about... finding a kind of material explanation or link or connection to these sorts of mythologies. Because I do believe that religious and spiritual and the superstition things Many of them do have material, they reflect material conditions. I believe this. It's just that the people who think of them, they don't really think of it in those terms. So for me, this is about how can you think about superstition as something that is reflecting a political reality and at the same time being critical of that. So I'm not saying like... oh, yeah, so, you know, the Filipino overstays, they use ghost stories to talk about their stress. Well, it may signify that stress, but at the same time, it also totally fucks people up, makes them totally stressed out, nervous, and if anything, could lead to more chance to be, you know, on edge and lead to getting captured and stuff. So I'm not at all into this romanticization of the superstition. especially like third world, you know, the whole, like, you know, there's this whole thing about let's romanticize the whole kind of third world nativist paradigm and superstition is somehow, you know, always this beautiful thing. How do you go about navigating that? in your own work and trying not to romanticize it? By having all of the completely fucked up power dynamics that happen both within the Philippine community and within the Philippines, because it's kind of done as a documentary within the Philippines. And then myself coming as like an American expat living in Japan and then coming to... to the Philippines to do this video and then the whole dynamics within Japan itself around immigration and letting those dynamics be completely brutally fucked up. Like not trying to be like a politically correct documentarian who is trying to remain neutral, blah, blah, blah, but really make... making it like all of this violence of power dynamics is inescapable. So that's kind of how I try to deal with it. Because there's just too much demand to respect, within the dynamics of imperialism, you have the demand to respect the colonizer and also the demand to respect the native. And I think that both of these end up in a lot of fucked up power dynamics that like, so for me, I'm like, I don't want to, to deal with respect at all. You know what I mean? It's like, it doesn't mean maliciously going out and, um, trying to fuck people's lives up or anything like that, but it just means not trying to use the language and visual and audio signs that we allow to give ourselves a feeling of neutrality or political correctness. When you're creating something like this, are you constantly like, oh, I can't... It's brutal. It's totally depressing. Yeah, that's why it took me so many years. It was just totally fucking brutal to edit and put together. and write and yeah so but you're an alien living in Japan yourself why did you move to Japan in the first place? I mean, there's so many different ways to answer that question. I mean, I had the unlikely, for my life, unlikely chance to leave the United States. And I was 32 when I left the U.S. And, you know, I was 32 living in Oakland, which was near San Francisco. and still like every fucking day when I would leave my house looking like this or whatever and then getting called fag. I mean, it just never stops. It's like fucking like high school or whatever. I've always been miserable in the U.S. I mean, why else would someone like me happen, right, if they weren't just miserable, right? So like making the projects I do and writing the things I do, it's all misery. So I had the chance to leave. Are you miserable in Japan? I'm actually not as miserable. That's, that's, that's, I don't like the daily life shit doesn't happen there. Like, like the U S stuff where like the big difference is like, if Americans don't like you, they're in your fucking face about it. Right. They'll spit on you. They'll throw shit at you. They'll say stuff, whatever. In Japan, if they don't like you, they just fucking ice you out. It's like silence. And if you're born there and you're raised there, that has the same brutality for the locals as, for me, having a can of soda pop thrown at me from a passing car. in the U.S. But for me, coming in this kind of immigrational moment, there are odd betweens that occur. And so for me, it's like that silence is golden. Like if people don't fuck with me and if they don't like me, what's the worst they'll do is they'll ignore me. It's like, how fucking sweet is that? It's like, it's amazing. Do you think there's a place where you can become happy? I think happiness is an emotion that comes and goes, and it's not a lifestyle choice, and it's not an objective for life goals and stuff. I think that's kind of one of the mistakes that the whole kind of enterprise of humanist discourse has, is that people are really convinced that happiness is a lifestyle, and it's just not. It's something that... comes in a wave even in the worst of times and it's I think that needs to be dissected you know I think that kind of was one thing that kind of got touched on in the Love Bomb project a little bit you know trying to show that these things have other power dynamics going beneath them like love and happiness and things they have other they serve other kinds of dominant discourses you know Does every project have to have a defining concept or theme for you? For me, yeah. Is that the only way that you work? For me, yeah. For me, the idea is more important than the sound or whatever. I mean, because otherwise there's... I mean, I don't play any instruments. I'm not talented in that sense. And if people wanted that kind of music, there's endless shitloads of people doing that stuff so good. So for me, it's like... But also for me, it's like that's totally uninteresting. For me, it's all about ideas and using sound as language. Because if you say, oh, I just like music, I want to do music about melody or whatever, but in the end, then that also... ends up being defined by the terms of industry or club life or whatever area you're distributing yourself in, that, you know, you just become a tool in that sense, you know, if you don't actively engage in... the way that your project is being received and marketed and stuff. You seem to be distributing yourself in a lot of different markets. You know, you have the club life thing, you have the kind of academic thing, even though you're not an academic. Is there one that you prefer over another, or do you need all of them to sort of balance things? It's psychologically handy to have more than one thing, because then when you get burned out on one, you can kind of do something else. Like, yeah, coming out of this Soullessless project, it's nice to do some DJing things or something, you know what I mean? But then it's also like doing too much DJ work, and it's like... oh fuck that you know you want to do something else so so yeah I mean it is one kind of strategy that I mean that but for me that that strategy of producing things is actually again connected back to my identity politics and my take on my own gender and sexuality and these sorts of things that it's also that's also about fragmentation and assuming different characters and different um being conscious about the ways that different environments twist you into a different being and um So for me, then, it makes sense then to produce and work and employ myself in ways that also... go along with this and have some resonance of that. For me, that's helpful. I wanted to talk a little bit about your DJing. You're very distinctive, I think. You play a lot of your own tracks, for the most part. The mixing is... Shit. You play the song out to the end most times. Yeah, it's Loft style. I mean, that's what you'd call it in New York. It's like, yeah, you play songs from beginning to end. Is there a reason for that? Because I actually like the music. I mean, what else can I say? I like the music. I like the idea that somebody sat down and structured the piece and actually took time. And if I like it and if I really respect it and enjoy it, then why not play it out? Because if I'm in a club and somebody's like, you know, these really technically savvy DJs where if a track's been on for three minutes, you know they ran to the toilet or something because there's just no track that lasts that long in their set. And first of all, I'm thinking, how much are they fucking paying you to work that fucking hard? And then I'm also thinking like, yeah, how do you listen to, how do you even, I couldn't do it. I couldn't even do it. But I'm also not interested in that way because I just, yeah, I like my records. I don't mean my, I mean the records I own, right, the records by other people. But yeah, over the years, that collection, has been increasingly mixed in with my own tracks. Are there particular producers that you play a lot of that you like? Well, you know. I mean, you know I'm still stuck in the late 80s and early 90s, New York and New Jersey and that whole thing. And one thing that makes me a bad DJ is that I don't know... all of the different aliases used by different producers and stuff. you know, like, somebody will come and be like, oh, yeah, play that Joey Longo remix of blah, blah, and I'll be like, I don't know what in the, Pal Joey, oh, yeah, okay, you know, and so I'm really bad with names, and I'm really bad with that sort of stuff. It's more like I know what the label looks like more than I know what it says, and I'm that kind of DJ, so I'm very bad to say what I like What was it about that era, sonically, that got to you? I think... I think it was the whole era that for me came to an end when in, I would say, 92, 93, when this was talking about in New York. I don't know exactly how things timed out in other areas, but in New York, that was really when techno and house strictly divided, right? And the example that I always use to demonstrate this is like the Moby, the very first Moby Go EP was like... some of the most fucking amazing Deep House. It's still one of my favorite New York Deep House records of all time. And then the very next remix single of that was just 100% shit from that point on. And it was like, for me, I couldn't play any of it. It was all techno stuff that in New York was very much ascribed to a kind of... white, heterosexual scene, I would say. And this also was like a very big issue for me, was that the kind of... the whole way in which the techno scene was just so fucking heterosexist in New York and so white, not sonically, but racially. And so for me, that was like when those things became really crystallized and you couldn't cross those lines anymore because the record distributors and the labels, they had their... directions, they started knowing how to sell, Strictly Rhythm started becoming Strictly Vocals with vocal tracks everywhere and all that stuff, like these were really strategic decisions, you know, at that point it became like, okay, well, if you're going to do an EP for us, you need to have a vocal mix because we need to have radio play and what fucking radio station was playing these things anyway? Nowhere, right? Or maybe, I don't know, in Europe, maybe, but, you know, of any of that. So, yeah, so for me, then it was this period beforehand where it was like, you know, from like, I moved to New York in 86, so like 86 to 92, you had this weird moment where you could get all kinds of music in one place. The house music was still the house music. It wasn't house as a genre that the distributors knew how to market. It was just the house music were the records that were owned by the club usually at that time. Like when I worked at Sally's, they had their collection of records. I also brought in my own. That was one reason why they hired me was because I gave them a... tape and they liked it and they said will you bring your records to the club and I said will you keep them safe and they said yes and then I said okay then I'll bring my records and yeah but yeah like house music was that's what it was it was like it meant that the music of the house it wasn't a genre really you know so what was Sally's like? Sally's was dark. It was nasty and perverse. things that the kind of romanticization of how people like to represent, including people within the transgender community, like to represent things. There's a way in which it gets cleaned up over history. I mean, Sally's was pretty raunch. I mean, like, the first time I walked in there... And it was Sally Maggio and Jimmy. Jimmy was the kind of manager kind of guy. And the first time I walked in there and I had my tape and I was like, yeah, is there someone I can give this tape to? And they said, yeah, go in the kitchen. It was in the Carter Hotel on 43rd Street. It was a ballroom. They had a restaurant and a bar. and the ballroom wasn't really used much and just a big kind of empty space with ugly carpeting on the floor and no real lighting system or anything. And they said, yeah, go into the kitchen. He's in there. And I opened the door and he's sitting there getting a blowjob from one of the transsexuals. Because it was a sex worker scene, you know. So then I waited for him to finish. And then gave him the tape. And yeah, that's how it started, you know. And then I replaced the 16-year-old Puerto Rican kid who was like, who couldn't stand faggots. And it was like that sort of scene, you know. It wasn't like this kind of thing where you think like a community and blah, blah, blah. It was really, it was really hard, you know. Why did you go there in the first place? Well, I had been... a friend told me about it I had been DJing at that point not really in like I just was always in like super fucked up tragic clubs I mean like the clubs that I DJed before I was like there was this really nasty rice bar called Club 59 and my partner at the time was one of the founders of the API the Asian Pacific Islander Caucus for ACT UP and So I was DJing at their benefits, or I would supply the tape for their pride parade contingent or whatever. So, yeah, I just kind of DJed these one-off things at these really totally messed up clubs that were also like environments, but these were also places that, like me and the people that I knew, we were more drawn to these kind of places that didn't have the kind of utopian, communal, blah, blah, because there was already too much of that within the kind of activist work we were doing at the time, and it was already so kind of... flawed and we wanted to be places where like we where we just felt more comfortable around places where we knew from the start that this is totally messed up this is totally fucked up there's nothing heroic about this there's nothing like you know clean about it it's totally nasty and that was in a way, yeah, it was helpful, you know, like psychologically, you know, but also I think, yeah, that was also kind of my experience in life always, is just always kind of not... fitting in, my body not fitting in to a particular community or scene which of course when you're involved in a lot of things that touch onto identity issues becomes very complicated and that's how I got into anti-essentialism and all that stuff. It seems like you could have gone exactly the opposite way. Totally could have gone the opposite way. There were definitely points in my life when I could have. There are definitely crossroads where I could say I would be just like the most standard West Village drag queen right now if I had only rented that apartment or broken up with that person at that time. stayed with that person at that time. Yeah, you can totally see, like, you know, somehow I escaped things, and at the same time, those escapes... have also been destructive in a social way, but in a way that I feel is identifiable and understandable, comprehensible to me. What do you do after making a full-length MP3 album? Seven inch? Yeah, right? I like the fact that I don't really know, and I assume at some point I'll find a way to do something that I feel better about, I'm sure. What do you mean feel better about? Well, like, for example, like my big crisis after the Love Bomb video was like... Not saying like, oh, it's so fucking amazing, but for me, it was like a really huge thing for me to finish that video. And I thought like, well, how can I do something better than that? You know, even though it's not, but you know, it didn't sell. Like, I basically made 50 copies of the Love Bomb video, and I still have... about 17 of them sitting in my closet. So that's like the level of, we're talking about how much it's sold, right? So it's not about that sort of thing, but just in terms of, for me, feeling what I was able to make a product that expressed what I wanted it to, to some over 70%, we'll say. And then I was totally depressed about Soulless List while I was working on it the whole time. And I thought, oh, this is going to be a nightmare. But also it was a nightmare because the themes were so depressing. Yeah, but I don't know. So I figure now that it's done, I'm just kind of like, you know, I don't know. I'm at this point where I don't want to think about it for a little bit. Did you feel that good when you finished Midtown 120 Blues? Like I've accomplished something here. You know, Midtown 120 Blues, I never, no. imagine that to be what it to catch on like it did I mean and again we're saying catch on like it did as if it like actually sold you know but but sure there are a lot of people here who have the download that they got from some website and then probably about three of you who have a CD and maybe some vinyl vinyl freaks or something But, yeah, that's the other difficult thing in talking about all these sorts of things is that, especially in the kind of blog, the blog generation now and stuff, is like... Things get so repeated and thrown all over the web that, like, for example, my website, which was originally started in the early 90s as a kind of joke about the Internet as a kind of hype machine. And it's totally... become what I imagined it would, but in the worst possible ways. And so resident advisor excluded, of course. Of course. Like what's the chance of something like Soullessless getting Album of the Year as opposed to Midtown 120 Blues getting Album of the Year? I mean the politics behind that sort of decision also, I think that is something that, but yeah, it just becomes incredibly difficult to figure out where, like for example, because of course you're totally dealing with so many projects, you know, like coming in and stuff, and I'm in my own weird little bed. room studio and then the people here I have no idea what the fuck any of you know or if you even know who I am and so it becomes very difficult to figure out like how do you talk about these sorts of things in a way that makes sense to a group of people and so if it's not making sense I completely apologize But here we are trying to make sense of it all. I guess... But you were kind of asking about Midtown. Yeah. on some level, doing the thing that I was criticizing. And of course, me doing an album about that was also being a part of that machine that I was criticizing and stuff. And of course, the baseline 89 EP by Sprinkles was also about that and stuff. So this idea of self-critique. is a part of my spiel and a part of my tactic, but it's very difficult to find record labels who are okay with this. Because they think when I say, hey, your label is shit, they tend to forget at that point that I'm also saying that I'm shit. So all they hear is that they're shit. And so, you know, like how do you work these sorts of things out? Let's do this awesome. It is. It is. I mean, yeah, literally, emotionally, it is exhausting. But yeah, the Keishi album then was kind of like, for me, that was a project that I did not expecting anyone to ever hear that. I mean, I was totally surprised when Skylax licensed that and stuff. What's that? Yeah, actually Skylax is really supportive and really, I mean, I have to say that their approach in releasing, re-releasing my stuff has been... really, really dead on in terms of personal communication. Just that, like, for example, okay, like, let's just kind of, maybe this is not so nice to do, but okay, let's just compare, like... Mule and Midtown 120 Blues and Skylax and Keishi. Okay, for Midtown 120 Blues, I wanted to control design of the cover. I had to argue about that. I wanted to write a text. I had to argue about that. I wanted the text to be bilingual. They were like totally, you know, Japanese and English because I live in Japan. I wanted it to be bilingual. They were totally against the Japanese being included because it was only cool for them to have English. I thought, well, for Europeans, it's cool to have Japanese, and it's a weird, stupid marketing bullshit level. But then they were like, but I was like, okay, but I want to have a text. I want to have a booklet. And they were like, no, you have two pages. So that's why it's like five-point type with just little tiny paragraphs and stuff. It was really tooth and nail for all of these things. And with Skylax, you know, they, I said... I said, oh, it would be great if we could do this because you're a French label. When I put it out, it was in bilingual Japanese and English. I said, it would be really great if you did a French version. And they were totally into it. I forget how many pages, 12 pages or whatever with English and then French translation, really nicely paid translator and stuff. And then for designing that jacket, like in Japan, you can't show images of a penis unless it's like mosaic or whatever. So that's why you have to wait until you get inside the record to actually see the penis. So when I was initially designing the cover for that, I forget exactly what I had, but I didn't have... the penis showing, and then from their side, they said, ah, we really wanted this photo with the penis on it. I was like, yeah, exactly, that's what I, yes. So it's like, I mean, this is what, you know what I mean, it just, it worked out. Sometimes it syncs up and sometimes it doesn't, and it doesn't, and sometimes when it doesn't sync up, that doesn't mean that those people. or assholes or whatever. It just means that you're coming at it from a different angle and it just is not syncing up. So that's why you had to release Soullessness yourself? Soullessness myself? Yeah, I was thinking of maybe trying to get like Mode Records who handles John Cage's catalog because they might know what to do with a 30-hour. But they don't really know what to do with anything, I think. I mean, it's John Cage, so they release it and people who like John Cage would get it, right? But I like Mode. I did the remix for them of the John Cage stuff, which still hasn't come out, but other than as my kind of bootleg vinyl that they approved of, but it was kind of shady. Yeah, and I thought of some other way, but then in the end I was like, I don't want a contract on this, you know what I mean? I don't want someone else to have some sort of connection to it. And I also, in that way, that also then I have to start censoring myself. I have to start worrying about, if it's just me, then I'm more willing to take risks with sampling, with, in this piece there's a lot of... kind of dodgy political stuff where like I actually mention people's names when maybe it's like I shouldn't have or I don't know. These kind of vague things, questions that I don't know. Like if it's a record label with a lawyer and all that shit that they might start asking me questions that then would alter the content. So that's why, yeah. Cool. Well, I think we should... wrap up but thank you very much yeah
