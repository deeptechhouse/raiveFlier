Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. When Berlin's iconic Tresor Club was moving out of its original location in the middle of the last decade, debug journalists Felix Denk and Sven von Thulen came up with the idea of documenting it through an oral history. The story encompassed a wide range of characters from the Berlin scene, as well as the Detroit artists whose music was so critical to its development. The project soon outgrew its original remit. The eventual result was Der Klang der Familie, or The Sound of the Family, a document of Berlin techno from the mid-80s through the mid-90s. Across dozens of interviews, Dank and von Thulen discovered they weren't just hearing about the beginnings of an iconic music scene. but the story of Berlin's reunification itself, told through an unprecedented youth culture. The book was published in German in 2012, to mark the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Declang de Familia will be published in English this November 9th. They'll also launch the translation at Berghain that weekend, with a reading in the cantina, followed by an author-curated club. night on the main floor. I sat down with Denk and Von Tulin recently to discuss what English speakers can expect from this new edition. Bye. You say at the beginning of the book that sort of everything that is happening in the book, you weren't there for it. You guys are not necessarily from this generation that you're writing about. How did the whole process get started then? I mean, where did you begin? Well, the original idea kind of came up in 2005 when the original Trezor. had to close. And I, before that, a couple of years before that, I had read Please Kill Me and Verschwinde Dein Jugend, both two books, also oral histories on first generation of punk in the US and then first generation of punk in Germany. And I guess you also read them, right? So we were like fascinated by the format. of oral histories, you know, how to tell a story while having all the different perspectives. And then, to the close, and one long afternoon at the debug office, I was like, it closed, and then what's going to happen then, you know, and it should, you know, somebody should tell the story. of Tresor and wouldn't it be interesting to have that and then have it with like all the you know meeting of the guys from Detroit and coming to Berlin in the new unified city which was a completely different vibe than back in Detroit blah blah blah all that so I went to Felix I told him about it he was like oh yeah let's do that and we kind of took it from there and it took us six years to kind of finally get the contract with our publisher and then on you know on the way also the the idea kind of changed as well so we can made it bigger as a whole history about the whole whole of Berlin and not just not just the Tresor. And was that just a matter of you began hearing stories about Berlin that seemed to fit in with Tresor, but were maybe a little bit separate? Maybe things that you didn't know about originally? Oh, yeah, there were many things we didn't know originally. We were both born in the mid-70s, both not born in Berlin. And when we came to Berlin, which was mid-90s, for us it was still totally exciting because it was so different than what our hometowns were like. There were parties in empty buildings. Everything seemed to be empty. Everything seemed to be possible in a certain way. And after a while we realized that most people who have been longer in Berlin already said that basically everything's over already, which we couldn't really believe. In a way, these stories about the very early anarchic days where you just could go into buildings, build up a sound system and have a party, they were always kind of vivid in Berlin, but no one really wrote them down. And since so many really different people came together, first of all, the kids from East Berlin and West Berlin, which is totally... They grew up in totally different circumstances. But then the guys from Detroit delivered the soundtrack. Also totally different social scenario, US. especially Detroit, strange city. And so all these kind of different actors make a great, this is a great subject for an oral history, which is always exciting when there are many really different people coming together. It is interesting. I mean, I guess I came to Berlin. probably 15 years after you guys got here. It's funny what you say. It sounds like you got here more or less, and not to give away the ending, but sort of right when the book ends is when you guys arrive. And it feels fresh to you. It feels new. It feels very exciting. Whereas in the book, it really does feel like the end of an era. I get here in like 2012 or something. And it still feels exactly the same. I mean, was it surprising to you, like, how far back things went? No, it wasn't surprising how far things... went back because we we kind of knew that before but um the just the extent of the anarchy i wasn't fully aware of that you know and i was also wasn't even though i kind of you know you i wasn't fully aware of the implications of of east and west i mean i knew obviously you know as being from germany you know about you know we grew up with it you know I was when the wall fell I was 13 he was he was 14 right so you know you know like different circumstances and all of that and I lived in when I moved to we both when we moved to Berlin we moved to the east like everybody I guess in the mid 90s so um but still like youth culture in the east I wasn't aware of that at all For me, one of the biggest surprises was, and that was something we learned from researching the book, from all the interviews with the guys, was in a very fascinating way, Berlin was even before the Berlin Wall fell. kind of not so strongly divided city in subcultural terms. I mean, all the guys from East Germany, we asked, they were constantly hearing the West radio. So they kind of knew everything about music. And since they didn't have so many channels, since they couldn't go to the parties that were constantly referred on the radio, they had kind of a, it was kind of an imaginary flight to some place they couldn't go. was kind of laden with a kind of a desire to to to go to these places and they knew everything about music about these this fresh new music and them and this is funnily just uh when the wall came down it was a it was a thursday and so on friday the next day they all went to that asset house club in west berlin and the guys in the acid house club were totally surprised what are these guys from these doing there where did they come from should we let them in All these questions all of a sudden, right? So that was kind of fascinating how a divided city in a way wasn't so divided. Yeah, the radio, I mean, was huge. Before this music kind of took off in clubs, it was taking off on the radio, which was obviously something that you had access to whichever side of the wall you were on. Yeah, exactly. I mean, there was this one radio show by Monika Dietl, which everyone was listening to. She was playing the hottest records. She also always said where the parties are. And sometimes she kind of made them up a little, like a little bit of a story. So you didn't really know where it was because some of the clubs or the parties were illegal. So also the kids in the East were kind of guessing where could it be. And the first UFO was in Köpenicker Straße, which was kind of, you know, it was maybe 200 meters from Friedrichshain, from East Berlin. So it was so close. Paul Van Duk, for instance, he was always listening to that radio show. He was just living right across it. I mean, you could have walked if there wasn't a wall. I mean, radio was one thing. And another thing that really I didn't know at all, which really surprised me was... that um that so there was these kids from from the east that kind of left east berlin before the wall came down in the late 80s, mid to late 80s, and who were also all, like a lot of them were breakdancing. The breakdancing thing is great. I had no idea that breakdancing took off and was in a way almost encouraged by the East German officials or something. It was like sticking it, it was seen as an anti... imperialist art form or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And some of them kind of left the GDR like in 86, 87. And obviously they stayed in contact as much as they could with their friends in the East. And some of them kind of started to go to the UFO, for instance, and also got into the very early Berlin electronic music. And once the wall fell, they reunited. So you had like two days, what Felix just said, just two days after the wall fell, some kids from the East came and they weren't strangers because they didn't know anyone, but they knew like two, three people there they hadn't seen for three, four years. And it was kind of like they reunited on two levels, you know, on a personal level and also like on a political level. And that's, I was kind of blown away by that, you know, I didn't know about that at all. Something that surprised me was sort of the ambivalence to some degree on the part of people from the East about this whole thing. For one thing, it seemed like people were shocked at how bad conditions were in some parts of the West. Like they would go to Kreuzberg and just be, they would be like, there was one street lamp working on like the next four blocks. Like it was never that bad in the East. We kept hearing we were having it so badly off. But then also this feeling that the few people who stuck it out in the East were somehow, there was some tension when the wall comes down and suddenly all these people from the West are back. It's like, well, where have you been this whole time? Yeah, but... I was, it's very interesting. I think it was very funny, but especially the first impressions of the West by the kids from East Berlin, that's highly fascinating. I mean, what did they know about the West? They mainly had pictures of the TV that they probably all were watching. And then probably what they saw on TV didn't look like Berlin Kreuzberg these days. It was kind of pretty much, you know, pretty run down and kind of a dark. place and not that East Berlin at that time wasn't much a happier place but they were surprised that they thought it would be the golden west you know where everything is shining and wonderful and people are rich and glamorous and what they discovered sometimes was that okay yeah weird people the lights don't go it's um um it's very funny the one guy said that he was surprised that they were kind of they didn't seem to be rich when they got to a club they more looked like squatters or something you know and they weren't they weren't expecting that that's quite funny but they also um they weren't they weren't expecting to meet their old buddies that left gdr a bit earlier in the in the in these small tiny clubs Well, this speaks to another thing that I was really struck by reading this book. I mean, if you've spent any time in Berlin nightlife, you know, even quite recently, you kind of have a sense of certain things that are unique here, like the after-party culture, the way the door works at a club. The fact that these clubs aren't necessarily very fancy places, they feel a bit run down, maybe in some cases a lot like squats. I mean, you can see that the beginnings of this whole nightclub culture back then, you know, like at some point someone had to sort of start. the first After Hours Club to kind of find these like kernels of the beginning of this culture that must have been exciting. Totally. Yeah, yeah, that was. Yeah. I mean, there's some eternal rules of nightlife, nightlife apparently, which is like the great mystery of all the bouncers not to let you in for a certain while to let you wait. I also was kind of excited by the very first West Berlin club that had a really DJ culture. The Metropole, it was called. Also West Bam was one of their early DJs there. and they had kind of that i found highly fascinating it's um basically it opened in the late 70s was kind of a proper disco club but had a late heyday during the high energy phase kind of early to mid 80s and that was when westbam was playing there as well And it was interestingly kind of, on the one hand, there was quite an explicit gay scene, but also kind of the strange new wave kids went there as well. So this is kind of something that was always the best Berlin clubs. parties were always when kind of a gay crowd and a straight crowd could have partied on the same dance floor. This is what happened at the Metropole very first, I think. Then, quite likely. And then later on a bit at the UFO, but more strongly at the Planet, later at the E-Work, then at the Osgood, and now obviously at the Berghain or about Blenke. This was one of the eternal success formulas of Berlin nightlife. When that happens, the party is good. Yeah, it is true. And that was another thing that I was really struck by is you don't really see in Berlin such a divide between the gay scene and the straight scene. I mean, they seem to be different camps within the same club, right? Interestingly, and it's cool for everyone, apparently. Otherwise, it wouldn't last for like 30 years now. Another thing that I loved reading about in this book that something else you kind of take for granted, maybe wouldn't necessarily think about is hard wax. you know, the beginnings of this shop. It's a special shop. A lot of people like to go buy records there, but I think people don't completely understand. What makes that shop special and how they were pulling off something that was sort of unthinkable at the time? I mean, tell me a little bit about what you guys learned about that shop. One of the main things of this whole beginning of this culture is scarcity, you know, scarcity of information about records, for instance. And so Hot Wax, Mark Anestos being, you know, music fanatic. he decided to open the store and he just wasn't happy about the distribution channels that were in place in Germany. So there was some of the early, mid-80s to late 80s house and techno stuff from Chicago and Detroit. And New York came to Berlin, but always just, you know, one copy here, one copy there. And, you know, and he wasn't happy with this, you know, he wanted and he loved the music. So and he wanted to know, well, what's what's it like? Where's this music coming from? You know, how can I get more of it? And and I think for him also, it was kind of a. And he decided in late 1990, he decided to go to Detroit. And I think it was kind of also an educational trip, you know, business as well, but also kind of, you know, he wanted to know the people who actually do the music. He wanted to see the conditions under which the music was made and all of this. So he went to first to New York, then to Chicago and then to Detroit. to meet people, to, you know, find records. And that's how it all kind of started. Like those close dealings with like labels from Detroit or Chicago, which they weren't. they were completely not used to that that someone from europe would come to their city um and uh you know try to you know buy all this like stock from them directly and kind of be really like happy to get all this like these hands on all these you know, kind of sometimes even kind of forgotten records. So, yeah, that's, I mean, Hardworks was really, really influential in terms of... you know kind of overcome the scarcity and also as a meeting point where people kind of I mean I think Mark and Esther also says it in the book like everybody did know a little bit you know somebody knew this record somebody knew that record and you would meet at hardwax or sometimes at parties I guess And you would share the knowledge, you know, I heard about this today. It's completely unthinkable that, you know, that you don't know everything or that you can just look, look it up in the Internet, you know, or Discogs. Oh, yeah, there it is. And that's amazing. So, and one pivotal things for, for, for the Berlin scene, I guess, is the return of Boris, Berghain resident Boris, the return of Boris coming back from New York. The incredible, one incredible thing is it almost sounds in the, in the book, like. A lot of the original stock at Hard Wax was just based on this record collection that Boris came back from the States with. And also, so for one, he knew about all of this music from the States. And it sounds like they were able to find, you know, some boxes of this in warehouses in the States that they were then able to get back over, like back stock. But then also he spoke incredibly good English and was able to help forge these relationships with the U.S. distributors. Yeah, he came back and Mark and Boris, they kind of knew each other, you know. And it's so funny, you know, now he's a Berghain resident, you know, and back then he wasn't. I mean, he was used to dancing in the Paradise Garage, you know, 2000 people, like big. And then Berlin Techno scene was tiny, like 100 people or something. And for him, it was like, what is this? You know, he wasn't, you know, he wasn't very excited about this whole thing. He didn't even like the music very much, actually. Yeah, he liked it. He kind of he came from disco, obviously, and he liked house, but he wasn't, you know, early techno sound which was very also i mean apart from some of the american stuff it was very like eurocentric was like really ravey basically you know so for him i guess that was a deal breaker well he says in the book something along the lines of you know he saw the writing on the wall in new york that um that Giuliani was coming into power, the Paradise Garage was closing, the loft was leaving its original location, all of this, and the wall had just come down in Berlin, like, kind of seems like an opportunity or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, he kind of... you know, he thought, okay, the best, the golden days of New York are over. And Berlin, something, you know, new start, something that he, because he's, you know, he's from Neukölln originally. So he said for him, it was unthinkable that Berlin would ever be one city, you know? So I guess that was. obviously a very good moment to come back and see what's it all about. But I think he was kind of disappointed by the emergent house and techno scene. Even though he might have been disappointed, he helped Hardworks a lot with his knowledge and with his English skills. And then he helped Mark. the others like a lot to kind of contact the American distributors and then yeah basically I think when Mark decided to go to Detroit in late 90 before he went he and Boris went to see Derek May play at UFO which was the first first time the debut of Derek May in Berlin and I think 25 people or something were there no one was there no one was there and um so they went there and and and uh kind of pulled them together kind of got all the courage and like went up to Derek and asked him And I told him, like, I want to come to Detroit. And, you know, then they exchanged telephone numbers and kind of went on from there. So Boris was there for a very long time and was very, very influential. A lot of people don't really know that. Speaking about Detroit, in the book, I found that there was a certain nuance about that sort of Berlin-Detroit connection that came out that... I hadn't really read about before or hadn't really considered before. It was so interesting how the two cities had a lot in common. I mean, their situations were the same in some ways and in other ways very different. There's, you know, the story about Demetrius. Dimitri Hegemon from Tresor wanting to go over there and start a club like the Detroit Tresor. And sort of the last straw for him was hearing gunshots on the street or something and realizing that it was just a completely different situation there. But there was also something that I think Mike Banks says in the book. where he was talking about how with underground resistance and with Detroit records in general, they were really trying to put all of these kind of forward thinking, futuristic ideas into the minds of like inner city kids in the United States. But their distributors were sending all of their records overseas and where they were all being bought by sort of a middle class white audience. And they were seeing a lot of money from this, but they were also like a little bit sad that their message was basically being diverted. The interesting thing is it's kind of a symbiotic relationship in a way. In Detroit, they had this strange, futuristic, super modern new dance. sound but they didn't really have a crowd that danced to it which is completely strange especially in dance music because dance music normally evolves around clubs you know like in New York or Chicago but it was quite different in Detroit I mean there were clubs there were parties but nothing which lasted quite long and they especially the guys from underground resistance didn't have a crowd so most most guy also the first generation detroit is forced to go abroad to dj to make money and they went basically to um to england the second generation bit different they went more to continental europe and especially to berlin and um yeah well we were in for one week in detroit and we're speaking to people actually we would have liked to speak to more other guys but hard to track them down sometimes. And the fact that they didn't reach their own crowd is very traumatic for all of them. We had the impression, I mean, yes, it's great that they had an, that they could, that they kind of conquered the world with their sound, but not having an audience that applauded. you in your own city was very difficult, especially for Mike Banks, who's not only thinking music terms, but also in social terms and how to push your community and to make things work in front of his own door. Well, and their music, which also has a very political element to it, is sort of going on to soundtrack. these, you know, very debauched kind of epic drug parties, which was something that was not part of like the Detroit scene either. That was something I was struck by in the book too. I mean, Berlin is quite excessive now in terms of what happens at clubs, but I mean, there's a lot of drugs in this book. Did that, do you feel like, I don't know, did that sort of color some of the stories that you were hearing about? I mean, I don't even think that there are so many drugs in the book. I think the reality was probably way more excessive, you know, like, that's for sure, way more excessive than. then you know you get a feeling in the book but you know you kind of also have to you know just imagine uh the the role drugs had back then you know um it was completely different you know when like in you know before like in the late 80s and you know in dance I mean club culture was you know like only or mostly gay people had you know would do drugs well you know had like contacts where they could get hold of drugs so When this kind of, when like the straight crowd and the gay crowd kind of met and they kind of started to party together and this whole, and drugs were more readily available, you know, in some way or another. I mean, there's some funny stories about that in the book as well. That was kind of, it was such a, it was in a way such a turning point, you know, because ecstasy was also. kind of MDMA or whatever it was kind of completely it was kind of a game changer you know and it and it fitted so perfectly with this new newfound freedom you know like the wall comes down you could explore the city there's no laws or you don't feel that there's any law you don't feel that you need to have any money you don't you could do it's like a playground basically and there's no one to say you cannot do this and you cannot do that and then there's this drug which kind of opens your heart and is very empathic and people kind of come together and there's this new this new music which speaks to you on a completely different level you know there's no there are no not very much vocals and no meaning you know and in a way and and you just dance you know it kind of you know explore and and and reconnect to your body with it so i think drugs were a very big thing for a lot of people you know the experience the experience was very important I think what's really funny is when in America back then, this is something where especially under-country resistance had a very strong anti-drugs policy is that they had a big crack problem in the 80s, all that, dragonomics. But in the early Berlin rave scene, guys like DJ Tani said that, for instance, they tried to convince the Detroiters, hey. This is ecstasy. This is something completely different. This is really good and great and perfect. So it's quite funny. The Detroiters, they didn't probably know ecstasy, not very much at least. And some probably found it a bit irritating. They probably found it quite irritating that the clubs were so gay as well. Also, what a lot of them said, they were kind of polite when you touch these subjects in the interview. And some also said that they felt it strange how the Germans danced. They're kind of, you know, like machine-like. And yeah, especially the Burton brothers, I said... I think they said it once they were the first time on May Day where there were like 4,000 kids dancing and they heard their own tracks for the first time on such a big sound system there. And seeing the kids on drugs, they were really like, whoa. they couldn't imagine that this happens to their music. They didn't have these pictures in mind when they produced it. But it was quite fascinating to know all that. Right, because they were all producing things in their bedrooms. Basically, yeah. Really had no idea about it. Although they had hits in England and all that, but they weren't in England yet. Also, they didn't, I mean, for a very long time, they didn't even know that there was this one track on the second techno compilation, which... I believe, huh? Yeah, I believe the techno compilation by Neil Rushton and Derek May. And apparently this track kind of blew up in the UK. But they didn't know about it because nobody told them, you know. And then they found out through a guy who was working at KMS because he came back from, I don't know if he came back from the UK or maybe Kevin Saunders or someone came back and had a Mixmag, a copy of Mixmag magazine. And they, you know, found a page with an ad, like a full page ad. and and it was i think della soul maxi priest and octave one on one page on the same ad and they were like what we have to go to europe you know we have to find out what's going on And then they decided to not just go to London, but also come to Berlin. And then they came just in time for the first May Day. That's something actually that also Hohen Atkins said, which I found highly fascinating. Hohen Atkins obviously being part of the first Detroit generation, a guy who played in the massive UK race with 5,000 people. like in the late 80s. And he said, like, when he played at these, we were wondering if it was different for a guy like him to play in England or in Berlin. And he said, interestingly, when he played in England, there was... when there were 5,000 people dancing, there was probably the sound engineer and him, the only black people. So in a way, it was in Berlin, whereas in Berlin, it was like in basements and cellars and more underground. He didn't feel, although he didn't speak the language and all that, it didn't feel to him more strange in a way. In a way, they seemed to be even closer connected. I remember that point in the book. He said that if everyone had been speaking English, it would have just felt like Detroit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And also, when I asked him, I remember if Trezor is the club where he has DJed or played the most often in his life. And he said, yes. I mean, that's also interesting. And it seems that he didn't really consider it before, actually. I had the impression that he never asked himself which was the club where he played most. But after all, this says a lot about how close the relationship in a way is. Yeah, going back to the, I guess, you know, the point about ecstasy and that bringing everybody together, it is really striking, like the sort of cast of characters that would be it. at any given one of these nights. I think it's a, the club, was it called Volfish? Volfish. Yeah, yeah. When you read about that place, you know, you would have these guys come in who were like soccer, you know, who were football hooligans, basically, who would have, you know, I think they say in the book, I forget who says it, but something along the lines of like these guys. would have kicked our asses like every other day of the week. But then they come in here and they're on 10 pills or something and they just want to go in the basement and cuddle and dance and like do whatever. You really do get a sense that so many people were coming together during this time. I mean, yeah, definitely. You had the same kind of the same phenomenon in the UK, you know. When the summer of love in the UK, which was 87 or 88, I don't know. 88, I think. Yeah. So, I mean, you had a big, they had a big like hooligan problem in the UK. And suddenly within like... year or something there was hardly any crime you know hardly any like hooligans roaming the street after games and because you know a lot of them started to go on raves you know and started to do ecstasy and kind of it's always I mean as in the chapter of Balfish that you mentioned you know it's always a question of how long these effects last you know so for a lot of those people who are usually more aggressive you know it lasted exactly as long as they kind of got back to alcohol and coke and then you know everything kind of came tumbling down again and they would start kick each other's ass again So, but for, you know, you have this moment, you know, this opening suddenly. And I mean, also, a lot of people were not on drugs. I mean, you always have to say that as well, because a lot of people were just really, you know, the music was so new and the circumstance, everything that was so new that a lot of people were also, you know, that was their high, basically. And especially in the beginning, because in the beginning, I mean, you had to have connections to get any drugs, you know. So I think that's also important to mention that it wasn't like just, you know, some. drug culture, you know, and without the drugs, it wouldn't have been as, you know, it was kind of both, you know? Yeah, there's a great quote in the book about, you know, the party, a bad party is a bad party, whether you're on drugs or not. A good party is a great party when you're on drugs or something along those lines. But I think it's also not a small point just kind of to go back to the music and feeling... high from the music. I mean, this was a sound that had never really existed before being played in sorts of spaces that, that never existed before. Um, I mean, you mentioned this in the introduction, but like, that's no small thing. It really did sound like music from out of space. You would imagine. Yeah. It was kind of a. It was for everyone kind of a flash of newness and nowness in a way. And also what most people said is that they had the impression that the music gets reinvented every week. So next week you have a new sound. It was like a day was like a week and a week was like a month and everything felt so incredibly fast. And this is kind of where everything comes together, the musical development, but also kind of Berlin after the war. things were so unclear and unshaped and when when you were quick you could really do exciting things which is quite an exceptional situation obviously yeah one of my favorite quotes about music in the whole book and it comes it's something that mark ernestus said who sort of in my reading of the book is sort of like one of the real heroes of the whole story um but he said um It was liberating to have music that leaves this cognitive level at the door, reducing itself completely to the rhythmic and emotional functionality and running free there. a great deal of power sprang from that. I mean, he's kind of saying that this music is not political, but somehow that's what makes it political. I mean, is that the sense you get? Yeah, I mean, that's kind of the, you know, that was kind of what a lot of people, you know, a lot of people thought, especially people who were... political in the 80s for instance you know and were kind of fed up with the 80s and and maybe and coming from probably also coming from the 70s you know which were highly political in Germany you know so and and and also very violent you know um so Yeah, I think it's the same thing with the love parade, you know, and with techno as a whole, you know, that a lot of people said, you know, not having the message has been kind of the message. It was kind of the uniting factor and also kind of, you know, that... what it was all about you know to have the to take the freedom to say we don't want this and we don't need this you know we it's been all been said and done basically you know so um i think yeah i mean you can always argue if this is really how it was i think they also do that in the book a little bit you know some people say yeah that that kind of philosophy kind of was came kind of came after it, you know, because, you know, some people would just focus more on hedonism than anything else. And then later it was like, yeah, but this is our political statement. So you can always argue about that if you want. But if you look at, it's interesting, if you look at the, for example, Berlin pop culture of the 80s of bands like the Einstürzenden Neubauten, you know, it's very dark, very depressive, very heroin. The whole pop culture was very cynical in a way and it was very anti-emotional and everyone was wearing black and depressed. kind of techno was the complete cultural change in that all of a sudden things were colorful everyone's hugging themselves people were coming together it was not the differences that were defining but what you could share you know this I think is also what Mark Innes says in a way which is reflected also in the music it's something that brings people together and not It's not about being cooler than you or something. All this dissolved in a way. And this is also the reason probably why so many very different people could come to these parties. be it the East Berlin football hooligan, the old breakdancers, or from the West, you know, the squatters, the Schöneberg gay scene, you know, eternal students financed by their parents in West Germany. or those guys who wanted to escape from military service, all these people, completely different, but in a way, you know, with this new vibe, they could come together. And maybe also because you didn't have to speak, you know. You couldn't possibly argue about all the differences. It was too loud, too intense, you know. Well, yeah, it was basically techno was just this space where sort of anything could happen. I mean, two of the most powerful images in the book for me are both sort of happened to be holes in the ground. You have the like literally holes in the ground. You have the original UFO, which is you climb down some hole and you're in the basement of a building and it's just a pit, basically. And then you have the original Tresor, which is nearly the same thing, descending down into this dark void. And the music is sort of all that matters. There's no... There's a pureness, you know? And then, like, it kind of takes you, like, I think Tillman Brehm's one of the... guys in the book says like when when he when you went down to into the the original treasure basement you know there was just strobe and just fog and there was the music and there was no way out you know you could you had to you could you could decide either you let go and you kind of have the experience and go with it or you go home there's no nothing else to do and most people chose to experience it and go go you know go with it Even the original Love Parade is in a way, I mean, it's taking place outside, but it's sort of a similar thing. I mean, you just have these very makeshift floats, sort of a minimum of organization, and there's absolutely no real message associated with it other than the music itself. Yeah, that is kind of a hole in the system. It's also a hole because it was a demonstration. It was kind of legal, but in a way it was also inspired by illegal parties, which is kind of a funny thing, kind of a prank. And yeah, I mean, what made it so important was probably the fact that it wasn't in some dinghy hole, some stinking hole somewhere, but everyone could see it. each other. So this scene got a sense of, hey, we are many, actually. So that was especially in 1991 when it grew bigger and people from other cities came. This tiny scene became an awareness of that it's growing and that it's there and that things are happening going forward. That was probably the important bit of the early love parades. Sort of the thesis of the book. if there sort of is one. What you guys lay out in the introduction is that you guys sort of see techno as something that people from the East and people from the West could rally around. It was a culture that... had something for people who had been quite divided. And it really sort of acted as this glue to kind of help reform the family, the society. I mean, that thesis, was that something that you kind of had an inkling that that would be the case? Or was that something that came out of the interview process? Oh, that came out, definitely, yeah. We didn't know so much about it, actually, when we... started and we wouldn't um you know as sven said earlier i mean our first impression was um hey the treasurer will be a great narrative you know to speak back then i wasn't even aware actually that it was johnny stieler guy from the east who was one of the co-founders actually i wasn't aware of the german german aspect of the treasurer back then so it was kind of something that we learned during research and um The interesting thing is that if you look at reunification, it was not an easy process for so many people. It was complicated. And also when the war came down, everyone was happy. But very soon, lots of... Bad feelings came from both sides, you know, and in an interesting way in this tiny little scene of fans of electronic music, that rave scene that emerged, this seemed to be a place where the reunification way worked much better than elsewhere, you know, and the answer to the story was basically the West buys the East, you know, and the guys from the East. they felt okay we are losing everything so there things seem to work different I mean it's obviously a difference when you're 18 or 19 or 21 when the wall falls and when you're like 41 or something it's easier to adapt to new circumstances But we had the impression in a way that this is totally interesting. Techno and all that gave an opportunity for these kids to do something, to do something on their own, not being kind of manipulated by the state and all that. So it was kind of a new space they could maneuver and freedom and they could find. It is also interesting if you look at other parts of East Germany. former East Germany, things in Leipzig, in Dresden, in Jena, big cities started to make their clubs, their parties, which are kind of a little bit similar to Berlin. And they were all kind of inspired by Berlin as well. So it was a strong, maybe many of them were kind of used to be breakdancers or maybe they had an ear for the electronic sounds. And then this new music came. was kind of in a way similar and then they could do it themselves. You didn't need so much. You know, you do a cellar, a sound system and somebody who has a couple of records. So that was easy to organize back then, which is different to most pop culture in a way, which was kind of, you know, you need a band, then you need somebody who produces your record. It's expensive. You probably never get there. Many gatekeepers. So Rave was quite easily accessible for all the kids This is probably why it had such an impact, especially in the East Germany. I mean, despite the fact that this was a sound and a scene that was bringing a lot of people together, in the sort of minutia of the way the scene operated, there was a fair amount of infighting and a fair amount of sort of differences of opinion, both about... what the music should sound like, how the music should be presented. You know, you sort of had on the one hand this Trezor model, which is purely the music, you know, people would think it was, would talk about it as being very, very, very. serious. Then you would have clubs like, um, you know, Planet or Volfish, which were sort of all over the place in terms of what they were offering. I don't know, maybe for me, the Trezor model was always what I thought of. I didn't know about this other stuff so much. Um, yeah i mean the trezor model or the trezor itself is kind of the obviously the longest running club i'm even though it moved now um and it the most well known internationally also because of the the label and everything so A lot of people were not from Berlin or, you know, they don't really know about everything else that kind of went on. And also E-Work, which was kind of back then when it was open, which was just four years, you know, back then clubs didn't last very long, usually. E-Work was kind of, you know, if you kind of compare, you know, the mid-90s to now and you would have E-Work. the kind of the club now you could kind of compare it to today is Berghain and it has that kind of reputation it was that important but since it was only around for four years they didn't have a label they didn't have all those things nobody knows if you're not from Berlin or maybe from Germany and were part of the scene you don't really know about that but so there was obviously always different different models and different and and in the beginning everything that's the thing you know in the beginning everything was together you have to imagine that everything was together it was you know like west bend says i think in the planet chapter you would have like some you would have breakbeats and then you would have some like estet house from chicago and then you would have like some hard techno and then you would have a record by marusha or whatever and everything in one set everything together all these different at some point different galaxies were all together back then you know and And just while this whole subculture kind of got bigger and bigger, people obviously, you know, people start to kind of, yeah, as you said, there were definitely some infights about direction, where to go, how much, how commercial can we be, how commercial do we want it to be, you know. And everybody has this, like a lot of people had like different agendas about how to. run things and and and like obviously in the moment money is you know the money starts to get an issue you know things kind of also go might go crazy and also you had which is very interesting you had the kids from the east who had a completely different upbringing they don't they had completely different idea about culture and and and you know doing like big parties and stuff and money basically and then you had some people from you know like the kids from the west and some people from the west were you know for instance a low spirit label from Westbam and William Ritka, who were kind of, had a completely different idea. They started, they were already there in the mid 80s. And when like techno started to get bigger and they realized, oh yeah, that's the thing, you know, we have to kind of get into that. You know, they came into it with a completely different idea. For them it was like, oh, this is a new pop. You know, we want this to be the new pop music. which is a complete opposite to the Trisom model, basically. And still, everybody was at the beginning, you know, at the Big Bang, they were all together. And then they kind of, you know... had all these fights and all of this and kind of it all separated in all these different fractions and models and ideas. That is a really interesting point about, you know, some people seeing this as the new pop music and some people seeing it as very separate from that. I got the sense from reading the book, it seemed like the two kind of whipping boys of the... of the scene were West Bam, who some people just absolutely couldn't stand because of his pop tendencies. And then Paul Van Dyke, for the same reason, who is someone who's sort of so poppy at this point, it's hard to even remember that he was connected with this original Berlin techno thing. West Bam was an especially interesting person. It was hard to imagine that he had the sort of longevity in the scene that he did because it seemed like he rubbed so many people the wrong way. Yeah, he probably had, but I mean... he was always successful. That's the thing, you know, he was, he was always successful and he was, I think he was never, I mean, it's kind of crazy to say that maybe, but I think he was never that successful in the scene, you know, but he, he very, because in the beginning when they, you know, they rented the UFO to do parties or they rented the. um um and it didn't really work you know and so they kind of and then eventually what made it was like the big thing you know that that was a big coup and and and he was already a star that's another thing you know he was kind of already a star when this whole thing started so he he already had that success and that kind of when he really got heavily into techno that propelled him even further because he already had all this fan base, all these people who loved him for like Monkey Say, Monkey Do, which was kind of sample house, basically, you know. And so, you know, I mean, it's also interesting that he up till like, I don't know, 94, 95, he didn't have a real residency in Berlin. And then he got asked by Hille from Iwerg if he wanted to be a resident at Iwerg. And that was kind of, you know, I mean, in 95, you know. So he, like Paul van Dijk as well, I mean, he had a residency also at the Dub Mission parties. earlier than Westbam, basically. But, you know, it's so interesting to see that Westbam was kind of, he was always there. He was always successful. He was never fully accepted by everyone, you know. In Berlin. In Berlin, yeah, just in Berlin. And same with PVD, you know. He was there from... like really early on and and uh very and also from very early on a lot of people didn't like his approach and but he was successful also from like a year into djing oh you know i'm going to new york play limelight it's interesting um the sense that you get from reading this book is that commercial sort of commercialism or the commercialization of the scene was in some ways it's undoing, you know, with, with Evert, you got the sense that the club got, got very, very big. They say something like the MTV had an awards ceremony there. The club made it to the front page of the New York Times. You also have the story of Front Page, the magazine, which seemed to be very motivated by finding advertisers and its sort of connections with various record labels and with Love Parade. securing exactly the right sponsorship deal to keep their magazine going and stuff. But somebody also says somewhere in the book, it's mentioned a number of times that this is kind of a Berlin mentality that like something gets too big, too successful, it's bad. So I wonder how you guys really feel about this. You present the whole book as a series of interviews, but as editors and maybe as journalists, I mean, do you think that commercialization sort of... had that real effect on the scene? I mean, well, if you look at it from, look at how we are now with the scene and everything, you know, I mean, now the commercial. is so much worse than it was even at the peak in the 90s you know so um it had a big effect on the origin like on from on the first generation or like the first and second generation of Berlin because it went from being a completely new anarchic uh thing like really idealistic thing for a lot of people it and a subculture basically from really tiny it turned into a culture and it turned into something in a mainstream culture basically and the common commercialization was you know was part of this development basically overall it didn't hurt the scene that I mean you know it just the interesting thing is when we close the book in which is basically in 97 when front page is bankrupt era closes And so that was kind of such a, it was such a break, you know, a lot of people we interviewed for the book in like in 97, they either started to, okay, I have to study. Now I have to study again. Like the crazy years are over. We have to have to grow up now or something. Some people, I mean, a lot of people kind of started to. kind of for the first time after all those years of craziness was like okay what am I going to do with my life like you know what I'm going to so that for us that was kind of the natural point to stop and from then something new you know from there something new started you know if you look at Berlin after 97 you would see that suddenly, which was a big club after 97, that was one of the biggest was VMF, you know? And like, how did people look there, look like there? Suddenly they weren't dressed like ravers, but they, you know, would wear like, like really like minimal black Helmut Lang. whatever couture you know stuff like that and how did the music sound suddenly oh yeah it was more underground again it was also more minimal i had a little you know suddenly you had much smarter smarter slicker you had compact you had playhouse all of this um you know all of those like german minimal house tech house whatever you want to call it labels they all started then you know in like 90 some 98, you know, clung a little bit earlier than that. So there was an end to an era. That's, you know, that's all. It was just an end to an era. And from there, it kind of went into another cycle. And now, I think over the last 10 years, we have seen with social media, with cheap flights and everything, we've seen another really crazy cycle of change and of commercialization because it got so global. Something completely unheard of. unthinkable back then even in in 95 96 I mean they you know they were fighting and kind of bitch fighting about I really played in New York oh yeah and I played in you know no I think rock said like oh yeah I play in London and people Paul van Dyke was like oh really London I'm going to go to New York, you know, and that's like, wow. And today it's, you know, it's really not a big thing anymore at all, you know. So, yeah, I don't think it hurt the scene as a whole because we still have it. It's still there, but it, you know, it kind of was part of this development from an archaic subculture. going into like a more or less mainstream culture, basically. Apparently Berlin seems to be a city that doesn't like stars, you know, and doesn't like people to, you know, to grow in a certain way. I think other cities, take New York or London, would be completely different in that respect. In our book, there are a couple of examples of people who are kind of, you know, just on the step of really breaking it, but then they don't do it. And we're wondering, is this something that is kind of part of the DNA of Berlin? You know, is this maybe in other cultural or even economical fields the same? In a way, it seems so, yeah. People like Dr. Motte, for instance, or Tani, they would have been the right people for a star that really breaks it. But in a way, they didn't. I mean, on the other hand, they were kind of punks. Probably it's as if it's some sort of built-in break that says, okay. this is too far. It is interesting that, you know, so many of the people who are in the book are just people like you've never heard of. You know, I mean, you've heard of Dimitri Hegemon. I mean, he's not a DJ or something. You've heard of Mark Ernestis. He's kind of a DJ, producer, like quite famous. And you've heard of the Detroit guys. But all of the Berlin DJs, they're nobodies outside of the context of very important history in of this book funny isn't it i mean for me for me these all of these djs have a they were stars for me you know in a way you know but i can this is a guy like rock a very charismatic guy he was he was working at hardwax and you know going then buying records there was something you had to have a bit of courage and also um a guy like johnson for instance he's such a such a smart guy, you know, seeing him DJ back then. Obviously, they were not in the light. They were somehow hidden in the dark, but they were like the grand seigneur of that music in a way. And they were of a very different charisma than pop stars have, but they have a charisma, obviously. And, you know, they were very important figures for that scene at that time. Yeah, but kind of now they're forgotten, which is incredibly sad in a way. I mean, the thing is that they never, you know, they never set out to do it for as a career, you know, and they never thought of this as a career, which is, I think, you know, that which sets them apart from. Paul van Dyck and Westbam, for instance, because they always, yeah, they were always professional. They already realized this is a career. This is something you build on. This is something you have to work in a certain way, you know, and a lot of, you know, those, you know, like Rock Johnson, Tarnit, all of them. They, you know, or Dr. Motta, they didn't really, I don't know at what point they realized, okay, this is my path. You know, this is my, you know, this is what I'm going to do for a very long time or something. But I think in the beginning, a lot of people didn't think of it that way. I remember an early interview with Tobias Thomas and Michael Meyer for Debug Magazine. probably in 97 98 or something when they did forever sweet and and and they were saying i can't imagine to do this in 10 years even then you know a lot of people they it was not you know it wasn't it wasn't like today you know where everything's there you know you can you can plan your career just like that you know you can oh I love music or what I do I want to become a DJ or what I have to do I have to do this blah blah blah and you go through the motion and then you know, you either, you know, make it or not, you know, but back then for a lot of people, it wasn't, it was, it was just there like pleasure and you, or you, you loved what you, you know. you just did what you do what you you know but but not necessarily thinking of like doing it in 20 years or 10 years or whatever or like having like a real career out of it which is really romantic in a way i like that as well i mean you know they were kind of kind of they lost themselves somehow in the moment and then afterwards i said okay let's do something else And I like what Rock said. He says at the very end, he says he's happy that he's not DJing anymore because what would happen if he did? I mean, he had these fantastic parties in 1991, the Tresor, what for him were among the most intense parties. You know, like now touring through, you know, some kind of mid-sized German towns and clubs to kind of that still book you. I mean, wouldn't it be sad in a way? And I think that was kind of a proud statement. And I like that a lot. Well, maybe it's good when something ends in a way. I would also argue that today, like the mentality, what Felix said about Berlin doesn't really like people who really kind of be stars or something. I think the mentality kind of changed in Berlin. I mean, you still, it's, it's still not about, maybe not about like glamour and all of, you know, all of this. I mean, it's still kind of within certain aspects of that, you know, early ideas about like techno and, but, but, you know, but you, if you look at. I mean, if you look at Berghain, how big Berghain got. You were mentioning before MTV did their... video awards after party at E-Work and all that stuff. I mean, that wouldn't happen at Berghain. But, you know, Berghain has so much more exposure than obviously than E-Work back then, you know, like being on the front cover, front page of New York Times was like, wow, amazing. And how often was Berghain on the... front page of like highly regarded international newspapers i don't know i can't even count that anymore yeah yeah i mean it has gotten to the point where when i phoned my mom back in the states you know she's like have you been to that club recently i saw it in people magazine you know one of the big tabloid magazines in the states like three times yeah so so it it kind of i mean the interest in berlin and all those clubs and especially like a big club like back and i mean it changed and the interesting thing is that and it's okay you know like Marcel or Ben they all I would call them stars basically Technostars, global Technostars, you know. But, you know, they still retain something of that, the way they do it in a way, or also the way Berghain does things and other Berlin clubs, the way they do things is... I mean, still grounded in the beginnings, you know. And I think that's what sets Berlin's club culture apart a little bit from other cities, you know. Because if you look at About Blank or if you look at Renato or Bar 25 when they were still open, all that. You know, they're all they all did their own thing. And you can see you can see the lines from like 1991 or whatever to now. You know, there's there's this those roots, basically. It's a very tempting question to sort of ask, you know, how does this book, which ends in about 1997, sort of. contextualize the era in Berlin nightlife that we're in now. I mean, what is that shadow that this era has cast over what's happening right now? Oh, I think it's a very, very long shadow. I mean, this is just, yeah, speaking of Berghain, the guys who do it, I mean, they met in Ewerg, I think, and they did parties at the bunker, infamous bunker. So, Trezor is still running. Yeah, I mean, speaking specifically about Berghain, it was hard reading about Evert, which obviously I was never able to go to, and not thinking about the way Berghain does certain things. In Evert, they describe this sort of... varying tiers of like VIP access that you would get in the club and doing things like having, you know, allowing, giving MTV access to it and sort of flaunting the fact that they're the biggest club, the best club in the city. I mean, Bearkind is flaunted as the biggest and best club in the city, but they. you know, distinctly do not operate that way. Yeah. It's they learn from the mistakes. Yeah. Yeah. I think that, yeah, that's one of the main thing they really learned from. what could go wrong, you know? Speaking of stars and the way that the quintessential Berghain star is in the end Sven Marquardt, their doorman, which is like the most famous face. Isn't it funny? You know, it's not the people who run the music or the guys who run the club, but the guy who kind of protects the door from the wrong person, from the wrong people to get in. I mean, they've made him the star of the club. Isn't it fantastic to have Given all of this, sort of this learning from mistakes, I mean, the way that the Berlin scene is operating right now, do you sense that it will be able to continue operating this way? I mean, is there any way to learn from the mistakes enough to create something that's truly lasting in a club scene? I think even though the shadow from back then is very long, you know, and it's a foundation. still a foundation for a lot of things that that are going on here i mean i think we're we're in a completely wrong uh different uh cycle right now then you can't really you know uh you can't really compare that. I mean, there's also new ground to break basically with like social media, all that stuff that's completely new. So there were no mistakes made before. So I'm basically the formula of having a good sound system, a room that is for whatever reason, inviting in some way or another. and people who love music and just focus on music, I think that will always work as a formula. So, yeah, we'll see where this is going. And another thing which has always been very, very important, obviously, for Berlin's club culture was the availability of spaces, places where you could do something. Places where you could just do whatever you wanted, or places where you could turn into something new. And the more difficult this is going to get, the more problems. the whole scene might you know become at some point i mean to this to this day you know your people there's always someone who finds something we're like wow this was empty you know or you know there's always it still kind of works you know even though um it definitely changed a lot so we'll see how this is going to continue And also at some point people are probably bored of the Berlin hype. And I mean, it already started, you know. And then maybe in two, three, four, five years, only half of the people who come to Berlin right now will come to Berlin. Who knows, you know. And then maybe you never know what will happen then. Or just imagine Berghain. decides to close you know who knows how long they want to do that you know maybe they decide in a couple of years like or whatever you know we've done it all you know let's just close it and then boom you know everything suddenly it's like like the city gets to start fresh i mean it's not that bear kind is berlin techno but for a lot of like interest from the it's a fixture you know the fixture would be gone there is this Interesting. I think in summer 97, E-Rock closed, Suicide Club closed. There was no techno club. In summer 1997, there was only one techno club. There was Trezor. Only one. Just imagine. Because everything else closed. Nothing. Can't imagine that now. Not at all. *music*
