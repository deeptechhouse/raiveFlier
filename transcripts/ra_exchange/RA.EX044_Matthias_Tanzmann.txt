Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Tyus Tansman is a name most House and Techno fans might be familiar with. After all, he's a resident at Ibiza's famed Circle Local Party at DC-10 and runs the consistent Moon Harbor imprint. His history in Leipzig's scene, however, is another matter. I went to visit Tansman and his German home base about an hour outside of Berlin to find out more about his early days in the scene, in addition to catching up with him about his label and its recent 10th anniversary. You know Leipzig is almost a big city, you know? Almost a big city. When I grew up, when I was a kid, it was still the East German times. When I turned 12, the wall came down. So before that, it was really like a happy childhood. When I got a teenager, I pretty much went through all the changes politically. So I grew up in that special time. You said it was quite a happy childhood. Obviously you didn't know what the West was like. East German times were for kids. You're not aware of freedom, of action, of thinking. because like the social care system in East Germany was really good. There was like the kindergarten thing, everything. It was, yeah, you were really taken care of in a very well way. So this was a happy childhood. And then... Were you aware, you know, when you were 10, 11, 12, you know, they were having these demonstrations down at... the church in exactly yeah leipzig was actually the place where it basically started leipzig is famous for that and at this time there was always the monday manifestation and i was going to to play table tennis and ping pong and i had training on monday so i was i was always going to take the tram to my training And the rest of life sequences are going to the manifestation. So you were all taking the tram, but you were going to just... I was going the opposite direction. So you were training ping pong. It seems you were quite serious about it. There was just like a period of maybe, let's say, two or three years. Okay. So I think I wasn't too good, but it was okay. It was okay. I used to play volleyball before that, and it was always a little bit of sports I was doing. Do you play sports today still? Volleyball again, yeah. Seems like there's a scene of German producers, Steve Bugg of course is big into volleyball. Yeah, he's so much into beach volleyball now. And he's always motivating everybody to do that. And I was thinking about going to Berlin just for that. Instead of moving to Berlin for techno, you're going to move for the volleyball. Exactly. That is the only, no not the only thing, but it is more tempting than just going there for the techno music. I read in an interview that the first sort of music that you got into is just random pop music. The first thing you bought was an ABBA cassette? Yeah, wow, where did you find that? That's true. It's, you know, totally credible pop music. It sounds great today. Absolutely. Absolutely. Like, also production-wise, of course, I didn't know that by that time, but also production-wise, it's really, really good. What was the first, I mean, was electronic music then the first one to touch you in a way that I want to? find out more about the people behind this i want to find out more about the culture of this music i think i slowly dived into the electronic music um when i'm when i was like 14 15 um somebody in my neighborhood who was already like djing producing in his bedroom or and I was in touch with those people and we went to the first club nights in a club called Basis, which was like really one of the first clubs even in East Germany. And we went there and I got in touch with this kind of music, but still at the same time I was going to like more... commercial discotheque club stuff. So in the beginning it was not really, I couldn't really say that I was going to be attracted by techno music. It was just like electronic music and electronic pop music. And then it kind of developed. Was the distillery the biggest, I mean the big club for you that sort of got you into... That was no, that's that's actually distillery. I got to know the story later before that I was then there was a different club was called opera and it was more on the It was not really like that the arty kind of thing. It was more. Yeah, no, no just party It was when was when was coming to play like two times a year, but There was also like kind of trans parties or whatever. I wasn't really like in a certain musical direction at this time. You were just partying. Yeah. And liking the music and trying to get involved with it. So it started like I got involved with distillery like in 1995 or 1996. Before that, I was pretty much going to different places here in Leipzig. And how did you... come to the distillery? I mean, was it known already? It had been around for like 45 years by that point? Yeah, by that point. Exactly. Yeah, it was known for sure. And by that time, I think I was playing with a friend of mine at the garden party of one of the distillery owners. So we had like this private gig, one of the first gigs ever we played. It was fun. And then in the end, we gave a tape to one of them. So they asked us to play and the first gig I played in the distillery was still in the basement, which was more like the techno floor. So I started playing kind of a techno set there and then like one year after I moved upstairs to the house here room. Now, did you move or did they move you? I don't know. I think it was both. We both agreed that that would be the better place. But before that, I was playing more this kind of techno music that I would know from this opera place. And then when I was digging deeper into music, I arrived to this house here, kind of floor. When you said Sven would be coming to town, was that sort of one of the bigger sort of people that would end up in a town that really drew you out? Not like an international, obviously, he's German, but kind of that sort of star power. Was he one of the one people that really was a legend for you growing up? Of course. Sven was there. He was always like, Sven Feth was always a big guy and has always been. like Laurent Gagné came and people like that. So this was always a major event in Leipzig. Was there one of them that sort of influenced you in terms of DJing, like your style? Like you saw him and you were like, wow, he's mixing so fast or wow, he's going all over the place genre-wise. That's really interesting. I would say who really flashed me when I first saw him was Terence Parker. Ring my bell, doubling and all that stuff. I was like, also a German. television show about electronic music and Viva by that time and he was playing there and I was really flashed and he had this like I think he still does it with that telephone headphone thing and I tried to do the same and I had a friend of mine trying to build me a thing like this really? yeah but that was like when I was 18 years old or 20 I don't know So it was kind of fun and I really liked his style and how he played, how he mixed disco and house. It was really cool. Was he noticeably different in the way that he mixed than a German DJ at the same time to you? I would say so. But there were some people here in Leipzig who were by that time doing the same, trying to do the same stuff. They were really like talented DJs who were really playing fast, mixing fast and scratching, doing cuts. It was really cool guys. Unfortunately, they didn't move on DJing, but there was a lot of people trying to do good stuff. It seems like in other interviews that I've read, that a lot of people talk about how healthy the scene was in this city back then. Did it seem like that this was sort of the biggest Eastern Germany city for club music? Could you tell at the time that you were living in it that, wow, this is pretty great? But this is like the thing you talk about now is maybe like three, four years later than what we were talking about earlier. And I kind of had a feeling that there's something going on in Leipzig at this time. Like a lot of producers were doing this deep house thing, which was different from American deep house. It was more, I don't know, it was like a sweet, harmonic deep house thing. Not really deep and, I mean, not really. This dark attitude was totally missing in it. Like what I would say. would be more clubby nowadays. But if I look at it from now, from my perspective now, I think maybe this was like just us people didn't really look outside the city and thinking, wow, there's really something going on here. But in all the other cities there were scenes as well. So just if you read like two or three articles in some newspapers or in some magazines that tell you, wow, Leipzig is something like a deep house center, then you start believing it. But I don't really think there was too much going on. And you said that this was about four years afterwards, so like 98? Yeah, 98, 99, yeah. Okay, so... I guess it was basically kind of centered around the distillery club, you know, each week. Tell me about the club itself. I haven't been there. I'm sure most people listening to this haven't been there before. You said there's two floors to it? Yeah, there used to be. The first distillery was in a different building, same area. And it used to be like an old brewery or distillery, like the word says, and it was abandoned. The people who started the distillery were just taken over the place and illegally started to party there. It was legendary, of course. People went there, it was a new thing, clubbing was great, it was interesting. Even Depeche Mode, when they were playing in Leipzig afterwards, they would come to the distillery to party a little bit. Probably more randomly because people told them to go there. But they did it twice or three times so it was really good enough to go. I was there was big story in town can't believe that Then they moved to this other place because they couldn't stay there. And that was pretty much when I got involved and started playing there. By the time I wasn't playing so much, I was going there every weekend as well. Just to party and I got to know some DJs and listen to music. So this was like one of my biggest influences. Also listening to other people and getting to know about different styles of music and DJs. What part of town is it in? Is it in a certain district? Yeah, it's a certain district of Leipzig. It's called Südvorstadt. And this is like the student and art kind of part of Leipzig. It's really close to the center and it's really nice. All the bars are there and it's a really great green park area inside. It's quite easy to get to. Yeah, absolutely. Quite easy to go home from. Yeah, yeah. It's interesting always, I think, so much of a club's success depends almost on its location within the city. Definitely. I mean, people who go there can basically walk home. Almost everybody lives in this area. So tell me, you know, you had these gigs at the distillery and eventually you got a residency. It was about a year or so that you were playing there? What do you think it was about you and the stuff that you were playing that was so good to the owners that they wanted to have you playing on such a regular basis? I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I was playing house here, mixed with disco stuff, but I already started producing. Maybe they were aware of that. a lot of people who was producing but like showing an attitude of saying okay I want to be a DJ DJ to people, I want to do that. I didn't really think professionally, but I really want to do something. I want to do something. I want to get out of my bedroom and DJ for people. Maybe that was the reason why they took me and chose me to play there. So you were already producing in 96? Yeah, we started producing with a friend from my neighborhood. But nothing came out until like '98? I think the first release was '98, yeah, it was in Freude am Tanzen. Okay, and you were working with Daniel. Yeah, exactly, Daniel Scholz. And this was this kid from the neighborhood, and we were producing this stuff together. It was Gamad 3000, right? Exactly, yeah. Where does this name originate from? Yeah, it used to be in East Germany like a gas heater. Okay. What do you have when you had like these old buildings with no central heating, whatever, then you had this gas heater in your bathroom. So you wanted a futuristic gas heater for your bathroom. Actually, it didn't really have a deeper meaning. I was sitting in a bathtub thinking about what the fuck should we name this project? I was looking at this thing and the logo of it looked like 70s style like brown with I think like a golden writing or something or it looked kind of nice I was like come at 3000 yeah or not okay cool so I liked it but then what happened was we did this release on for damn Thompson and pretty much at the same time we did a release on the zoo on Steve box label And Steve didn't like the name, actually. So he convinced us to find a new name, which I didn't really like. Okay, we can do a release there. Let's think about a new name. So he was like suggesting names. And I think we all ended up agreeing on the name Permanent Funk, which is horrible. Permanent Funk. And then finally the records arrived and by some mistake they were still called Gamma 3000. The EP name was Permanent Funk. I was like, oh God. We can have an EP named this, but we cannot have a project named this. Exactly. That's fine. You went to school and were you going to school and doing the DJ and production thing at the same time? Yeah, I went to school until, like high school, until I was 19 and I was doing like the DJ thing, of course. It was not like at this time that I wanted to be a DJ. Maybe like one or two days in a week I was like dealing with music. going to this friend and DJing. And then I think in the last 12th grade, then I was more into it and we went to record shopping once a week and I had like enough money to buy exactly one record a week. for my pocket money and yeah this was when i got into it and then after i graduated from school um i did this um how you say this when when you skip army you do this uh social service thing um Yeah, and this time I got more into it and I had more time apparently and then we spent more more hours a day in the studio and started working and But you ended up going to the Bauhaus. Yeah, that was like two three years after I was like pretty much I was not sure what to do I did the social service here and then I was at University of Leipzig. I was just, I didn't know what to do, so I followed one. I started studying. I didn't go there, but I was part of the university. And then with another friend, he told me about this study in Bauhaus University in Weimar, about this media design thing, which is like an art study. And it sounded really great to me, really interesting, something I was looking for. I really wanted to have a university degree because I thought only thinking you can be a DJ for your life is pretty naive. So I was like, oh, this sounds interesting. Let's try that. And I was applying there and they took me, luckily. And yeah, then I moved to Weimar and studied for five, six years. And what was the program exactly? I mean, what were you studying? It was media design? It's called media design, but... It's a little bit different from other media design studying because when you had classes there, it was more only projects. like audio installations at some places, in a park, and mining for some art project. Or we had experimental radio, where we started the first streaming experiments, like stuff, like really nice, interesting projects at this time. Or we were visiting Amsterdam, where... Pirate Radio was one of the first places with Pirate Radio where it came from, also, I mean, apart from England. And, yeah, so I was going to that university. I was really learning a lot also about studio techniques because they had a radio studio, a proper one. So I got into that. And it was really a good time. I learned a lot. Do you feel like it helped your production? Yeah, for sure. For sure. Definitely. I mean technically, but also like the input you get from the art side. Were you doing some of these installations and parks and stuff that you're talking about? Yeah, exactly. I was doing that. What sort of music? Or was it even music? It was just ambient stuff? That was more ambience, yeah. And you were going back and forth between Weimar and Leipzig every weekend? Yeah, I was pretty much playing a lot already at this time. So I would stay in Weimar from Monday to Thursday, let's say, and then going back to Leipzig, either to play here or to go to the airport and fly where I have to go. And one of the guys who runs... who was running the distilleries, Andre. As he was telling me, he sort of was taking care of a lot of the local people, doing their bookings and trying to get them gigs throughout Germany and, of course, Europe as well. Who were some of the people that you were also kind of with around that time doing things? DJing. There was basically the people from Leipzig. It was Marlow, he also released on Moon Harbor later. you There's not so many DJs from Leipzig who made the next step, like playing outside Leipzig. And it was pretty much a project by ourselves with Marlo and then later some friends, some more friends came. Okay. Once you graduated, you came back full time. Yeah. Wooden was that? It was, I think I moved back here in 2005 and graduated in 2006, so I had to write a diploma. But yeah, I was already back here. Okay, so you had already started the label and everything. The label started in 2000. Right. So yeah, it was working parallel. I was, Andre was running the label like... from the office side and we were just on the phone every day doing stuff but when i when i got back here of course it got i had some extra time and we could put in some extra efforts and then also the label started through a little bit more yeah So tell me about why, you know, 1999, you guys are talking, I'm sure, saying, what's the next step? Yeah, it was this funny story when in New Year's Eve, 1999 to 2000, the millennium New Year's Eve, we were having this party at the distillery I was playing. He was still one of the owners. And we had this talk in the backstage and it's like, yeah, I want to do a label. And we both found out we have the same idea to run a label, do a label to take the next step. And he also wanted to... He was not really fed up with the club thing, but he knew he wanted to do something else. But he wanted to stay in this cultural, subcultural electronic music thing, scene. So I was releasing apparently on a few small labels. And I also thought like I have to do an own label just to have an own platform to go to the next step. So we talked it over. We found out that we pretty much have the same ideas and maybe it's even better than what I thought before to do it myself because actually I don't have time to do it and don't know how to do it. And he didn't have the input. He knew how to do it. He has time. He was the office guy anyway. That's what he likes. He likes to stay in the office until late and work. So we made this. And you have your other. office and you stay up late and you're working. Yeah, exactly. In the studio. So I would provide content and idea and whatever A&Ring is about and he would like basically administrate the whole thing. So, yeah. And early on it was very much a deep house thing. Yeah. Was it always to push that sound or was it just the stuff that you and your friends were making? It was just always about the music we liked. We always wanted to release the music we liked by the time that we released it and we thought it should be out. So at this time I was exactly playing this kind of music. I really liked it in the club. You could play deep house in clubs all night, which was a few years after, it was impossible anymore. The times changed a little bit, of course. And one of my biggest influences in the late 90s was, for example, Matthew Herbert or Saint-Germain. It was like really nice and deep stuff. I liked the Fender Rhodes chords. I can just, yeah, really... wouldn't let me go anymore so I was trying to incorporate this kind of sound to the music and also release it on the label then. Yeah. You did the recently, obviously the 10 year anniversary, you did the mix where you sort of went back. Were you listening to stuff for the first time for the first time in a long time to some of these things? Exactly, exactly. That was really... I was looking at those old records and I was listening through them. I was like, wow, some tracks of them I haven't heard in years. Seriously, in years. So, I mean, especially now when there's so much music around, sometimes you just play tracks for four weeks and then they are gone. I mean, because there's so much new stuff. It's not that they are not good enough. It's just too much new things that you want to play. So when I was starting to work on that project, let's call it a review mix, whatever, I found some tracks that I haven't heard in such a long time. It really moved me. Was there one that was particularly surprising that you were like, I didn't even remember? There's this one record. I mean, I always loved it, but then I totally forgot about it. It was like, he released it maybe in 2003. It was Kruger and Manofsky, which is Jan Kruger and Max Manofsky, who's Daze Maxim. And they went on to do Hello Repeat. Exactly. Exactly. Now they do Hello Repeat very successfully. And by the time Jan was still living in Dusseldorf and Markus as well, I think. And yeah, they were releasing on our label. And this one track on B1, it's just so good. It's so easy, simple. But yeah, just... takes it to the point where what I like about music. Early on, was there a particular track or release that was really sort of, you felt like was a voltage you to another level that like in people's minds became a really big success? Yeah, there was. It was the same time when I came back from Weimar in 2005, 2006. I had this one release called Bulldozer with a remix by Robach Brume, which was quite successful. But then a little bit later that year, there was a remix I did for Marlow that really surprisingly, for me, very surprisingly, like exploded kind of. And it was really big hit. for what I found out later brought me to DC 10 as well and I did something on Pokerflat as well pretty much same time and this all gave a little push and took it to the next level And before that it just been pretty solid, slow, steady growth. Yeah, exactly. I would call it solid and slowly growing. But this was also because I was in Weimar, focusing on studying and didn't really have time to put enough effort to really push the label up. Talking to Andre earlier today, He also mentioned that you guys are just very careful about the things that you release. You want to work with artists. For the most part, and make sure that you have two or three releases in the future. That's not necessarily a one-off label, even though you have had a couple of those, for sure. This is normal, yeah. I mean, Lunacity Express, of course, did the art. album two years ago and Martinez was last year. Who are the other sort of you know core artists in your opinion of the label? Like we have also Dan Drastic who's now with us for also let's say five years and then yeah basically Lunar City Express and Martinez are the most I mean they have the most releases as well and they both did albums now. Let's think who else is like constantly for a long time. I know we had a little change in last year's. Also we have some artists with our sister label, Cargo Edition, like Echo House and Sven Tasnadi. Those guys have been working with us for five years now as well. We really like the idea to build up this family of people. that people are releasing on the label and also playing on label showcases together, traveling somewhere together. Well, you have the booking agency as well, which I think probably helps make all of that happen. Why did you and when did you decide to do the booking agency? Was it even from the beginning? Was it just taking André's contacts? It was actually from the beginning. André was doing the booking for me all the time. And then at some point we said, okay, let's set up a Moon Harbor booking as well next to the label because it makes sense. And nowadays it doesn't only make sense. it's necessary to survive on the whole thing because of course you lose money on putting out vinyl, which we still do. So we have to have like consistent cooperation with our artists. So we have them in the booking agency and then of course the money has to come back from that side. And yeah, as you said, it seems like it's an essential part of. a label nowadays. It didn't feel like that way in the beginning though. No. It was still... I remember reading an interview with you where you said that even when you started you could tell that vinyl sales weren't... they couldn't be what they were going... what they had been. But you were of course surprised by how much. It isn't that way anymore. Yeah, it changed a little further for the bad. But when we started in the 2000s, we were told by friends and who were running other labels that the golden years are done, like in the end or middle 90s when they put out vinyls and it would sell 10,000 copies easily for a good track. But when we started, we never got close to that number. And yet you still started the label. Yeah, I mean, we didn't start a label to get rich or to make money out of records. That was not the idea. It was just to do the next step on the way to have a... I mean, to go our way as a DJ, producer, and also with André being together to set up something, a platform, and to make the label. Not like a record label, but a label itself. Let's talk about Circo Loco, because it seems like it's a pretty big part of why you've become such a big name. When did you first hear the word Circo Loco, I suppose? I think it was quite late because I haven't been to Ibiza until... 2005 maybe? So I heard it, I heard of course I heard about Ibiza stories all the time but I didn't really... Did you have a good perception or a bad perception of the island before you got there? I mean since the hype was so big I was kind of you know distanced to it. I was like yeah okay I'm sure it's cool but I mean everybody goes there so why the fuck do I have to go there as well? Because I couldn't really rate it from my perspective here. I heard from my friends and people that Guido Schneider was going and like everybody and also playing DC-10. And yeah, but I'm... I was playing 2005 the first time for my friend Nima Gorgi, who I knew back from Copenhagen when he lived there and he invited me there. So I was playing with him in 2005 at Space Terrace. And that was the first time I ever came to Ibiza. And then I came one more time and then I think in 2006, end of 2006, I got a request from Circo Loco. what what and i already knew it's a it's a big thing it's a big thing by that time i heard so many stories and i was like Who was telling you these stories? Everybody. I think I heard those stories from many people. Steve Bach, for example. I saw that video when I was telling you about the remix I did earlier. There's this one video where Steve Bach is playing and somebody's stage diving. from the DJ booth jumping into the crowd. And it's like, wow, this is an amazing video. And Steve is playing my remix at this time. Wow, amazing. And that didn't happen at the Space Terrace. Surprisingly not. I think that was an afterparty at Space Terrorist, afterparty to the Monza party, so it was not like that. No stage diving. No stage diving that time. So, yeah, that's like all those crazy stories I heard, and then I got this request, and I was like... What's going on here? Okay, cool. And the Italians who are doing it, Andrea and Antonio, they booked me for like, I don't know, like maybe, I don't know if it was a test gig or something. So they booked me in December for somewhere in Italy. And I was going there and they sent somebody to take care of me. And on that flight, I was like, I had a cold or something on that flight. almost lost my my hearing senses i don't know something with the pressure and i usually don't have it at this flight i had it so i arrived there on my probably try out gig and i didn't hear anything i was going to the club kind of panicking But it went well, maybe it was just loud enough in the club, so it was okay. And then my first gig for Circo Loco for TC10 was on the 1st of January, I think it was 2007 then, yeah. 1st of January. And they always do these parties, I used to do these parties on the 1st of January. They close all winter season, but for this one date they open. And I was like, okay, well, let's do that. And I was playing New Year's Eve in London, and then I had to take a flight to Ibiza. And I've never been to DC10 before in my life, which is really, just imagine, everybody's buzzing around this place. It's amazing. They asked me to play there. I haven't even been there before. It's the one party in six months. at this place. Everyone's ready to... Exactly. So I'm connecting in Barcelona, I think, arriving to Ibiza, and my bag is gone. Seems like a lot of luck with that. That was already only one hour before my set time. So I had to wait. And I was like queuing and doing the Lost and Found stuff. The bag wouldn't show up. Luckily it wasn't my record bag. It was the bag of my clothes. I was really late. They took me to the airport, put me in the car, drove me to DZ10, back door open. I got into the DJ booth and started immediately. I didn't even have time to look at the club or people there. I just like, go start. And I just put on the first record. what's going on here? And it was totally crowded on the 1st of January. People were just flying there for this party. Amazing, amazing. And this is how I got involved. for DC 10. The set went well. Yeah, it went really nice. Really well. I really enjoyed it. I think people also liked it because they booked me again. Yeah, of course. And maybe it was a good thing not to arrive too early there and to get too excited about it and get nervous. Just get in and do whatever you want to do. And then you became a resident the next summer. I talked quite a bit to Loco Dice about the DC-10 and the sound of the club. What was the sound of the club in 2007 in your mind when you were there? I learned a lot about music. just being at TC10. I mean, after I got involved with them, I played there once a month in the first year maybe. But I was there and I was listening to the other DJs and I really learned a lot also about, like, from guys like Rarisch and Radio Petro. TC10 is like a different sound from other clubs that you would play. It's like more... I say it's more of a flowing sound like of course percussion and stuff is like Balearic in a way, but not in a cheesy way. It's organic deep but powerful at the same time so For me that changed my perspective again for music for DJing and I learned so much and whenever when I'm playing there I was I was trying to do what I knew about music, what I liked about music to adopt it to a DC-10 kind of style. I mean, of course, still staying true to what I like, but... playing slightly different from what I would play in a nightclub. How do you... it's more flowing? Yeah, kind of, kind of. And you don't, you don't... It also depends, of course, what time you're playing. If you play in the end... of the night now, then you have to push it a little harder. Did you have a particular time slot that you played all the time during that summer? It was always changing. Yeah, it was not like DICE. When DICE told you that, he was playing every week. So he had this real residency where he stayed and he played every week. I was still like a... I was a resident but a guest resident DJ so I was playing not every week but in the beginning as I told you once a month so they would still give me a guest slot which would be around 8 o'clock in the evening and also at this time they were not allowed to open anymore at 8 o'clock in the morning it started at midday and then came all the problems when they started even later so you didn't have those the whole day to play and to put DJs on. So I always played like, let's say, before Tanya or before Luciano. And it was already... Like when I played so late, I could push it a little further. Okay. When did the mix CDs... come out. Was that the same year or was it 2008? I think it was 2008, yeah. It was 10 years of Circa Loco. So, I mean, obviously it made such an impact on you that you were like, we need to team up and do this. Was it six? It was three double CDs. Yeah. Six CDs. Wow. We did it with Moon Harbor and it was so much work. Like imagine all this. It's not only like the licensing. The licensing is a lot of work. But just imagine it's all you do with the Circo Loco guys, like the Circo Loco DJs. It's not like you ask them, hey, send me the tracks you want. No, no, you don't get them back immediately. It's like, yeah, you know, like all DJs. Like if you have six DJs asking them for tracks. It took forever. And then we got the licenses ready and we had to wait for the mixes. But it was really a lot of work, but I think it was worth it. We made a nice project and it was really... good indicator of that time of the sound of Circo Loco. I think you know people look back in 10 years probably saying that that's a really nice encapsulation. Exactly it's about capturing your memories of a season. I mean that's also what other clubs are doing but with Circo Loco with a big project. It's really like the full scope. In terms of the sound, do you feel like it's changed at the club? Obviously, last year, they sort of had this kind of relaunch type thing called the new era. Yeah. Yeah, it changed a little bit. But I mean, also necessarily... It changed from the sound because some DJs changed as well. Luciano is not playing anymore. RPR are not playing anymore right now. So there's new acts or other acts that are more in the focus now. And I really must say that Andrea, who's the mastermind of Circa Loco, really had a... like really wide view when he was like picking his artists. If you see now like guys like Jamie Jones or Damien Lazarus, all those guys, like when you see the big buzz around their music now. But Andrea felt about it already like years ago. They've been residents forever. Now if you see the Circa Loco DJ crew, it's really... It's not only one sound. It's like a wider, really wider bandwidth of music and all together makes this a colloquial sound. If it's inside or on the terrace. I'm really happy to be part of it now because it's such a high quality crew of people. Let's talk a little bit about the label. Obviously it's changed sound over the years as we talked about. It's a little bit more tech than it used to be. Why do you think that is? With the label, the releases have pretty much followed my taste and what I'm playing. So I always wanted to put out the music that I want to pull out on the weekend and put it on the turntable. I mean, nowadays I don't put it on the turntable anymore since I use the tractor. But I always start releasing, try to release music that I want to play in clubs. Do you think that's also kind of a mirror of your career, though, in a way? Because, you know, when you were early on, when the label was early on, you were playing the smaller clubs, and now you're playing these big rooms. And you're like, well... I gotta... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, naturally. It all goes parallel in a way. But still, I don't want to totally get away from the Deep House thing. I think it's still there. Also, in this more driving music, I still have the Deeper Chords or whatever. I still want to... I mean, it's not... It's probably never going to leave my musical taste and also my sets, but... Of course, as you said, in a bigger room you cannot play that stuff all night. You have to be able to be more versatile in your music. And you mentioned in a recent interview that you bought a Fender Rhodes. So I'm sure those deep vibes will start coming back in once you're trying that out. That's my little baby. It's now in the studio. I don't know, this instrument, I just love it. Just put it on, just... I know hit a hit a chord and it's like oh, I just want to dive in and fly away. I was like amazing amazing instrument Are you writing stuff for a new album right now? Yeah, yeah, I started working on an album and I've said like I want to release it after the summer But I'm not sure if it's gonna happen because now the craziness started already. I'm traveling like I know play three four gigs every week And then when you come home you always have to take care of some other stuff. So it's not really enough time to go to studio and work continuously. I don't want to put myself under pressure when I'm ready with it, but I'm definitely working on it now. You mentioned when you come home you don't have the time because you're playing three and four gigs a week. I remember seeing a Facebook picture from you. You were on vacation in Thailand. You were saying, like, a Saturday and I'm not in a club. Finally. That was amazing. It was really amazing. I realized in January this year, I realized I haven't had a weekend off in years. Seriously, in years. I couldn't remember when I had my last weekend off. So I took one weekend off and stayed home. It was fantastic. I didn't really know that I was missing that. So yeah, just being home is fantastic. And then in March, I went to Thailand for like two and a half weeks. And this was this vacation. And I really found out, okay, I have to charge my batteries from time to time. And now I want to be... more aware of that. Did you come back and you realized, wow, this is such a help to have this moment where I'm not doing anything because my work will be better? I realized it just there, but when I came back from it, I was already exhausted again. The problem was I was going there in March. And then I was going, I was, that was really kind of crazy. I was, I was, when, when I was in Thailand, there was this, um, uh, the earthquake in Japan. So, and I was supposed to, to go to South America after, and we're like connecting in Tokyo. And I was like, Oh, okay. So we changed a lot. And then I was flying from. Bangkok to Los Angeles, from Los Angeles to Lima. Already all the charged batteries, all the energy was gone again. I stayed in Lima for one night and flew straight to Miami for a winter music conference of Ultra Week and played there like six or seven parties. And then I was already okay. maybe that was the wrong idea to do that after each other and i think my next holiday has to be planned more you know more aware of my schedule after yeah yeah uh is it still important ultra music week the miami thing for you i mean is it just being there and networking and talking to people and hearing new tracks, what's hot and all that sort of thing? I think it's kind of important to be there if you want to be on the North and South American market because all the promoters are coming there and they want to see our showcases. So it's really good to be there. Just this year we had the problem that Ultra Week and Winter Music Conference was not in the same week anymore. Most of the parties really suffered and we just didn't have enough people in Miami for the Ultra Week. I mean the Ultra Festival itself was very busy for what I heard but like the club nights they didn't have as much people as we had like the last years. I hope for next year that we'll be back and that they will put it together again. You say it's very important for the North American and South American market if you want to become bigger there. I mean, how... How are you doing in America these days? How is America? As an American, I'm very interested. Yeah, I think I'm doing quite well. I have an American booking agency, Bullet, the agency of Dapfire. They take care of my bookings there and I'm playing quite a lot so we do like maybe three tours a year. It seems like people are living in LA like Damien and Jamie Jones was spending time there at least. It seems like there's stuff going on in America that wasn't before. Definitely. Martin Buttrich is now moving to LA as well. And I think I want to stay in Los Angeles for the month of January together with Davide and Martin. And we have this project going on. It's called Better Lost Than Stupid. So we want to produce some stuff and work on our live project together. I think it will be a nice time in January. then just touring a little bit as well in January from being based in Los Angeles. Makes things easier. Yeah, definitely. And we also, we're planning to do a Circa Loco tour, Davide and myself, in North and South America after the summer. Okay. Tell me about this project. With you and Martin and Davide. Yeah, this is, I don't know, we're good friends and we thought like we should do something together. And the first thing we did, the first time we did this show was last year in New York, the Electric Zoo Festival. And we were, I don't know, we were quite nervous about it. What can we do? And we played like our own tracks for two hours. And I never played live in my life. I mean, it wasn't really like a proper live act. It was like more a live DJ merged thing. But it went really well, we had so much fun, so we decided to go on and do it another time. We did it at Sunday School in Miami this year and now we do some gigs with this project. We're going to play the closing set of Exit Festival in Serbia on the main stage. And we're really excited about that because it's like I heard like, I don't know, 15,000 people floor. And we used to play quite deep. So we have to see how that goes. Is it you're basically DJing live all three of your tracks like together and sort of merging it? Yeah. One set. The first time we played, we played only our own tracks and also older tracks of ourselves. When we were playing in Miami, we played a DJ set, actually, all of us. Martin was playing his own tracks as a live act, and we added some of our tracks, but also tracks from other people. But I think for the future we have to think about where we want to go with the project. That's also why we want to meet in January in Los Angeles and produce some tracks all together so we have like a proper live set. And why the name? I mean it's no permanent funk. No, I don't know. I don't really know who came up with the idea. I think it was Siva and Martin's girlfriend. And then it was just there.
