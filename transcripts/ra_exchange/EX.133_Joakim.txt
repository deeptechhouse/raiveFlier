*music* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Aaron Coulthate and I'm the news editor at Resident Advisor. Joachim is known as a man of many talents, the kind of person who seems at home performing live on stage, DJing or producing bands in the studio. The Frenchman's production history dates back to the early 2000s. with several EPs and albums on Parisian label Versatile Records. He launched his own Tiger Sushi label in 2002 and began putting out an array of new and reissued music from the likes of Cluster, Morris Fulton and Metro Area. His eclectic taste struck a chord with adventurous DJs and he soon developed a close relationship with the likes of Ivan Schmarg and Optimo. We caught up before a recent gig in Berlin to discuss his latest collaborations, an impending move to New York and his love of gastronomy. We started our conversation with his new label project, Crowdspacer, a vinyl-only affair with a focus on club-friendly music. you So you've just started your new label, Crowdspacer. Tell me the story behind that. Well, it's pretty simple. Well, I basically, how can I start? It's simple, but it's complicated. It's been a long time. I wanted to have like more like. club music playground because somehow when I make albums it's never really dancey stuff. I don't know why but it always end up being not dancey. or not that much and then when I make remixes it's something I really make for the clubs and so I was a bit frustrated because I've got all those ideas of I have literally like pages of notes about tracks I want to make with ideas about club things and in general. And also I was a bit tired of the distribution process with Tiger Sushi and I wanted to start something fresh from scratch. So both things coincided and I had this track I made with Kainé Saint-Jean and Vincent Eltrak. some time ago, like one year ago. And so it made sense to start with this track because we didn't really know what to do with it. And that's it. And how did you first come into contact with Adam, with Kindness? Well, I emailed him a few years ago when I heard his Swinging Party cover, but he never replied. And then he came to Paris to record his album with Philippe Dard. And kind of out of the blue, he came to the office and said, oh, hello. And so we... we met like that and uh and then we hanged out more and more he spent he spent some time at my place when he needed to crash and and we talked a lot about food and we went to a lot of restaurants and then one day we were just playing in the studio and And it became a track in just maybe two hours or three hours. It was really, really spontaneous and quick. And will Crowdspacer be something that you put out solo material on or will it be... no it's really open like the next next releases will be uh that's will be one with another collaboration i did i'm making now and uh but also then there will be other stuff i guess uh from other people and i'm also planning on uh on some edits It's pretty open, but the only thing that is clear about it is it should be music that you can play and really, really good dance music. And I was interested to see that it's going to be a vinyl-only label. Why did you decide to do that? Because... It's more fun and it's simpler. Not really simpler but it's more fun I would say. And there's this whole thing about vinyl labels at the moment that is really entertaining and I think exciting you know. as a buyer, as a collector, and also as a label manager. So, yeah. And you still buy records yourself? Is that something that you're still passionate about? Yeah, yeah, I do. I spend so much time ripping them because I'm not touring with vinyls, but I buy and I rip them. And I read... that when you started DJing, it was more out of necessity than pleasure. You weren't really into DJing in your earlier years. Is that something that's changed over time? Oh, yeah, absolutely. Well, I think it's like most people who produce music, they have to DJ at some point, especially when you're doing perform live. So I had to do something when I released my first record. I already collected a lot of records. So that made sense. But I don't think I was really good. I enjoyed it from the beginning because I like to share my... collection but I think I was not so good because I had this you know the typical collector DJ who wants to play his best tunes and doesn't really interact with the crowd or you know within a few years I think I learned a lot and I'm enjoying it more because now I know what I'm doing. Was it just from learning as you go or were there other DJs that you noticed that you learnt from? It's a bit of both I would say obviously like being around people like Optimo and Ivan Smag and Gilbert and Acube I think Gilbert was a big influence on DJing for me from Versata He's a very, very good DJ. And I don't know, I remember when I saw Harvey, I was like, oh, this is amazing. But a long time ago. yeah but it's also like doing it you you understand what's what how you can interact with the people and and also I didn't when I started I was not a club kid at all I'm still not a club kid, but now I think I understand that culture better than I used to. And what does a Joachim DJ set sound like these days? It's always a bit different. I like to improvise. I would say it's always a mix of different styles. Always. I've never played any set that was only this or that. There's always some bits of disco and always some house. I can say that. Now, these days, I enjoy a lot of more ghetto stuff. I think there's a good comeback of good techno. Yeah. Any artists or labels in particular? Well, it's pretty, I think it's a broad revival because you have... people like Bodica and Joy Orbison doing new kind of techno but from that post-whatever thing. And then you have people like Lize doing techno but in a more old-school and dirty way. And everything in between. And in terms of talking about your DJ sets, you as a person seem to have a really broad range of musical influences. You know, in the past you've... professed a love for blues, pop, post-punk and many strains of electronic music. Going back a bit, where did it all begin for you musically? If I go really far in the beginning, it would be classical music because that's where I started. But I can't really mix. classical music with other things. I mean it's a different case in my brain, different folder. So I think I started just listening to basic pop music when I was a teenager but pretty late. yeah, pop music and like rock and roll, like Led Zeppelin or whatever. And then I became more interested in like more indie stuff and especially American indie, like Pavement and Sonic Youth and that sort of 90s, early 90s. I used to listen to the radio a lot and to tape, record on tape everything I liked. And I read a lot of magazines too at that time. And I was reading like rock press, indie rock press. And I remember there was a special issue of a well-known magazine in France about the best 100 records of all times or something like that. And in that issue, I think there was a record by Mr. Fingers and maybe Motobass, which were not rock records, but they were included in that top 100. And the reviews were really intriguing. What the guy described sounded like something really weird. that's how I got into electronic music and also through that was the gate to more like house and techno stuff and also I used to listen to some hip hop and that led me to mo-wax and warp stuff in the mid 90s And Motobass was probably the record that made me love house music. Before that I was like, "Oh, this sounds too cheesy." And then I listened to this record and I was completely blown away. And I started Tool Collector, Chicago House and stuff like that. And there was quite a lot of stuff happening in France as well, I guess. Yeah, that was crazy. It was so much excitement. I remember every time you had a new track coming out, there was that buzz, which was not online, obviously, but sort of people actually talking about... Do you know there's this thing called stardust? have you heard it? I've heard this guy charted it and this guy. Yeah, it was very, very exciting. So this would be, you know, the late, mid to late 90s. Were you going out into clubs hearing this music in Paris at the time? A little bit. That's when I started. I remember going to the Rex to hear DJ Snake and Daft Punk. And that's also when the Pulp started. That was a kind of lesbian club in Paris that's quite mythical because there was amazing parties there and really on the ground. Yeah, and that's when I started DJing because I released my first record at... the end of in 99 also I was I was listening to some drum and bass I listened to everything at that time so I also DJ sometimes on drum and bass I remember I tried to do some parties at my school Some drum and bass parties? But there was like those big parties and they had one room where you could propose to do something and with some friends, oh yeah, we're going to play records and nobody cared about it. It was a total catastrophe. It was a catastrophe. What were you playing? Can you remember? Well, like from drum and bass to Daft Punk, you know, just all the electronic music from that time. And where did things go from there? When I released Coming to My Kitchen, that was kind of a turning point because it was my first really dance floor hit. I mean, underground hit, but it drew a lot of attention and it got me more gigs. So I had to become more of a DJ. And also then people started to ask me for remixes. And one remix leading to another. And how did you first meet up? with Joubert and Versatile because you had quite a strong relationship with them. Yeah, I was doing all those demos in my bedroom and I started to send cassette tapes to maybe two or three labels. Versatile, I think F-Com and maybe Warp. Which was... That was my top three, kind of. And he was the one who replied. I mean, Fcom sent me a postcard. I saw it the other day because I'm moving and I found it. And it was funny because it was, oh yeah, thank you for your demo. Please keep us updated. Like the standard refusal letter. But Gilbert was like... oh it's interesting it sounds really bad but it's interesting you should send me more stuff a bit like Fcom actually but more like he called me so it was more like more serious and I bought some equipment The thing is, I really didn't have any idea about production in the sense of mixing sound and stuff like that, because in my background, there's no such concept as production. Classical music background, I mean. So I had to learn this really from scratch, from really nothing. And that's why my first demos were so cheap and lo-fi, like just one keyboard. And with Gilbert, I learned a little bit. Well, you use a sampler for beats because, and then some synths are better than others. So at this stage, what was your production setup like? Were you just sort of making music in your bedroom? Yeah, yeah, it was bedroom. It was just an old PC. The first setup was just one keyboard and a really cheap one. Very, very cheap, but with a sequencer inside. Then I got another keyboard that was a little better, but still a bit one of those 90s cheap keyboards, and I bought a sampler. and that's when it got a little more professional. And did Gilbert offer some interesting feedback? How did you get your productions to a level where he was like, yeah, let's put this out on Versatile? I didn't really work with him until that first record. I mean, I pretty much worked on my own, but I understood that I need to work on some stuff. and having a sampler made a big difference and I started to sample all those jazz records. and I did a few tracks with only jazz samples. And I sent him a tape where there was some hip-hop, some drum and bass, some house, everything. And those tracks with jazz samples. And he told me, oh, that's really good. If you do an album like that, I will release it. And I was, of course. I'm doing an album like this the next day. And I actually went really fast. Maybe one month or two months, I did an album like that. And that was the first record. But that's why I always put this record a bit aside because it was kind of a... How do you say? commission like almost you know and then when I did Phantom a few years later it was more like a personal record with my actual influences and it wasn't too long after that where you started Tiger Sushi is that right? No, no, it was pretty much at the same time. I mean, I think we started, we created Tiger Sushi in 1999, but that was just a name. And then in 2001, the website was launched. And I think the first release was in 2003 because it was not a label in the first place. So when you say it just started out as a name, what was the goal? Where did you want to take that name? We had the plan to make that website, but it took years to, well, two years. to make it was pretty complicated, especially at that time where things were more... It was the early times of Internet in some ways. There was not even ADSL when we started, you know. So that took some time because it was really ambitious technically and also on a legal level, I would say. And that's also why it didn't really go where we wanted to go because we were stuck with labels and people not wanting to have their music online, basically. because at that time, labels were like, no, no, no, internet, we don't do anything on internet, no streaming, nothing, you know? So we didn't go, we did the website, but that was not exactly what we wanted to do. So what was your vision for how you wanted the website to be and how did that compare to how it ended up? It was like some sort of Spotify but with content, like editorial content and historical perspective on things. So you had a database of music, you could search any artist, any record, and you had like streaming for the tracks, and you had recommendations of other stuff that were kind of similar. And that sounds pretty obvious now, but back then there was not such thing. About 10 years ahead of your time there, I think. And biographies and label profiles and everything. Because we were passionate about music and we couldn't find anything in the real press that we liked. So we said we should do something online that would be our dreams, media, music, database, whatever. And there was also a radio and there was also a section where we would do a history of genres, like history of hip-hop, history of industrial music. history of ours. And who were you doing this with? I started with a friend at school, Charles. And there was also a guy who was more like a programmer. But they both left. When did they leave? Was that early on? The programmer left after we started the website. Sometime after that. And Charles left a few years later when we were doing the label. So how did it get to a stage where you had this idea for a website to where you wanted it to be a record label? How did that transition or progression take place? The first record we did, the idea was to have something in the shops that people would... would see the name tigersushi.com and they would go on the website. So it was like, oh, let's do a record as an advertisement. And then we said, oh, maybe we should do a series because... the first record you know it was it was a 12 inch and one side was a ratio and the other side was a new producer that we kind of linked to the ratio so it was like linking past and present and the first one was Cluster and John Tejada. And then we did a few 12 inches like that, each time a different genre and different artists. And then it led to doing a compilation of all those 12s, and it got a lot of press and impact. And so we got demos. because people say, oh, I like this compilation. Starting with the compilation really is strong to make an image quickly, because you say, this is what we like, and so people understand what you're going to do. And so we got some good demos and then we signed some artists. And also the website was kind of stuck and we were not making any money. So we continued with the label. And how did you decide if something was right for Tiger Sushi? I was really... intuition and there was no real rule that's why we signed so diverse artists and maybe that was a problem and that's still a problem because it's complicated when you have such a diverse roster now it's a bit more restricted but yeah we we had rock bands electronic artists electronica folk and then ratios and then techno compilations and you know how would you say tiger sushi has changed down the years i don't know i'm not i don't know if it's really changed No, I think it's pretty much the same idea, except that we don't do anymore those compilations or ratios because there's two reasons. One is that it's really hard to license things now because major labels don't give a fuck. because everything is basically on the internet. I was really interested to see the reissues you guys were doing in the early 2000s. I guess you could say now in 2013 it's a pretty rampant reissue culture with people going through classic or overlooked material and putting it out again. What made you decide to do that initially with Tiger Sushi to match up a track from, say, Cluster and put it? with something more contemporary? Because I think we thought that music was closed, like there was too many separations between genres and people and a lack of knowledge, basically. Maybe a bit... arrogantly we were like we should teach people you know in a way but like saying oh all those people they love bjork but then they don't know that affects twin exists or So it's the idea that in mainstream music you have parts of underground music and in nowadays music you have references to old music and hip-hop samples jazz and disco, how is disco with machines and stuff like that. So it was like a statement, like, okay. This track from Cluster, most people don't know it, but if you really listen to it, it's like Ambience, but 30 years ago. And people should know about it, you know. And then we chose artists that were like-minded or even in a remote way. But for instance, John Tejada, there was this track he released that I really loved called Significant Numbers. And it had a thing really close to that cluster track, and I thought it was interesting to link them. What was the reaction like when you started doing this stuff? Were people getting in touch saying they liked what you were doing? Yeah, especially because there were not so many ratios at this time. It was kind of the same time when there were soldiers and that was the same time as Strut also. We all started at the same time. But the difference is we were also putting out new music. That was the difference. And the compilations were not themed. It was a bit more... Merci. And you mentioned Optimo before as a DJing inspiration. Yeah. Tiger Sushi also built a relationship with the Optimo Singles Club. Is that right? Yeah, because we... We managed the labels for some time. I can't say it was really like we did a lot, but still. But it was after because we were, when we started the label, so we were doing all those parties at the Pulp. And the pub was run by some lesbian crew doing things with Ivan Smag. And they were called Kill the DJ. And they were doing those parties. And then they say, oh... we would like to maybe start releasing stuff but we don't know how so maybe you could take care of a Kill the DJ label so that became a part of Tiger Sushi and Kill the DJ were bringing Optimo over so they wanted to do this Kill the DJ compilation with Optimo and we did it that was crazy crazy work And then Optimus said, oh, do you want to take care also of our label? And that's how it happened. And you mentioned the Tiger Sushi parties at Pulp. When did they start happening? Early 2000s, yeah. But it was not a residency. It was more like when we had releases. We had like Daniel Wong, Tejada. for done and like yeah people like link to the releases and you mentioned the kill the dj nights and obviously optimo coming over it must have been a great breeding ground for ideas yeah of course and it was exactly the same spirit. I mean, if you went to an Optimo party, you would hear 90s techno and new stuff and Northern Soul in the same night. So that was perfect for us. And what were the crowds like in terms of how did they receive the Tiger Sushi parties that you were involved with? Was it an open-minded crowd? Yeah, but that's why we did the parties at the pub because that was really the place that broke all the laws in the clubs in Paris because before that, you really had that, like, this is a techno club, this is a house club. And then the pub arrived and killed the DJ parties and they said... Now it's open and the crowd was also like that. It was lesbians, gays, but straights and like poor student kids and posh people and hipsters, but really mixed, like really. And so that's how it, why it worked, I think. I wanted to ask you about your studio in Paris. It's relatively new, I think, and you built it yourself from scratch. There's been a few different studios, yeah. Okay, and there's one that you've been in for a couple of years now. Is that right? Yeah, three years. Are you happy with how that is now? Has it taken a while to get to a stage where you're really happy with your studio? I've read that you've... been slowly accumulating lots of analog equipment over the years yeah over lots of years yeah but uh yeah it takes some time before you really uh get used to a studio because there's many parameters and acoustics of course and setup and and new machines everything needs some time but now i'm pretty uh confident and used to the studio now I like I can mix things pretty quickly which was not the case in the beginning I was interested to read that in an interview that you said that once you know how to do something you don't want to do it anymore is that still the case well that's how i work yeah it's a bit of a problem because i've always been fascinated by artists who really uh you know dig a hole and they keep digging for their whole life and And a lot of artists that I really like are like that. But I just can't do it. Yeah, I get bored too easily. Maybe because I was too much of a spoiled kid. I don't know. So how do you think that's impacted on you as a musician? It made all my records sound a bit different first, even though I'm hoping there's some kind of consistency, like when you look at it from a few years past. But yeah, like most... people say would say it's i'm hard to pin down so somebody wrote a nice review like a nice biography once i was playing in a club in france and he said if you ask people who joachim is you would get 10 different answers and so yeah that's probably the result of my Not sticking to anything special. Are you happy to be perceived that way? Yes and no. I mean, I think it's a good way to stay free. And being free is probably the most important thing for me. And it allows you to surprise people. And to also build sometimes a stronger relationship with the audience because the audience you have really had to dig what you do and to understand. So maybe it's a bit stronger. but then it's also a lot slower. And you mentioned that you've been described as someone who's hard to pin down and it's not really a surprise really with your DJing, your solo production, running a label and then of course you've produced bands before. I wanted to talk about that specifically in terms of producing bands. Is that something that you want to keep doing? Yeah, absolutely. I've been doing this a lot this year, actually. For the first time, I've been doing mostly this. That's why I didn't release a lot of stuff in 2012. That was also the idea that... If I want to not be so much dependent on gigs, I have to work in the studio. And I love DJing, but I don't want to spend my life on the road forever. So, and since I have this studio and people started to talk about it and there was this video of future music came to the studio and I didn't know, but apparently like it made some. Like people checked it and those people talk about it. And then I got people coming to me like, oh yeah, I heard we have this studio. Can we come record? So who got in touch? First, it was very close people because it was Zombie Zombie. Then I had this French band that was recommended by a manager I know. And then this Belgian band called Montevideo. Also through their manager who... who I know him for a long time. Then I just did a band from Manchester who I think just liked some of my remixes and saw the video and they wanted a lot of synths. It's funny because they arrived, they already knew everything in the studio because they saw the video and they were like, where is the... I don't see this synth, where is it? And what is it about producing a band? or another outfit that you enjoy over, say, just making your own music? Well, it's much less stress, I would say. I don't have to think about... I mean, I have to think, is it good or is it bad? I can't change the music that the people would do so I just have to make my best to make it as good as possible so you have less responsibility in a way it's like a good break from producing music, even though it's taking a lot of time and frustrating because I would like to make more music on my own also. You mentioned that you produced the most recent Zombie Zombie album. Yeah. How was that? It was a bit of a challenge because we wanted to kind of renew the formula a little bit because it's a very simple band, it's just synths and drums and it can easily be the same record over and over again. So that's why we brought all those percussions and stuff to change a little bit the color of their music. And it was really nice and easy because I know them really well and we have the same references and stuff. I also did that Acidwashed album that's going to be released soon. But that was more like just mixing because it's electronic music. And you mentioned that this was all keeping you pretty busy in 2012 and there hasn't been a Joachim album since 2011. Is that something that you're going to try and rectify this year? Hopefully, but I'm moving, so that's going to delay things a little bit. Okay, whereabouts are you moving to? I'm to New York, so it's a big move. And I'm looking for a studio right now, there. Okay, so what's broad about that move? Well, it's a bit of... There's different reasons. Personal, opportunity, something I always wanted to do, but I thought it would not be possible. And then a few things. made it possible like my visa but and I thought if I don't do it now I will never do it so and would this be the first time you've lived outside of Paris yeah I've lived there for six months in New York in New York like two years to one year ago but yeah that's gonna be the first time I'm really excited. So can we expect the next Rock'Em album to be recorded in New York then? Well, that's pretty likely. I have a bunch of drafts and stuff on my computer, but I'm not sure I will have time to finish anything before I move. also because I want to finish things for Crowdspacer. So yeah, probably. You said you spent a little bit of time in New York a couple of years ago. What was it about the city that appealed to you enough to want to come back? I don't know. I just feel... I feel good. It's a good change from Paris, I would say. It's a good alternative because it's so different. The energy is so different. Sometimes Paris can drag you a little bit. It's exhausting to be in New York, I would say, but it's good exhaustion. It's like a vampire sucking your blood. But then you turn into a vampire and you have super power. But I don't know. I like lots of stuff. The city, the architecture, the vibe, the fact that there's so many different cultures in the same place. It's a very mixed city and I love that. Food. You've mentioned food a couple of times. Of course. I read an interesting article once where you basically gave a bit of a guide to Paris and you mentioned restaurants and your favorite food spot. Is food a big passion for you outside of music? Yeah, it's the main one. Yeah, I can't live without good food. I'd rather not eat than eat bad food, you know. And I cook every day. Can you divulge, maybe say, your number one recipe if you're going to cook a meal? My number one recipe? I don't really have a number one hit because most of the time I never do the same thing. Um, Maybe a pot au feu. I'm pretty good at pot au feu. And what's that? You have to describe that to me. A pot au feu is a very traditional French dish where it takes some time to make it because you have to start in the morning and to make it ready for the night. And it's a winter dish with a broth and things cooking in the broth for hours. And something that's really good the next day also. And you can keep it for a few days and make something else from it. It's really amazing. And do you find that's a nice way to get your mind off music and other things? Oh yeah, that's the best thing to think of nothing. And since my brain is a bit overactive, I need that kind of stuff. Now, I wanted to ask you about your music in a live context. You've performed live on stage with a band regularly over the last decade or so. Is that something that you want to keep doing? Oh, yeah, of course, yeah. Yeah, it's very different from DJing, so it's really complementary. It's a different work, it's a different feeling. Yeah, and I like it. And there's a lot of stuff that I... I want to do live that I haven't done yet. So for sure. Like what? Things I can't really. tell here but like different setups I had this idea about some kind of performance with lights and music but I can't really tell about and yeah how much is you know the live setup changed for you down the years it's had a few different in kind of hasn't it? Not really, I think it's evolved a little bit but it basically didn't change it was from the beginning I mean in the beginning there was a guitar player that's not here anymore but It was guitar, a bass player who's also playing bass synths and a drummer. And I have just a few machines and synths and I control the rest of the band. I mean, I send like clocks and stuff. It's always like that. And I guess that live element and also, you know, your albums today. have had a real song-based quality to them. Is there something about the idea of a nice pop song that appeals to you? Absolutely, yeah. I love good songs. I love songs that appeal to everybody, that has this power of just instant emotion. That's the ultimate goal, I think, for a song. So that's my obsession, but it's not easy. I still have some road to... And do you think the next album, that's what you reserve the album format for, is to write songs and then you've got the 12-inch singles and crowd spaces? Yeah, that's how I'm trying to picture things right now. Do you see yourself in some aspects as a pop musician, as a pop producer? That's hard to say. I don't know. It's not for me to tell, you know. I'm just trying to do things and then people call me what they want. Last year you did an interesting collaboration with Bambunu on Sound Pellegrino. Yeah. Can you tell me the story about how that came to be? It's Tequila Tex who contacted me about it. I mean, we played a couple of shows together. Like I remember in Ukraine, we were playing live and they were DJing after. And so I know Tequila Text for a long time, but we were never really talking about music or stuff. And then we realized, playing together, that we had some common grounds. And I think the idea of this series of collaborations that they started, Saint-Pélegre, was to bring people from different... you know genres or backgrounds but with some common grounds and and I remember I told him once that I really like that Bambounou track they put out on on the Scion compilation they did And so once he emailed me, he said, hey, do you want to do a track with Bon Bonou? We're starting this collaboration EP series. I'll buy you a dinner, a good dinner. And that's, of course, how he got me. And that was really cool. I mean, working with him was super nice and fresh and interesting. I think he's going to be a really interesting producer over the years, Bambounou. And I read that Bambounou had not actually made music outside of a laptop until he met you and started working with you. Yeah. Absolutely. And not even with a single, like not even a sound count, you know? And, and that was interesting because I, when I met him, I like, yeah. you know i really like the way you you make those so those beats on your productions and because that's not the way i would do it and i like it and and he showed me how he did on his computer just with bits of audio not even a sampler in the computer because he didn't know like he could use a sample so he was like pasting bits of sounds I was like, wow, this is crazy. And it sounded amazing. Yeah, and so he was really excited when we started to play with the drum machines. Like I said, okay, you'd make some beats on your computer, some drafts, and then we replay the same thing, but with the real machines and see how it works. And are you happy with how that EP came out? Yeah, I'm pretty happy. Actually, we were talking about doing something else yesterday. And how do you assess the current... music landscape in France is it as healthy as it was when you were doing those you know tiger sushi parties at pulp or is it not the same healthy I'm not a doctor so I can't really say But it's good. Well, the other day when I met Bambounou, I was at the social club and Crackboy was doing a party and it was great. The music was great and all the kids were dancing. Everybody. Yeah, it's really cool. Thank you. Oh baby Give me peace Give me peace Give me peace
