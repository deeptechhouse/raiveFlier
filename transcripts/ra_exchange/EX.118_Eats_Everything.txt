Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Eats Everything may seem like a bit of an overnight success story, but the Bristol-based house producer is anything but. Indeed, it was only after a number of years of DJing and making tunes that Dan Pierce decided to give things one last shot. That's when he caught his big break, the release of Entrance Song on Cats and Dogs Pets Recordings. Off the back of that, he's done the Essential Mix, DJs nearly every weekend, and has plans to launch a label in 2013 to further push his distinct brand of bass-heavy house. We recently went to Manchester, as part of Copperburg's Unestablishment, to record a live RA exchange before Pierce performed later that night at the Warehouse Project. *outro music* Welcome to the Copperburg Unestablishment. My name is Todd L. Burns. I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. And what we're going to do here is a part of our series of RA Live Exchanges, where we do talks with DJs around the world. Tonight, we're lucky enough to be joined by Eats Everything. Hello. Fucking that's loud. Sorry. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. You're playing tonight at the Warehouse Project. I am, yeah. Have you played there before? They just opened up a new space, correct? I've played there. I played the old space the last... event they did on New Year's Eve. I can't remember what it's called, the arena, and then I played the opening event in Easter on the Saturday night in room two, which is where I'm playing tonight, and it was unreal. It's one of the best gigs. I've ever had so I'm very excited to go back very excited you're talking about the lights yeah they've got like pillars like about I don't know 10 15 pillars either side going down and they've got an individual strobe light on each pillar and when the track drops they sort of fire the the strobe lights off individually and it's like being in Blade or something like that. It's amazing. I imagine from your perspective in the DJ booth, it's like also you have a bird's eye view on it. Yeah, it's amazing. I played Jagged Edge and I had a full DC-10 style. I don't know what they call it, get down or crouch down. Sit down. Yeah, sit down, yeah. And it's amazing. And that was like half past seven at night. I've been open half an hour. Manchester ravers are amazing. Half an hour in. I know, half an hour in and I've got to sit down, crazy. You're from Bristol though. Yes, as you can probably tell by my voice. Born and bred or just bred? Yeah. born and bred when I was born in Bristol and I lived like I actually lived up here for a bit lived up in um skipton i don't know if any of you know skipton it's like in between leeds and manchester but i only lived there till i was five and then i moved to a place called button under edge which is like 25 miles from bristol and i lived there till i was 16 and then moved to bristol why have you stayed in bristol over the years i mean what's the is it inertia or is it like appeal to it that you know you love this city i don't know i just i'm quite a uh like home person i like i like bristol i've got loads of friends there it's a really pretty city it's not too big it's not too small there's loads of stuff going on and as i said i like being home and i'm i like getting back to home so i'm not really although i travel a lot once I'm finished DJing all I'm thinking about is you know getting home and being at home not necessarily at home like a hermit like you know being in my hometown and being surrounded by things that I can recognise you said that you're playing later on even further on tonight in Birmingham in Birmingham yeah And then it's a one-hour drive home. So I finish at midnight at Warehouse Project, and I've got to be in Birmingham at 1.30, so I'm cutting it fine, I reckon, yeah? But I reckon I can do it. I've done it before, so I might be a little late, but... Tell me about going out in Bristol in the 90s. I read interviews where you said... It was amazing. It was really inspiring to you. Well, I used to go to raves which were not in Bristol, sort of Milton Keynes. I used to go to Dreamscapes and stuff at the Sanctuary in Milton Keynes, which is a warehouse, and used to go and listen to DJs like LSD, Easy Groove, Psy, and all the jungle. DJs like Hype, etc. Carl Cox, Easy Groove. But then 1996 started going to Lakota, which was at the time, I'd say, one of the top three clubs in the country. And we used to go every Friday, Techno, Dave Angel, Carl Cox, Daz Saund, etc. And then every Saturday it would be like Jeremy Healy, Tony DeVit. you know, those kind of the big judge jewels, all those kind of in the mid-90s, and it was, it was, well, it was unreal. It was, it's what shaped me as a person, I think. Were you already sort of like, clocking the djs that i was already djing i've been djing for four years then when i've been djing since i was 12 so i um yeah i've been djing there's not a lot to do in in the in rural brist in like wooden under edge and so when you sort of get into mixing dance music and you know everything that comes with that basically and then yeah I was obviously playing in Bristol when I was 16. I had my first gig in Bristol when I was 16 years old. So it's nice to sort of go to the co and see these guys doing and just dreaming one day that I'll be in that booth. You mentioned the name just a little bit before that I always see you mention as an inspiration, who's LSD? DJ LSD. Yeah. Tell me about him. and why he was such a thing for you? Well, because he was like, for me, LSD, he was, I don't know, does anyone know who DJ LSD is? No. He, for me, because he played like, it was called Jungle Techno at the time, so it was in between hardcore and jungle, so I was into hardcore, but I was also into jungle, and he was the DJ that played the best fusion of the two, if you see what I mean, and it was actually termed, when guys played like that, it was termed Jungle Techno, and also... there's a style of music called jungle techno which was jungle but with a 4/4 beat. It's kind of hard to explain but it and LSD was just the master for me. Everything, the way he mixed, like the way I DJ is modeled on him and Carl Cox. How does he mix? Like just cutting, scratching, acapellas, spin backs. I don't really do spin backs so much anymore but the rest of it. and the way he blended and he's one minute it's really happy music and the next minute is evil and he would just go up and down and up and down and it would be perfectly blended and just tune selection was just incredible and mixes were never out and everything was just spot on and you're thinking this guy all he's got is a I don't know probably a cam mixer like no EQs no nothing two old turntables and he's banging in records every two minutes just unreal I mean, the Jungle Techno thing is interesting because you've obviously done a number of edits of Jungle tunes and brought them down to the tempo. I guess one of the more famous ones is the Adam F. Adam F one, yeah. I would say that's the most famous one, yeah. If I were you, I'd be almost like, I can't even touch this song. See, the thing is, I'm not really like, I don't look at that as sacrilege. I think people who are really, really anal, and I apologise to people out there who are like this, but people who are really, really anal about Jungle and really, because there are people with all kinds of music, not just Jungle, but at the end of the day, it's not like I'm trying to tout it I'm not trying to sell it all I wanted to do was make it as a record for me to be able to play in a set it was just something I wanted to do for a bit of fun and it seemed to work on the dance floor and that's probably the biggest record I've made so I don't find it sacrilegious you could say to remix a track that I love do you remix a track that was at 160, 170 and bring it down? Luckily the original of Adam F. Circles is a Bob James record and the riff, the bass guitar riff is actually only about 120, 530 beats per minute. So Adam F. sped it up. So then I just sort of slowed it back down to almost its original tempo. But I've only used it in the break, so it's pretty easy to slow something down like that. I had to get Claude Von Stroke to slow it down properly on some high-tech equipment because I've only got Ableton and it sounded too rubbish, so I had to... it onto him is he your sometimes your technical guru on things like this no actually not at all i don't i don't want to sound like an idiot but i don't really have one it's only when ableton can only handle like when you're slowing stuff down or speeding stuff up ableton can only handle it gets really grainy of you the same with like master tempo honestly CDJ. If you start going too far one way or the other, you lose a lot of quality. But Corvon Stroke had this thing called iZotope Radius. I'm sorry, I'm getting a bit geeky now. And it's a really amazing pitch-shifting tool, basically. It's only on Logic. I don't use Logic. And it costs thousands of pounds. And I don't have thousands of pounds to spend. on one little thing. So I just said to Barkley, look, can you fix it for me? He's like, yeah, of course, dude. He did it. How did you get hooked up with the Dirty Bird crew? Was it through the pets recording thing? Yeah, well, it was basically, I... Ever since pretty much Claude Von Stroke started releasing, you know, but he did his first album and sort of blew up, I always really loved the music. And I always saw Dirty Bird as a kind of, not a pinnacle, but kind of like somewhere I really aspired to get, a label I really aspired to get on. And he was playing in Bristol last, I think it was last year, March, yeah, March of last year with Seth, him and Jay Flip was in the other room and I'd made like Entrance Song and Heard That which were the my first pet CP and then a couple of other tunes and I put them on a CD and I went specifically down there to meet him and give him the CD but he was playing it like I think they opened it early. It was at Blue Mountain in Bristol. And they opened the doors early because he had to play somewhere else. So he played like nine till 11 or something stupid. And I got there at like quarter to 11. And just as he's leaving, obviously he's got a million people going, Claude, Claude, Claude, Claude, Claude. So I gave him the CD and obviously never listened to it. But luckily, Jay Flip was there. And I went upstairs and watched her DJ. And afterwards, I sort of got chatting to her. and I said, look, I've made these tunes. Could you have a listen to them? Maybe if you like them, could you pass them on to Claude Von Stroke? And she said, yeah, of course, no worries. And it was just before the WMC Miami of that year. anyway she went off a couple of days later I got an email from her saying look I played at Ultra I played heard that and I played Entrance Song and they both sounded great I've passed them on to Cats and Dogs is that okay I was like yeah of course yeah great and then a couple of days later from that Voitek from Cats and Dogs emailed me saying hey there we love these records can we sign them and I was like Yeah, of course you can. And so that's kind of how I got introduced to them. And then where the Dirty Bird hookup actually really came about is from Dempth in Detroit of that year. And Justin Martin played on the Beatport stage and he played Entrance Song and he played The Sides, which was the first track on my first Dirty Bird EP. and Claude Von Stroke was in the crowd for the entire set. I've seen videos of Justin Martin playing my records of Claude Von Stroke bouncing up and down. and I got an email the next day from Claude Von Stroke saying, dude, I've just heard this tune of yours. I know I've missed out on the entrance song. I wanted to sign that, but pets have got it. They'll be good to you. They're good guys, et cetera. But I really want to sign the size. And I was like, well, sorry, dude, I've signed it to Worthy's label, Anabatic. He replied, fucking Worthy. And so, anyway, a couple of weeks went by and a few wranglings went on between him and Worthy and he can be a very... Pitch shifted a couple of things for Worthy. And basically he managed to prize it off of Worthy and then that's basically it. The rest is history and I'm just lucky to be with him. They're really good guys. Dirty Bird's a fascinating connection to me because all of those guys have such a love of jungle as well in their tunes, even though they don't necessarily always, you can't necessarily hear it. Yeah. But that reality. mindset all of us through the music every single apart from jess jess is the only one but worthy christy and justin barkley cats and dogs do as well a bit but not so much because in poland i mean i can't imagine jungle was rife in poland whereas in america and england yeah yeah But yeah, so we've all got this jungle, this love of jungle, basically. Because it comes across in the love of bass. The bass, yeah. The low end of our music definitely is synonymous with jungle. Definitely. I try and make my house as jungly a lot, some of the time anyway, as jungly as I can. That makes sense. That's not really much of a sentence, but... Isn't alright. Yeah, I mean, I was really interested and it seemed like a year, year and a half ago, Barclay also really, you know, got in touch in a big way with the UK bass scene. Yeah, really, yeah. The right slugs guys. Yeah, really, yeah. He was just like... Yeah, he's back into it. You like... finally all these connections that just seem so obvious were being made. Yeah, definitely. He's very now, I mean, he's very in tune with what's going on. As you say, especially in the last year and a half, he's really become in tune with the UK scene. And he takes a lot of, you can hear it in his music now as well. You can hear, I mean, he's just done a remix of Infinity Inc. And it sounds a lot more UK. than anything he's ever done before. And you can hear that he... Obviously, I take influences from him. I'm sure he may have taken influences from me. I take a lot of influence from Justin Martin. I mean, Justin Martin, for me, he's the king, in my opinion. His production is just amazing. Being in the studio with him, he's just so particular. It's ridiculous. In what way? it'll just hear things that are just so, they don't matter at all, but in the bigger picture, they actually do. But I won't even hear it. And he's just like, no, there's this little noise at 1.7 seconds into the break. And you're just like, what are you on about? And then you solo everything and you're like, actually, yeah, there is a noise. How the hell do you hear that? But yeah, he's a genius producer and a genius guy in general. Genius guy. Must have been why it took his album so long to come out. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he was so finickety about that. He kept sending me tracks and, oh, I'm not sure about this, I'm not sure about this. It's just so particular. I mean, both him and Claude Von Stroke are both uber particular, but in the best possible way, a lot more particular than I am, a lot more. You said in an interview once that you only started getting happy with your music. Two, three years ago, basically. Yeah. You only found your sound? Yeah. I've been producing for 10 years, and I personally, I mean, not as a rule, obviously, I mean, some people pick it up a lot quicker, and I only really got happy with what I was doing probably about, it would be about three years ago now, where it really clicked. It was like... So that's how I do that. Because I'd always wanted to write the kind of music I'm writing, but I could never write it. I'd just be sat for hours just, and I've got like probably, and this is no exaggeration, I reckon, maybe four or 5,000 16-bar loops on my computer where I'm just sat there for hours just, oh no, that's not right, and start another one, start another one. And eventually, yeah, about three years ago. just it clicked on the track Heavy which was again Barclay says he missed out on that one as well I sent that to him and he didn't listen to it he must have missed out on a lot of records over the years from a lot of artists where he just doesn't listen But yeah, Heavy was the first one. I made Heavy an entrance song in about June... I made the entrance song in June 2010. It didn't come out until July 2011. So it took me a while to meet the people that would like the record. A lot of labels said no. I mean, what clicked? Was it that you said, I'm doing music full-time, I don't care, I'm giving it? You said earlier tonight... you said at a certain point you're like giving it one last shot yeah I was on the dole and I basically said to my now wife that look I just want to give it one I was just coming up to 30 and I was like just want to give it one last chance just one more chance of just going full at it so I gave up my job and just worked and worked and worked and worked and worked and worked and it was like the year that she'd given me was up in like two months and then cats and dogs signed the EP and then luckily it's I was basically it was like someone was looking down on me going all right you're gone then we'll let you have this one but it was it's just a load of different small things that all happened at the same time, production-wise, just things clicking and just being influential. I think kind of the records that were coming out, I mean, things like Justin Martin and Ardalan, the one that sampled Snoop Dogg, I can't believe I've forgotten the name of it. The Spock thing? Yeah, Mr. Spock. The record was out, that was mid-2010, something like that. And hearing that, I was just like... that's the kind of thing I've been wanting to make. And hearing that, I was like, okay. And I tried to emulate it to a degree, and that's where Heavy came from, basically. And that was the first record I was really like, yes, I've done it, I've nailed it. And ever since then, it's just been, it's still a learning curve the whole time. Did your wife give you the year willingly or grudgingly? Um, willingly, we'll say, for the records. No, yeah, she did. No, she was cool. She basically just said, look, okay. It was tough, but worked out. But I think if you really want to do something, if you really want to do something, like I really wanted to do this, and I have done since I was 12, then you've just got to really, because I wouldn't have been happy for the rest of my life if I hadn't, do you know what I mean Yeah, thank God she let me do it. And thank God that, not let me, but thank God she gave me the blessing to do it. And thank God that I actually did it, really. It's amazing. It's amazing. We made a, Ari made a film last year called Real Scenes Bristol. I was shocked. directly involved in the production process. How much house is going on in that city. You know, from the outside looking in, I'm like, oh, dubstep, you know, that's it. And there's a, it seems like there's an enormous scene for House. I mean, it's always been, the common misconception is that House is obviously, Bristol is like a bass music, like a drum and bass and bass music city, but there's always been, there's never really been. house big house producers per se for years but the house scene in Bristol like club wise has always been the biggest thing pretty much I would say there's you had like nights like run which was a big jungle night but generally the House music nights were big. But yeah, all of a sudden, I think Bashmore was the first guy, really, to sort of step it up. Bashmore put Bashmore completely to his credit. put Bristol on the map house music wise completely and it just opened a door opened people's eyes to the city that it's not just a jungle or a drum and bass or a bass music or a dubstep city it's there's other good things coming from there and he opened a door and we just sort of like Kicked it down after him. And just there's me, Waston Strayed. I mean, there's so many guys. I forget, Bailing and Simpson. Obviously, just the future boogie guys in general. Future boogie guys, that's who I'm playing with in Birmingham later on tonight. It's a future boogie night. and they've been plugging away for years but they were predominant they weren't really house until about three years ago it was more you know crazy P loosely based house but not essentially what I would call proper real house music so yeah and then you've got there's some young guys like Christoph and Lucas as well and you've got young guys like Pressed Rio and Pressed And there's another guy that Cats and Dogs have just signed called Billy Disney, who I've never heard of, but the tunes that they've signed are amazing. You know, we asked everyone in this film, you know, why is Bristol so creative, you know? Or, like, it seems like per capita. It's shocking. Yeah, it's definitely a... So, why? I've got no idea, mate. Honestly, I have no idea. It's like, I honestly can't answer it. There must be, I know it's so cliche, but there must be something in the water because there is... And it's constant. Like there's so many, I get sent records from people. I'm not joking. I must get sent, not all of them good, but I get sent probably five records a week from a different producer in Bristol. Like a different house music producer saying, hi, this is my name, blah, blah, blah. Here's my record. And I was just like, how many people can there possibly be making music in one 450,000 population city? On the other hand, you said, you know, for a while there, the club scene specifically in Bristol wasn't very good. a little while no in like i would say between the end of this big night called scream which i was kind of involved with in about 2002 to about whenever just jack started and you obviously you've worked with john and rag rag is the promoter of just jack um until that started i think about 2000 around when sort of switch And, you know, like, Jesse Rose and those guys became, just before the minimal thing, they, I think that's when it really kicked off again. But there was a period for, like, two or three years where it was pretty dire. Pretty dire. And you were DJing in the city around this time. Yes, all the time, to no one, every week. It was amazing. It took a few of the best years of my life. So, obviously, you know... The productions have been the catalyst, but it seems like your DJ sets have also gone over pretty amazingly. Everyone I hear says it's party. It's party. Do you have a philosophy, an underlying sort of... I don't know, DJ, like mixing wise, I just try and do as, I play on like three or four CDJs and I try and do as much as possible without being over the top and without, obviously my style of music suits. I mix like a hardcore, I mix like LSD or Carl Cox. I try and have like two records or three records going the whole time and acapellas and I edit everything I make. I'd say 90% of the records I play, I've edited in some way. I've put extra drums or I've changed the break or put a build up in it or just something to make it sort of put my own stamp on it so that when people... come and watch me dj they'll only hear me playing those records do you know and i think that for me is the most important thing to be unique to just a little bit different i mean i'm not that to other people but I've just got I just I'm a little bit different that hopefully people will want to come and watch me DJ that's that's that's my philosophy I've just got I'm always I don't plan ever I never know what I'm going to play until I start but I plan I make edits all week long every week just four or five six edits every week so I've got new tracks to play but they're familiar do you know what I mean I think the edit thing is interesting because it is the one way, especially in the age that we're in, you can play things that no one has. Final DJs who are strictly purist vinyl, it's very cool and I respect it greatly, but I also like, unless they're doing a lot of different things, you can hear that. record yeah of course yeah but having an edit like that you have something that no one else has definitely i mean look i this the whole vinyl cdj cd argument like i learned on vinyl i think you should if you can learn to mix if you're going to become a dj just get tractor and press the sync button but I've got no problem with the sync button if you're Richie Horton or you're someone who's an absolute wizard who is doing so much stuff that beat matching is the last thing on your mind because beat If you're an experienced DJ, you should be able to mix a record in two seconds, really. If you've been doing it for 10 years or so, you should be able to beatmatch. Did it take you 10 years to learn how to beatmatch? No, it took me 11, actually. I was quite lucky. I used to play the drums. So before when I was a kid, when I was 10, 11, I played the drums. So I picked up beat matching quite quickly, luckily. But yes, I think you should learn. But then once, I don't understand the format well. I think you should just, if you like using vinyl, use vinyl. And if you like using CDJs, use CDs. Use CDs. You want to use USB? Use Rekordbox, right? I use Rekordbox and USB. What are the advantages of that for you? Well, I don't have to carry a lot. I walk around with a little headphone bag and a couple of USB sticks and I'm it. That's it. Whereas before, I used to have two bags of records. I was obviously a lot slimmer then, so that's probably why. Maybe I should go back to the records. But I find that having everything on USB, I don't like the thought of using Traktor because I don't like the thought of having to set up while another guy's DJing. And I don't like having to think about... carrying a £1,000 laptop around with me everywhere. Whereas a USB stick costs, if you've got a really good one, the most it's going to cost you 50 quid. And you've got everything categorised like you would have on your computer. How do you categorise your tunes? I'm always interested with what folder names are. Just by the gig. So this week I've got WHP forward slash Brum. And that's all. I don't have it like... Any house, garage, deep house, techno, tech house, jungle. How many tunes do you put in a folder for a gig? 25. Something like that. Every week, about 25. I probably play two of them. But I try and put 25 and about 10 of those will be edits. And you kind of just remember, I just kind of remember where... the certain tracks that have gone down well. And also it saves your playlists. So if you're using just one USB stick on four decks, because they're all linked up via Ethernet cable, if you're playing off just one USB, then it will remember your whole set. And then you can just, you can remember, oh, that tune went down well, that didn't go down so well, I won't play that one again, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So I just save each playlist and then sort of put a marker next to the tracks that went down well, and I know then to use them in the next situation that's similar, it's a big room situation, then I know that this track was a big room track. I won't mark it or anything, but it just Where else have you played this summer that's been amazing that people might not know about or expect? I played it, I mean, some of the guys here might know, I played at Mint Club in Leeds. Has anyone been there? It was on a Thursday night, me and Heidi. It was ridiculous. Absolutely jam-packed. From start to finish, people going absolutely mental. From start to finish, chocolate cake fight, the whole shebang. Like, steep. Like, the underground. It was ridiculous. It was Heidi's boyfriend's birthday and he got a chocolate. We played Stevie Wonder happy birthday for him and she got him a chocolate cake. But it just turned into a full-blown chocolate cake fight. Even people in the front row were getting... I've never had a chocolate cake fight in a club in my life. I don't think I've ever had a chocolate cake fight. But yeah, it was just ridiculous. It was... And it was packed. I got there at midnight on a Thursday night. I ended at 7.30 and it was packed. The same amount of people from midnight to 7.30. That was a highlight. A real highlight. And then I played Fabric Room 3 the night after. And that was insane. Just ridiculous. So busy. It was a bit dangerously busy. If there was a fire, people would have died. Sorry, Fabric. It's a small room. Over the past year or so, it seems like you've achieved a lot of goals. Yeah. Play, Fabric, room one. and three. Yeah, and two. Oh, no, I haven't played two. I've played room one twice and room three. Okay. So I guess my question was, you know, what's next? But I guess it's someday play Fabric Room 2. Yeah. That actually might be happening next year. But goals-wise, I want to play South America. I've not played South America. I've only really been to, like, you know... England, a lot of England and in America. I've not played anywhere else. I haven't played Australia, I haven't played any Middle East, Far East. I've not played South America and South America I really want to go and play there but it just looks crazy and everyone says it's brilliant so that's a goal but I think that will hopefully come. I mean I don't know if anyone knows who I am over there but hopefully they do. And production-wise, things coming up? Yeah, I've got my EP, new Dirty Bird EP comes out next Wednesday, Vertigo EP. And then I've got an EP on Future Boogie, which is a lot more like down tempo, more sort of just slower house music. It's not a change of style. It's just like a little, because I like that kind of stuff as well. And it's nice to just be able to put out. like an EP a year or something that's a little bit more down-tempo, a little bit more groovy. And then I've got an EP with Justin Martin, like a collaboration EP coming out on Hypercolor in February. And then I'm going to hopefully write an album, hopefully, if I can. Hopefully I don't get writer's block. What in your mind would an album look like? Not that you've started yet, but what is your ideal or what is your general concept? Well, it wouldn't all be bangers, which I'd like to make it... I wouldn't want to... for anything poppy at all or anything that could be considered chart music. It's not something that I aspire to do. If that happened by accident, then great. So not bangers, not chart music. What do we have left here? I'm going to work with some vocalists and I'm going to try and write some real music rather than just some, but I want to just go everywhere. I like making all kinds of music. I mean, I like, I write kind of, I don't ever do anything with it, but I write like, you know, like 808 hip hop and stuff like that. I write a lot of those kind of beats and I like loads of different kinds of music so I'd like to try and make an album that sort of without sounding too wishy-washy it sort of encompasses my sort of love of all styles basically I guess I wanted to open it up to questions from the audience does anyone have anything they want to know from Meets Everything? Surely not It's a bit of a non-music related question actually. I just wanted to know, if it didn't work out, what would you have done? What was your fallback career? Fallback? A builder. Really, that's true. I used to be a recruitment consultant and I did that for five years and that was just so stressful. I was at the point of throwing myself off the nearest high thing. And then... And yeah, I used to be a builder and then I was a recruitment consultant. So the only thing I could have really done was gone back to be a builder, I think. And that's it. And luckily, touch. I don't have to do that, but you never know. It could all go tits up and I might have to be a builder yet, but hopefully not. Do you use hardware when you're producing or do you think we're at a stage where software can pretty much emulate most hardware fine and it's like irrelevant now? I think hardware is totally relevant if you can fit it in and you can afford it. Personally, I can afford it but I don't have the room for it. I am moving to a new studio and I will buy some but I've got one synth and I don't really use it. I think if you've grown up with it, I don't think just buy it for the sake of buying it because it's hardware and people are getting back into hardware. I think if you think you're going to use it, a lot of my friends have become, and you'll probably know this, a lot of my musician friends or DJ friends or whatever. synth addicts. They've got like synths coming out of their ears and eyes, nose, everywhere and they're just constantly on eBay like buying a new and they just don't they use them for like I don't know one track a year and they're spending like £900,000 on a synth. So in my personal opinion would be that I'd like to own some hardware, but I don't use it. So it isn't necessary because I'm done all right and I don't use it, but I would like to use it. What are you addicted to on eBay? What are you late night? Trainers. Trainers. I buy lots of trainers. I don't buy on eBay. I just go to the shop. Because you can't really trust eBay, can you, for trainers. But trainers is the only thing that I buy a lot of. And V-neck t-shirts, because they're slimming, apparently. Are there any other questions? How do you find sound? When you're making a track, what is your inspiration? How does it come to you? What's that magic moment? That's like the billion dollar question, isn't it? An inspiration, it sounds so wanky, but it just comes to you, do you know what I mean? Because I've been doing it for a while, I can pretty much create. what I want on a software synth in a few minutes. I can pretty much emulate anything. Do you know what I mean? So I think inspirational moments come... Like Entrance Song, I heard that the acapella that I nicked, that I used for Entrance Song, I heard that track on a... I was in my car, Floetry, Say Yes is the track I sampled, and I heard that track... in my car, just driving about in Bristol on like Bristol's local star radio. And that track came on and I heard it. I was like, Ooh, hang on. That's quite a cool acapella. When they found out, Shazammed it, then went to the, went home, put flowetry, say yes, acapella and bang, there it was. I was like. And then downloaded it and that's, I put it, I'd already made the instrumental for Entrance Song and I just put the acapella over it and that was it. So it's just, you can, inspiration for me comes from like literally being in McDonald's where I am a lot and just being, just being anywhere really, just anything. So it's not really a great answer but that is the truth. of a silly question, but your Twitter profile photo is probably my favourite. I have 7,000 people I follow, so... Yeah, I've got a lot of followers on that. I've got a lot of followers on that. Have you lost any followers from that? I'm sure I have. I find it weird that people unfollow you and, like, unlike you. I don't really get it. I never unfollow anyone, but... I can't change that now because they've stopped allowing you to upload gifs on Twitter so if I get rid of that so that's going to be with me because it's I love it it brightens up my day when I switch on Twitter woohoo If you don't know, it's a badger swinging his penis in an anti-clockwise motion. A cartoon badger swinging his penis in an anti-clockwise motion in a gif. So it just keeps on going constantly. It's like a lava lamp. It's quite hypnotic. You said when you're mixing, you take like 25 songs. Yeah. You also said you use acapellas. I want to know how that works out. Well, I just basically have loads and loads of acapellas on my hard drive. And when I think, because there's certain ones that I use a lot. A lot of my tracks have, like, you know, Entrance Song, for example, has an acapella and some of my older tracks and stuff. And I will then just take the vocal. Acapella is basically just the vocal. and then I will play the vocal over the top, so effectively it creates a new song. And I'm all the time searching for and editing acapellas, so that I can just again make my sets a little bit different to the norm. Pretty much use the acapellas you've used in your songs? Yeah, not exclusively, like there's other ones that I use, but... But that's usually how it works. Yeah, generally, like, my own tracks and also, like, you know, tracks that are well-known, things like Blades to my beat and stuff like that, and just things that are well-known, just vocal samples that people will recognise, and then I'll put them over the top of another track. and people would be like, what's the remix of that track you played? It's not a remix, I used an acapella. Do you see what I mean? So it just makes it a little bit different to the other dude playing the same record. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. All right, thanks. Cool. Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Bye.
