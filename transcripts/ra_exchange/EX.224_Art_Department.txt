I just can't. No, I just can't. Without you. No, I can't. I just can't. I just can't make it without you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Aaron Coultey and I'm the news editor at Resident Advisor. It felt like Art Department graduated from Toronto's club scene to the international stage overnight. Their swift rise can be attributed to their breakthrough single, Without You, which was voted RA's number one track of 2010. Thanks to DJs like Jamie Jones and Seth Troxler, the tune was a certified hit even before it was officially released. A year later, they dropped their debut album. The Drawing Board, which established Kenny Glasgow and Johnny White as one of the biggest acts in contemporary house. The subsequent three years have flown by for the pair, who relocated from Canada to Europe to maintain their hectic touring schedule. Stopping by RA's London office, they were in a talkative mood, lifting the lid on the story behind Without You, tracing their origins in the Toronto scene, and discussing their upcoming second album, Natural Selection. I just can't No, I just can't make it without you No, I can't, I just can't I just can't make it without you. A new art department LP is on the way. It's called Natural Selection. How did you guys approach making your second album? Well, the second album was kind of a mindfuck, to be honest, going into it. I mean, off the back of the success off the last album. I mean, it's a strange thing when you're making a record, thinking about having to, you know, appease certain people and maybe even outdo yourself for the last album. Yeah, I mean it was a tricky one. So we decided to go back to Toronto where we wrote the first album. Rented a studio there underneath the Hoxton nightclub which... I don't even know if they know that we were there still to this day. We went in and came out. Yeah, kind of on the low rent of the space. And stayed there for a month, writing at home as well in our separate studios and in this space there. And for me, I mean, what we had discussed was going back there might kind of bring back some of that magic. Yeah, and that original feeling that kind of helped us create the first record and going back home and being around family and friends, you know, a bunch of ex things. Yeah. And did it work? I think it did. It's a lot different than the first album. It's like, to me, it's a good artist album. It's a great artist album. Again, I go back to the first one and listen to it, and I'm like, wow, this is, you know, to me personally, I This is an amazing album. And still, when I listen to the second one, I don't know which one is better, but I look at them as two total different types of albums. One was our first album to introduce a sound, our sound, what we're doing in our studios to as much people as we can. This album, after them hearing that... I know a lot of people are going to be thinking, wow, there's not that much actual dance tracks on the album, but it's more of an artist album. There's actually, there's one. There's one dance song on this record. Would you say it's more geared towards home listening, or what kind of changes are we talking about here from the drawing board through to natural selection? Yeah, I mean, the drawing board, it did cover a bit of ground. There was some kind of experimental. stuff like robert's cry and um in the mood you know which was that kind of hip-hop thing that sampled swv this one is overall more experimental more kind of broken beat more of like uh more of a down tempo thing it's not banging club stuff really aside from one song like we said i mean we're just saying going into this it was a total mind fuck you know taking into account what all the editors are waiting to tell like shit on the album possibly, you know, and, you know, all our fans that are expecting a certain sound because we're famous for that sound from the first album. But I think once we started writing, it was just back to kind of not giving a shit and back to how we felt originally when we were writing music with nothing to think about, you know, nothing to prove and nothing to lose. And I think we ended up with an honest LP. And I imagine it can't be an easy thing to ignore what, you know, your fans and the media are saying about you. It was a difficult process to, once you got into that studio, to put that out of your mind. For me, it was. Yeah. I mean, I think going in, like knowing that we were renting that space and when we were going back to Toronto, I was kind of tripped out about it. But I mean, once we started writing and I mean, I was spending time in that dark room. You were there a lot. I was there a lot. I was there like 24 hours a day for a month. I don't know, it just kind of evaporated. Because also, at the same time, personally, I haven't had a lot of time to write music in the last few years. So for me, it was like, I think a lot of stuff just coming out, you know, that needed to. So it was just like that kind of overpowered the thoughts. And tell me about how much your lives have changed since the drawing board came out. We're rich, bitch. I mean, a lot. I had never traveled this way before this. So, I mean, number one, when you're living on the road versus living in Toronto for 30 years, you know, it changes quite a bit. You know, everything becomes a lot quicker. Relationships, everything is just fast paced. Everything's quick. That's something that just changes your life drastically. And you're both based in Europe now, is that correct? Yeah, I live around the corner. You walked here. I live in Barcelona. Was that a result of just the success and being sort of based in Europe for more gigs and things like that? Well, most of our gigs were coming when we joined the Rebel Agency, which it was called in the beginning. When we first joined that, it was all, you know, European gigs. The album hit in Europe a lot stronger and faster than it hit in the U.S. or in, you know, in South America. It wasn't even the album, right? It was without you. Just without you. Bam. And Vampire Nightclub. But both of those, when those came out, it was like, bam. And then when the album finally came and they started making tours for us, it was basically based in Europe. So we both were living in London at the beginning with our good friends. Can we tell them about the DJ frat house? It was a flop house, actually. It was actually Jamie's flop house, but it was a good one. This is Jamie Jones. This is Mr. Jamie Jones. Yeah. It was Jamie Jones, Will, who was our agent, our other friend Will, I think Foss. Foss came in after. Who else was in there? Richie came in after. It was like, it was really a flop host. Like we were all kind of crashing there on this like extended European tour. And we literally didn't know where we were sleeping. Like when we get home on a Monday, not like there was much sleep going on, but it was literally like maybe you're on the floor in the studio or in the basement on a couch or wherever. If luckily Jamie or somebody is out of town, it's like we're fighting over the bed. So I can imagine that was an insane amount of fun, but also pretty tiring. Yeah, that's why I took off. He took off and he went to Barcelona and then I stuck out and got another frat house. He's just got a bunch of other crazy DJ roommates. And so we're talking here about 2010, 2011, that's right? Yes. You mentioned without you coming out and basically your first full record is... as art department was a huge club hit. Tell me about how that affected things for you. Well, it brought us where we are now because of that, you know what I mean? Basically in the beginning I would start something he would like take it listen to it add what he had to add and finish it I personally listened to it and I thought it was cool, but thanks to his knowledge and experience He took it to where we're talking about without you know, specifically specifically What did you hear initially in the sort of bare bones of the track and then what did you decide to do to it? originally it was I mean, the vocal was completely finished and bassline and like the crazy high synth comes in later and everything. And I mean, it wasn't like I heard the parts and knew it was some kind of monster tune. But I remember you were on your way to Montreal and I started working on it. I had been in the studio maybe, I don't know, three and a half hours or something with it and put some drums on it and started kind of quickly coming up with an arrangement. I texted Jared, right, who's with you, from My Favorite Robot, and I was like, what did I say? I think we made a monster or something like that. We made a monster. It was just one of those things. Like, I just knew what this thing could do. I mean, I didn't know it was going to do this. But, I mean, the record just caught, and I think it was more of a timing thing than it was just that the record was so fucking amazing. It was like Something new needed to happen. Everybody was ready to hear something new. And there wasn't a whole lot of new at the time. Minimal was just kind of phasing out and people were hungry for something with a lot more music, which is why kind of the Wolf and Lamb sound was really big at the time. That slower musical, more soulful kind of stuff that kind of was influenced by house. It was just really good timing along with, you know, Jamie and Masio and Denise and everybody that was kind of part of that sound. I think it was enough between all of us to kind of really make something happen. And after, you know, you've kind of tinkered with it in the studio, what were the first signs that it was going to catch fire? It was me dancing around my room alone like a wacko, probably. It was basically, it was a big tune before it even got officially released. How did that happen? Here's the story. This is the official story that nobody really knows. But our first gig as art department was in Toronto, a party that I was throwing with Jazz, who's our agent now. And what was the club called? Cobra. We did a rebel rave there. And we had Damien. and Jamie and I can't remember who else, but it was the first time like art department was on a bill, right? And it was for that. I had an after party at my place after as we do. We're just listening to music and playing some of this stuff. Damien had heard about the project from Seth because we'd already done living the life with Seth and we played that at the club. And I remember Damien taking a picture of this moment where he heard these two tracks and he's like, oh, this That happened? Yeah, yeah. I didn't even know. There's a photo of like three of us. Like, and I'm holding up the CD that says Vampire Nightclub on it. Yeah. Oh, no way. I need that. That's amazing. So we went back to my place and we're after partying and Jamie was telling us about the new label that he was starting, which is Hot Creations. Didn't exist at the time. And we're playing some of the music that we're making. And there's 20 people in my house. It was kind of madness. And we played Without You. And Jamie was losing his mind about Without You. I was just like, cool, you know, like, if you like it, take it for the new label. And he's like, really? I'm like, yeah, sure. But we played it for both of them. Let's be real. Well, D was in the room. He was in the room But I think he was in the room. He was in the room. I know he was in the room. I remember he was in the room because he let my cat out, right? He opened the window and my cat jumped out the window. I almost killed him. Remember? I stopped the whole party. So anyways, we gave Jamie the record and he was, I guess, the only person that actually had the song in his possession at that point. And he started playing it out and I guess passed it to Lee Foss and And they were playing it and all of a sudden I was getting emails from like Clive Henry and all these people and like Toll Free and people that I was in touch with asking if they could have this record that they'd never heard because rumors just started circulating about the song. And then I got the email from Damien saying, what's this song without you that I'm hearing about? I was like, oh, it's this record, you know, we gave to Jamie for the new label. And he's like, can I hear it? So I sent it to Damien and right away he's like, that's got to be on the album. Because at that point we had made, actually in the same night at that after party is when we made the album deal with Damien and gave Jamie Without You, which was clearly a conflict of interest. So that was a pretty kind of historic after party, I guess you could say. Yeah. Pretty important. I guess so. Yeah. So I guess, you know, it got around a little bit quite early on that, you know, Jamie wanted this track and Damien wanted this track. And in the end, you know, we had a contract with Damien. So we had to give it to Damien. And Jamie wasn't super pleased about it at the time. But he's a gentleman. But he was cool. Yeah And so that's kind of the story of how the buzz started about Without You. So I guess it was kind of unintentionally a very shrewd marketing campaign to just give it to a couple of high-profile DJs and they broke it. Yes, I had the whole thing planned. Scheming. As you alluded to, the record ended up coming out on Crosstown Rebels. So when did your relationship with Damien start? When did you guys first meet? Ages ago. Ages ago. We brought him down. He was actually playing at Sonic, I guess, at the time. And the club was getting shut down or something, like a big kind of club that was before David Morales owned it, right? It was when it was BOA. Boa, I guess. Okay, so they were confiscating the sound system that night that Damien was supposed to be playing or something. So we snatched him real quick and had him play a Canada Day party for us in Toronto. And that's got to be eight years ago or something. I think longer than that. Longer? I think longer than that, man. Yeah, maybe. But I mean, I picked him up at the airport and hung out Canada Day. Probably a few more days. So were you putting on parties regularly at this point in Toronto? Oh, yeah. We had both been doing parties for ages in Toronto. Is that how you guys first met? No. I mean, I was actually paying to go see him play at clubs before I was even DJing. Way back at like Industry Nightclub and Comfort Zone. A bunch of other shady places. Dark dingy. But we met, I guess, years later. I would say 2000 and shit. I don't know, 2004 maybe. And you were both making music and DJing at this point, 2004? At 2004, I wasn't making music at this point. I was DJing. And he was actually making music. and got me back into making music. The first album I did was because, as a label owner, he was like, yeah, I know you got it in you still. I was making music from before, so he knew what I had done before. He asked me to do an album on his label, which I did, and that was my first introduction back into making music. And Johnny, I've read an interview where you said you had to light a fire under Kenny's ass to get him back into making music. How did you Oh, man, I don't know. I don't know how I did it, actually. Pretty hard to work with, I'll tell you that much. Yeah, he did it. He did it. Yeah, I got him going again somehow. I mean, I think it was more I mean, he was pretty comfortable kind of having had a really successful career with techno and turbo and everything and kind of being the biggest DJ in Toronto for years and years. And by the time I met him, it was kind of like. the career was kind of you know tapering off and you were chilling like at home a lot relaxing and i think it was kind of me coming into the picture and hanging out with this crew that was kind of already a crew in toronto and i hooked up with when i got back from israel that kind of i think just me being around kind of lit a fire under his ass because you know he saw like me coming up the younger box coming up and i don't think i like that too much Yeah, but I mean, when I got him to do the album, that was actually part of the reason that I started Number 19. Like I had been doing some production that I thought was solid enough that, you know, we could get somewhere with it. And I didn't want to rely on, you know, shopping my shit to other labels. I never wanted to like put my future in other people's hands, so to speak. Having a potential album from Kenny was like a reason to start the label. So was that one of the first releases you put out, number 19? Yeah, it was. What was the number? The first release was... Was it number four or five? Yeah, number four, I think. Yeah. Yeah. It was four or five. I don't know. It was one of those. It was one of the first ones. It was the first LP that came on his label. Tell me about what happened from that point where you've asked Kenny to put out an album on your label to where you start The funny thing is, it was like, I guess a couple years even before we ended up moving in together. We started working on tracks together, though. But we weren't really working on music, right? Well, when we worked on Robot Cabaret. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. There was like one song that we worked on like a while ago. And the first one we sent Damien that he said no to. Came out on, do you like how I watch how you dance and you did the long... The creep. The creep. The creep, that's right. There was a couple. It wasn't until, I guess, like even when we were living together, we weren't working together. We had separate studios upstairs and downstairs. We were always playing together. And there was a point basically where... I was doing only label parties now and I wouldn't really play for anybody else. And so anytime we did a party, it was me, it was Kenny, it was Nitin, it was T. Lou, if T. Lou would show up. Unbelievable, that guy. Yeah, it was in-house for a while, but we weren't making music together. The first one would be the remix for Damien, Don't Sleep. Don't Sleep. That's where it all started, really. That is really where it all started. Yeah, the Rizem's T-track. Yes. We'd been partying with Damien for a few days in Toronto years later, I guess, and he went back and hit us up and actually asked me and Kenny to work together. on a song because i guess i don't think it was that he thought there would be magic i think he just didn't want to exclude one of us from giving us a remix so he was like do it together and that was essentially the beginning of that sound of our department were you guys like oh yeah that's a natural thing for us to do and to go and make something together or how did that come together well when we got the parts we made it in johnny's studio It was kind of weird because I hadn't really worked with anybody in the studio before. And I didn't know how it would be like on a real remix thing now. This is like a real deal thing. We're just not making tracks in our studio together, you know. Now we have a project that we have to work on. So it was kind of weird, you know, but it was where we can see what each other's contribution to a song would be or how we would work together on working on a song. In the beginning, I'm not going to lie, it's kind of weird. But then when the songs started to come together, I was like, this is amazing. And I can honestly see myself working with him on music. I didn't know it would be a partnership like the way that it is. And I even had songs that I had made and said, just give it to him. and say, you know, work on it or add something to it or whatever, because I trusted, you know, his mindset and how he makes music. So it was a good relationship. And was it straight off the bat, Kenny, you were sort of providing vocals and a basic kind of foundation of a track, and then Johnny would take it from there? Was that what you were doing straight away? That was more or less the plan. I didn't even know. Like, the first album I started, I did one song that And I didn't really know that I was able to sing again. You know what I mean? I've been smoking, drinking, partying. I'm like, this voice is gone for sure. So when that song came out, I realized that maybe I could start doing a few more songs with vocals on it. And obviously I would give them to him because I know that he can do what he does. So basically from the start, that's how it started. Me doing the vocals and around a little bit of music that I put together so I can actually sing to the tune and then giving it to Johnny. And Johnny, you mentioned you were throwing mostly label parties at this point for Number 19. Was that an opportunity for you to start playing music from your friends around Toronto? the people that were involved with the live? I mean, well, we'd been doing parties for ages and we were pretty specific about the kind of music that we were playing. And I mean, yeah, of course, we're always pushing what we're doing, but it was really, really a niche thing at that time. Like there was literally like, you know, one like-minded crew, it seemed like in North America, like we had the Drew guys in LA doing culprit and like. So we actually became close with them just because it seemed like they were the only other people on that side of the pond that were into the same kind of music that we were. And I mean, I'm sure there was small groups everywhere, but kind of really kind of going out there and bringing proper talent that are like really pushing boundaries to the point where you're kind of losing money when you're doing it, you know? chances are they were not kind. They were really losing some money, but doing it for the love of it. You know what I mean? For the music itself, this is what they believed in. And so those are the kind of people you want to be surrounded by. And so paint a bit of a picture of what Toronto's club scene was like at that time. Still very underground at that time. In the sense, when I say underground, not like... You can just go somewhere and hear good music. You would have to know who's throwing a party or who's throwing an after party. and know it's going to be a party that has maybe about 300 people in it. I mean, we had been doing a party at that time for a few years at a place called Pais and Lilli, which is on College Street in Little Italy, where it's all just kind of bars and small, small lounges. And I mean, it was me, Kenny, Nitin, like our entire crew playing in a bar, like a hookah bar. that held, I don't know what capacities, like 90 people in this place. Like that was our weekly, you know. I also had a, I was running an after hours, like a booze can every Friday night until eight or nine in the morning or whatever, where we would all be playing as well after Pais or whatever it was we were doing. And then one promoter named Carrie Britt, who's a good friend of ours, became the booker for a club called Sonic, which was David Morales' club in Toronto, which was like the equivalent of Stereo kind of in Toronto. Kerry I'd known for a long time and he was really, really forward thinking and all about kind of pushing boundaries and pushing edgier music and really believed in me and Kenny and what we were doing. He was really instrumental in bringing that music kind of, you know, to Toronto. He started giving us like opportunities to showcase the label at Sonic, which is, you know, kind of crazy. And I was a resident at the club. quite often at like five in the morning you know whatever was going on earlier i would end up just like playing the weirdest from 5am on yeah i mean at that time it was hard to find music that i guess we would consider proper music i mean there's a lot of house music still in toronto who's around but i mean really underground really edgy really pushing boundaries. I don't know, it was tough. What capacity are we talking here? Like what sort of crowds were you playing in front of? The Sonic crowd, that would be like 900 to 900 people a week, yeah. And we would do like the odd warehouse party at like 99 Sudbury. We did that Halloween with Trent Moeller. Yes. Which was, that was a big day for... ron also i think an andrew spot we did a fist spot you did a party at his spot yeah still still an underground thing yeah and taking things back to point where without you's come out and you've started working on the drawing board what was that process like and what kind of pressure were you feeling at that point where you've you've put out one no it wasn't wasn't like that because we made the deal for the album before damien even heard without you because it all happened that one night where he kind of missed without you so we made the majority of this album with no pressure, nothing to lose, a lot to gain. And, you know, there was nothing there. There was no bullshit clouding the creative process at all. And what's Damien like to work with in terms of a label boss? He's demanding, but he's not like I had no problems with working with him to tell you the honest truth. It's like Exactly what I thought it would be is what it was. He wanted the music. He wanted the parts He got the music and he got the parts. Actually, did he get the parts? No, we actually decided that we didn't want anything on the album to be remixed. Like that was it. And the mere fact that he went for that, he actually used to sometimes tell us, yeah, the song should be shorter. And Johnny would be like, well, that's a pass then if you don't want it. And you'd be like, okay, no, no, no, I'll take it, I'll take it. He's pretty easygoing. So was it important for you to be able to Yeah, I mean, I've been comfortably disagreeing with Damien for years and years. I mean, Damien's one of my best friends, you know, so I understand how he works. I actually take a lot of cues from him and I really respect how he runs his business. And he really is a visionary. You know, he's not just putting out records. He has a vision. and a really specific kind of aesthetic to everything that he's doing. And I really respect that and I really understand that. And at the same time, I'm kind of the same in some respects. And, you know, I had a vision for our department and we knew what we wanted for our music and how we wanted it perceived. And it's easy to butt heads when two people really, really believe in something, you know? So it's just different perspectives coming together. But, I mean, it worked. And you mentioned having a vision for art department. I'm interested to know how you came about deciding what that vision was. Well, I mean, it was based off the sound, I think, that we created, right? I mean, we knew what the sound was. We kind of knew how it's a total. package you know like being an artist it's show business too you know so you know how you want how you want it to be perceived being a fan of music and a fan of so many artists over the years you kind of know what's cool or what you think is cool anyways you know in terms of like visually what will represent the music and all that and the kind of music that you want to dj in relation to the kind of music you're making you know it's all part of a package and how it's going to be received This seems to have worked amazingly well. I guess to the point where you guys went from being pretty much unknown to incredibly popular, what were the positive and negative aspects? of what you described as a meteoric rise? The negative part would be that, again, the traveling and the touring and the not being able to be in the studio to make the music that made you where you are right now. It's like when I get into my studio now, it's like I lock everything out and I'm in there because that's the only time I have to be in there. It's not like before where we could just sit down and relax and be in our studios and make the music that we want to make. And then the touring, when that comes involved, it's like it just beats you up, a lot of it, you know? When we first started, we were like... 13 dates in 10 days. So it does take a toll of you. Yeah, I mean, it hasn't even slowed down a whole lot. I mean, I'm sitting here right now. I've got like a sprained left wrist, a dislocated right shoulder. My ear didn't work for like a month and a half this year. And they're all kind of DJ related injuries, I guess. I mean, yeah, in a roundabout way. I mean, it beats you up, whether I fell or not. It was in the battle. I'm not in good condition. I mean, looking at the listings for your gigs for the last few years, I mean, there's 130-odd listed in 2011 on RA, 130-plus in 2012, 110 in 2013, and you're sort of up to almost 90 this year. Hence the one year, one shorter, one year. You know, you had a residency at DC10 this summer. Can you tell me about how that went? It was great this year. I mean, we've been there for four years. This was our fourth year. Yeah. That was really cool because, I mean, we were stuck in Toronto just kind of watching videos of DC10 on YouTube and shit like everyone else. You know, it's just like, fuck, kill the be there, never mind play. And our first time in Ibiza was to play DC10 twice in one week, like Tanya's night on the Friday, Circa Local on the Monday. And we played, I guess, how many times that summer? Like we were residents straight away. We played like about six times. Yeah, I mean, we were residents from the first time we landed in Ibiza, which is crazy. How did that come about? Clive Henry. That's right. Clive was really, really like a huge supporter of the music first because we were close with Clive, so he was getting the music first and hearing it before anybody. He was super excited about it and had us do a mix. specifically for the DC10 guys. They were into the mix and Without You had just kind of come out that season and that was it. We were in. And how's your relationship with that club and Ibiza in general developed since, you know, over those four years? Good. We still love, enjoy playing there. The owners are cool. They like us, I think. I think. You can't tell sometimes. Yeah, it's hard. But yeah, for me, I enjoy it. And if you were to talk for our department, yeah, I would say the same. I love playing there. Yeah, I love that club. And the owner, everybody's super cool. The whole staff is really cool. It's a special place. It really is. There's a lot of clubs that are a lot of hype, and then there's the clubs that... It really makes sense. And something happens even playing there. Like it's – I don't want to slip on wood, but it's like – You can do no wrong. Yeah, you just play – like your A game just comes out every time you're there. It does pull the A game out. We're just there for closing this week, and I swear to God, every single person played amazing. Yeah. I'm interested to know because, you know, you're playing at DC10. playing at places like panorama bar or fabric and you're also in the last couple of years being built to play some of the mega like us festivals ultra edc and the like do you find yourself having to change the style of or the way you're playing for these different audiences yeah yeah of course i mean it's not it's not changing the style to something to play an edm fest I mean, the thing is, we only collect music that we like, you know? So, I mean, whether it's harder or softer or houseier or techno, it's still us, you know? It's not like I've got a collection of music or... a folder on my USB stick that's... The garbage folder. Yeah, the shit folder for festivals, you know? Like, it's still, it's all our music. It's what we're playing appropriate. If we're playing for 20,000 people at Lollapalooza, it's not what we're going to do for 400 people in Amsterdam or something, you know? So it's interesting. It's a challenge for us too, you know? Tell me about some of your experiences playing at the bigger US festivals To be very honest, if you're going to ask me if I enjoy the festivals here, the festivals here a little bit more, but I enjoy playing at, you know, we enjoy playing at more smaller venues. Not small, small, but small enough. Like the festivals, in any festival, it's hard to focus. on just one sound or one person. So when I go there, I just know what I have to do. It's an hour and a half set at most. You go, you play an hour and a half of what, you know, more or less the banging stuff. It's different at those EDM festivals. It's like, they're a lot younger for starters. And so a lot of them don't even know really who we are. So when they do, we have to kind of introduce it in a nice way, our sound, but still realize you're playing at an American festival. Yeah, I mean, I think when you say they don't know who we are, I mean, we are playing like our stages with our people. And I think... It's more people know about the hype and they know the name and they know without you maybe then they really know who we are and what we're about, you know? So we're not really venturing out of like what we do at all at any of them. Do you ever get a sense when you play at these festivals that there are some people who maybe stumble across your stage and maybe start listening to your music and are getting converted from? Absolutely. For sure. I get messages from these people all the time. Like if you look at the art department Facebook or we check our messages from time to time, even personal messages. Like, and I mean, we're not on Instagram or Twitter or anything. So, I mean, Facebook is how people reach out to us and we get messages like this all the time. And the first time they heard us was here and that's it. Now they're hooked, you know? Okay, I want to sort of trace things all the way back. Kenny, tell me about your experiences with production and how you got into dance music in Toronto. Well, I used to buy a lot of records. When I first started, this was before I wanted to be a DJ. I used to walk in the record store and just pick up a few records that I liked because at the moment that's all I could afford. So I would pick up a few, go home, listen to them and then go out that night, let's just say on a Saturday night, to a warehouse party, which was basically a warehouse that someone threw a brick through the window, opened the door, and set up a system. So those were going on quite often in Toronto without being busted by the police. So I would go there, and I would hear maybe about 20 minutes of really good music that I liked, and then maybe about 30 that I didn't like. So then I started buying more records and practicing at home to the point where I said, okay, I want to be maybe a DJ. So then I started how he, when he first got into our crew. which was already an established crew. I myself got into an established crew of DJs that were working at the record store. So they finally let me play, which I started playing by myself. And I met two other guys, Jeremy and Mike, and we started a crew called JMK, which ended up, the only way we would play in Toronto is if we threw our own parties. So we had a whole bunch, a whole series of JMK parties. And then finally, they wanted to go do stuff to make real money, real jobs. I continued to want to be a DJ. I hooked up with this guy named Shams who owned a record label called Jinx Records. And I come from a natural singing background, like a choir and stuff like that. So he knew that and was like, I want you to do some vocals for some stuff for me in a real studio. I went to M1. You might know him from labels like Emotive, an old school DJ and producer. He had a studio, brought me into a studio, and we worked on a track called... Pressing On? Pressing On, which had a Nick Holder remix and did really good. Toronto and around the world but basically in Toronto in America from that I went on to do another song called you got a hold on me which was a double EP which had a Ralph Falcon from Merc remix And then after that, I hooked up with someone called Noel Nanton, and we started something called The Junk Hunters, all on Jinx Records. And then from that, I started taking the hiatus of being just a DJ and doing some traveling. And then Tiga from Turbo asked me at one of the WMC's. if I would do the Toronto Turbo Mix Sessions, which was the beginning of me starting to do the tour by myself. So I had to tour the CD. So I did that CD, and then I had a high point of just like DJing, no really making music. And then I met this guy. And that's where his story starts. And yeah, Johnny, would you take me back to how you first started encountering dance music in Toronto? Okay, I was actually a promoter before I was a DJ. I was like kind of young, out of school and into some pretty bad stuff. It was kind of getting heavy to the point where I needed... to, I guess, find something else that would make me money. And I was already partying and I hadn't really discovered like underground, underground. I'm talking when I was 16. Okay, so what type of music are we talking here? We're talking, you know, I was going to clubs with friends who weren't heads, you know, and there was only really one club that was playing like a club. There was warehouse parties, but there was only one club. or two clubs playing real underground house music at that time. That was Industry Nightclub and Exit to Eden. Oh, and there was The Buzz also, right? Yes, that's right. So I was just going to regular clubs with friends who weren't, you know, about the music until I sort of found out about these clubs like Industry and Exit to Eden. I think I just turned 17 maybe. And I had a fake ID that said I was, wasn't even legal. I wasn't 19. I was 18 on my fake ID, but you only had to be 18 to get into. nightclub after 2:00 a.m. because they would stop serving so I would go with my friends and you know when they were done for the night at 2:00 a.m. I was going on solo missions to industry nightclub and these places where I could get in and sit outside and wait for a minute until it's 2 o'clock and then started kind of bringing other friends down to that and I started hooking up with like an older crowd of you know guys that had finished my high school, the same high school that I went to, and they were promoting some nightclubs in Midtown, like around Yonge and Eglinton area, which is like, you know, not quite downtown, but not the suburbs. And I started promoting nightclubs with them because I was, you know, out of school and kind of hustling. And I knew a lot of people in a lot of different areas. So I started promoting these clubs with them and got to a point where I guess I was 18 now and G-Spot opened up and I was pretty heavy into the music now. Like I wasn't looking at being a performer or a DJ or anything like that, but I was really... really obsessed with the music. What kind of artists or labels were you following at this point? I was really, really obsessed with Chicago shit at that time. Like the Derek Carters and Sneaks and J-Dubs and Heather and Green Velvet. That shit was like, that was my bag at the time. You know, I was seeing everybody from like Richie to Tenaglia to... Roger Sanchez. Actually, I was a big fan of Roger at that time. So I was promoting this new club, G-Spot, that just opened. And it was like, On Fire was the hottest club in Toronto. And we had Peter and Tyrone doing the main room, which was like... to me like this thing I was really excited about because they were like industry residents where I kind of found out about this music and we had them playing the main room of this sort of commercial club. Was that your decision to get those guys on board? No, I mean I was pushing for it but it wasn't my decision. It was kind of a big crew of older guys that I was promoting with but I basically I knew so many people in Toronto like I had turning guest lists of 600 people. to these clubs just because I was getting around so much and I'd been out of school for so long. So it was during that time when we were promoting G-Spot that my friend Ian bought turntables and he was living at home. And within a week of him buying turntables, his parents were like, either these things go or you go. So I was like, I'll take this shit off you because I was super into the music. I wasn't thinking I want to be a DJ. I was just like, yeah, whatever. I'll have this shit at home. Got his turntables. And I think one was just a record player, actually. And it was like a Radio Shack mixer and shit. And so, you know, quickly I turned it in for 1200s and a Rain mixer. And, you know, you just start collecting music because you like zone. Just another place I used to go see this guy play and none of us should ever admit that we've been there or played there. Was it not the best club in the world? It actually was the best club in the world for a minute. It was a really good, a cool club with a lot of unsavory characters but really cool. A lot of DJs when they were playing the big gigs would come in and play. at the comfort zone after for an after party. And I mean, it was like a Sunday morning to, you know, Monday morning kind of thing. Like it was as after hours as you get in North America. So I played there and just started collecting. And I mean, I didn't really make a... a real go at it until I kind of got back from, I had actually moved to Israel to make a go at it for a short period of time. I wasn't really going out as much. I was kind of, I'd gone through all the money that I'd been saving up from all the shady shit I was doing and I was in a relationship and. I kind of just bounced to Israel. I was actually sort of forced into it because I was running away from something, but that's a whole other story. Seems like a fairly massive move to make. Yeah, I mean, it was kind of like, I need to get the fuck out of Toronto quick or else I'm... That might be it. So I bounced to Israel. I was like literally like had mix CDs and was like going to clubs and passing them around. I had hooked up with this one guy who owned a club. I think it was. fetish or something I could be wrong but um I got there and I got in with this guy he was like okay cool we're gonna make you a superstar DJ out here and all this shit and the first gig that I had arranged with this guy was the official after party for love parade in Israel which is like a massive massive thing the week or maybe just a couple days before love parade and I was waiting for this one gig to kind of launch my career in Israel and there was a bombing in Haifa out there the same week that that was meant to happen. So Love Parade was canceled and I'd been out there for months and months kind of waiting for this first gig. You know, I'd gone through tons of money, everything I pretty much had left. And that was kind of it. The gig was canceled. I ran out of money, went back to Toronto. And that's kind of when I hooked up with Jazz and Eddie and Kenny and Nitten and the crew. Wow. That's nothing. I wanted to ask about your social experiment parties. Tell me a bit about the idea behind that. There are more and more of these days. I mean, it's not something we pushed or rushed. We got really lucky with this because they've basically been sold out ever since we started. We used to just do them as after parties at festivals, basically. You know, it would be like a side thing at Dempth. Dempth was the first one, wasn't it? Yeah. You know, it just kind of became this thing. It was us and jazz and everybody involved with the label. putting together these parties and it was always just crew, you know, we didn't really have like headliners and none of us were really even that successful at the time. But... I mean, it's kind of standard. You have a record label, you need showcases. But the difference between just a number 19 showcase where it's like, you know, any few guys from the label are playing, this is more of, it's more of an event. Everybody's kind of aware of a more cohesive sound for the night that we're going for. It's got to be three, what we consider to be headlining acts for it to be a social experiment. It's the best way for the listeners to interact with us and get a feel for, you know, what we really do, you know, because there's this distance. between the listener and the people making the music, when it's just, you know, the record comes out, the listener buys it. Whereas, like, you know, you're in the venue, you're experiencing the live energy of the artist, it's a different thing. There's that back and forth, just like any DJ said. But it's an important thing. It's essential for a record label, I think. And you say it needs to have three headliners. Where does that leave you guys in terms of when Actually, we play every single one. There's no social experiment that happens without us there. And we might evolve into that, but I mean, I still feel like it's in its early stages. And like I said, we're not rushing it. So, you know, I feel like it needs that impact there. Will you guys warm up in the night or will you play the peak time slot or how does that work? Or is it all pretty fluid? It's usually pay time. People are there, especially if they see the name on the flyer. They come to see us, you know what I mean? So we can't just, we'd love to start and let everybody else do, you know, what they're supposed to do. But I think, you know, a lot of people that come there come to see us. The brand is really associated with the art department and off the back of the success of the art department as well. And tell me a bit about your live show. Live as in DJing or live-live? Live-live. Live-live, non-existent. It's so different. It existed for a quick second when we were asked to do the Medaville show for BBC. And we came up with a live show for three songs, I guess, and just kind of went back to DJing. And I mean, it's something we've talked about. Did you also play live in Miami once? Well, if we say live, live, we didn't have any gear or anything. We had our music, and I would do vocals. We're talking about the first show, I guess. What are you talking about, at the Electric Pickle? 2010, yeah. Yeah, that was the first show at Get Lost at the Pickle, which kind of launched us as DJs. But I mean, that set was me DJing almost all of our own music, like exclusively most of the stuff we'd written for the album, a few remixes, and Kenny was singing on almost every track. So that was, you know, it was DJing instrumentals with Kenny singing, which isn't exactly a live show. From your action, it doesn't seem like you've got any massive urge to go and put together a more traditional live show. For me personally, I don't know what he's thinking. For art department, I don't know if that's something. We thought about it. We talk about it. We kind of talk about it and get excited about it and then get tired and pick up. It takes a lot. Again, if you're going to do a live show, if I go to see a live show, I want to see a live show. And this is how we think too. If we're going to do a live show, we're going to do it like a live show. And it's going to take a lot of work for us to like. It's a lot of work. I mean, just talking to Jamie about what he went through with the Hot Natured live show. And I mean, I know everybody, including R.A., kind of wasn't super into it. And, you know, there's a lot of I get it. I see what it is. But the amount of work that went into that show and the production that came out of it, to me, I mean, whether you're into the music or not, that was a proper live show. super blown away by that and to think of what goes into that and then to put it on us and in the context of like touring and everything it's just it's it's not realistic for us i guess you guys have also put out some mixed cds i think the most recent was the one that was in collaboration with bpm festival yeah How do you guys go about putting a mix CD together? Do you both sit down and work it out? No, the mix CD is usually, like, I would contribute music. It just makes sense, you know, for probably just one person to do it. I trust his judgment, and I know he's got great music, and I know he's a great mixer. So he'll ask me, just give me a few tracks that you think should be on the CD. And basically he does the mix CDs. It's essentially what we're doing at the moment. It's going to sound a lot like the set that we play last night if we're doing a mix CD tomorrow. We're basically doing it together. And in terms of that BPM series, it's also in collaboration with Number 19 Music. I mean, I'm interested to know where you plan taking the label. sort of years and if you're actually able to devote much time to working with other artists yeah i mean i'm i'm really heavy into the label i'm a control freak and i've had a hard time kind of relinquishing responsibility and letting my staff just kind of do their thing and nitten's a big part of it brone who's also a partner and has moved over from australia now to barcelona is doing a great job helping out, and Mayor Daniel, who's the label manager now. Where I see it going, I mean, there's no endgame. I think after five years, it's in a really good place, and I'm happy with what we've achieved in our back catalogue, which to me, it's all about the catalogue. You want to look at this in 10, 20 years and just be like, wow, this is a collection of amazing music that's going to... stand the test of time and I think we're on our way there. My first man, knew I was a freak Late night, three times a week You wanna take my hand, boy said alright You wanna take my hand, for me to be your man I said alright, all nights on the road Your head up, it's still a girl's, all different times It's true. I couldn't try with a weak body. Okay, that's why.
