Yeah, check this next track out. You got Asterix in space. Watch your bass bins, I'm telling ya. *music* Peace. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Mark Archer. You know him best in disguise, shrouded in a chemical warfare suit and yellow mask with an A painted on it. This was the iconic uniform of his group Alternate. Their infectious hardcore rave sound took the UK by storm in the 90s, landing them in giant warehouse raves and top of the pops alike. Archer has been in the rave scene for over three decades now. And as Holly Dicker found out in this conversation, he has the hilarious anecdotes to show it. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Mark Archer is up next. . So it's the Tuesday after Bangface Weekender 2016. I'd imagine there's a lot of rotten feeling people out there right now, but you're looking very sprightly. I'm trying, yeah. Can you tell me what happened this year? Were you playing twice again? Well, I played... on the Saturday in the Queen Vic. It was the first time I'd done the Queen Vic. So it was, yeah, and you know how hectic that room is. And I was doing a track man set, which is like the more kind of techno stuff that I do. but it was a debut live set, so I've not done it before. So I was a bit nervous, to say the least. I know what the Queen Vic is like, but maybe our listeners won't. It's a bit odd, because it is like a proper pub stuck on the side of a Pontings. And it's completely different to all the other rooms. I mean, you go in the main room and it is, you know, it's a really great venue. The whole of that Ponting site's not glitzy at all. Oh, no. You know, some are like the Butlins and Minehead. He's, you know, very chrome and carpet kind of vibe, whereas this, it's... The main hall is just... a great big hall, but the Queen Vic is like a dingy little pub with a stage at the one end and then a weird kind of dance floor with a balustrade all the way around it. And when it's full in there, it's pretty intense. And it was fantastic because it was an I Love Acid takeover. And so Doubtful Guest was on first, then they had Chevron, then Mark Foreshore. then post-tune and then myself. And was that the only set you played? Then I did, Sunday night, I did the opening set in the main room. Like a DJ set, again, playing Acid. So I did that, was it last year or the year before? Yes, I was there, I remember. And James said it really worked. It warmed the room up nicely. I went in at the start, it was empty, and then by the end of the set, looked around, the place was full. Yeah. Yeah, ready to go. Yeah. It's a really nice set to play, you know, because you can see it filling up, so it's cool. And there was, you know, literally a handful of people in when I started. No one turns up on time for anything today at Bangface. Okay, so for those that probably don't know about Bangface, maybe you can tell us. what it's all about? It's tagged Neo Rave. And what does that mean? God only knows. I think James is the only person who exactly knows what Neo Rave is. But it is possibly the closest thing to an old school rave you're going to get. Not the music necessarily, because what we used to make as Alternate was Clusters Hardcore, but it's certainly not. hardcore in comparison to the rest of the music at Bandface. But it does range from, you know, like Acid and Techno and then what we do, like the old school hardcore thing and then the BPMs tend to rise from there, you know, with Gabba and... I have to say, normally the Queen Vic is sort of Gabba Central, isn't it, for the weekend? Or you've got... And the likes of the Squire of Gothos and their really wonky bassline kind of vibe in there. So, I mean, the acid stuff was pretty calm, really. Undoubtful guest whose stuff is a bit more towards the Gabba Enders scale. And she's sort of been there from the beginning, hasn't she, I think. What was the theme of this year's Bangface Weekender? It was saints or sinners, which was a weird one. I was going to originally go with Santa Claus. But I couldn't put enough weight on for the vibe, so yeah. Did you dress up? No, I didn't. Fail. I normally do. One year I went as Captain Rave Man and no one knew it was me because it was like a full Captain Caveman suit and they've got these massive caveman feet on a big club. And I'd be standing next to people who I'd been hanging around all weekend, banging them on the head. And they had no idea it was me. No idea. I freaked Ed DMX out a bit when I said, it's Mark. Can you... tell me why Bang Face is special? We've illustrated some elements of it. It's just got this really, really friendly vibe about the whole thing. I mean, it's the one festival where, like Nikki one time, she left the main room to go back to one of the chalets. And, you know, it's pitch dark, you don't know anyone, but the amount of people who offered to walk with her to the chalet to make sure she got there okay. It's ridiculous. The vibe in the rooms, it's as close as you're ever going to get to an old-school rave. It's just everyone going for it. You could be on stage playing pots and pans and be going off. But the reason it's really special for me is... There was a time when I wasn't allowed to use the alternate name for a bit and no old school promoter, all the big rave promoters who I used to play for, if it didn't have alternate on the fly, they didn't want to know. So I lost bookings. I mean, it got to the point where eventually I lost my house. So there was only a few people who continued to book me, and James is one of them. It was James and Josh at Isle of Acid, you know, so they really helped because, you know, the booking just completely dropped off. And James consistently, you know, books me every year, which is... It's very special. So what was the first gig that you played as Alternate coming back? Was it at Bangface or was it at Block? We were asked to DJ as Alternate and I'd never... So who's we at this? Well, it was myself and Mark. who was our second MC. Now, he MC'd from about 91 until we stopped doing PAs in the end of 93. But we stayed friends, and we were asked to DJ. And this was, I think, in 99. And I just said, oh, do you fancy DJing with me? So I used to DJ. and he'd DJ alongside or MC. And would you be dressed up with a full...? I did, if I was asked. A lot of time I didn't, you know, because it was a DJ set. And then occasionally people would say, you know, yeah. I mean, it wasn't the best idea I've ever had in my life, wearing a suit. I mean, especially back then when there was no air conditioning. You know, it was absolutely jitters. But, you know, even now, I put it on. Sometimes I can just about manage an hour and then quietly go away and die. Has it experienced sort of some redesigns over the years? Perhaps have more air infiltration? No, see, again, I've not been that clever. Right. I mean, the original suit went into retirement in 2015. So it lasted from 91 through to 2015. And that's when we started to do the new PAs when Josh joined me. So Josh needed a suit. So mine would have looked incredibly tatty compared to his. Probably smelt quite bad. Yeah, yeah. When we first started, because when I first started making music and when we first started Alternate, we never thought it was going to last, you know. We might do one gig and that's it. So we did the gig, put the suits in a bag. we were asked to do another gig, put the suits in. And after about three times, you know, these are going to start walking on stage on their own if you don't bring them in and wash them in soon. So, yeah. But surely it's not washable material. Well, we cut all the charcoal out from the insides of the suits, which a lot of people who've seen us wear suits and go and buy themselves one and then go to a rave wearing it. and it's lined with charcoal. So then they take it off. They're black. Yeah, completely. And it's like, I mean, the charcoal bit is a really thick bit. The green bit's quite thin. So, yeah, we cut all that. I mean it takes hours to create a proper painting. So is this a tip for all you alternate imitations out there? Cut the charcoal out first. Yes, yeah, yeah. We haven't redesigned it at all. I mean the suits are made in, I think the one I got, it's still got a packing slip when you buy them and it was made in 1983. And it's been vacuum packed since then. Wow. Yeah, so. So we've wandered dramatically off course. I think we were talking about your first DJ set. Yeah. Coming back. So we DJed together as myself and Mark. And then someone asked me in 99, would you do a PA? I said, well, I don't know whether you know, but as a group we split up. Well, it was very early 94. And he said, I don't care who's on stage, we just want you to play the music. So I managed to get Mark, who was our second MC, and... one of our original dancers, another mate who used to dance for Bizarre Inc. And then Danny Torres, who I did slow motion with after Alternate, he stood in wearing the other suit. OK. So... And where was that? I was in Nottingham. OK. And again, I thought, you know, it was like, someone's doing an old-school revival gig, that'll be that. But after that, you know, the gigs started coming through as far as, like, DJing. So myself and Mark DJed right through until I think it was about 2011, sometime like that. When did Josh become involved as the sort of honorary second member? That was 2015. OK, so that's quite recent. Yeah, so we did. I mean, I'd been working with Josh since about 2008. when I massaged him on Myspace to say good, because I'd heard about Isle of Acid. I said, you know, I'd love to play Isle of Acid. And then I had a few tunes out on his label, Balkan Vinyl, and we'd done remixes of Frequency and Armageddon that had come out. But the whole come about of us being able to, like... Username was a campaign on Facebook in 2013. We should go back a little bit further and explain what happened in your own words. Right. Originally, we started Alternate in 1990. Yeah. Had some success in 91, 92. It kind of completely died down in 93 and we did a single called Everybody, which was to thank everybody for all the support, all the rest, and kind of go out, you know, rather than flog a dead horse and keep going on with something and it kind of, you know, died down, died down and then just forget about it. Because there was a big kind of backlash against our rave scene at that time. And we wanted to concentrate on the nexus. project that we were doing before Alternate. So that was the plan. So we did the single Everybody. We were still doing a few gigs abroad, but not in the UK. But by that time, after working with Chris for a few years, he was more interested in computers and I was interested in music. We were having musical differences at the time. And we booked into the studio for like two weeks and we didn't get anything done. I was recording stuff with different people and on my own. for one reason or another he wanted to sue me which was you know it's a bit bit strange but that's when you kind of stop working with someone that'll do it so um so that's when just continue doing stuff on my own you know we completely stopped the alternate thing it was like we had a business partnership and everything that was all dissolved in 94. And then I was doing Zen Mantra stuff, DJ Next, and then I started working with Danny Torres with Slow Motion. I'd like to pick up on sort of this whole backlash against rave around sort of 94 can you sort of maybe dig a bit deeper well there's the the i mean a lot of magazines at the time you know when something was new they'd big it up and there was loads of pieces in it when it'd been going a few years and it's like oh it's old hat it's a load of crap blah blah blah they did the whole thing with Liam from The Prodigy. Yeah. He went on the cover of Mixmag. And apparently the story goes, he did a whole photo shoot. He was asked, hold the gun to your head. And, oh, don't worry, it won't be used. And the headline was, did Charlie kill Rave? OK. It's just like, so then, you know, when people who follow certain things, they aren't necessarily mad into it. And then it's like, oh, Rave's dead. Yeah. But surely there's other facts. Oh, there's that. I mean, the criminal justice bill came along, which really, you know, hurt the outdoor raves and, you know, the whole illegal rave scene. And then there was a shift to, like, the super club culture and, you know, handbag and all that lot. The music was also changing. I mean, it was splitting up to, like, techno, happy hardcore and jungle. It's not the kind of thing that suit alternate, you know, we made that particular sound so it was like We didn't want to change the sound and try and follow something, you know we were making a certain sound and it just felt wrong to to do that so Loads of factors while we just decided let's just call it a day In hindsight, looking at it, it's almost... It seems like you pre-empted this whole... Like, you pulled out just at the right time, but I guess it probably wasn't like that. Oh, you know, loads of people said, oh, I bet you wish you'd carried on and, you know, gone a bit rocky and done this and followed the project. But, you know, that's their path. That wasn't what we wanted to do. Yeah. And sort of talking about the Prodigy, was there a sort of rivalry between you two? Was that very much a... A media pitch. Yeah, it was a thing in one of their videos where some geezer was wearing a white suit and dancing like a demented chimp. And it was... Everyone was like, oh, look, they're knocking you. They're like, well, are they, or are they just doing a representation of someone at a rave? So everyone's like, oh, you know, the prodigy's taking a piss. We only ever met them once, and they were very quiet. I can't imagine them being quiet. Yeah. Hardly said a word. You know, it was in Stafford. So it was like a bit of a hometown kind of gig. Yeah. So we got quite a big fan base there. What's the year? That was 1992. OK. So it was, you know, we'd not play because there was nothing in Stafford at all. You know, like no... clubs at the time, no raves or whatever, so when there was one in Stafford, you know, everyone from Stafford went, so. Was this where the famous one in 1991 at Shelley's Club? Right. Now, that's in Stoke, which is like the next town north. OK. Because Stoke did have a scene all the way through, like, Acid House in 88. It had a brilliant scene there. And then just pre to, like, the whole hardcore thing, there's a club called Introspective that I used to go to. So all the way from like '88 onwards I was going to Stoke. Sometime, I think it was in 1990, they started doing this thing at Shelley's Laser Dome. Okay. It was a horrible little club before it turned into what everyone knows it as. They didn't refurbish it or anything. Can you describe what it was like in there? Polished dance floor, loads of carpet around the side that you stuck to. It smells bad. Like a blue, one of those shaped lights that said Shelley's Laser Den. Oh, OK. back on the stage. But it was just then about the music and it was rammed every single week. I mean, it started off more housey and there was a night on the Friday where Sasha played and it was a lot more housey. And then on the Saturday, it was like the more hardcore night. So we used to go, if we weren't doing a PA, we used to go... every week. Just as punters? Yeah, yeah. Chris didn't because he didn't like the music, but me and the two guys who danced for us and the MC. And, you know, there was people there from Scotland, there was people there from London, people from Wales, Sheffield, everywhere. You know, you'd either go to Shelley's... or the Eclipse in Coventry. And we wanted to do some footage for Activate, which was our third release. An infield track, the one before it, had done really well. So we did the track, got an acetate of it cut. played it at the club. It was like the first time it had been played anywhere. Went down really well, so we decided what we'll do is a video shoot at the club. But people used to come out of the club and then stand round the cars, doors open, stereos on, and just dance for... Carry on the party. Or go up to the services on the M6. I had no idea why, I just used to go home, you know, have something to eat and go to sleep. And I had no idea why people are doing it, but if people want to dance, like, outside, why don't we give them, you know, like, something to dance to? So we put a 5K rig on the back of a flatbed truck, got there at five in the afternoon. and parked it up so it'd just look as though, you know, like a truck has pulled into the car park and he's gone to sleep for the night. About 15 minutes before the end of the club finished, we all went outside, waited until everyone came outside and pulled the side of the truck and just did a PA in the car park. Just to get footage. So the video company had been in the club all night, filming, like, actually in the club. So did the club know that you were doing this? Yeah. OK, so it wasn't, like, a covert operation. No-one apparently knew, you know, like, punter-wise, that we were doing it. But allegedly someone had phoned round quite a few places and said something's going to happen at Shelley's. So there was more people outside than there were in the club. We got footage inside the club and then waited for everyone to come out. And there was, like, you know, the film of the whole car park absolutely rammed people dancing on top of each other. cars and then there was this chap called Dominic Green who was like a freelance reporter and he did pieces for BBC Radio Stoke and he went round with a DAT machine and a microphone interviewing people and doing like these little bits to introduce what was going on. Did you do that together? No, we had no idea. He was just doing it. He was one of the people who heard about it. OK. We eventually got his recording and pressed it up on vinyl. Oh, brilliant. Yeah. And there's bits of it, because he was like, they're going mad. And we got him in the studio to re-record those bits and put them on Evaporate. which was the next single. This is the moment they've all been waiting for. That was him just before everyone stood in the car park, doing his little drops. That's amazing, I didn't know that. I've got a massive grin on my face. But we actually asked him to be in the Evaporate video and do the whole bit, and he didn't turn up. That's why we've got a bodlin at the beginning of the video. What's a bodlin? It's like a 90s toy. It's like a really ugly rubber monster. OK. You put your hand in, it's got these little arms at the side and a tail and mad punk hair. Yeah. These eyes move about and stuff. And that was the only thing that we could find that we could, you know, get to someone. He was a bit upset. Well, he should have turned up. Yeah, totally. There are so many great videos, but what's your favourite one? The ones that we've done. That you've made, yeah. Probably the Activate video, to be honest. I mean, there was the footage at... at Shelley's. Then there was the footage outside of the car park and everything. And then we did a shoot afterwards where we were in Trenton Gardens, which is near Stoke-on-Trent. There's a portion in the video where we jump over the camera. And it's like we go from one reality to another. We got a guy on stilts dressed as a robot walking around old buildings while me and Chris are playing the violin part. Now, we got a tape player so we could get everything in time, but the noise that was coming out wasn't nice at all. So we got quite a crowd of people who were just... Just like walking around, you know, like the gardens at Alton Towers, you know, everyone's like just wandering around looking at nice flowers and stuff. And then there's these two blokes wearing chemical warfare suits screeching on violets. I'd like to know where you got the tank from in the... What was it? The Evaporate video. Yeah, that was a funny one, to be honest, because we did the whole scene at the beginning where that was supposed to be a day in the life of Alternate, a very surreal day in the life. So we got a bit where we woke up, go and have breakfast and we're throwing cornflakes. faces because we've got masks on yeah there's crez our dancer like dancing about in the kitchen and then i don't know whose idea it was let's get some tanks of course and that's what you do after breakfast why not and then they spent pretty much the whole budget we didn't make a lot off that single because the the video budget was absolutely ridiculous because we had I think there was the amphibious vehicle that we drove round Stafford and then another two tanks plus all the transporters to get them from where they were based to there. The cost of it all, the drivers, the petrol, everything, it was... Was that the most expensive alternate? Yeah, yeah. We kind of, like, scaled it down a bit for the next one and did it in someone's house. But where did you get the tanks from? There's just a company where you can hire, you know, for, like, war reenactment kind of things. And they'd got, like, a whole row of these tanks. But the amphibious one, someone came out with the idea, right at the end of the video, it goes into water, and they'd film the reservoir without the tank. and then film the reservoir with the tank and mould the two together so we evaporate in air. But we're all stood on the back of this massive chunk of metal as it goes into water and thinking, this thing's not going to float. But luckily it did. OK. How did you get P.P. Arnold from the KLF involved in that track? It was one of Neil's ideas, Neil Rushton, the label boss. I mean, he's one of these people who's very much like Josh, comes up with fantastic ideas, brilliant ideas. for a concept of something and then like the covers and this and we can do this we can do that even being a northern soul dj and he'd already been thinking about the track called shame and and stuff like that and he was digging through like old tunes and we knew that she got a great voice from like that the old tracks that she was doing She'd done, I think it was a single with the Beatmasters a few years previously, like an Acid Housing. So we knew that she was a great voice from back then, but also she was back doing tracks and knew the kind of vibe. So Neil got in contact with her. Got her up to Stafford and I went and picked her up from the train station in a minute. She was expecting something a bit more lavish. I think she wanted a chauffeur all the way from London to Stafford. She wasn't happy at all. But I know she did a fantastic job. Then she came on top of the pops with us. It was at the time, because we kind of suffered with Activate. They just bought this new rule in on Top of the Pops that you had to sing live. So a lot of the rave acts had used vocal samples. So then you had to try and get someone to replicate the vocal sample, which is not easy. I mean, we got... a girl who was in the Activate Radio who was dancing. She was like, I can sing. We heard her sing in the van. Everything was cool, right? We get her on top of the pops. She froze. And is this the point when it's in a live audience, filmed live, basically? If you're Tina Turner and you're not happy with your performance, they'll re-record you later on. Yeah. We weren't happy, but they were like, yeah, that was fine, Sam. And we thought we'd gone in straight at, I think it was number 12 or whatever. I thought, that's it, we're going out. Was that your first time on top of the props? Yes. The video for Infiltrate had been shown on top of the props. It didn't, I think it got to 28, so it was like if we'd have gone in higher, we might have got an actual performance. and then Infiltrate. I mean, Activate went straight in at 12, so it's like, you know, highest new entry. It's mental. After watching it, you know, as a kid, and, you know, I'm going to be on top of the box. It's filmed in the same studios as EastEnders, so, like, the Mitchell brothers were there, and Doc Cotton was... It was mad. Did you meet them? Yeah. Because they're all eating in the canteen and we're just, you know, we were like a bunch of 20-year-old lads sat there just pointing at people. Oh, my God. And then Ricky is Sid Owen. He was into the whole rave thing. So he sat at the back to watch, like... the bands because Rosala was on as well as us that one week and it's recorded as it's shown so they do they do like the whole show in one in one go so they do like the titles they introduce Bang, the cameras go to that one. And while, say if this is the studio, you've got one stage on one side, one stage on another wall, one stage on another wall, another stage on... So everyone that's stood on stage is ready to go. Right. You've got the crowd in front of one stage. And while they're doing the link between that one and that one, everyone moves from the front of that stage. It's not a rammed room. It's just a few people around the front of a stage. Shuffling around in a circle. Yeah, they're all herded round. Get them onto that stage, boom, off they go. So does that mean you're sort of stood there on this plinth waiting nervously until... Yeah, under all the lights with the suit on. No wonder the girl froze. So it got to that bit, she froze, wasn't fantastic. Steve Wright on Radio 1 did a whole skit about rave bands and kept playing a rave mock-up song with a really awful vocal on it. And we thought, you know, we're going to go out, but luckily it went up and then we got a proper singer for our next performance. Yeah, so how many times... Have you been on top of the pop? I think it was fine with Intel with the different tracks that we did and different performances for each track. But the reason we got Pee Pee Arnold, getting back to the original question, was because she was a proper singer. If you get her on the song, you know, she can belt out the song. if we do live performances or whatever, she'll be able to sing it exactly the same, which she did, you know. Didn't the stilt-walking robots join you on one of them? He turned up on that, because Top of the Pops like you to bring something new. Each time if you're gonna do the same performance as you did with the last single it's gonna be two blokes with ponytails like jamming behind the keyboard I've done that before we want something different so every time so the first time there is dancers, a live MC and a singer and me and Chris. And then the second time we bought loads of banners and stuff with us, we'd added like a complete suit change, which there was a very short-lived image change in 92. Okay. It was another not fantastic idea because we wore plastic capes, which made it even hotter. Okay. So we managed to get on the front cover of Mixmag with it, new image, and then after about two weeks we sacked it off because it was just like, oh, it was ridiculous. OK. I was not the cleverest person about it, to be honest. I think there's been lots of wonderful failures throughout. The alternate career. My favourite might have to be the hot air balloon Christmas pudding incident. Yeah. Which never happened but became an article anyway. So what was the idea behind that? The press officer, John McCready, at Network. He came out with loads of, like, mad pranks. Because one time we turned up at Network in my mini and it was on a side road. And me and Chris pulled up outside and everyone saw it was us. So we carried on driving for a bit and then reversed back and then drove forward again. And we did this for like 15 minutes. Isn't that on one of the videos? Yes, there are daft bits in it trying to replicate daft things that we'd done. So John knew that we were a pair of idiots. So he's like... If they're going to be that stupid in real life, let's really go off on things. So he came out with loads of little pranks. I mean, there was tiny bits to keep your name in the newspaper, like we'd invented real disco biscuits for peckish ravers. Mini air horns, because people used to get air horns taken off them going into a rave. So it was like pocket air horns and stuff. And the papers, you know, freely printed all this. And did you sort of actually manufacture these? No, no, it was all totally, totally. There's one story about we had a massive bonfire. with a sacrificial offering of the original dat of frequency so that when it was pressed up, that was it. It was never happening again. I've still got the dat now. There was no bonfire, nothing. But people actually turned up in Stafford wanting to know where the bonfire was. So the Christmas pudding idea was a magazine wanted to do an article. So we pitched this idea at them that what we'll do is get some Christmas puddings and they were titled Brand E Christmas Puddings. And we were going to go up in a hot air balloon, drop Christmas puddings to people in Stafford until someone decided that it'd be a bit of a daft idea because a projectile dropping from a hot air balloon would probably kill someone. And we didn't even get the hot air balloon off the back of the lorry because the weather was too bad. So we got in the basket on the back of the lorry. Cameraman lay on his back and took photos of us in the basket with the clouds behind us. So it looked like we were up in the air. Did the whole magazine article. And then we went round Stafford trying to hand out these Christmas puddings. But if you've ever walked through a town and someone in a chemical warfare suit tries to give you a Christmas pudding, you're not going to take it. They're not having it. So no-one had one. What a shame. Was all of this about courting the media? Whose idea was it? It's courting the media and also giving the group... bit of a larger than life image you know it was like there were so many so many like bands of a certain level in in the rave thing you know sl2 and dream frequency prodigy bizarre inc And everyone, you know, if everyone went on stage and did the same thing, you know, it all got a bit kind of samey. And it was the reason we started with the suits was just to differentiate ourselves between Nexus 21 and Alternate. You know, so we didn't look the same as ourselves when we went on stage. You know, we'd done a Nexus 21 PA at a club. And then a couple of months later, we did Alternate. And he's like... I just thought, we're going to look exactly the same if we don't cover this up. And then it was like, wait a minute, there's this whole thing about faceless technobolics. You know, no one can see your face. And then it got to the point where people, they don't even think that there's someone in the suit. That's alternate. It's the suit itself. There is no person. And naturally, I'm pretty shy. So being able to wear a suit and no one can see you, you can act a complete plonker on stage. And we'd gone from playing live as Nexus 21, everything was coming out, drum machines or whatever. But it was... Then it was us standing there looking down at a keyboard and pressing things and concentrating. And we wanted to put on more of a show. So we kind of like stripped the whole element where you can get things wrong. Got these old keyboards and just karate chopped them while we were. I mean, I got proper bruises and blisters on my fingers and stuff while we were doing it. And at one point there wasn't even a... a plug on the end of the keyboard, you know, it was just... And people used to come up and go, oh, what are those? They've got all the noises in, haven't they? Not even plugged in. But it was, you know, it just makes the riffs bigger by, you know, pronouncing it. kind of thing on stage and it was just gave it more of a show you know with the dancers and then obviously the robot who came on on tour with us and stuff so it sounds like it's always been projected to be a live thing So what about then alternating the studio? What was that like? Was it, again, just sort of very serious? Or were you... There was a young lad who used to work at the studio. And, you know, he'd just been taken. Obviously, you get the crap jobs when you're the young lad. And the engineer used to say, go and make us a cup of tea, would you? No, I'm not making tea. I'm here to learn how to engineer. So we had this hammer called the bringer of the brew that he was threatened with. He didn't actually hit him. But, I mean, one time we pranked him that much. The studio was at the end of this little courtyard, Mews area. and there was, like, hairdressers and little restaurants. So there was loads of ladies going backwards and forwards with the blue rints and things, and we got a studio chair and got all the audio cables out of the studio and tied him to this chair and put him out in the middle of the courtyard while we carried on recording, and he couldn't move, and all these ladies were, like, walking past and going to their cars, pulling up behind him and then back in their horns. And he couldn't move. Tormented. Yeah, honestly, we do, like, really daft things. There was another engineer there. There was, like, this isopropanol alcohol to clean the tape heads. And he just used to get a capful of it and pour it on his laces and set a fire to them so all his laces would go frilled and his shoes would drop off. So it was exactly the same pair of idiots, really. So, but then compare that to Nexus 21, which I guess was the opposite. Yeah, but I mean, because that came earlier. And it was a very kind of serious thing. I guess it was because it was the first thing that me and Chris had done together. You know, it was kind of developing the working relationship. And it was quite set out at the start, to be honest, because I was crap at playing keyboards. I did most of the engineering. and taking records in and stuff. I want to play something like that and then Chris would just jam on a keyboard until he'd do something that was kind of on the right lines and then maybe change that bit or whatever and then we'd get somewhere. So I'd do all the drums and everything. It was very set out. But by the time we were doing the alternate thing, I'd kind of taken over quite a bit of what was going on. And we were just dicking about in the studio. I mean, the name itself, Alternate, is actually a typo. Yes. Correct. A complete typo, yeah. We were doing tracks in Blue Chip Studios, which was in Stafford, which is where I first started recording in about 88. And by the end of 89, as a commercial venture, it had ceased trading. So it was locked, it was closed up. And the record label that we were signed to went bump. It was that point, you know, that could have been the end of my career. And then I bumped into Neil Rushton in a little club near Cannock. And he was like, oh, we've got your album in the office. why didn't you come over and we got signed to to network records and we didn't get paid from the first studio at all we were allegedly given studio time in you know as payment but he's like You're given studio time to make records for you to sell and make money, and we wouldn't get in a penny at all. So we said, like, you owe us some money. So the chap was like, I'll give you the keys to the studio. You're not supposed to be in there, but you can have a couple of weeks in there. We went in and recorded, I think it was about nine tracks. played them to network, and they're like, Nexus 21 is this. It's like Detroit techno. And these have gotten more ravey influences. You can tell it's made by the same people, but it's not Nexus 21. And Chris said, well, I used to be in a band at school called Alienate. Let's call ourselves that. And that was that. until we turned back up at the office where they'd got finished copies. It didn't even go out as a DJ promo. Because there was eight tracks on it, they thought, because of the value-money side of things, there's no point promoing it and everything. Let's just go with eight tracks. Everyone will buy it because there's eight on there. And he said, alternate on these big stickers. And we're like, Neil, this is wrong. It's a bit late now. That kind of saved the day for later on with the whole who owns the name bit. Why? Because then... Because Chris didn't think of it. It was the record label and they were cool with me using it later on, so it's off you go. So you sort of mentioned it a bit earlier, but the saving grace of you reclaiming the name was a Facebook post, right? How did that happen? It was... I sat up in bed one morning and Nicky says to me, have you seen this on Facebook? It's a campaign to get Activate back in the charts, which was in 2013. And there was like, I think 60 likes on it. Very flattering that someone's done that. It's like, of all the tunes to try and get back in the charts, why would you do that? So Nicky posted it up on her Facebook. I posted it on my Facebook. By the end of the weekend, it got like 5,000 likes, and it just kept growing and growing and growing. And it was like, maybe this could be a serious thing. Spoke to the bloke who'd started the campaign, and he had no idea... It was just an idea. He didn't know he was going to do what he did. In a way, he's changed the history of the band completely. I mean, there's remixes of that song that are about that wouldn't have been about because of him. But there's certain rules to get tracks in the charts and it's got to be on iTunes and there's got to be single versions and stuff. So we had to speak to the record label to see whether they would get it up onto iTunes for us and get everything put in place. And they were like... We've got a matter of weeks to do it. They're like, well, are you going to do some remixes? So I had to call in loads of favours, get people to do loads of remixes for it. Like who? Rocket Pimp, who did a dubstep mix. There was Tommy Sunshine and Ghost Effects from America. They did quite a VDM-y kind of mix. There was King Euphon's... Bunta, who did a mix. AGT Rave Crew did a mix. And we got a Deep House mix by Lucius Project. Shadow Dancer did an Acid House mix. DJ Fantasy did a drum bass mix. So it was a whole race of mixes, just trying to cover all bases, just to help out. you know, its chances of getting in the charts. Normally radio don't support, they didn't support the rave scene back then because they weren't breaking the songs at all. You know, it was like, these songs are going straight in the charts and we haven't played it at all. So they didn't. The only person who used to play any of our stuff was Mark Goodyear in an evening, you know. The only other time it was played was on the chart rundown. So again, they completely dismissed the attempt and didn't get radio play. And their single of the week, which they won away, went in the charts lower than we did. So that was nice. But what about reclaiming the name? Obviously, I've been in meetings with the record label to sort this out. I said about the whole thing. with the name and they were like, well, you two didn't think up the name. No-one can own it more than the other. No-one can claim ownership and you can't use it. You know, it's like the record label thought the name and they said, well, if you want to use it, go ahead, they've not got any problems. Because of the typo. So, cha-ching! It was nice because, you know, people were always asking, because I was DJing, you know, all the way through the 2000s, what about live set? I said, well, I can do a DJ set where I'm playing all alternate stuff and, you know, the original, well, the second MC and the dancers and stuff, but it can't be a live set. as it were. Right. You know, so I did a few of those at Bangface, you know, where I'd do, like, so many alternate tunes and do a DJ set and we'd have the dancers and everything. Being able to actually do, you know, like, a proper live set. I mean, we did the first one in 2015 at Bangface and I'd never, never touched Ableton before that night. So, yeah, it was a bit nerve-wracking. So, Josh had done it so many times as AGT, Rave Crew and Postium, and he knew it like the back of his hand. We'd prepared this set and then it was like, I'm on stage, I'm bringing things in and out. By the sounds of it, you know, that's sort of what you've always been doing. Chaotic, yeah. It didn't really matter. As someone who was in the crowd, it looked like... We knew what we were doing. It looked like how it should be. I know, it was brilliant. I mean, how things go down at Van Cleef. Yeah, it was fantastic. You know, James then asked us... to do it the year after, which is when me and Nicky got married. Yes. At Bangface, yeah. So, yes, you had a Bangface wedding. Right. Can you... elaborate what that means what that could possibly mean well we properly got married in southport on the day and then the registrar said you can't get anywhere nice yeah we're going to ponting yes straight over to to bang face and bang face have an opening ceremony on friday night where it's like everyone goes to the opening ceremony and then the closing one on sunday night It's the ritual of Bang Faces. And it's, you know, they have, like, really daft things going off. And they get, like, occasionally they have, like, guest presenters like that. Dave Benson Phillips, who used to be on Kids TV, with a big gunge tank and stuff. I mean, they've had Tim Westwood before now. At the closing ceremony, they've had people like Chas and Dave. Yeah. It's like... It's just totally bonkers. James suspended on wires for the Superman. Saint acid, yeah. So James was like, how do you fancy doing a rave wedding? James goes all out on the ideas. So he, as Saint Acid, did the whole wedding, conducted it. We had to have two people ordained into the rave so they could be our witnesses. And they asked two people in the crowd. Obviously, you didn't hear a word that James was saying. So they had to go backstage, sign a disclaimer, and then were whisked off to a massive dunk tank. Oh, no. Sat on a chair, and even when they were sat on the chair, they didn't realize they were going to be dropped into this big dunk tank. which originally they wanted to put in the middle of the floor. But when it was filled with water, it would have caved the floor in. So they had to put it at the side on the concrete. So again, it was very chaotic, you know, the health and safety aspect of it. So we got these two people ordained into the rave and they came up on stage absolutely soaking wet. Oh, so the dunking is the... ordained yeah right okay like you know the whole rave baptism thing right and then bosh they were on stage they'd rewritten some hymns give me joy in my heart keep me raving Words on big screens at the side said the whole crowd could join in. They'd got a girl on stage singing it so everyone could sing along. And then from the wedding, we went straight into a live PA. So mine and Nicky's first dance was Evaporate. Brilliant. So we smooched around the stage in front of thousands of people while Evaporate was playing. That sounds wonderful. So it's, yeah. But it's nice because so many people have said, like, thank you so much for letting us enjoy your wedding. And you see thousands of people there going absolutely bonkers. Nikki got a trusty inflatable bouquet of flowers. Because, you know, the inflatable was given out at Bankface at the throne and everywhere. So it was, yeah, it was fantastic. How much choice in the matter? Or, you know, how does she feel about sort of being wedded at a rave? She's slightly more bonkers than me. Oh, OK. So she's... I mean, she wore a mask for the whole... But hers has got Mrs A in it. So, yeah, it was cool. You know, she absolutely loved it. I wanted to ask about Martin Cresswell, also known as Cress, the dancer. Yeah. Member of the team probably since the beginning. So where did you meet him or find him and why did he become involved? Back in the breakdancing days, I knew a lad... Parksey from Stafford. He was like 15 or whatever when I met him. And used to hang around with him through like the acid house. And then I got kicked out of Bizarre Inc by the other member because I started Bizarre Inc. And so there was the two of us, me and Dean, and then I got kicked out. How did you get kicked out? He decided he wanted to go solo, but rather than tell me, he just got me sacked from my job, which is really nice. I stopped hanging around with them for a bit, went my own way, went to different nights and stuff like that. And then one night at Shelley's, I saw Parksey. I was like, no way, what are you doing here? And it was at that time that our first dancer, another mate called John, he'd been taking time off from uni in Sheffield to come and do gigs. And he was like, look, I'm going through my exams now. I can't take any more time off. I need to concentrate. I'm going to have to give up the dancing. Then I see John, who I knew was a great breakdancer. So it's like, you know, obviously he should be able to dance. Would you dance for us? She's like, yeah, yeah, Sam. As long as my mate can. Who's your mate? It's Krez. So I had no idea whether Krez could dance or not. But... He turned into like this legend in his own lunchtime while we were on stage. John had come out and do all his body popping and break dancing and all the rest. And Krez had come on and just point at people. and intimidate him into dancing. And, you know, he was the one that everyone knew. I mean, he danced with us from, like, 91 through to about 93 when we stopped doing the PAs. And then when that first one came back, I rang him straight up. You know, I was the best man at his wedding. So, you know, we kept in contact and stuff. And it was weird because we did this gig in 1999 and we'd not done one since 1993. And it was like we'd done one the year before. It was just as chaotic. It was a shambles at the rave, you know, trying to get stuff on and all the rest. While we were on stage, it was literally like we'd played one the week before, you know, it was exactly the same kind of thing. So it was, you know, then I started doing... we did the first Bang Face in 2008 where I was doing like the DJ set of just alternate tunes and that was and Krez was dancing with us that was at the Weekender wasn't it yeah the first Weekender in Canberra Sands Canberra Sands and we did 2009 again so that's when we started doing you know quite a few of these what are called extended DJ sets. Because you weren't technically allowed to do the PA. So Quez was sort of like your Bez. Yeah, our Keith Flint. Yes. He was just... I mean, he's a big bloke anyway, but he's just a larger-than-life character. You know, people used to love it when he'd stand at the front and just point at them. You know, he didn't have to do any fancy moves or anything. You know, and he's like... The one thing about the whole wearing the suit thing, like, back in the day when we used to do PAs, we'd all go off. come back on to get the gear, everyone in the crowd had recognised the MC and the two dancers. It was them two. And that must be the janitor getting the keyboards up. So no-one knew who we were. Kind of what you wanted, wasn't it? Yeah. Even though it was your thing. So they got recognised. As soon as we'd finished, everyone was out in the crowd again, apart from Chris. So we were all, like, out there, you know, raving. And, you know, everyone recognised Chris. So he was, like, he was one of the things that people knew about Alternate. I don't really want to know about all the raves that went right. I think I'd like to know if there was any ones that went horribly wrong. Coming on after Chesney Hawks at an Oxford Ball, that was a bit... OK. This was probably in the mid-2000s, one of the old ones. I mean, they were all the old ones. The worst that would go wrong was the music would start playing and you weren't on stage. Because then everyone would know that you're not playing. You'd all run on with your keyboards and run. But I think everyone was, you know, that after Ed didn't even know whether anyone was on stage or not half the time. But this one, it was like an Oxford ball. Why on earth we were booked? And it got to the point where... Everyone was that bladded, people walking about and stuff. We were just walking around the stage, swapping from one keyboard to the other, got the girlfriends on stage, everyone was having a good laugh, throwing food about. It was just one of the worst gigs ever. OK. That sounds all right. Yeah, more chaotic than usual. Right. But it was just, you know, it was just one of those, the wrong place. Yeah. Can you tell me about touring Brazil with Moby? I mean, that was being shy again. And Moby had got, like, such a big name and stuff. So it was the first time we'd ever been to Brazil. And they weren't expecting as many people to be into the whole rave thing that turned up to the gigs. So they got these massive warehouses in the middle of nowhere, cordoned off a small section for the crowd and put the stage and everything. And then they had to open it up because there was that many people outside. sponsored by cigarette companies. So everyone was given a little sock hat, which was a thing at the time. just like a tube of material that's tied at one end. Everyone in the crowd wore a hat. So it was a bit weird. It was like playing live at a Smurfs convention. OK. Going round with Moby, see? Got like this kind of, you know, everyone knew about him. But he was really quiet and really shy. He was like, oh, my God, it's alternate. Didn't know about that until the book, when he did an interview for the book. So we thought he was just, you know, didn't give a flyer about us at all. Because they were the first ever raves in Brazil. You know, they've gone down, like, in rave history over there. And they were really, really big gigs. Thousands of people there. And Mark Kamins, one of the blokes who discovered Madonna, he was DJing there. Brazilian DJs, because there's so many DJs, like bedroom DJs or whatever, and then there's the ones that are making it in the scene. So they were the biggest DJs at the time in Brazil. And Moby had bought his... So there were fantastic gigs and then going on, travelling through Brazil with this massive entourage of people. Did the Brazilians sort of get it? Because I always think that Alternate was quite quintessentially British with all the humour and everything, but I suppose on stage, you know, as a spectacle... Well, the records had apparently... Records weren't getting out to Brazil for quite a while, so they got everything from 88, 89, 90, 91 all in one go. So the music out there is played... Like, where you wouldn't play something from 88 and 92 in the rave scene, you know, that was, you know, something you'd played at your house or whatever, but it didn't get played. It was all, like, the newer music. They were playing across the board. So everything was going on. So some of the records had got there already and we got to the point where there's two bootleg albums in Brazil, the best of alternate, where someone's got all the singles and just put them in different orders and made two albums. You go over there and people get you to sign them. It's like, actually, it's not real. I haven't even got one of these. And the bloke who even made them, I met him last time I went to Brazil. Who made the bootlegs? Yeah. And he's like really proud of it. Yeah. I didn't get one. He didn't say sorry or anything. But it's, you know, it's nice because without things like that, the music probably wouldn't have got, because they were imported over there. They were quite rare. So they managed to get them. be able to produce them themselves and make it what it was. So people knew us over there, which is cool. Yeah, really cool. So last year was the 25-year anniversary of full-on Mask of Syria. How did you decide to celebrate the anniversary? After speaking to the record label. they said that they wanted to do a re-release of the album, remaster the tracks and possibly use some of the remixes, different versions, because I'd done a complete remake. of Armageddon and Frequency. So it's like I'd done a cover version of my own song but not sampled my song. So it was a complete cover version so I could put it out under my own name. But we used the remixes of those for the album. And Josh got... really behind it and with these lavish ideas we went for a triple pack album with a gatefold sleeve loads of old photos of old flyers and photos that we'd taken at gigs and everything so it's a bit of a you know a kind of a collector's piece which was nice Was it always going to be involved with Vulcan vinyl? Neil Rushton has moved on to a different label now. But he still owns the rights to the songs. It was with a lot of help from Josh doing the remastering and the artwork. But it came out on a record label called Bleach. but it still had the network logos and everything like that. But it's just, you know, Josh has just got, like Neil's, had so many fantastic ideas and he's changed the album cover to black rather than do it like the original gold. So the mask really stands out. Even though it's not the original mask, it was a newer one. OK. Of a very similar size. Because the original one, that was my very, very first mask that I wore on stage. And it managed about six months' worth of PAs. And then someone sat on it. So if you look closely at the mask on the original album, there's like a crack that comes down the nose and down the front because they're hard, the masks are, because you have to paint them loads. More tips. OK. And it cracked some of the paint off. So I had to make myself a new mask. And they were like, have you got a mask that you can send a photographer? Because it was originally for a photo shoot for the Evaporate promo campaign. And so I sent them my first mask that had been sat on. And that's the one that's immortalised on the album, you know, and it's become like... so I'm just with the whole alternate thing. But we hadn't got any, because loads of people say, have you got any high res images from like back then? It's like, there was no such thing, you know. So we've got no decent images of that mask. So we had to get a fairly similar mask. And so if you look at them together... OK. That's for the hardcore fans out there who are going to compare the masks. And there's plenty of hardcore geeky fans out there. Yeah, I can imagine. There are lots of, like, weird fan bases. And do you get, like, back in the day, fan mail, perhaps? Yes, we got fan mail and record label set up. PO Box 202, people to write to, and they did merchandise and stuff like that. And we used to get really weird letters. I mean, there was someone who wrote from LA, and so the gig we did out there completely changed their life. We thought it didn't go down very well, but it was because everyone had not seen anything like it before. Everyone stood there and stared at us. Plus the fact there was a robot going through the crowd, which freaked a lot of people out. Yeah, so I didn't think we'd gone down fantastic, but, yeah, it was a good gig. I mean, we've played in LA quite a few times. because of those gigs back then. Similarly with Brazil, because we'd made a certain impression back in '93, we'd go back every now and again. - So what is it like still performing as this thing that was created almost as a joke that you never thought would ever... Everlast. Yeah. And yet here you are still. When we first started making music, you make it because it's, you know, I'd really like to try doing this kind of music, like acid acid or whatever. And you do something that you like. Anyone likes it. It's a complete bonus. So for us to have the success that we did in the 90s, it's fantastic, more than you could have dreamed of. But if you think back in the late 80s, if you picked something from 25 years previous, you'd never be able to play that at a rave. So for us to be able to play 25 years later at things... and still be sort of relevant, you know, to what's going on. You know, you'd never have ever imagined it back in then. So it's just massively flattering. Do you feel less or more connected to the crowd now than before? Have you ever really been very conscious of it? I mean, he's... The weird thing is, from up there, it looks as though it goes down completely differently than you are down there. I mean, a lot of the time back then, people didn't know we were on stage or the stage management was that bad. They got lights at the front of the stage blaring out, so when you were out there, you couldn't tell. Whether it started. Yeah. There was people walking in front of us while we're playing stuff. Now it's slightly better. Nowadays, the difference is you go to a rave back then and people knew. It was like we were about that time. Dream Frequency were about that time. SL2, Liquid, all them. Now it's like there's people going to things now and they've never heard of Alternate. It's a completely new kind of music to them. You know, you get people coming up and saying, I didn't know about you last week. Someone played a track and I've gone through YouTube and I can't believe I've never heard this before. You know, people are getting into it now, 25 years on. It's mental. So it's almost like a reset and you're starting again. Yeah. What do you think about being a nostalgia act? A lot of people, when you say nostalgia, it's like... I'll wheel them out another time kind of thing, you know. Whereas I think I'd get booked at, like, a lot of techno things and house nights and things, acid or whatever. I mean, you know, with the acid thing being back now. It kind of flows a bit better, but a lot of people book you when you're like an influence to what they're doing now. So they know that what you're playing will go down and people will get it. So it's not like people have in the past, I mean, there was all like late 2000s kind of backlash. about the whole thing and people like saying, oh, the 90s were crap, blah, blah, blah. And now people are looking back at that whole era and being like, actually, you know, it's had a massive influence on what people are doing and still doing now, you know, and what people are doing now wouldn't be the same. It's more of a look back at where... now came from, kind of thing, rather than just like, you know, let's wheel out these clowns. Even though we are a bunch of clowns. And I just wanted to end on your autobiography. Why did you decide that now was the time to sort of get the memoirs out? What triggered it? I've been asked quite a few times, to be honest, but never had the confidence that what I've got to say anyone would be that interested in. You know, it's just me talking and just Mark from Stafford, you know, have always said all the time, people come, oh, man, you're a legend. I'm Mark from Stafford. I made a tune and people liked it, and that's it. It's a complete bonus that people liked what we did. So I've been asked a few times, I mean, even Derek May said, you need to write a book. But Bunter did his book, and he put so much work in, like completely from scratch, set his own publishing company up, got the printing in place. everything like that. And I did an interview for his book. And he said, you know, of all the people who'd done bits... mine was one of the really interesting bits. Would I mind doing a book? And it was because he'd got everything in place with the writer and everything, it was like, you know, I wouldn't have known where to start. I wouldn't have the confidence to go to someone and say, I want to do a book, how do I go about it? So it was kind of like put there for me. And even when we were doing the book, after I'd done all the interviews and everything, it was, do people still want to read this? But it's done really well, so... So was it sort of... therapeutic or what was the process like for you doing this? It was Andrew Woods who wrote the book. He'd phone up like every day for a few hours. Just ask one question and let you ramble. And I'd go off on like... super mental, like I've done today. And then he's, difficult job he's got to do is then try and put them in the right order, which was an absolute nightmare because I couldn't even remember some of the, you know, I'd have to ask friends, did we go to Germany once or twice? But it made me think about how important certain little bits are. Say for instance, my girlfriend at the time bought me a box set of records. Without that box set, Nexus 21 wouldn't have happened. Because I listened through a load of this techno on there, decided I wanted to do a techno record, sampling a particular tune, and that's how the project started. So if I hadn't have bought that box set, it wouldn't have happened. And without Nexus 21... we wouldn't have done alternates. So that box set is really, really important. So it just made you think about things a bit more. Thank you. you
