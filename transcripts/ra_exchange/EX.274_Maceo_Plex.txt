♪♪ ♪♪ Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Carlos Hawthorne and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Maceo Plex. Miami-born Eric Estornel is a man of many guises, Eric Entity, Mario Ito, Matrix, but it's his globe-trotting DJ and hit machine Maceo Plex that he's made his name. What a lot of people don't know, though, is that Plex is a relatively recent development in Estornel's career, which dates back to the early 90s and spans electro, minimal, and experimental. I sat down with Estonel during one of his many trips to Ibiza this summer to chart his winding trajectory from bedroom techno nerd to becoming one of dance music's biggest stars. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. An exchange with Maceoplex, up next. Thank you. So we're about a month into what I imagine is another hectic summer for you. You've just come back from Sonar. How was it? It was good. It was interesting. It was probably the first Sonar that was pretty relaxed for me because I live in Barcelona. So it was just a matter of doing the family thing and then going at night to play and coming home. It wasn't like past year of which, you know. The days kind of run all together and you know with all these after parties and then you just end up going to the next gig and next gig. It was nice. It was like a vacation, you know, from gigs. How's it working out for you living in Barcelona? I love it. It's a beautiful city. It's got everything I need and some really good record stores too, really good restaurants, really great airport, really close to Ibiza, sunny all the time. It's got everything I want. And you recently became a father as well. Yeah. How is it balancing? Yeah, Solar is his name. He was born in January. I didn't expect what came. It was just kind of like, you know, the moment that your first baby is born. I'm a stepfather. My wife has another daughter and she's pretty much my daughter. But, you know, when whenever one of your own is born, it's like things have to change, even if they don't change right away. You know that something's going to have to change. You're probably going to have to. sort your priorities a little bit and you know do things the right way you know what I mean how's it been balancing touring it's been easy I mean we take them pretty much to half the gigs and we have a really good friend that's a nanny, Manny. He's a guy. He's a Manny. And so, you know, we'll go somewhere and when it's time to go play, he'll stay with the baby and my wife and I will go play. She'll come, you know, and just kind of like my tour manager kind of. And then we go home. We go back to the hotel. It's pretty easy. I mean, not everybody's in my – a lot of people have babies. They can't travel the world and do gigs and do it so easily. Luckily, I'm in a position where I can actually bring the baby with us and bring my wife as well, kind of bring the family. It's coming at a good point in your career. Right. It's like the right time. I want to take it back. You were born in Miami to Cuban parents. Did you have a very Latin upbringing? Yeah, for sure. Like, for instance, food-wise, I didn't discover, you know, half the foods I eat now until I was in my teens because I just ate, like, really greasy Cuban food up until my teenage. years so I hadn't even tried sushi or like really fresh stuff or healthy things I was and I wasn't even fat but you know it was it was funny it was like that's how Latin my family was Latin music all time Latin food we went everywhere was really Latin but they speak really good English they have both my parents had really good careers but yeah it was pretty Latin upbringing yeah and you and your brother were part of a dance troupe Is that right? Yeah. We used to call ourselves Two Tone. And then we were in like, you know, because when I got into music, well, we were put in dance class at a early age. I got into it when I was, I guess, I don't know, six or seven years old. And my little sister as well, my brother, I got into it because the girl was really cute. And I was a little kid, and I thought these girls that were like teenage girls, my brother's friends, maybe I was more like I thought they were really kind of like, wow, there's girls. So I got into it. And it was good. It was a really good learning experience. It's kind of how I discovered dance music. Yeah, we toured and did shows in this dance group, really cheesy, like late 80s dance group with the baggy hammer pants and all that. it was hilarious it was good your brother went on to become quite successful yeah and then he he went on to become a professional dancer and actually dance for everyone from J.Lo to Michael Jackson to Britney Spears um insane coming to everybody so in the late 90s yeah and you moved to dallas right at the start of the 90s i mean what were your earliest experiences of dance music well it was pretty easy my brother was already into dance music and he would i was experimenting with uh this sound recorder program it just it was literally called sound recorder in windows 3.1 i think it was And he would have me, he would give me some music to like edit together for warming up at dance class. Cause you know, you would just. put on whatever dance music you had and warm it up i mean you know i grew up listening to miami bass and electro uh as well as like the latin bass stuff and all that so it was it was natural progression for me i really liked it and i was doing this um for dance class and then i guess somehow i discovered actual techno just turning on this radio show called the edge club I came on Saturday nights, became obsessed with it. It was regular acts from Detroit, like Juan Atkins and other people like that that were coming down, Hotton, other people like that that were coming down and playing. And it was really quick. It just took like maybe a year or two. And I went from really bad rave music to really good techno music. And I was really young. I was like 14, 15 years old. So were you an active part? Did you become an active part of the scene? Probably not until the past few years. I wasn't that social. I was pretty introverted. You know, I had friends that were really extroverted and they would get me to sneak out of the house and go to raves in the early 90s and listen to my favorite DJs and all that. And that's how I started DJing. But I was so into just staying at home and learning because I eventually got a couple of really bad record players, a really bad Radio Shack mixer. This was, I guess, 93. And, you know, I was 16 years old and discovering the music. And I just didn't I didn't care about the drug scene or like getting with girls or anything like that. Basically, I wasn't a part of the rave scene at all. I went through the 90s, you know, hanging out with pride. And I eventually worked at record stores. Hanging out with really, really nerdy techno kids and not really going out very much. It's kind of awkward. So you came at dance music much more from the kind of producer, DJ angle bedroom rather than as a clubber. Yeah. I never was really a raver or a clubber. I mean, I went to parties, but I think there was only maybe two or three parties in the 90s, the early 90s, that I went to to dance. The rest of the time was literally to see just my favorite DJs and hear what they were playing. see how they were doing it as well as live acts and then going to the record store and asking for all the music that they were playing. And, um, you know, that was it. I never was a club or a dancer or a promoter or anything like that. Before you were Macy Plex, you had a couple of notable aliases, Matrix and Mario Ito. Before we get into them, I want to just kind of establish how you make sense of the differences between them. I don't anymore. I don't anymore, basically. Like the album that I'm working on now is just everything rolled into one. But I used to try. But some people are really good at being disciplined on what sound needs to have. what name or whatever, whatever name they're using. And I was trying really bad to do that, but I can't go into the studio and say, I'm going to write a house record or I can't write a techno record and be like, okay, you know what? I need to do this metric remix. It's going to be techno, you know, or whatever, or I can't. you know i experiment around with electro and experimental i can't just like keep you know neatly designating it for any certain name that i'm using so it's all blended together in the past like year or two so you know You've been incredibly prolific as a producer across all those different aliases. I mean, are you someone who making music comes easily? Well, yeah, it comes easily. It's not always good, obviously, but I mean, it comes, you know, I mean, I don't know how to do anything else. I don't know how to, I don't even play sports well. I don't fish. I don't go camping. I don't. I don't know how to do literally anything. It's kind of depressing. But I mean, I don't even know how to fix anything around the house. The only thing I know how to do is just play around with programs and synths. You're good at having the ideas in your brain and getting them. Into the machines. I eventually became good at that, yeah. I mean, it was many years trying. So you were putting out quite a lot of records in the early 2000s. I mean, did you manage to kind of build a small career off Matrix? Right, I did, yeah. I had a little career and I was doing okay. I was broke all the time, but at least I was doing what I wanted to do. I couldn't necessarily go have a nice place or have a car and all this stuff. I still had to work at a normal job, but it was good. It was like that from 1999, 1998, 1999 to 2010. That was fine. I guess there was a point where... When I moved to Europe, then I realized I could probably make dance records better. I was touring Europe a little bit as Metric or as Mighty Lito, but they were way too complicated for most of the dance listeners. The tracks were super glitchy or they were just all over the place. It didn't make any sense on the dance floor. My live didn't make any sense. I was able to kind of strip it down and realize what works on dance floor or not. And that's when I started the Maceo project. Was there space for what you were doing as Matrix and Marilito in Dallas? Yeah, yeah. In Dallas, we had our little electro night. Not Metric that much. I didn't play as Metric very often just because it's a very house town. Like it's always been a very housey town. But there was, you know, and I never really made house that much, especially in the 90s and in 2000s. It was just me hanging out with basically electro guys. And ordering records, I worked at a record store from the late 90s through about 2006, ordering all the vinyl that came in of techno and electro. So we were doing that. And I had my little crew, and we would just do our nights for about 15 people. We would literally get about 15, 20 people up until 2008. It wasn't that long ago for most of my career. And we would just play whatever records were coming in. And it was like a crew of us that some of them had success, like Gerard Hansen as Convection ERP. He ended up releasing on Matrix and some other labels and like Frantic Flowers and Clone and all these other labels. He's Clone-affiliated labels and became this somewhat... Star, still charging relatively cheap, but it came kind of like Star. I watched that happen. I watched other people download records, become this big thing. They got distributed for the Rush Hour, but they were like a local Dallas label releasing electronic and all that. And I was doing my little thing. But yeah, we never really did very much in Dallas. It was just like dudes getting together and having a coffee and making tracks. I read that by the time you moved to Valencia, you were finding the whole Dallas scene quite uninspiring. Right. Yeah, I was kind of over it. Because we never got support. It's just a town where nobody supports each other. to this day, nobody supports each other. And, you know, there's little clicks that start and they eventually disband. They just kind of like start and then they disappear and do parties for a little while. But nobody ever just gets together and has like a sound, whether it's naturally get together or, you know, try to actually organize. So it's kind of like a black hole of creativity. It sounds terrible, but it really is. It's like a black hole of creativity. There's really creative people that come out of there and out of Texas in general. I believe my... few years even from Texas from like San Antonio or something like that there's just so many like people that come out of Texas just you have to leave for your creativity to like really blossom or for you to do anything with your career so that's eventually I finally figured out after 20 years of doing it I was like all right I gotta get the fuck out of here what do you think it is about the places of the attitude of the people I guess because it's such a commercial place, such a conservative city and such a commercial places in like it's all about money. Money runs Dallas. People with money run Dallas. None of the laws are in favor of the artists, of any kind of artists, visual artists, painters, whatever, music artists. Everything had to close at 2. Some, there was like one or two places that closed at 4. Raves were impossible by the mid-90s. So you just had this pent-up creativity that really had nowhere to go, and you had to get out. which actually could be a good thing. By being isolated, I could only listen. The only influences I had were... listening to records. It wasn't, I couldn't, we didn't have that many guests coming through, like amazing artists coming through and playing. So we had to like study records to learn how they were doing it. And there's a difference from like knowing and hanging out and doing drugs and being cool and like hanging out with all your favorite artists to like only having their records to listen to and, and learn from, you know? So it's kind of like the exact opposite of Berlin. Like in Berlin, people get together and they create together and they move the scene forward together. in Dallas you don't have that so you can only listen to the records and think of a future or something and like create from that you know what I mean it's like complete isolation totally yeah the move to Valencia always struck me as quite an unorthodox place right for an artist to live yeah well I mean it was like for me since I came from a very unorthodox techno scene there's nothing basically there Going to Valencia was like the same thing, but just slightly better. It was safer. I had a couple of friends. I had a festival called Observatory back in 2003 with Isolay and Matthew Johnson and people like that. And I fell in love with the city. We had such a good time, all of us, playing together and just hanging out together for that week. I met really great people and they were suggesting I move out there. So years later, when I finally moved, those are the only people I knew in Europe, basically. So I landed in Valencia and eventually made it to Barcelona. And that's where you recorded Life Index? Valencia was where I recorded Life Index, yeah. So, I mean, how was the MaceoPlex project first conceived? pretty simple i mean it was just i was making the the metric stuff i was starting to get more dancing i sent a demo to damian lazarus he had already signed somebody named matrika from mexico um i believe from mexico and he um which very similar spelling really annoying. It was like, I was like, are you kidding me? But that's what he chose to use. So, you know, he had already signed somebody named Matrika. And he said, can you call it something else? And it was basically one track. It was my first funk track. I thought I was making funky stuff. It was called Gravy Train. He liked it. And he said, can you make me more, but can you use a different name? I was like, sure. So my wife had a cat named Maceo because she was a huge James Addiction fan. and there's a song named Maceo in it. Maceo Parker played on that song. And the liberator of Cuba, his name was Antonio Maceo. So it was a name that, like, throughout my life came up a lot. It's like, all right, I'll use Maceo, put it together with Plex, because I had already used the name Plex on a couple records, and that was it. off the back of those records and that album, you blew up pretty fast. I feel like it summed up where dance music was and the focus switched from DJs onto producers and you could blow up really quickly. What was it like being thrust so quickly into the limelight? It was horrible. No, I'm just kidding. It was amazing. I would never say that it was anything negative about it, but... Not everything is so perfect in this world, obviously. You have sacrifices whenever you rise so quickly. And yeah, it was basically everybody wanted something out of being, you know, and you have this overwhelming pressure. You have this overwhelming amount of people that are... quote unquote the taste makers of the of the trend at the moment asking for this and that and they could do this for you and could do that for you and you you know every every producer eventually has to like you know you if you don't fall into it then you have it happen to you and you have to make a decision like a really tough decision of either continuing to do that or And just to make everybody else happy or saying fuck off and doing your own thing. I'm not that strong. You know, there's other people that are like, you know, a lot stronger than me that they could literally make a hit record tomorrow and never make another record that sounds like that ever again. You know, and be like, all right, I made that one and that's it. I'll never make another one that sounds like that again. And kudos to them because that takes some serious nuts. You know, I wasn't that strong. I was like, oh, well, I can take this I felt like slightly like an artisan and not an artist. You know, like somebody comes in and orders something and you just make it to order. And you're really good at that, you know, as an artisan or whatever. You're really good at that, making that. And you're respected at making that. But then you don't feel like an artist anymore because you're not really doing anything that new. So that's the pressure of coming up so fast. I mean, was it frustrating not being known for your metric stuff? Like being this... Yeah. And then all of a sudden, everybody that never gave a shit about metric all of a sudden gave a shit about requesting Metra because I was like, where have you been, for God's sake? But it was really nice. There's no complaints. I mean, it was just, you know, when people come on and say, okay, I remember this Metra record or even Villalobos started playing again because he had originally was playing a lot of this track called Utilisame. and he started playing it again so I had all these people asking me for Utilízame style stuff which is something that came out in 2005 so I was like you know what Yeah, but I mean, you just want to turn off the voices, you know? Do you know what I mean? Like you literally want to turn off the voices and just, you know, make what you want to make. It's really tough. I imagine it's important to have good people around you in situations like that. I have literally like no circle. I have a few friends that I don't have a manager. I don't have, I mean, I have an assistant or assistant manager. kind of like in a managerial role, but not an actual manager, have a very, you know, I just use my friends to our managers. I have a pretty good agent, but I don't have a team of people that are like, you should do this, you should remix that, you should do blah, blah, blah, blah. Because you realize that everybody has a different opinion of what you should do, and you're never going to be happy doing what other people want. I still have yet to hire, to have any kind of team or anything like that. And I prefer having a really small circle of friends that tell me if something's shit or not. For a while, you were playing live with Maceo Plex. Pedals, drum machines, voice. I mean, what brought about the transition towards the more traditional club setup that you've got now? Well, I mean, I had already been DJing for many, many years. It was kind of a pain in the ass, basically, to do my life. I didn't even like my life, to be honest with you. Some people liked it. I didn't like it that much. And I felt like there was others that could do it better. And I was just like, you know what? I'll let others do it better. I could probably DJ better than I can live. I can produce in a studio. I'm very comfortable in any kind of studio with any kind of program, with any kind of synth. I have so many and I have so much gear and I'm good at that. Live is a different thing. There's people that are really good at live and there's people that are not that great at live that are pretending that they're good at live. You know what I mean? And they have their laptops playing tracks instead of actually performing and actually really improvising tracks. I just wasn't happy with my life and I put it on hold and I had many people wanting to book me so I just started DJing again and it went well. I mean, I'm just DJing. I feel like where you are now is kind of this big room house and Techno Sound is just a really good marrying of the two, of Maceo Plex and Metric. Did you make a conscious decision to kind of bring metric more into the fold? Well, no, I wasn't conscious. I mean, that's just when I go into the studio, it's going to sound like a metric record if you leave me alone. And if you have any kind of say in making me make like a deep house record, then it's going to come out. You know, I might make a deep house record. But I mean, usually when I go in. and I'm messing around with the sound, I tend to be inspired by the more kind of crazier, futuristic synth sounds, not the basic pads or the basic stringy sounds or wah-wah-wah-wah that you always hear, like something really thick and expressive and disgusting. I like disgusting sounds. basically so it's gonna come out as a Metro record or a Marilito record as I've written so much that hasn't come out yet but if I actually like say okay I need to make something you know if I really you know have a mission to make a Mesa Plex record I could do it and if you leave me alone I'll make a Metro record so even if it's called even if it's a Metro record with the name Mesa Plex put on it you know You said in an interview with R8 in 2012 that you wanted to bring your techno-experimental side more into it and kind of achieve that balance. Do you think you're there? No. Well, I mean, the next album that I'm working on, I think... will incorporate more of that without scaring people too much. It's got straight up monolitho tracks on it that, I mean, a couple of them were actually designated to come out on, um, on SCSI or on AI or, um, on Modern Love back 2006. And, um, I've revamped and went back and like, I found the SysX files of the keyboards. I found some of the beats and the samples that I used in recreating them to go with this album. So yeah, it's coming back, but it's not going to completely be an overload of it. There's no house trucks on there or anything like that. It's going to be totally different than the last album, but not so different. that it's not MesaPlex anymore. And I think it's hopefully the stuff I'm working on now, people will start accepting, okay, this is MesaPlex. It's not going to be a copy of the last album, which was really successful and the Stevie Wonder covers and shit like that. It's an evolution of that. Are you keen for it to be a statement? I'm hoping it could be a statement, yeah. If it was a statement, that'd be great. Around the time of your first Maceo Plex album, you also started Ellum, your label. Was the idea to release your own music? Yeah, it just started off with the first few releases, getting out the stuff that I had written that Crosstown couldn't release. And then I realised that we were selling okay. At the time, Crosstown, you know, while they did a lot for me, it was becoming a thing. You know, I don't dress like them. I don't act like them. I don't hang out with them. I can't say now, but I didn't identify with them very much back then. And they were slowly... becoming like a family or like a crew of artists that work together. And naturally I, you know, rejected it. I went a different way. And so I had to turn to releasing my own stuff. And you could see that actually happen in the LM catalog where things went from, you know, stay high baby to, which was written about my, my, my girl. you know, it was like a deep house heat track to slowly but surely getting like a lot darker. You could tell where it became a real label, in other words, in like a way. And you put out some tracks as metric on there. Did I do? Yeah, I did one. Yeah, I did an EP as metric. It's just me. It's both. It's me. You know what I mean? It's like, okay, fine, I put metric on it, but it's me. And eventually, and it was like a dark tech house record. And then eventually, I never did another Metro record, but everything is called Mace Hill Plex now. Do you kind of wish you'd never started any of the aliases? No, no, no. I'm glad I did, but I just wish people would stop needing it to be called something. I'm a huge fan. For instance, there's a producer named Carl Finlow, one of the best producers I've ever heard. He had many different names, Voice Stealer, Silicon Scally, and all these amazing music, but it was all him. And nobody ever, like in the late 90s, early 2000s, we didn't give a shit who it was. It was just like, it's Carl Finlow. Fuck it, he's using voice to there. Who cares if it's the same as Silicon Sally or not, but... you know, it's a Carl Finland record. I got to buy it. And that's what I wish. I mean, now it's so trendy to have a name that's hot. I wish people would just be like, oh, it's an Eric Eshton record. I want to buy it because it's an Eric Eshton record. I want to listen to it at least because it's an Eric Eshton record because it might be good. It might be bad. But, you know, it's an Eric a pleasure it's not my later record but now i guess the media needs to to put a artist name on it in a title in a style of music in a genre and all that it's a different it's just a different ball game is you wanting it all to be under one umbrella is that why you haven't put our record as metric since the cocoonie p in 2012 right yeah because every time i write something that could be a metric record like the last drum code especially one of like the B side is kind of a disgusting track. It doesn't really have much melody. It's just in your face techno. Everybody was telling me, yeah, you should call it a metric record. It'll make all your metric fans happy. I'm like, well, I, I'm, I'm hoping that they'll realize it's the same freaking person and, and just buy it just because it's a, it's a, uh, it's an Eric Gushnell record. You know what I mean Let's talk about the new album. It's named after your son. Right. Solar. Yeah. Is it finished? Almost. Yeah, it's pretty much. I mean, I guess it's never going to be finished until I actually hand it in because I keep finding stuff to either add. to it or take away from it. I'm still writing music. I'll write something. I just wrote, not too long ago, a 105 BPM electro track about two weeks ago. And I was thinking about shopping it out. And then I realized, nah, I'll just throw it on the album. So it's probably going to be the most all over the place album. It's not going to be that cohesive, I don't think, because it's just too many sounds. I like too many types of things. So I'm trying to find a way to make it a little bit more cohesive where you listen to it from the beginning and you feel like it had a purpose by the end. But I can say that every track, just because of my influence lately, in the past five or six months, has been very directed towards my son, love for my son, love for my family, love for my So there's a lot of really emotional music on it, whether it's techno, whether it's house or electro. Is it strictly a dance floor record? No, not at all. It's probably two dance tracks on it and the rest. is really slow. Is it going to come out on Ellum? Yeah, because I could, I had a lot of really great offers from major labels and stuff, but I don't plan on being a major contender in the major league. You know what I mean? Like there's all these artists that they signed to majors, but they haven't, maybe they have no idea that, yeah, there's money, but. do you want to play the main stage with those guys? Do you want to do that? Do you really want to do that? I mean, if you don't, then there's no reason to sign with a major label. I'm doing great in the quote-unquote underground. I'm in Ibiza, staying at a really nice hotel, and I'm playing in a huge club. So if that's not underground, I understand. I mean, there's people that I have a different definition of underground as well. Sometimes I Playing at a place for 50 people is underground. But I do believe that it's somewhat underground what I'm doing. So I'd rather just stay with that and my label's underground. So we'll just keep doing that. There's no reason to be on a major label. Do you have offers to kind of take it more commercial? Yeah, for sure. I don't even think they would even like the music, you know, if I sent it to them. Because I think they're expecting me to write another Stay High Baby or like Under the Sheets or some one of these records. So, you know, even if I did send them the album, they'd probably hate it. But they want to make something that I'm not out of me. You know what I mean? And, you know, you see all these tweets where people are like, I can't. wait to see Skrillex and Mesoplex. I have nothing, I mean, I like Skrillex, he's a nice guy, he's a really nice kid, but we have nothing in common. So, but I think there's somebody out there, there's some kind of entity, some commercial entity out there, maybe corporate or whatever, that are trying to put it all, they're trying to make it all commercial, you know, make money off of it in some way. So, let's just put it on Over the years, you've come out and spoken your mind on certain issues, the ghost-producing thing and Conjure Superstar's message there. Do you think it's important for someone in your position to voice their opinion on certain issues? Yeah, for sure. If there's something good that could come out of it, but not just for the hell of it. There's some people that tend to attack others for press. Just to get just a few extra people to come to their Facebook page. I see it all the time. Because it gets people talking. And it's because, I don't know, maybe they're not releasing any music at the moment. Or maybe they're not releasing any mixes of Worth at the moment. So they're like... you know what, I'm going to talk some shit on my site. And you see it all the time with just a large array of artists that look for bad press or good press to get press. I've made the mistake of, everybody does, eventually make the mistake of thinking that nobody really reads your Facebook page and you can just kind of say whatever or your social medias. And you just say it and you realize how much of an actual impact your opinion has on others, whether positive or negative. And I realized really early on, what was it? One of the first ones was the Nina Kravitz thing. Another one was the, you know, I was really fed up with like really fake DJs. I mean, fake artists. sure they might be DJing using a sick button or whatever but are they really making their own music and something that originally was in the commercial scene I mean even Michael Jackson Thriller had five producers on every track you know people think Michael Jackson released made every single track you know he had five producers helping him on every single track This is a normal thing in commercial music. You work with lots of different people, an amazing drum program, an amazing arranger, or people to help you with your lyrics, whatever. But it was never like that in techno music. It was never like that. I mean, it was supposed to be... We're supposed to be doing the opposite of that. And I guess maybe I have like a 90s opinion on it or whatever you want to call it, 80s, 90s opinion on it. But I just – I feel like we were supposed to be doing it ourselves. And lately in 2015, there's so many artists that are not – they don't know how to write a kick. drum you know they don't even know how to write a 4-4 beat and they're playing all over the world you know buying their music or getting other people to write their music for them so I had to say something you know uh I mean I'm sorry we you know we're all frustrated about something thing is I learned early on that uh that unless you really are ready to back up what you say just shut up Do you feel like since dance music has really started to grow in the last five or ten years and the money's become bigger and it's grown into this huge industry, do you feel like the scene has become bitcher, more politics involved? Oh yeah, for sure, more politics. A lot of the stuff that works, like I said, in commercial music was slowly... seeping into underground music sex sells everybody's known that for years except in techno music and all of a sudden in techno music sex sells where the fuck did that happen when did that happen like when was that but it's maybe the Ibiza influence it's a club thing it's others would say oh it's natural blah blah blah but I may not make the most purest of music, but I make, I have the most purest of ideas. And I feel like, you know, we're letting the commercial industry seep its negativity or its control onto our scene when it was a very fine line before. There was a fine line before and now it's all kind of mixed together. There's people that... actually blow up in the underground scene doing everything exactly the way somebody like Gaga, Lady Gaga did, but just doing it in the underground scene. And that's how they get big. Do these things really get you personally? Yeah, I mean, I come from a small... small town but Miami but Dallas and you know we just it's so opposite of our thinking but I'm not I'm not that young anymore you know I'm almost 40 and there's people that are younger that have they got into music got into dance music only knowing that you know so you know, I have to adapt. I'm adapting all the time. I'm accepting of it. I'm not going to be best friends with these artists or whatever, but I'm accepting of, of the game has changed. And now it's gone from great DJs to now you have to be a producer to be, to blow up. And now you have to have something else other than producing to blow up. Now you have to, I don't know, be hot or like. just look good on YouTube and shit. It's crazy. There's people that are literally blowing up off looking good on YouTube. It's a totally different scene. Coming back to this summer, the big news in Ibiza is your involvement with HITE, which is the new Wednesday night party at Amnesia. What appealed to you about the project? Well, they were really, really open to the idea of letting me invite the guests that play with me. I invited Marcel Denman to play before me or whatever, or Cozy or other people like that. And so once they gave me that type of power or decision-making power, it seemed really like a good decision to do. You know, technically, the terrorist at Amnesia is still somewhat of the Holy Grail of the island and made famous by Ricardo and other people like that. I wanted a chance to play the Terrace. I have before, but not closing it. And they said, you know, you can close it, you can invite whoever you want to play with you. It was a good choice. You've built a real affinity with that room over the past couple of years, or you've started to build an affinity with the room? Yeah. I guess I'm still learning it. I mean, it's very tech house room. It's very... you know, you don't just play something super weird and deep and the place goes off. But there is a way to, like, incorporate really good music in there and not just go straight for the dance floor, but still get people dancing. I remember, you know, one time I walked in, Ricardo was playing a Pepe Braddock record. which normally shouldn't have everybody go nuts and have everybody go nuts. And so I knew from that point on, I was like, you know what? You can probably experiment a little bit, but you got to get back to dance beats. So that's what I'm doing now. I'm just hoping that more and more people want to hear something different and come to that room and not just the people who want to hear bangers all the time. I hope that. you know, others come to the room and are willing to groove, not need their hands up all the time, you know, but just want to groove and just like get down a little bit. So that's what I'm working on. Maybe in the next couple of years, you know, it'll happen. Are you still continuing your relationship with Circo Loco? Yeah, yeah, we're friends. But, you know, it's just, it's, you know, you shouldn't play everywhere. You should, I would love to. But I guess it makes sense that they were like, if you go play height a certain amount of times, then it doesn't make sense to also do Circo Loco or Paradise or whatever. can be considered competitors. So I had to make an active decision to do more height. We're still talking about doing at least one day, maybe the closing of Circa Loco, but it's not set yet. Maybe so. It seems like you get to a certain standing as an artist and then the kind of next logical step is to start running your own, your own night. Is that something you've ever considered? Yeah. Yeah. I considered it the last couple of years and, um, that's a whole different ballgame. That's like, you're now, you're not an artist anymore. You're, you're, you're an artist. Yeah, I guess so. But you're. a businessman at that point and you have business contacts and business uh associates to make happy you gotta sell a certain amount of tickets you gotta you don't have all the right djs unfortunately i do agree with what a lot of people criticize about ibiza is that Basically, everybody just has the same DJs coming out all the time to sell tickets. And if I did a night, I would fall into that. I'd have to invite all the same people out in order to make my night work, even if I didn't want to have them. I mean, I do like them, but maybe I wanted to have somebody else. Without name dropping, just different people that are not going to... that are not necessarily big on the island, but it's a business island. It is. There's still a major business behind it and you have to sell tickets or you're not going to last. And I don't want to be, I'd rather wait until the right moment and wait until the right place and everything comes up. So you've had offers to? From everybody, yeah. And there was a moment there where, you know, I was actually thinking about it. I mean, I've always thought about it and then just kind of said, no, forget it. But this past year for 2015, we're thinking about doing a night at DC 10 on Fridays. And I decided that just the politics of the island, just the business, the pressure to book certain acts over other acts or whatever became too overwhelming. Just it wasn't going to make any sense to do it yet again. So I backed out. And now there's life and death on Fridays. There's five of them. It was originally going to be with Taylor Bells. And, you know, I backed out because it was just like not everything was going to be perfect. So they went ahead and they're doing five, I think. But we were going to do like, you know, a whole actual summer of dates. Like, I guess if things aren't perfect, I'll just back out, you know. Do you think it's something you will end up doing? I mean, it'd be cool. You know, it would really be cool. You know, if I can emotionally handle it. You know, it's tough. You know, you have to be strong. You have to realize that you're going to get a lot of criticism. You're going to get a lot of... pressure from business associates to make them money you're gonna get the clubs are gonna want us to sell a certain amount of vips whether you like it or not even dc10 has vips these days or tables everybody's selling tables and i don't know if you know but there is nothing more annoying than playing and having a table person that paid like 10 grand for a table come up and demand the track You know, that is probably one of the, I mean, I couldn't go through that every week. You know, there's some DJs that can do it, and there's some DJs that somehow find a way to make them happy without ever actually playing their tracks for them. Just that turning point would be really tough for me to handle. You know what I mean? Just speaking to you, it feels like the most important thing for you is just remaining independent. You don't like being tied down. No. Whether it be musically, different projects. Do you think you have a fear of being pigeonholed? I already was a long time ago. My tracks are so, the Maceo Plex tracks are so successful, I'm still considered like, oh yeah, he's one of the top Deep House producers around. You know, I was already pigeonholed a long time ago. That happens as soon as you have a hit record. The point is what you do from that point on when you've been pigeonholed. If you show people that you're not just that or if you decide to make money off that. It's a fear, but I'm always getting people to realize, oh, he's not just a deep house producer. He can do other things.
