Don't you remember me? Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Veronica Vasica is synonymous with Minimal Wave, the label she started in 2005. to release overlooked DIY synth records from the 70s and 80s. Its musical remit soon became a kind of genre in its own right. Combining her digging skills with a sharp eye for photography and design, she single-handedly turned Minimal Wave into one of the most visually and sonically appealing labels out there, with her tireless archival work shining a light onto a generation of obscure bands and producers. Vasika runs another label, City Tracks, which she uses to release music that doesn't fall into the minimal way of Sphere. Increasingly, she's become in demand as a DJ across Europe and the US, and will soon be releasing music of her own via Regis' Downwards label. In a stop through our London office, Vasika spoke to Aaron Coulthate about all of this and more. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Do do do do do do ♪ ♪ Do do do do do do ♪ So I wanted to start by talking about your upbringing in New York in the late 80s and early 90s. What kind of music were you exposed to growing up in the city? I was exposed to a whole range of music, everything from New Wave to dancehall to classic rock. Yeah, all kinds of stuff. Hardcore. punk. So in those teenage years growing up in New York, were you going out to clubs, experiencing the city's club culture? Yeah, I was actually sneaking out of the house to go to clubs when I was... Started at 15. And I was going to places like the Limelight. This was before it closed down. And a club called the Pyramid. And a party called Ward 6. And they would play, I mean, all kinds of... great industrial music and what they called gothic music and synth pop. And during that time, I also, I got to see a lot of live bands like Einster's and Neubauten that was highly influential on the way, my view of music. And I think that seeing, and then I saw Front 242. Nitsreb, I went to Nitsreb record signing when I was 16. I had missed their show, but they were doing a signing. And I mean, I think seeing these bands and meeting these people was, that experience expanded my musical horizons and had a lot of, I mean, now when I look back on it, it had a huge influence on the label. When you were going to these gigs at age 15, 16, were there many other young people there? What kind of venues were they taking place at? Most of the people were 18 and over or had a fake ID that I got on 42nd Street. And I had gone there after school one day to get this ID so that I could go to these clubs. But yeah, mostly it was between 18 and 22 people that were there. I mean, there are also older people there now that I think of it. And you mentioned Limelight as well, obviously one of New York's most revered clubs from that sort of era. Can you remember who was actually DJing on the nights that you managed to sneak in? I remember Dave Kendall was DJing in the chapel, just like in the back room. And he was also, he was on MTV 120 Minutes. So we would watch 120 Minutes doing the indie alternative, whatever, two hours of indie music. I mean, this was like music that was currently coming out of the UK. That's what was being played. And then, yeah, I mean, I went to see Popolita itself when I was 15, which is very random. They played in New York. And then who else was DJing? Reese. And... There were just so many different DJs. It was hard to keep up with the names. At this point, you were living in New York on Manhattan Island? Yeah, I was living in New York in the city. My parents lived in a residential neighborhood that was away from all the stuff that was interesting to me, all the cool stuff. So I would take the subway downtown and just stay out all night and go dancing. And then I would go to school the next day. And I mean, I got all kinds of comments at school, like girls asking me, so how long does it take you to lace up those boots every morning? Because I was wearing like 20 eye dog barns. long does it take you to put that eye makeup on every day? It's got a lot of, but I really didn't care at all. I didn't care at all. I mean, I spent more time then getting ready than I do now. So I guess even from those early school days, you've always identified yourself as separate from the pack, I guess. Definitely, definitely. And you worked at a record store while you were still in high school, is that right? Yeah, I was in high school and I was working at HMV, which was like the only HMV that we had. I know it was a chain over here. And it was three blocks from high school. So after school, I'd go there and I worked there and that was when I discovered a lot of more underground stuff. And I guess you must have been sort of finding some pretty weird records while you were working at that record shop. What were the kind of bands or producers that stood out from an early age? Well, while I was there, I mean, as far as that shop, there wasn't a lot. There was some stuff there. But I think what started before that was going out to clubs and then finding record shops downtown. So HMV was the closest thing to where I lived that I could actually, it was a store where I could work. But down the street, there was a Tower Records annex, which is like basically anything that wouldn't sell at the Tower Records. So they had all these mute cutouts. And they had, I mean, that's where I first found Throbbing Gristle releases and Bad Gadget, Can, and I Start Counting, which is a band from the UK. Yeah, there was a ton of stuff, DAF, D-A-F, and mostly just stuff that I bought because I liked the covers and they were all, everything was really cheap. And at what point did this start becoming more of an obsession, like digging deeper and deeper into this kind of left field electronic music? I mean, I think it started mainly with Robin Grissel and everything that was around Robin Grissel and learning about industrial records and just wanting to know more about it. And yeah, going to record shops downtown and finding stuff there. That was when it started. I think a lot of it also had to do with listening to the radio when I was a teenager. and making mixtapes off the radio. There's a radio station out of Long Island that we could get in Manhattan, and they were playing a lot of just underground indie. It was called alternative music, so that was like the umbrella term. But I was making a lot of mixtapes from that, and that was around when I was 14. So I'd say that was the beginning of the, I mean, I had no idea what was out there, but that was the introduction to that world of music. So a couple of years before you started Minimal Wave, you were... in starting East Village Radio. Can you tell me a bit how that came to pass? It all happened pretty accidentally, actually. I was working for the restaurant owner that is the primary owner of East Village Radio, and I was assisting him, and I was actually sewing curtains for the restaurant and just doing odd jobs. And we were talking about this radio thing because there was another guy who was working there too. And he had done Free Radio Austin, Texas. And Frank himself was a college radio DJ. So he had this dream of starting a radio station. All of us came together. There were four of us. They came together and just decided, well, let's do this. We have extra space. He was expanding the restaurant and decided to build a storefront station that adjoined the restaurant. So it was at that point that I started doing a show called Minimal Electronic Plus, which is now called Minimal Wave. And it was really exciting because I could just play, I mean, anything that I wanted to, which was really weird. So I guess all these early discoveries you were having, you were then able to go and showcase on the radio. I guess the two things go hand in hand. Yeah. And what kind of response were you getting in those early days? The response was great. It was surprising. I was getting phone calls from people driving over the Williamsburg Bridge and just like saying, wow, this is an amazing song. And I'm tuned in right now, just big support. And it was interesting. It was really interesting. Because a lot of this music was, it seemed to like reach people easily. Whereas before that I thought, well, this is, some of this stuff is just such weird. You know, I was playing like a lot of German wave stuff, cassette recordings that were just odd, but people responded to them. So at this point, were you playing music by artists that would end up on the label? Yeah, I had started to. And where were you finding those records or tapes? Well, Oppenheimer Analysis was one of them. And I was going to a lot of record fairs and record shops in upstate New York that had... Very random bins, like dollar bins of those magazines, like Vinyl magazine, a Dutch music magazine from the 80s that had flexis in every issue. And just finding these things in random places, I mean, in upstate New York of all places. And then they had cassettes that, I don't know how they made it over to the US, but just like compilation tapes from France and Germany. So that was a starting point. And then, I mean, I got a lot more serious and started going to record fairs. And at this point, was it just... a bit of a collector's impulse or were you thinking this this music needs to see a wider release like at what stage did you start thinking i could actually start a label by giving this these tapes a proper vinyl issue i think it was definitely the point when i was playing up in hammer analysis out at a because i was doing some club nights as well bar nights And the response was just, I mean, we were in a bar that didn't have a dance floor and people were dancing. So it's just like, okay, this needs to be out. And people came up and they were like, what record is this? And I was like, this is not a record. This is like a song from tape burned onto CD. And I mean, that was the big turning point. There wasn't any preconceived idea of starting a label. It was very spontaneous. I mean, literally overnight. You mentioned Oppenheimer Analysis and I wanted to ask you about that first record that kicked off the label in 2005. There's a pretty fascinating story behind it. Isn't that right? Yeah, yeah. Well, they met at a science fiction convention in Brighton in, I think, 1978 or 79. And Andy is and was at the time a nuclear weapons consultant expert. And Martin was a doctor, and they both had this love of electronic music. And, I mean, David Bowie to start with. And when Martin met Andy, he, I mean, immediately he thought that Andy looked like Ziggy Stardust. And that's what prompted him to go up to him and start a conversation. Yeah, I mean, it was really fascinating because at that time, Andy had also done these paintings of J.R. Oppenheimer and they were online. And that was pretty much, aside from his, some quotes on the BBC of him in regards to his nuclear weapons specialist specialty. There were also these paintings online, and that was it. And there was nothing about the music. So when I found him, I was just wondering, I was like, is this the same person? How did you find him, out of interest? Well, I wrote to him. I actually wrote him a letter. I typed out a letter, and I sent it to him, to his office. It was just a question of, you know, was this you in this band Oppenheimer Analysis? Are you the same person? So, yeah, it turned out that it was him. And they were really excited to find that I had discovered their music and I was playing it on the radio. they started transferring all their tapes, digitizing all the tapes and sending them over. I get the feeling that the stories behind these records and the process of finding and unearthing the music is pretty much as exciting as the music itself. Is that what sort of spurs you and inspires you? Yeah, definitely, definitely. I guess one question I wanted to ask you is about the actual name Minimal Wave. So you've put out the first record from Oppenheimer Analysis and the label was born. Just tracing it back a bit, how did you decide to call it Minimal Wave? Because you've basically not only came up with a name for your label, but a name for a genre. I actually registered the name minimalwave.org long before, I think it was in 2003 or 2004. And I wanted to build an archive of this type of music. So basically have posters and sound clips and just information, biographical information about these bands. And so Minimal Wave really came from my two loves at the time, which were what people called Minimal Synth and Cold Wave. Yeah, it was spontaneous. And I guess one of the first evolutions of the label was to add a sub-label, City Tracks, where I guess you could focus on putting out stuff that just didn't fit under the Minimal Wave banner, including new music. How did you come to that decision? Was that just a natural evolution for you? Well, it started with reissuing a Chicago house record, Z Factor, the Dance Party album, which was a record that I was really, really obsessed with and wanted to buy, but it was like $500 on eBay. So I decided to get in touch with Jesse Saunders and ask him about licensing it to reissue it. And so City Trax was just born out of the necessity to have that outlet for music that wasn't Minimal Wave. And then as it evolved, I felt like it became more focused on, and now I think it's really focused on. artists that may be influenced by Minimal Wave and they are bringing that to their music, current artists. It feels like there's also been maybe a meeting of some of the stuff you've been reissuing and some of the newer records in terms of the techno side of things. Is that been maybe where your own tastes have kind of developed in recent times? Yeah, I think so. I mean, that's pretty much how I see the label because there's music that I released in, say, 2006 that I don't think I would release now. So it just has to do with the natural evolution that I personally am going through with music. Have you found over time that the kind of people buying your records has changed that you've noticed? I think initially it was somewhat insular and it was about the collectors and really the people that I, in the beginning, was, I mean, I felt like I was a part of that group. And now I think it's just outgrown that and it's gone way beyond just. you know, that subculture of collectors. And there are a lot of young people that are interested in Minimal Wave, which is especially exciting. I did want to touch on, you mentioned there the sort of subculture of collectors. It seems like Minimal Wave has built this kind of community, be it an online one through, you know, on the website, you've got a forum and there's a fairly active Facebook page. How have you sort of made steps to build that community or is it something that's just kind of sprung up around the label? I think it's just sprung up around the label. But like I said about the initial impetus to start the label, it was actually an online database, an archive, and it was also member-based. So people could interact and talk about whatever, their record collections. And so from that point, I mean, there was a billboard, a message board, and a place where people could announce their parties or announce that they were selling records. And so I think it just grew from that, just expanded on that. And has that little community been a source for you to discover new music that may eventually come out on the label or is that sort of the primary way you find these tapes still by travelling around to record fairs? Well, I actually haven't been doing much record fair travelling. And I found that after a certain point, record stores just became more about online. I mean, it was like you couldn't go into a record store without the shop owner knowing exactly what he had. So the excitement of stumbling across something that was rare, just, I mean, I think that. The whole experience is gone. At what point do you think that stopped for you, where you could stop going, say, to upstate New York and just digging through these kind of amazing obscure tapes? Well, I will. I mean, I'll always have some hope in the back of my mind that that still exists. But as far as actively pursuing that, I think it's been. About four or five years. Okay. So in more recent times, how do you find new music? A lot of the music is music that I had actually found 10 years prior. And, I mean, there's still material that I have that hasn't been released. So it was during that period where I was so actively collecting that I gathered all this material. And then what happens now is that people will reach out to me about reissuing things or telling me about their unreleased tracks. So it's changed a bit. And then I'll reach out to bands that I didn't think. were accessible, like La Manche, for example, about their first release. Because to me, that has an important place in music. Whereas before, it was more about what truly hadn't surfaced yet. And now I think it's about bringing things to light that hadn't had enough exposure during their time. Like, for example, blanc-mange, they're not known for that. Irene and Mavis, 10-inch. Well, it came out as a 7-inch, but they were never. known for that. And I mean, that's a really important piece of their musical history. I've read in interviews, you've been described as a vinyl archaeologist. Is that something that you agree with? Do you feel like a vinyl archaeologist? Yeah, I do feel like a vinyl archaeologist, but I think it's not solely about the vinyl. Yeah, I mean, I think it's more... It expands to all kinds of audio cassettes and VHS. And I guess I wanted to ask you about the tapes compilations that you've put out. I guess they felt like markers in the sand for the label and pretty good for people who maybe are intrigued by what Minimal Wave's all about but aren't maybe prepared to go out and buy like an artist album or LP. Are you planning to do any more editions of these in the future? We haven't decided yet, but we're definitely going to be doing compilations. We're going to keep going with releasing compilations. So, I mean, aside from the Minimal Wave tapes, there were other compilations on Minimal Wave, like the Lost Tapes, the Found Tapes, the Hidden Tapes. But definitely having Stones Throw on board brought those songs to a wider audience. And how did that relationship with Stones Throw begin? It started because Peanut Butter Wolf was a, he became a fan of the label. And one day he saw some of the releases on the wall of other music store in New York. And he just liked how they looked. So it went from there. I guess he's one of many people who likes the way that the Minimal Wave records look. And I wanted to ask you about the visual element to the label. Obviously, you have a background in the arts and photography. Can you tell me where that began? Well, it started when I was 15 and I was shooting black and white photographs. And then I became really serious about it and decided I wanted to go to school for photography. So I ended up doing that. My parents were completely opposed to the idea because I was really good in math and science. They wanted me to do something that was useful. But I, yeah, I mean, I had a strong vision about what I wanted to do. So I ended up studying photography. I became really interested in graphic design. I never took any classes for graphic design, but I just started making things and working on two-dimensional projects. And then when I started the label, it was like a dream come true because I could apply my photography and design skills too. the design of these album covers. And you said even from a fairly young age you had a strong vision. What was that vision? At that point I was, I mean, it was mostly aesthetic, but I was influenced by writers like William Burroughs and music like Throbbing Bristle and movements like Situationism. And so I was interested in surrealism. And I mean, I really, I didn't know what I was doing, but I knew what I liked. So I was taking a lot of portraits, cutting up photographs and making collages. And yeah, one of the compilations, well, actually that Oppenheimer analysis record. The photograph is from the DC Metro, and that was the day that I met Andy Oppenheimer. I took that photograph in the DC Metro. I think it was like an hour before I met him. The Lost Tapes, which is the first compilation, was the cover of a photograph of a friend of mine that I took when I was 16. It's a photo I took in my bedroom. I painted my walls black. and that was the backdrop that I wanted for my photograph. So it was like perfect. How much time and sort of energy do you invest in when you've got, say, an LP ready to put out in terms of the visual element of that? It seems like it's a painstaking process. There's a lot of time put into it. I mean, sometimes the artists get annoyed because they're waiting and they're wondering. you know, are you really working on this? And so they can get frustrated, even though they've waited 30 years for the music to be released. They still get frustrated when it's an extra three or four months. But yeah, it is a lot of time. I just, I think it's really important. I think that visual element is so important. I mean, it's what initially drew me to all the music that I... fell in love with so it's you know it has this personal side to it and how do you go about deciding what image and also kind of what color scheme you're going to use on a sleeve and how that relates to the the music contained within a lot of times it has to do with just listening to the music and visualizing what would work with the music yeah it's intuitive really these days minimal wave seems to be a really slick operation i mean super organized whenever a release is announced as it goes up on the website there's a really interesting write-up a lot of background the artwork's there sound clips, track lists, it's all really, really nice and well thought out. Do you feel like things are sort of operating at that level now? Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Did it feel like it was, it's been hard work to get there or have you always been very, very organized in what you do? I think I've always been pretty organized, but I wasn't aware of the record plants and timing and how a lot of times things can be late. And that's something that just comes over time through the experience of having a label. that now I can know for sure, okay, well, if they're saying it's going to be done at this point, well, I'll add an extra two weeks to that date and then, yeah. Your dedication to doing full-color sleeves and nice heavyweight vinyl. you know, that's obviously elevates Minimal Wave to the realm of a boutique label or whatever you want to call it. Is that something that brings us some pressures? Because I guess financially that must be quite a burden at times. Every record you put out is a beautiful record. It is. I mean, it's a lot more expensive because you're dealing with heavier weight sleeves, heavier weight inner sleeves, heavy vinyl. And then the shipping costs for the whole shipment of a thousand records ends up costing more because it's all heavy. I mean, it can get tough, but luckily I have a really good relationship. with the plant. And a lot of times I can figure out, I can gain enough sales through pre-orders so that I don't have to pay everything all at once before I even have the records. So there's a system in place now that works really well. And you're currently in the midst of a brief European tour. And I noticed this weekend you're playing in Paris with Philippe Laurent and in Atterin and Veil. To be playing alongside two of the artists whose careers you've kind of helped give a real shot in the arm, that must be a pretty amazing feeling. Yeah, I'm very proud of being able to do this gig with them. I got to play with Enid or Nunvale with Laurent Praud last November in Los Angeles for Mount Analog Party. And it was his first US live show. And he really impressed me. He was really amazing. It's exciting. I mean, these are the best gigs to have, to be able to play alongside my artists. I haven't seen Philippe Laurent live yet. I've met him a few times in Paris, but this will be my first time seeing him live. I guess it shows the power of the label where basically putting something out can give a band or an artist a second wind, really, in terms of their career and even get them back touring again. or releasing new music. Is that something that you're particularly proud of? And does that happen regularly? Yeah, I'm really proud of that, actually. I'm just happy that the artists can succeed in a way that maybe they hadn't back in the day when they made that music. And a lot of times they go back to the recording studio and they make new tracks. Like in Aiden on Veil, he's now making a ton of new music that's being released on different labels. And now I'm really happy that he can do that, that he has an outlet that he didn't have before. And he deserves it. I mean, he worked on it for years and years and years. Yeah, there are a lot of bands that, I mean, there's a band from Belgium that recently did their first live show reunion, I think like 30 years later, called Pas de Deux. And the response was great. That was a really fantastic sleeve, the album there. put out um oh thanks so and so with pas de deux is that something that you'll go and sort of dj when they perform live is there any plans to do anything like that or we've talked about it but at this point our dates hadn't coincided but it may happen is there kind of the the option to do like a full minimal wave tour is that being something that you would you would be be up for or i i guess I'd love to do that. I'd love to do that. I mean, I think what would be really interesting is combining some of the new artists in City Tracks and some of the older artists in Minimal Wave and doing a night like that, like in Edernavvail for the Reductions and I, who's based in Berlin. Dosting, he started playing live again a few years ago and his live shows have gone over really well. I mean, it's tough. Sometimes these artists make a comeback and it doesn't really work. So in the case that it does work and it's successful and they have an expanding fan base, I think it would make a lot of sense to do. full minimal wave night tour. And in what other ways can you see the label expanding or evolving in the years to come? Well, I think that now since City Tracks is such a focus, I think that's where the expansion reaches to. I think it's about bringing new artists, you know, younger artists. in and releasing new music, current music. So can you see the output of Minimal Wave slowing in the future? I don't think it's going to be slowing, but I'm not sure how far it can go. I mean, a few years ago I was in other music talking to someone who worked there. We were laughing because I said, well, he's like, what do you think you're going to be doing in 15 years? I said, well, I'm not going to be releasing music from the 80s in like 20 years from now. So, I mean, just that concept is a little bit, I don't know, a little bit boring. Well, did you see it as having an end point? I guess there's only so many tapes hidden away out there from the 70s and 80s that you can... Well, I mean, I'm finding it pretty unlimited because there's new material that I discover constantly. But this possibly has to do with my interests. My interests maybe are gearing more towards new artists who are... In a lot of these cases, they're influenced by minimal way records. And I mean, they're not acting. They're not retro bands. They're not trying to be like an old synth pop band from 1984. They're doing their own thing. they're informed and it's really interesting. Yeah. And in terms of the artists that you've been working with on City Tracks, I guess the An Eye record that you mentioned briefly from Doug Lee has had a fairly big impact this year. How did that record come to be released and is it going to be part of a series or what else have you got in store with Doug? Yeah, we have a few other releases of Doug's coming up. That was especially interesting because he hadn't listened to EBM and he hadn't, I was playing him on this weird electronic music from the 80s. playing him a lot of EBM. And this was around the time when he would go back to the studio. And then the next day he would just send me like clips of what he did. And I mean, that was when I first saw this direct relation to, I mean, he wasn't someone that, I mean, he comes from a disco, more of a disco background. So he wasn't one of these EBM collectors who were interested really in industrial music or knowledgeable about any of the history around that. So I really liked that he came from this naive place. And he heard this music and he just was influenced with his immediate, you know, guttural reaction, went into the studio and came out with this craziness. You know, I guess that record was very much a dance floor focused release. Is that something that you can see the label sort of or yourself sort of focusing more on is? dance floor 12 inches as opposed to full albums? Not necessarily, but yeah, there will be, there certainly will be a bunch of 12 inches, like DJ friendly 12 inches. I think that mostly has to do with the fact that I'm playing a lot out these days and I'm just thinking of what, what works in my sets and yeah, that NI record works really well. There's a new Further Reductions track that is going to be coming out as a 12-inch as well later in the year that I've been playing out a lot. So it just happens that some of those publicity tracks releases. But it won't, I mean, City Tracks is, it's also about full-length albums and just other stuff. Like that other band that I released, Brutal Non Calculant from France. I mean, that's, it's the most mellow record ever. Well, that's, yeah, I guess CityTracks sound-wise hasn't been as focused as Minimal Wave and I guess that's maybe been a... a good thing for you to be able to explore the different sort of areas of your musical interests. It does feel like as well as quite a few New York friends of yours that you're putting out music from, generally I guess a lot of the music that you've released has come from these scenes in France, Belgium, Italy, the UK. Yeah. Is that something that you see yourself continue? doing or are you noticing or sort of digging up other little scenes from from other places around the world a little bit of both i was recently approached by an industrial band from the early 80s in spain and they i mean there's yeah they're artists that i definitely want to release so it's More about the music coming first. But another thing that's coming up is the Richard H. Kirk 12-inch that we're doing of some old tracks, four songs. So that's really exciting. I mean, Richard's obviously a legend in as far as his own history. How did that sort of come to be? Did you get in touch with him? Yeah, I initially got in touch with Mute about this one track in particular, Never Lose Your Shadow. Love that track. And I've been playing it for a while. And that was another instance where people would ask me, what record is this? Can I get this on vinyl? And so then I was like, okay, this needs to be out because it's so brave. It sounds like quite a significant inspirational part of the label comes from. your DJ sets and the response to tracks that you play. How are you finding, is that still the case? People come up to you and ask you about records and how much does that still feed into what you decide to release? Yeah, I mean, it's more of a factor now more than ever because I've been playing a lot more recently. So a lot of times I'll try out new tracks that I love. And, I mean, just seeing the audience, like seeing that direct response is really important. And are you playing in New York regularly or is that the moment is that sort of the East Village Radio slot, you're in sort of weekend activity there? Yeah, it's mainly East Village Radio and then on occasion I'll do gigs in New York, but I think I'm just more picky now than I used to be. But I really loved recently playing at Output because the sound there is great. Was that a show with Silent Servant or was that? Yeah, that was with Silent Servant. You're putting out a Sandra Electronics record. Later this year? Yeah, we're doing it. So Regis and Silent Servant. And I guess Silent Servant and Regis are both examples of people who embrace techno but also industrial and new wave music. So I guess that seems like a fairly natural collaboration. Yeah, I mean, it's been an amazing collaboration between the three of us. And yeah, with Sandra Electronics, I mean, we did one 7-inch Sandra Plays Electronics, which was just Carl, last March. And now coming up, we have these. tracks that Juan and Carl did together. And so it's a six song EP and yeah, I love working with both of them. It's been, it's been really fun. I actually, I read an interview recently that you mentioned that some of your own productions will be seeing a release on, on downwards. Is that right? It's true. Yeah, it's true. So I guess I'd like to know how long have you been, been making music and. Oh, I mean, I had my first four-track recorder when I was 18. So I wouldn't call what I was making music, but I was making some kind of noise. I had a tape recorder that I would record everything through this tape recorder, just everything and anything. And then I was playing it through this bass guitar. I was playing the tape recorder through the pickups of the bass guitar. So it was just, it's hard to explain what it was like, but that's not what you're going to hear coming out. But that was the beginning of when I started recording. So then over the years, it was just something I did almost as a diary. I was recording regularly until probably until a year after I started the label a few years after. And the label took over. So once you started Minimal Wave, did that put an end to your productions or your experimentation with your own music or have you managed to pick that up again more recently? When I have time, I work on it and I do recordings, but it's not. It's not as academically as I was doing it before, because before I was just like, okay, every Sunday, every Sunday I have to do this. And then I would just record something. And now it's just about finding the time to do it. The recordings that will come out were made between 99 and around 2003. I guess as someone who seems like a total perfectionist in terms of the way you run your labels, how long did it get to have these tracks in the works before you were happy to let them be released? To me, they're unfinished tracks. But Carl heard them and, I mean, he heard them from the other room and he was like, what is this? And I was like, oh, this is old stuff of mine. And he was like, this sounds like it was made now. I was like, no, this is from 1999. He was like, well, can we put it out? Because this needs to be out right now. I was like, okay. I mean, for me, they're never going to be finished, but I'm finally going to just let them go. It's about time. Is that a big decision for you? Why had you not even considered releasing them for 10 years? Well... I never really played them for anyone. And I wasn't going to release them myself. There's something odd about writing about myself. Listen to this incredible release coming out. Rare recordings from 1999. She recorded them in her bedroom. What am I going to say? I can easily write about other people because... I mean, I'm always idealizing what other people are doing. So it's fun to write about them, especially as a European artist in the middle of nowhere, like doing these home recordings. But as far as my own stuff, yeah, I think I need someone else to handle that. And what kind of setup did you have? Were these recordings just made in your bedroom or? At the time, I had Pro Tools and an M-Box, which was like two audio tracks going in. But I had a mixer. I had like a 16-channel mixer. And so I had drum machine, an 808, SH-101, SH-9. I can go on a Pro-1. I can go on. It's going to get boring. Well, I guess I know you've said this is pure agony, but how would you describe those recordings to someone who hasn't heard them? They are... I really don't know. I mean, this one track reminded me a little bit of the Doppler effect side project, Zircalo. It's this one track that I did. But I would say atmospheric industrial, maybe slightly danceable, but not. I mean, not synth pop. Definitely not synth pop. Dark. Electronic. Yeah. And will there ever be a day when a Veronica Vesca release comes out on CityTrax? Possibly. Possibly. I mean, I'm all for doing that, but to me it means taking some time off to work on that. And right now I'm having a lot more. fun releasing other people's music so yeah it's and it's interesting you say that um I guess Ron Morelli over at Lies has got a similar kind of story he's been he was so focused on you know putting out other people's records and when he's done his own stuff generally with a couple of exceptions has been on other labels like Hospital yeah so I guess it's a well-trodden path in that respect And I just wanted to ask you, what else have you got in store for the year ahead? Well, I mentioned that Richard H. Kirk. Another thing that's coming up before that is Soma Holiday, which is a French-Franco-American duo. that recorded in New York in the early 80s. Their record was produced by Jay Burnett, who was Arthur Baker's protege. And that's something that you can hear in the production. And then we have that Sandra Electronics record that you mentioned. Sandra Electronics tape, which hasn't been announced, but we can announce it now. It'll come out around the same time as the record. And that is live sessions and early recordings that were, some of them came out on Downwards already. as Under White Savage Dance as Carla O'Connor's solo project. And then we have a band from Switzerland called Geyer's Connection that recorded this album when they were 16. And it's very well produced. And that's one of these records I got long ago. It's like one of these minimal synth, highly collectible records. And that's been on the table for a while. But I just, we hadn't been ready to do it. What kind of process goes into, you know, it sounds like you've got quite a few tapes or recordings that you've been sitting on for a few years. How do you decide that, all right, this is the time, this is the right time to release this particular artist? I think a lot of it has to do with what is happening musically right now and what I think makes sense to put out. Like, for example, Sympathy Nervous, that was a band from Japan. And I put out a collection of his music from 1979 called Automaticism, and the timing just seemed so perfect when I put that out. And yeah, it sold out. People loved it. It just fit really well into what was happening during that time. Take me to another place. Take me away to another place. Outro Music Bye.
