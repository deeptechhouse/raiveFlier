♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. When I recently emailed Eddie C. to inquire about his availability for an interview around the release of his debut album, Parts Unknown, Friendless Flight, he told me he'd have to check the schedule of his landlord for his Berlin visit. Shannon. C makes slow-mo Disco House and Shannon more minimal tinge techno. So intrigued by this unlikely combo I thought it best to get them together to explain their connection and in the process found out a great deal about Canadian rave history. I wanted to get you guys together in a room because I emailed you, Eddie, when you were coming into Berlin this week. said sure i'd love to chat i'm staying with mike shannon and i said to myself eddie c and mike shannon how how did these two people meet why are they staying together uh that's interesting i uh i actually haven't seen mike for uh for a long time but uh When I was in university back in Ontario, in the Kitchener, Waterloo area, Mike was living in Kitchener at the time, and we met just randomly. I can't even remember how we met, actually. But I was probably at one of the parties that he had been throwing at the time, and I was already buying records and DJing in the area. I had a radio show at the university. And yeah, it was generally just a small town and you meet people pretty quickly there. What was the radio show that you were doing? What sort of music were you playing? It was on CKMS, 100.3 FM in Waterloo. And it was just the university station. I was playing all kinds of music, but I guess I lived in Toronto for a year before I moved out to Kitchener. And before that, I was in Parts Unknown. But I was very interested in techno and early rave stuff that was happening in Toronto. And by about 1995, I think I moved out to Kitchener. I don't know, all kinds of music, but Kitchener was very Detroit-influenced, whereas Toronto had a big London influence. So it was very, very interesting seeing the scene in Kitchener and seeing how they interacted with each other. It was amazing, absolutely amazing. What were the parties that you were throwing, Mike, that Eddie was going to? We did a series of different things. I mean there was a couple of different club nights that we did, a couple of different clubs. We did like this thing that was called The Function and this one we invited I know we had like all kinds of different guys from Chicago, from Detroit there. You know, like who do we have in there? Like Boo Williams is a regular guest there. We had like whatever Glenn Underground, Mark Grant, Trax. Justin Long, and then from Detroit we had Mike Huckabee and D-Win and who else was coming over? Rob Hood would come up. So we had some pretty serious guests that were coming down and we used to share those guests with the guys in Toronto. So there would be a couple of gigs worth it for them to come to make the drive up. Most of the time those guys would just drive over. and it wasn't that far away for them to do it. So we used to do those parties, and then we used to do these parties that were sort of affiliated with the record shop that I was kind of doing the orders and managing there. And those were the Speed parties. The name of the shop was called Speed. And, yeah, so we did a whole series of those things as well. I don't know, there was a lot of different things that we had going on. that you know how to do meeting points, you know, where I'm pretty sure that's where we must have met up at one of those parties and somewhere. You said that Kitchener had a better scene sort of, or was more influenced by Detroit and Chicago. You know, when these people were going, the DJs were coming to the party, were they saying that the Toronto gig wasn't so great? Gig here is fantastic. Like people seem to be way more into it. And was that just a geographical thing, that it was much closer to Chicago and Detroit, do you think? Just that there wasn't so many people organizing things like that in the area, and we were really into that. And so we were sort of, you know, putting all that influence there. And it wasn't really that. There was a preference. There was probably a lot of people that weren't into that stuff that were in the area, you know what I mean? But we were just sort of force-feeding them what we liked all the time. And, you know, there wasn't a whole lot of options there for people to do. So, you know, those parties always turned out to be pretty good for the most part. I mean, I wouldn't think that those guys... would say that it was better than the gigs in Toronto per se. I'm sure we had a couple of one-ups on them, you know what I mean? But I don't think that it was constantly like this, you know? But they were different. And you said you moved to Kitchener after just being in Toronto. Why? It's interesting. I applied to, like, three different universities. And I wanted to go to take radio and television at Ryerson in Toronto. And I remember I tried three years in a row to get in and I was denied every time. I think they just take certain personalities there over mine. I ended up in Waterloo. It was actually my third choice. But, you know, your parents sometimes, like, you have to go to school, so I went to school. And I'm really happy I did because I met some great people there, not at the school, but in the town. And it was, I still remember it. It was just a really, really great time. We also used to drive down to Detroit to go to, you know, some of Richie Houghton's parties. They were incredibly inspiring, like really, really innovative and creative. Just amazing stuff. Tell me about the city itself and sort of, I guess, the scene in general, Waterloo. I mean, a lot of people know... Toronto, a lot of people know Montreal, Vancouver. It's not necessarily regarded as a hot spot of any sort. Well, you have like two big universities there, and one university is the University of Waterloo, where Eddie was going, and it's like primarily like computer engineering students. So you can imagine like... There's a big architecture faculty, there's a big design faculty too, but that was really, actually those were the parties that were really good with the architecture faculty when those guys were doing stuff, there would be something really crazy happening. But you can imagine there's a lot of students, high pressure sort of thing, so when you get those guys out and they let loose, it's kind of a... Yeah, kind of a very interesting situation, you know. But on the other hand, I mean, there was another school there that was a business school. And so you have like, you know, there was a real mixture of people in there that was really funny sort of situation. But I mean, it was really, that was primarily like the main drive behind a lot of those parties was the students. Do you know what I mean? So it was really, it's really university town that way. So it was primarily that sort of thing there. But it was quite young as well. We had a lot of people like, I mean, I was, I don't know, I was 18, 19, organizing a lot of that stuff at the time. It was incredible. I remember seeing Mike. play before I even knew who he was. It was in Hamilton and he was definitely like the youngest guy there at the entire party and it was wild. I can't remember who else played. It was probably Richie Houghton and Dan Bell. But it was just, it was pretty wild. And another great town, Hamilton, where they had some good parties back in the early 90s, mid 90s. You were quite young when you got into this stuff. I mean, how, what was the sort of entry point for you? Did you go to raves and tell your parents, like? I'm gonna go to my friend's house to sleep over. Yeah, you just nailed it pretty much right there. Actually, I had one real badass friend of mine that basically was staying over at his place every weekend, you know? And so that's kind of where it all started. It was one of my relatives that kind of told me about this party and wanted me to go and check this thing out. So yeah, I was probably 14 years old when I went to my first party like that. and I was pretty much addicted from that point on. And then I really started, you know, I was already sort of fascinated with mixing and stuff already by that point, but just it was more of a different scene, kind of like more of a mainstream club scene, kind of, you know, like all ages dance parties and like, you know, kind of early hip. house and house music and stuff that was really what I was into but then when that whole you know when I discovered this rave scene in Toronto that's where the first parties I was going to It was really a UK-influenced thing, and those guys who were organizing those parties then were called the Chemistry Parties, and those were all organized by Brits. All the guys who were promoting that were all coming from London, and those parties really had that sort of summer love, kind of the early 90s sort of sound to it, and that was the music that I became really obsessed with at that stage. what we called it, we called it hardcore and it was nothing what you would, you know, I mean it's really the early part of breakbeats and early, you know. early form of drum and bass and jungle was this. And that's what I was like blown away by that. I'd never heard anything like that before. Of course, I'd heard tons of, you know, house stuff like that, house things on the air and stuff like this and in record shops, but I'd never seen records like that or heard anything like that. It blew me away. I totally loved hardcore as well, without question. It sounded like it was the most innovative sound. It's all kinds of sounds you've never heard before. Before that, I started listening to the radio back in the late 80s. And I generally like to shows like Chris Shepard had and Deadly Headly Jones on CFNY. Maximum house, maximum movement. I mean, people make fun of Chris Shepherd, man, but it's like, his show was incredible. Like, he played everything from Skinny Puppy to, like, Depeche Mode to, like, early British Acid House stuff. And we actually got a lot of British Acid House in Toronto back in those days. And I think it was actually Chris Shepherd who probably threw the first rave ever in Canada. And that was like in 88 or something. I'm not old enough to even talk about it, but... But then yeah man, like around in the early 90s it was amazing how everything changed so quickly and the warehouse party scene developed in Toronto and you get flyers as far out as where I lived in parts unknown. That's the thing that's amazing too is that you have that whole scene there that was like this one type of thing which was this over the top. you know, rave experience really, where it was really over the top. Everyone's really like. dressed up and really just kind of going for this experience. And then I had another experience that's changed everything, you know, and I went down to Detroit and had a whole other experience that really kind of motivated me in a whole different way. And it was really sort of the rawness and the sort of like, there wasn't all this sort of like, you know, glitter on top of everything. It was just the real thing. Do you know what I mean? And then you've got that real experience and you really, it's sort of all clicked and you're like, okay, this is exactly where it's at. You know what I mean? So when you were going to these early raves, I mean, was it sort of like, the music is fantastic, but yeah, it's a little bit over the top, like everything else. And then when you went to Detroit, you're like... Okay, all of this, the whole experience is... Keep in mind you're a young teenager, right? Yeah, you're 50. Exactly. So, like, it's very, very exciting to even, like, to do anything. Right? So, you're out, I mean, imagine. I can't even imagine. can remember you know going to my first party still like it was yesterday and like it was the most incredible thing and then yeah just getting a little bit older in your teenage years and seeing it in Detroit it's just like blows your mind you're like oh my god this really is like something that's super legit and like i mean you didn't need anything you didn't even need a light show in detroit man it was just like incredible like i mean i don't even it's impossible to talk about it really so who were some of the djs for you eddie that you were looking to you mentioned some of the guys who are doing radio shows but when you're going out you sort of said wow the way he's mixing or the music that he's playing is really, really fantastic? Man, that's a very difficult question. I was inspired mostly by my friends that I was hanging out with, to be honest, because we would get together and play records all the time. So, yeah, mostly my friends. But, yeah, when we went out to parties, it was always like everyone was addicted to Richie Haughton's parties. I mean, it's simple. Southern Ontario, that's just like what you did. He threw the best parties and they were just incredible. Was it the style of his mixing or was it the music that he was playing? I'm just interested in sort of the way, you know, as a DJ, was there someone that you saw and you were like, the way that they do what they're doing is really an influence? That's changed so many times over the years. I've had so many different influences. I think are incredible. Like I love all styles of music. It's not just techno or disco or house or whatever. Like I love everything. I have numerous of my favorite reggae DJs, like soul DJs, funk. Like I could name a zillion for you right now. It's like it's hard to just start. You know, I'm hugely influenced by, like, guys like David Rodigan in England and, like, geez, I don't know, like, you know, Q-Bert's incredible. You know, I don't know. It's like, I just love, I love all kinds of DJing, too. Like, you could blow me away by just being a good selector or, like, an amazing, you know, perfect minimal techno DJ or you could be, like... You know, I don't know or incredible scratching like it doesn't matter It's like you can just tell if someone's really good at it. So how about you Mike? I think the first time I saw Mills mix probably was like one of those times there was also a good friend of mine Jeff Milligan that was like, you know what he was doing and still kind of to this day what he does is totally like Another level Thank you. There's, I mean, there's so many different people you can name like that, I mean, but definitely, like, in Houghton, I have to go there again, you know. He definitely had a lot of influence on just about everybody for really obvious reasons. At the time, what he was doing with the whole plus-eight thing at the time, the way that those guys were playing, it's just that they were playing... I mean, everybody had the same records, more or less. There was only so many records that you could play. It was all about how you played them. And the way that he was playing them was just generally faster. than everybody else. You know what I mean? And it kind of was working in a way. I don't know. I remember hearing that from somebody. I think Derek May said that, like, that the BPM has to be over a certain BPM level for people to really freak and really go crazy. And I think that kind of was the ticket for him, really. He was plus eight all the time, you know? That's why. And how did you get hooked up with them? It was through friends of friends, and we'd play together a couple of times, and it was through a really close friend of his. they kind of introduced us a long time ago and I ended up at one of his birthday parties and I had cut a couple of dub plates back then that there was no CDRs or anything at that time so I had a couple of dubs that I cut and I gave him one and then he got in touch with me. I was probably like 18 or 19 at the time and this is when I was really excited. I was like okay I'm going to do this. record on plus eight now and I was like telling everybody yeah I'm doing a record on plus eight everybody made like a big fucking announcement to the whole world you know and it was like and then of course the whole thing didn't happen you know what I mean the whole thing backfired I really learned my lesson I just don't open your big mouth you know just keep your big mouth shut And then years and years later, it was just like by chance, I was here in Berlin at that time and just shot him a couple of things and see if he was interested in it. And then I just had a whole album ready to go. And I said, do you want to check this out? And then he was ready to go for it. I think that was it. It was really easy. You're doing a radio show, and were you around the same time? Were you starting to get interested in how to make music, or did that come a lot later? Well, it came a lot earlier, actually. I started in high school. My high school actually had an incredible music department for the time. 92, 93, 94 sort of year. And they had like, there was an Ensoniq EPS sampling keyboard we had there. We had a DX7. We had a Roland JV30, which had the 808, you know, drums on it and everything. It was like, man, when I first started, like... You could take an electronic music course at my high school. It was unbelievable. It was very, very inspiring and exciting to even be able to use those sounds that I'd heard on records. But actually, when I moved out to... Anything I did back then was just super experimental and not worth listening to. But when... I didn't make any music when I lived in Kitchener and then really didn't start again until like 2002. And at this time, I was actually not really interested in dance music at all. And I was buying, I bought new records basically up until about year 2000. And then when I moved out west. I was lucky enough to have an incredible record store only an hour from my house and I just started buying old records. I'd already started like buying funk like learning where breaks and stuff came from and everything but really really got into digging like this past decade and started making Basically music that I was inspired primarily by the great hip-hop producers in the early part of the last decade. So I was just trying to imitate my heroes in that genre for the last little while. Why did you end up moving out west? Well, my wife, my girlfriend at the time, my wife now, we were living... in Toronto and it was slightly getting a little bit stale I guess the scene like I wasn't really interested in going out that much anymore and I don't know. We just needed a change. We had a summer where we were going to take off anyways. And I have family that's up in the Yukon. And we drove across the country and stayed up in the Yukon for a month. And we were actually driving on the way back. We stopped in this beautiful mountain town. And we camped there for maybe two weeks. You're like, you know what, I'm not really interested in going back to that fucking city. And so we just, it was incredible. But I mean, so many people that live there now have the exact same story. It's really, really hard to leave a place that's that amazing. It really is beautiful where we live. And I mean, not so inspiring musically, but maybe it is because I've written a hell of a lot of music there. It's hard. I don't know. But every time I go away somewhere, I meet all these great people that like the same music I do, and no one does where I live. So it's very, very interesting. I found it really interesting talking. Earlier you said though that even though no one likes the music that you like, that you're able to work full time, make enough of money to work as a DJ in that area. Can you tell me sort of about how that works? Yeah, I did. I just know I've been able to, it's like magic. I don't know. I always just wanted to make a living DJing. I live in Banff. It's kind of a resort town. There's hundreds of bars, literally. And so there's enough opportunity, especially if someone lives in a town that has turntables and a huge vinyl collection. You can get some gigs. I was able to play... a few places over the years. It's been really good. I played at the same place for maybe six years. I don't play there anymore. Neighbouring Town used to be really great. And I also played a few nights in Calgary for like two years. But it's not like, I mean... It's very difficult to describe. You can generally play whatever you want, but people prefer if you play music that they recognize. Do you think, though, it kind of helps you as a DJ in a way to sort of read a crowd? Although I guess the crowd is always sort of the same, but at least at the very least, it keeps you pretty varied in what you're playing and how you're playing it. Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, I mean, there's so many different ways of looking at DJing like as a job. Like there's guys that I mean. People are just working DJs. There's guys that do weddings and bar mitzvahs and stuff. And then there's guys that play here in Berlin. It's incredible how varied this career is. So yeah, it's been a very, very interesting ride. I've done almost every imaginable party you could imagine. pretty varied skill-wise, I guess. When was the last time you guys spent time together? I mean, were you good friends back, you know, in Kitchener? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I didn't, but when I moved out west, I didn't see very many of my friends at all. It's pretty remote, recluse sort of place. I came back to Ontario every once in a while, but it was usually just like at Christmas time, spend time with my family. No, I probably haven't. Jeez, Mike, I haven't seen you for... 10 years probably. It's crazy, but he looks exactly the same. And were you going to the same parties together? Or were you involved in different scenes for the most part when you were in the same city? All I got to know Eddie really was when he invited me to come play on his show. That was really when I started to get to know Eddie. I was really doing the show with him a couple of times. And then we really, you know, I just really saw what this guy was capable of. And it was like, this guy is amazing. It was first of all, it's just like unbelievably deep crates of just like all kinds of things, you know, really. I mean. and just really sharp skills as like a turntablist, you know? So that's what it was like really like for me was kind of drawn to spending more time with Eddie because it was just really a good experience that way in terms of what I was getting out of it just from being around and watching this guy play and just what he was capable of, you know? So it was, you know, I think I really missed those times doing that show with you. It was a really nice experience. was doing that, just like showing up there with the turntables and the case of beer, being completely ripped by the end of it, and just like having a blast. And I think it was just a relationship of the campus basically, or just the city. I don't know. Yeah, it was, I was also like very impressed with the way that Mike would play too. It was just, it was really exciting to watch, always to watch him. DJ or just like be there for a party and yeah it was no different on the radio like we used to I mean we'd talk about new records we'd also just like sometimes just do a whole set yeah it was I really miss those days too radio is my favorite way to communicate music to people there's a there's a freedom about it that's like nothing else and it's really nice to be on FM quite a bit of time in Montreal and this was right around the time that Mutech was starting, correct? I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the scene in the city around that time and why you decided Montreal was somewhere where you wanted to live. Well, yeah, I was going to visit Scott Monteith at Deadbeat and visiting him. And I went to this event of Mutech that was at Exxon 3, which was like a, I think it was an Alvinotto thing that I saw there. And yeah, just that first experience like this was really something. else for me there isn't really I mean I think there was things like that happening in Toronto but I was never really checking those kind of events out so often and I'd never seen anything so polished and professional like this and it was just such a you could really see that there was like an amazing community of people there so And at the same time, we were sort of signing people like Mark LeClair, like AccuFin, and Deadbeat as well. And so through those guys, we were sort of introduced to that whole thing, myself and Milligan. And we really saw something that was like a step above everything else that we'd seen in Canada at that point. And it was really, you could feel it, that there was a lot of momentum happening right at that moment too. It was just after the first MUTEC, I guess it would have been the second edition of the festival. And yeah, I had a couple of big changes in my life, major changes, and I just needed to make a move at that point, you know. And so we did it, you know, we picked everything up and moved there. And I'm so thankful that I did that move, you know. We became really, we met probably the best people that are still like my best friends to this day from those years, you know. And it's amazing. Like, we've just since then kind of followed each other around. I mean, a lot of them are here. And it's been like that for a few different places even with some of these guys. And there was just a whole, in terms of the production and stuff. was going on as well. There was like, I mean, there were so many amazing things coming out that were just fresh at the time, you know, and they were like something different from what was happening in Cologne or different from what was happening. on Dindy from what's happening everywhere. It had its own sort of edge to it. And, you know, and on the other side of that, besides Mutech and stuff, there was also, like, there's a killer. Those years, Montreal had this killer club scene there. It just blew the roof. off of anything that was happening in Toronto. Toronto just really had, for the most part, it was really a cheesy situation, you know? And not to say that Montreal wasn't cheesy as well in certain ways, but, like, there was Sona, for example, which was Tigga's club, which was, like, amazing. Like, you know, Richie did a residency there. Some of the residents there were, like, of this caliber. And it was really like a... unbelievable club, you know. So the after hours scene, those years in Montreal, even earlier, a couple years earlier than that, like in the late 90s, it was really cooking. Amazing. So that was the other thing, too, for me that was like, okay, you know, this is really, there's a lot of nice venues like this, a lot of good parties going on to play as well. And at that point, really just, it kind of exhausted everything. It was the same thing that Eddie's saying. It wasn't like it was stale for me, but I was ready for something new, a new situation. Did you spend much time yourself, Eddie, in Montreal? Were you visiting there at No, not really, which is strange because it isn't actually that far from Toronto, but I didn't spend very much time there. I've heard so many great things about it. But I did live, I lived in Victoria, which is on the other coast of Canada, for three years. And that was another place where I met some very interesting people. Yeah, I got even deeper into record digging there. Just meeting people with crazy knowledge about the history of dance music, especially. And it was just... so fascinating to get some of these records. And man, I worked at a record store while I was there. It was a used record store. And Nathan Johnson, who I'm playing with tonight here in Berlin, was also working at the same shop. That's how I met him. And we had some mutual friends. We were both like, I was DJing in town. in Victoria. Yeah, really great people are from there. A lot of them live or play here. I don't know, do a lot of them live here now? Probably. Canadians in Berlin. But yeah, it was a great little town to learn even more about music. I assume Tiger Dula from Cobblestone Jazz was probably, I don't know if it was the same record store, but I think he was working in a record store. And there's obviously the Wagon Repair crew is all from Vancouver. Were you, I mean, aside from working... Alongside them, were you also, you know, hanging out with them, doing production stuff? No, I've always just done, well, not always, but I've mostly only done production on my own. But yeah, Tiger Dula, he ran like a restaurant slash sort of lounge place that I played at the entire time I lived in Victoria. And I actually didn't even know he was a member of Cobblestone Jazz until maybe six months into DJing there. And it was great. Yeah, we always shared stuff about music and everything. And then it was, I don't know, it was a great place to play. People are really open about music there. And it's even more incredible now. They're throwing, my friends that are still there are throwing. really, really incredible parties in just like loft spaces. And it's just, just wild, like absolutely wild. We've also released stuff on seven inches of love, which is run by the mole and someone else. Is that, that connection was living out there? Um, yeah, I suppose so. We, um, Colin and I have a, have a mutual, uh, mutual friend. I met Colin for the first time only about a year ago. Um, but, uh, yeah, we have a mutual friend in, in Victoria, um, resident wild man. And, uh, yeah, it's, uh, it's, it's, yeah, this, uh, this guy, Koosh, man, I, I owe a lot to, to him. He's, uh, he's been, been great. Uh, just, um, very inspiring in the disco collecting front, for sure. I guess you've only released for the past couple years under the name Eddie C. Were you doing a ton of stuff all throughout, you know, and you just weren't releasing or you were releasing under different names? It's the thing. It's amazing to even be sitting here having an interview. I've been writing. It's nuts, man. I've been writing music for so long and... I never have done any self-promotion whatsoever. I just, I don't know, I had like a MySpace, you know, that I put a couple of tunes up. And I think Colin noticed. one I don't think even knew who I was I think he just knew like liked a couple tunes and and a guy from Jisco music emailed me and asked me if I had any had a cup because he liked one of the tunes and so I sent him a bunch of things and they they put out my first record were you paying attention that you know he was even making music. Yeah, of course, but the thing was it was actually, it was Colin was one of the people that brought it to my attention that they were doing some work with Eddie and I was like really? I'm like, you guys, how do you guys know each other? I mean, that's amazing. You know, that was like, at that moment, I realized, you know, how small the world is and it just gets smaller and smaller. And yeah. And then that's where, that's where I was just like, you know, and the thing that was amazing for me was, is that like kind of DJ wise, there's such a similarity between them all. And Eddie, it's just like. We're both like hardcore diggers and like just have super deep crates and they can go, you know, just like rock a disco party or do so many different ways. And that's exactly how both of those guys are. I can always compare the two of them, you know. So I was really like, okay, that's amazing that these guys have found each other, you know, because it just like makes so much sense. It's just like poetry in motion, you know what I mean? And, yeah, so I was paying attention to some stuff for sure. Actually, Nathan was one who was, I remember shopping with him here in Berlin. He was like, you've got to hear this. And he was kind of keeping me up to speed with a couple of things. You know, I was doing research for this interview, and I was like, I know Canada's a big country, but it is crazy how it seems, how, like, So many people are connected, you know, even though they're in Vancouver, Montreal, Toronto, and all these different things. That's what's really interesting about Berlin, actually, because it's really the first time that all of us have kind of been in the same city before. Do you know what I mean? Like, we've all known each other for a long time, but it was always just like, when I would be going out west, I would see half of those guys, or when they were coming over. the east or whatever like this it was never really running each other somewhere else it was never the reality that we have here right now so it's kind of an interesting thing that way uh you know it's just but it's amazing though like you're saying like just how small that scene really is it's just that's just the thing there's only so many people that are really doing those things in the end you know and you love bam You're not leaving. That's interesting. Yeah, I mean, we love it. Like I've always said, it's very, very important to have... two things in your life that are polar opposite interests. You have to have two passions. You can't just do one thing every day or you'll just, it'll just become monotonous. And, uh, oh yeah, I'm a big, uh, my other passion is, uh, is, is skiing of all things, but I do, I love it, man. I try to get in a hundred days a year if I can. This trip is really interrupting that scenario. But I do. It's something else. that I've done my entire life. And I've always had those two interests. And it's the place to live in Canada if you like those things. It's only a few hours drive from some of the best backcountry skiing in the world in Rogers Pass in Canada. If anyone's out there listening who's into skiing, they know what I'm talking about. It's incredible, man. It's a really beautiful place to live. It'll be hard to leave, but... you know, then maybe you'd move somewhere where music was the thing. I don't know. It's fascinating. It would be nice to live somewhere else, though, because now, having been there 10 years, just like, you know, you do, you get tired of the place. But who knows? Maybe I'll be able to live there until I'm 90. I have no idea. No idea. This may seem like a silly question because there's mountains all around the world, but are there mountains that you're still like I really need to go skiing there, like that you have in your mind, like three or four. Well, that's a good one. No, I love, I'm deeply in love with the Canadian mountains. It's a very special place, especially like the Rogers Pass areas and the history that goes into it. That area, like, it's all, that whole, this, like, Banff and the area was founded by Swiss mountain guides. And first skiing ever in Canada happened in Lake Louise, which is really close to my house, a place called Skokie Lodge. And it has quite an incredible history about it, if you're into that sort of thing. There's huts all through the mountains. There's incredible trail systems in the summertime. and in the wintertime. If you're into nature, it's quite a great place. And do you ski, Mike? Generally, the last time that I went snowboarding in Whistler, I was, like, wishing that I had rented one of those fat suits, you know, so I could just, like, roll down the hill, you know? I remember kind of punching out of the hole the whole day pretty early on everybody. I was just kind of wounded. Yeah, I would say that I'm... Not a skier.
