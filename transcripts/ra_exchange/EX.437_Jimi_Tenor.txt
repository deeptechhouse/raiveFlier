Thank you. Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Jimmy Tenor. Trying to pin down the Finnish musician is something of a futile exercise. On the one hand, he's known in electronic music circles for albums on key labels like Warp and Sarko, but on the other, he's a jazz musician at heart, with a deep respect for John Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders. He's managed to combine those worlds like few others, but his wide-ranging style, which touches on everything from doom metal to funk, makes him even harder to place. Add to this a bizarre sense of humor and a knack for pastiche, and you've got one of modern music's true eccentrics. In conversation with Lisa Blanning, we hear about the joys of collaborating with Tony Allen, building instruments from rotating fans and oil barrels, and how the urge for disruption powers his fascinating live sets. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Jimmy Tenor is up next. Thank you. Thank you. First off, would you agree if I say that boiled down to just the root of everything, that I would say that you're a jazz musician or you make jazz or that's the sort of base point for everything? Yeah, yeah. I would say that, yeah. Okay, so you agree. At least I'm a musician for sure, you know, and I play like... play saxophone and flute so that's pretty much normally people think that okay that's kind of jazz instruments at least saxophone so but yeah I went to jazz schools and um but I'm actually discovered sort of like like really discovered like jazz music when I was like 25 27 or something like that um like through music like sunrise you know like so I didn't I never liked it kind of like straight ahead jazz or something. Okay, so you were playing saxophone. Why that? Yeah, well, I liked that. I always played more flute. So, you know, I was flute and then, okay, saxophone has the same fingering, so more or less. Okay, there was a reason for that because... In the 80s, it was very uncool to play flute. That was the least coolest thing you could do. So if I would go to rehearsal room, okay, I have this flute, people would laugh and say, let's go back home. And then luckily in the 90s, people started sampling. jazz things, in hip-hop and stuff. So there was a lot of flute in those samples, and it became actually cool to play flute. So I was really happy about that, you know, how the 80s are going. But you still chose flute to begin with. Was that a conservatory thing? Yeah, I played in a conservatory. My teacher was the grandson of Sibelius, the composer, and he was very strict. So that's why I'm a pretty good flute player. Did you choose flute because it was the smallest? No, I don't know why. I don't remember the reason why I always wanted to play flute. And when I went to the conservatory, I said, I want to play flute. They said, you're too young. In your age, you have to start with piano. That was, I don't know, some kind of Finnish system. So I had to start with piano. I wasn't that good. And when I was nine, I... could change to flute. Okay, okay, that's interesting. Okay, well, okay, now that we've established bass level, that even in your own mind, you're a musician and a jazz musician. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely a musician instead of, let's say... Perhaps a musician, maybe a jazz musician. Yeah. Okay, well, I mean, okay, so my real question is, so how do you think... that you were able to make what is essentially jazz and even big band music, something that cool electronic labels wanted to release? Yeah, yeah, that's a good question. I don't know if it's a problem. Maybe it's at least a financial problem for me that I make this music, which is... You know, if I play like jazzy stuff and I go to a nightclub that is very electronic kind of sound, I mean, people think normally it's electronic things. There's a small issue, you know, like it's hard to fit in, let's say, with my history. But the reason why it's okay for those labels to release my stuff, I don't know. What do you think? Well, I'm just wondering how you convinced them to release your stuff. I didn't convince them. They asked me. What do you think it was about what you do that attracted them to you? My first solo album was released by this Finnish label, Sähkö. And the owner is an eccentric guy. So maybe that's one of the reasons. It was just merely a context that was set right away. Yeah, I didn't know him that well, but I knew him a little bit. So he was releasing this really minimal electronic music by Mika Vainio. Panasonic. Panasonic back then. Yeah. So to release my stuff was completely the opposite. A little bit like, my music isn't that heavy. a little bit of humor and stuff um but he liked it and and because i was doing music with electronic stuff but i had uh only like really primitive equipment so i could just about get a bass line i got this like cheap sequencer but i couldn't do much changes in during the course of um because of the track because the limitations i just want one beat box and maybe like one synth So I think, well, I know how to play instruments, so let me put a mic there and I play on top. So that becomes like music instead of just a little bit too primitive stuff. I think that's how it started, the combination of electronic and... kind of jazzy things. How do you think that Sacco first started? I mean, obviously I think that it has to do with there's a Finnish connection there. Yeah, yeah. But how did he first hear about you, do you think? I mean, were you... I was living in New York, so they came to bring some records to the shops and just come to New York anyway to... to have fun so they came to my place to stay and uh yeah i played some of my stuff and they're like well yeah send me a cassette so i sent cassettes and he actually released the cassette i mean like he just took it straight from the cassettes because i didn't have a like a master tape recorder i recorded everything with a ghetto blaster so i was i was really surprised when the record came like, "What? Did I make this?" Because I kind of forgotten what I did. I did a lot of tracks all the time. So the way he selected, you know, the stuff that I made was really surprising. I'm thankful for that. That's why we're here. Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's a very interesting trajectory. Although, obviously, you were using electronics, so it's not that it was strictly jazz. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, there's only a little spice of jazz, yeah. But I just feel as though as your career progressed, that became much more... Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, because when I was in the jazz school, I wasn't that good student, you know. I didn't feel like I fit in, you know. So I didn't have any, like, belief in myself. I was like, you know, maybe this acoustic music is not for me. But then, like, just playing with a drum machine. and just playing something on top. It was totally liberating for me. Like, well, I can play something, you know, there's something here. And then slowly I started practicing more. And later on when I went to Warped Label, they suggested, well, maybe you should play organ on stage and play something. So I had to learn. to play the left hand, sing same time as playing, which was really hard for me. I'd never been like a multitasker on stage before, which nowadays I actually am. But that time it was really hard, but you learn when you practice. Who do you think your audience is? I mean, are they electronic music heads? Readers of Downbeat magazine? No, no, no, Downbeat, definitely not. I don't think I've ever been. There's never been a review of my thing in Downbeat. Maybe once, but it's a different world. Yeah, yeah, definitely like this kind of like... DJ types that would sometimes listen to Sunrise, whatever, you know. That's what I consider my optimal audience. When I was playing like two days ago in a club here in Berlin, the DJ, I don't know who played before, but it was incredible. It was exactly the kind of music I would like to hear in a club. I didn't recognize a lot of the stuff, but there was some sunrise and Farrah Sanders. Maybe Farrah Sanders with clock DVA and things like this and really like a left field thing. Do you think that you exist between fairly disparate scenes or that there is a specific scene for what you're doing? No, I think there's some like strictly electronic people tolerate my thing, you know. I think I've done so many different stuff that I have a couple of fans here and there, but it's pretty inconsistent. How important is it to you, the idea of being an outsider? Maybe it has become quite important. It's hard for me to, if I go to studios, it's hard to me how to track, think, okay, let's make it like a... pop song. It's hard. I don't think like that. I would like to make something that would sell a bit more, but it just doesn't happen. That's interesting because you definitely have a bunch of pop songs. Yeah, yeah. They kind of accidentally happen. Yeah, yeah. I like pop music. They come sort of accidentally. I like to make melodies. If I have something like some group going on, I'd like to make a catchy melody and does it happen? I'm just trying to say that there's a difference. I have a lot of friends who make strictly really commercial music and their aim when they go to studio is to make a hit with a certain kind of structure. You know, things happen when they're supposed to happen and the song is supposed to be slamming, you know. But I think it's a different mindset. I enjoy the role of being an outsider, you know, let's say like that. But when I go to the bank, I don't enjoy the idea of being. Because I fool around in so many different genres, so it's become like in that way, you know. The record shops ask, like, where do we put your record and which genre is this? And I can't tell. Well, I mean, I think that there's like, I would completely agree with that statement. But there's also like a thread that runs through everything. Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, if you listen to the music itself, there's certain kind of chords I always use and certain kind of structures that are kind of typical and certain kind of sounds, you know, like. for sure for sure because I compose in the same way if it's big band or electronic you know I use the same equipment I use I use a lot of this like chord memory function and it's a little bit cheesy but but I use it it's you play with the chord memory it's immediately like housey or a little bit Star Wars like a sound I'm sure John Williams used it when he was doing the Star Wars. That's interesting to hear that you compose in the same way. Yeah, yeah. I use these step sequencers for bass lines many times because the idea to come outside of my own, or if I'm in trouble finding a bass line, I switch on the step sequencer. So you just turn the knobs and you... change the rhythm to be a little bit random and you do stuff that you would never do yourself and maybe it goes in the wrong key compared to the chords that I already put. Then if it sounds good, it's good. You know, you leave it. You know, you don't touch it even though it plays B flat in a B key. So later on, let's say I do some electronic track and I have to play it acoustically later on. Many times I figured, then I found out, oh, the chorus, this is major and this is minor and they are supposed to be the same song. And I never noticed it when it was released. But do you, so when the gig that you played the other night, you had... like three synths and then a drum machine. Yeah. And is that sort of what you're working with in the studio as well to start out with or to when you're germinating a record, for instance? Yeah, well, yes and no, because some of the stuff I can't bring outside my house, you know, like the step sequencer, the box is kind of big, so sometimes I travel with it. So when I do live gigs, I have to do a little bit different setup. But I like to have many, many equipment that I have my hands on. I can quickly change balances. I'm being like a chef, you know? There's a lot of ingredients, and I combine them all the time. It's kind of like modular without being modular, but the modules are like... separate machines, so to speak. Well, I thought it was interesting because when I had heard, especially because you did, there was this whole period of your discography where you're playing with bands. Yeah, yeah. And then, for instance, your last record that came out this year. Yeah. I just assumed it was a band, but then after seeing you play it, I realized that it probably was just you, actually. It's a lot of me, but there's a drummer and a percussionist on this Philophone record. It's a very acoustic record, but when I did the demos, I made them pretty much the way I do stuff on stage. So that's kind of the electronic music connection. It's hidden there, but it's there. And when I do demos, I use these kind of blocks that I can swap around in a computer, that it's tied to a clock. Because I find it easier to make demos when I can shift things around. And if I would do just a wild recorder, it would be kind of difficult to combine the elements. But the record that we've made at Philophon, they have some really cool synths there, like historical stuff. I've never seen Hammond extra voice and stuff, which is really primitive. Synth looks like an organ, but it's a monophonic synthesizer hidden inside there. I find the sound really meaningful. You can't adjust it much, but it... It has a different feel than the modern scenes, which have too many possibilities. You touched on this before, but just to clarify, how important is the idea of humor for your work? I try not to do it, but it happens sometimes. Maybe timing of things sometimes, or a certain kind of line. If I'm playing live, yeah, there's way more. I like to have fun. If people come out, I personally like when shit happens there. When there's something to watch and you have a good night and meet the people in a club and it's a friendly environment. I prefer that kind of evening. It's like a DJ night. where I personally suffer a little bit. So I want it to be like a family thing. That's why if you look online, like some snippets of my performance, you see me playing flute or you see me playing wrong notes. It's taken out of the context of the gig and it normally looks just stupid and horrible. Because you have to know what happened before and you have to kind of... The moment of absurdity has to come from the experience of being there and see how I do this stuff. I hate to watch my live gig videos because it doesn't translate. I would actually have suggested that there's a lot of humor in the lyrics. Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. Sure, sure. I'll try. I like combining science and love and this kind of erotic thing. So it's kind of my thing. I'm a little bit of a popular science nerd, in a way, and enjoy those themes. But if you would make lyrics that are only, let's say, scientific, that would be strange. So I like to put a funny metaphor, if it's possible. Yeah, it's funny to hear you describe yourself as a nerd and then you have so many lyrics that are about sex. and they approach it in a very humorous way. Well, humor can be sexy and erotic. No, why not? Although I was reading some Andy Warhol stuff and they always say in his books that humor and sex don't mix. This is impossible. What about the idea of pastiche as device? Okay. Because I feel like you're not afraid of it. Yeah, I'm not afraid, but I wish it wasn't like that. Wait, what do you mean? I wish I was more original in a way, but it's, I guess. Well, I think you are original in that you definitely have your own thing. Yeah. When I'm talking about Pestacean, I'm talking about the fact that on some records there are, like you were talking earlier about how you listen to a lot of different kinds of music, you play with a lot of different genres. There are some tracks that are... Clearly you attempting to make, for instance, there's one record where you clearly have made an electro track. Yeah. And there's maybe only one of those. That's right. So it feels like it's a bit of a pastiche, but it's approached in a very lighthearted way. It's true, yeah. I don't do electro like that often. I like it. But hopefully you can hear something like, but it's my sound. Yeah, I mean, these are just, what I mean by that is that these are, are they just fun exercises? Or is it, you know, what is it? What is that? What are those? Because there's lots of them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's lots of different kinds of things like that. Yeah. Well, sometimes I have like a fantasy of doing like sound. track or whatever you know so you you just do different stuff as if it was as a movie thing so there might be a scene of this and scene of that you know a love scene and then a nightclub scene maybe that's where it comes from also you know maybe I'm like a more modern distracted person you know like that I can't concentrate on that for that long you know so it's like Okay, I concentrate on music, and I deliver a lot of recordings, but they're all over the place. But I like it, though, of course. So it's like a method of experimentation. Yeah, and having fun. Life is long, and I don't want to play like... I mean, the idea that I would play, let's say, just only techno the rest of my life would be really depressing for me, if other people do too much. I mean, it's really clear that you have big ears in the sense that you listen to a lot of different kinds of music. And that makes its way into your own stuff in this manner. And like I was saying, in a way, those tracks kind of sound like homages. But they're so wide-ranging. I've heard... clear references to doom metal, psych rock, prog. You're clearly a fan of funk, and that's actually one thing that's very impressive about the way that you play is that it's very funky. And yeah, like I said, of course, it really seems like you're a jazz musician. So of all those different types of things that you've attempted and you've tried and you've listened to and all that, and that's made its way into your music, are there any other things that you've tried to do? For any of those, do you regret trying any of those or putting any of those to tape? Depends on the year when I think about what I thought was a bad idea. I mean, I don't regret. No, it's just, you know, just like a fun thing. Yeah, and recently, like maybe the last 10 years, I've been doing a lot of like African influence stuff. And that happened totally by accident because I was looking for... I was actually thinking about to ask Tony Allen to come play on one track. It was a bit of a Latin track, so I was thinking maybe some Latin drummer. But then I found out that Tony is living in Europe, so I was in contact, but he couldn't make it. So I got friends with an African ensemble here in Berlin, so we started playing together. And ever since I've been kind of like indoctrinated or something like that. I've been brainwashed to think like in an African music way. Like in the last album I play all the bass lines with the organ. So it's definitely like African music. Yeah, and the way you're playing saxophone too. Yeah, yeah, for sure. It's clearly all there. Yeah, yeah. And that's actually pretty interesting because... It's part of my technique too. It's like I like to go for it. I don't have like a great... great technique in many ways, but I like to sound personal. And I think that's part of African sax playing. It's the personality and the way you approach the playing is more important than intonation or any of this stuff, which I found really liberating. I think like, as a rule, like European horn players are like, they play too well in pitch. Yeah, like it's too clean and too nice. It's too perfect. Like, it has to be, there has to be more rawness, you know. You know, if you want to play vibrato, just play it. Like, even if it's not cool, this moment to play with a heavy vibrato, but you know. Yeah, well, it's very interesting to me because, you know, you're like a pale northern European guy. Yeah. And you're playing very convincing Afrobeat style. Yeah, I've been around these guys now for a long time. I definitely learned so much about the rhythms. I was playing some solos with Tony. Later on, we did an album with Tony Allen. He was like, you guys, you don't have a tack in your horn playing. Where's your tack? It was me and this Cuban guy playing the horn section. So we go, like, what do you mean? Then we kind of figured it out. Yeah, true. We come in too soft, you know, like with a supposed to be... We had too academic approach. So you learn, you know. Also, in the beginning, we would start playing with the loose polyrhythms. I couldn't figure out where the bar starts and where are we? I was super confused. Now, I'm not confused anymore. Just to go back to talking about Tony Allen. Did he know about you before you worked together? How did that collaboration come about? No, I don't think he knew. So how did you convince him to play with you if he didn't already know who you were? It was the Strut Records. There's this guy, Quentin Scott. He had a series of records where a younger artist makes a list of five older artists that he or she wants to collaborate with. So he asked me to do that list. So I put names. I put Hermeto Pasquale and Marshall Allen and Farrah Sanders and Tony and one more. Maybe James Chance. Well, then Tony Allen worked out of that list, which I think was lucky because Tony is an easygoing guy and a really sweet guy. And he was great because he's a drummer and I do other stuff, so we both had an easy role in the production. But yeah, I don't think he knew my music. Quinton played him backstage. I brought him some demos. He was visiting Finland in a jazz festival, so I brought him demos. That's got to feel good that he listened to your stuff and was like, yeah, I can play with this guy. Yeah, that was great. Yeah, of course, first. First couple hours in the studio, it was a bit difficult, but then we went to have lunch and we drank wine and everything was fine. I was a bit nervous, of course. I mean, I listened to his playing since I was a teenager. I mean, it's also really interesting to hear that you learned something from him about the way you play. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Also, he plays really quiet. I mean, he plays so quiet, you cannot play more quiet because you wouldn't hit the drum skins anymore if you play more quiet. And obviously his sound is great and groove is amazing. So that's a lesson, you know, right there. You know, like you don't always have to be like a gorilla or like... elephant that comes into your room. You can be macho, but take it easy and incredible. Is that going to be an ongoing thing? You guys have released a record, you've played several times together. Yeah, maybe not now. We did an album for the Moog synthesizer series. We did a duo in Cafe Otto. Yeah, that sounded like a live recording. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, I made this system, this English engineer guy, Finley Shakespeare, that each drum would trigger the Moog. synthesizers like with a step sequencer so that each hit would move one step of the step sequencer so I programmed some stuff for Tony's songs and we came out really good I mean it was strange gig when Tony starts playing the drums all the all the all the moves are firing comes this strange yeah the recording well you know It could have been better. I would like to do it in a studio. I don't know if you would agree with me, but I think that jazz seems to be making a comeback right now. But like, for instance, Kamasi Washington. Oh, yeah. And there's this whole group in London that seem to be selling a lot of records right now, which is almost surprising around Shabaka Hutchings and a lot of these players. I have a friend who runs a record shop in Oakland, and he says that he can't keep these records in stock there. So that's interesting. Okay. And I've also noticed in other genres, people are starting to make a lot of music that really seems to come from a jazz place. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Although, you know, maybe they're not traditional jazz musicians. I would fit in. Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. I mean, I'm just wondering if that's affecting you in any way. I haven't heard about that, but that sounds good. Especially thinking about, because we are right now, today, we're in the studio to make a new record for Phil of, and yeah, it's going to be maybe more jazzy. It's definitely like all acoustic albums, so that's good news. Good news for that. But if it's very traditional sounding, then maybe I'm not sure. Some of the jazz festivals are incredibly conservative, if it's like a big mainstream jazz festival. But Kamasi Washington, he plays in many crossover festivals, not necessarily strictly jazz festivals at all. That tells you something. Because I find... Especially when I was playing in Asia, they were really conservative at the jazz festivals. I was shocked. I was a bit afraid to play there because I felt like it in fear. But it's interesting because of everything that I hear and what you do and in your music. I saw an interview that you did for iPlug in 2016. Yeah. And you said then that you thought your music sounded Finnish. Yeah. And I mean, I wouldn't say that at all, but maybe also I've got no idea what Finnish music sounds like. So what do you think are the defining characteristics of your music that sound Finnish? certain kind of moodiness and maybe a little eccentric sounds you know like that it's um but yeah definitely like i make and i try to make this kind of long melody lines which i i find them finish in in my that they are and I know some Norwegian friends of mine, they run labels and they say, oh, that's the Finnish melody line you did again. I was like, what's Finnish about that? Oh, everybody in Norway knows the Finnish melody. Okay. But I don't know what it is. It's kind of like this kind of like wandering synthesizer sound, which sounds lonely or something. I didn't know there was a thing. Do you think it's related to Finnish folk music at all? What music? Finnish folk music. No. That melody that they're referring to. No, no, I don't think. And I'm definitely not influenced by Finnish folk music. There's a big folk scene and it lives its own life. And I never listened to it. So for me, it's like, it's foreign music to me. But I think the way of life and sort of the nature and so like the kind of loneliness and isolation is more like a real influence. melancholic there's a little bit melancholic at least deep down that's interesting that's something that's something to listen out for then maybe because um yeah no i mean uh i hear so many different kinds of things in in in your music and there and there are some touches which maybe would would relate to that but i for instance there's there's one record um Where I swear you're playing the flute like it's a shakuhachi. Oh, yeah, yeah. Where that's not like, okay, well, that must be like a reference to Japanese soundtracks. Yeah, exactly. It is. In Japanese culture and Finnish culture, there's a lot of similar stuff, you know, like deep down it's like, I don't know. A little bit reserved and quite polite and very clean, you know, clean countries, you know, like everything is, you leave your shoes outside the house. I mean, like when I come to Germany and people walk, it's, well, actually I have shoes on now, which I find amazing. I have them on, but anyway. I do leave my shoes always outside and it's a thing, you know. Right. You just do that. So to me, yeah, and because I'm a flute player, of course, Japanese flute playing has huge influence to me. Like when I was in conservatory, I would play these compositions, like really experimental. I got really into that sound already when I was a teenager. I always liked this kind of like, if it comes to classical music, I like experimental and I don't like like a traditional classical music kind of at all. So that's where my flute playing comes from. And I make my own flutes. Really? Yeah, like some wooden flutes, yeah. Like a shakuhachi? Not shakuhachi, no, no. I don't play the end blown flutes. Oh, I see, yeah, yeah. Because it's different. But when you make a flute out of wood, it sounds like a wooden flute and it's not so far away from shakuhachi. And then with certain kind of like... how to end the note and how you sometimes pitch it down and up so you can emulate. that sound. I mean, I love that kind of playing. One thing that I was pretty impressed about when I saw you play the other night was, I mean, as I said, you had these three different synths which you were switching between and the drum machine which you had going and you would obviously change for each track. At one point you were playing the flute one-handed and playing the synth at the same time. Yeah. And this was very impressive. I mean, and even though it was the same melody on both, like, to me... Wow, that's the... Which, I mean, well, that would probably be, like, you'd have to be a crazy person to... split your mind to be able to play different melodies on both. People do that too, but I don't. Really? Who can do that? That's nuts. This is one guy who plays the Steve Wright piece for two pianos where the rhythm starts kind of like shifting, like the clock changes, and he plays it on his own. And for that... you have to be like insane person like they have different clocks kind of and they start like you know so people there are people who can do this one yeah but of course if I would play like all kinds of nonsense with the other hand if I play with the flute people wouldn't necessarily get the connection that then I'm able to do it or something it's For life purposes, I think it's funny when I play in unison. No, I was impressed. I was very impressed. I mean, I... I think that if you were able to play two counterpoint melodies together on each. That would be kind of cool. Like that would be nuts. I have to work on that. That'll be the next step. Well, I was impressed that you're, I mean, because obviously the fingering for both of those is totally different. Yeah. Right? And you're having to play the same melody on each, which means you have to play differently on each instrument. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you're playing the flute one-handed. Yeah, it's also hard to keep it in your mouth because there are notes when I don't press anything, so the flute kind of falls away. So for those notes, I have to put the little finger to support that it doesn't fall. And you can only play notes between G and E. But it's a fun thing. I don't practice that, actually. I never practice it. I've only done it live. So it's just a thing I do. Like, yeah, I can do this. Well, it very much makes it a one-man band. Yeah, yeah. And then... Yeah, it's funny. If I play a unison, then I go to these jazz chords with the fourths. So it has the same kind of movement, but the chords go up and down with the melodies. That brings it to another level. It's funny. Yeah, that was pretty... I was very impressed, actually. So what do you, like, thinking about that and thinking about all the different kinds of things that you've done, what would you say is the most audacious thing you've done musically? Maybe that's not something you even care about, but... Well, surely the live shows are, like, they're out there, you know. If I'm in a... That kind of mood where I really go for it. Then it's like, I really enjoy it. And it's completely abstract, you know. Because nobody is telling me, like, you can't do that, you know. My friends say, like, you shouldn't mix this. You know, why don't you put the drum machine a bit louder so that, you know, I don't feel like doing that because... There's so much music which is all like beat, beat, beat, beat, beat. And then I kind of like the... I find a little bit that the fun of the evening is reduced when it's so repetitious for me, you know. So I want to go a little bit against the grain and do unusual balances and yeah, stuff like this, playing the flute. I also try to sing and play the flute. keyboard at the same time and then quickly change the balances and do some vocoder thing connected to the drum machine stuff like this and I don't know if you noticed but I did a little like when the drum machine you can reduce the amount of steps that it plays so it becomes like this kind of noise noise generated thing and then you can go from like romantic ballad to all of a sudden like this insane like like noise I would say that's as far as I can go and I don't I can't do it in in the studio I can't do it at home tried it I'd like let me do a record like this where I'm completely free and I just can't do it at home. My mind is too regimented. If I don't have the audience, if I'm not sweaty, I can't. Tried it, but it failed. Well, it's interesting that you say that you don't want it to be this. I mean, I totally get how what you do is a different thing than, for instance, like a... techno set in terms of in terms of uh in terms of rhythm but having said that like the gig was very rhythmic and there was a lot of dancing and uh yeah yeah so so and and rhythm like if you listening to what you do and and and how uh how much you love funk music and how much you're into afro beat is like clearly rhythm is like a very big control for you yeah yeah yeah Which again is like maybe another reason why it appeals to people who like electronic music. Sure. Yeah, my friend Russell Haswell, he makes like noise and he was really struggling at some point. Like, you know, people just didn't want to hear his stuff. And he was doing, I think it was some tour with Otakron Apex. So they were saying like, Russell, just put a little beat there, you know, just tiny, just compromise a little bit, like put a little bit. And then next time I saw him, he has, yeah, he has a little drum machine there. Every once in a while you get a little bit. Sure enough, people love it, you know, like, so beat is important, like. People like beat, you know, and I understand the reasons. Well, it's universal, and all of us are carrying our own rhythm internally. Yeah. But you can still be hardcore noise, but just give them a little bit so you can digest it somehow. That's kind of what I do too. I mean, of course, I enjoy the rhythm stuff. And I try to use a little sample here and sample there so that it-- this kind of like-- instead of just the traditional drum sounds, they make the beat. Or it comes to the rhythmic sound from the synthesizer that I trigger. But of course, live gig, you have just 60 minutes or 90 minutes or whatever. So you have to restrict a little bit more stuff I can carry in the plane. I like to have more small synthesizers, like little bounds. I'm shocked that you're a solo performer carrying that much gear with you, to be honest. Yeah, it's work. Do you think it's silly? It was too much? No, I think it's obviously... No, I think actually, to be honest, it made for a really interesting, fun gig that would have been totally different if it was just you with a laptop and your flute and your saxophone. It would be very different, yeah. So, I mean, clearly that's a... a choice you're making on purpose. Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, I want it to be spread out and there's something to see, you know? Right, there's the whole physicality to the performance. Yeah, yeah, yeah. With synthesizers, they are not really designed for stage and a laptop definitely isn't designed, you know, for stage, so there isn't much to see. So you have to try and... find ways that it's there's something to see but it's still not like cheesy you know like that it's only made for visual reasons you know like that it's actually it has a purpose you know everything has a purpose and it's it's not like put this because it looks great like I bring MS-20 because it has you know historical great sense but I don't do that but you know Right, so there's an aesthetic reason that you do this too. Oh yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely. It's not just because, so that you can have... And functional, functional, it has to be functional. Actually, like, I don't know if you noticed, but like... I tried to make the, because with electronic music, there's always this problem. How much is programmed? Did you do it at home? You know, like how much did you actually do live? I mean, did you just press play? And so I've been always struggling. It's like, okay, how much can I do? pre-planning and pre-programming so I try to keep it to minimum and that's why I can only play certain songs on stage when I'm doing the solo gigs they have to be kind of not complicated with chords and not too many changes like in a structure and so my whole thing is like when I go on stage if something changes you see me doing the change, you know. If I don't touch anything, nothing will change, you know. So, because I think in the 60s when they had the huge, like, electronic music studios where they did, like, great music, but then they wanted to bring it live and bring a tape on stage and they would press play and clearly that wasn't, after a while people were saying, oh yeah, that sounds great, but I mean. come on you just press play because now with the the modern dj thing we we are in the same situation almost like people are making fun of it online you know like like where's where are the scales you know you come on stage with the usb stick and you press play yeah so it's it's a it's a very similar situation than 60s tape recorder on stage it's a problem i think it's a real problem You mentioned this. I thought it was interesting that you, when you were talking about this piece you did at Cafe Oto with Tony Allen, where you actually were, you programmed, so you've got these other skills where you can, you're triggering this Moog so that it would respond to Tony's drums. Yeah, yeah. So I had this idea for a long time that wouldn't it be cool that I go on stage with the drummer and then the kick drum would trigger a bass line. That would be like a live bass line and every time he hits the kick drum, the bass line goes one step ahead. So you go like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. A little bit random because it would come from a step sequencer. So we tried this like... with the Echo Alibi Savage. We tried it like maybe five years ago, six years ago with my MS-20 and the latency was just too long. The sound would come, but it would come too late. So it sounded horrible when we tried it live. And then I met Finley Shakespeare at the Moog project, and I talked to him about this, and he makes modular equipment, and he has his company. So he said, well, let me try to do one that would react faster. And he made it, and it was really tight. And we thought, okay, well, maybe we can make this gig with Tony. And he made one for each drum. That's amazing that they made a project just for you. Yeah, yeah. It was incredible, like, technical achievement in a way. Like, Tony, when he started playing, he was like, what? What is going on? Like, this is crazy. Because I was wondering, like, you and me alone on stage. what's it going to be? So I was happy he agreed to do it. Well, it's just, I mean, the reason I brought it up is just that it's interesting because you're clearly capable of a lot of different kinds of things. And, you know, you're not just this wacky musician guy. So you're, and you're not just a retro synth dude. I make instruments, you know. What other instruments do you make besides flutes? I made this friend of mine, he's like an industrial designer. So we made like experimental things. One is called the photophone, where it looks like a fan, but where the fan blades would normally be, there's a piece of film. And on film we expose sound waves like optical sound like in a movie, but a really primitive way. When light goes through, we have a light that goes through the film, I collect the sounds with a photo, is it resistor? Photo cell, you know? So you can play it a little bit like theremin. It looks similar to play it. Of course, it works a completely different way. But I didn't bring it to the Berlin gig because sometimes it's a little bit hard to carry. I have so many cables already on stage. So every 10th gig, I play the photophone. But it looks great when I play it. It's beautiful. It's like characteristic. This kind of sound. I played on many records, like Warp record, Out of Nowhere. On the Out of Nowhere track, I played with the symphony orchestra. And I was playing next to the string section, so it was all live. So it was kind of beautiful. Yeah, and then we made some electromechanical drum machines. We made an electric flute. which is actually an acoustic flute, but all the mechanics work with electricity and the pads close with electricity. The reason we made it is because I wanted to make an alto flute out of wood, and to make an alto flute you need mechanics, you need to have the machinery. to make it happen and I can't do that at home so I thought maybe we could do it with electricity you know like with repelling magnets or something like this so then we figured out how to do it we put like electric coils and that push them the pad you can see it online like Jimmy Tenor playing electric flute Do you blow into it? Yeah, yeah. It's a regular flute. Totally regular. Acoustic flute. Yeah, well, I have a battery. We tried to make a patent out of the system. And it turns out that in 1965, an English woman figured out exactly the same thing. Same drawing. The drawings looked exactly the same. She was working with an engineer. But 60s was too early for it. At that time, what I read from the patent description, the battery was like a separate unit on table, a huge, huge thing. And so obviously 60s wasn't the time to do it. But yeah, okay, our thing is still like a prototype. Wish Yamaha or something would pick it up. I mean, because they could do it. I mean, obviously they could do it, but for us it's just too much. So that was a great, great project. And, you know, because there are possibilities. Then you could go on stage with, you could hook it up into a sequencer, like a step sequencer. And we actually tried this, like with MS-20, we triggered some of the pads so you could blow into the horn. I mean, to flute, and then the sequencer would move the fingers, so to speak. So you could get totally mechanical sounding, but completely acoustic, like a horn, which would be kind of strange. A little bit futuristic, maybe. Have you seen those? They just look like electronic recorders where you blow into it, but it's like this. I like a MIDI. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. A MIDI controller. Yeah. Every time I talk about my electric flute, oh, yeah, it's like a MIDI controller. No, I'm wondering. No, it's not a MIDI controller. It has nothing to do with MIDI, and it's an acoustic instrument. But it's like, yeah. So the electric element of this is so that you can make it a lower pitch? Yeah, yeah, that without. Like literally it can't exist as an acoustic instrument without being aided. Yeah, I couldn't be able to make the instrument because it would... I mean, there's Japanese and Chinese and Americans who make this kind of like alto flute. It's complicated. You need a factory. You need a lot of people to do it. So, I mean, for me, it was no way to do it. So that's why I think, well, maybe electricity would be a really simple thing. And it was to do that. So yeah, the electric part is only to do how you control the acoustic instrument. I mean, your studio isn't just a series of instruments and some computers. It's literally like soldering irons and all this other stuff too. Yeah, for sure. Well, that just leads me to wonder what haven't you done yet that you've got planned? Because, I mean, you've been working for a long time now. Yeah, I don't have much other life than make all this stuff to make music. So that's kind of it. I don't go on for six hours. I wouldn't have that. But that's good. I like artsy fartsy lifestyle so that's good for me.
