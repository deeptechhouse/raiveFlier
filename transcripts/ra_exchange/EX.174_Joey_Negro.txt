Do what you feel. Do what you feel. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. For the last 20 years, Dave Lee has been producing and promoting the more soulful end of the dance music spectrum to much acclaim. He's best known for his Joey Negro alias, but this is actually just one of over 30 stage names he's used, which have included the Sunburst Band, Aqaboo and Jakarta. Between these monikers, he's touched on everything from jazz funk to deep house down years. Recently, he's been scratching his disco itch again with a new compilation of re-edited classics from the likes of Patrice Russian and Voyez. Stephen Titmuss caught up with Lee in London recently to discuss his long career in dance music, his sizeable record collection, and his surprising connection to Take That, one of Britain's most well-known known pop bands. So I'm sitting here with Dave Lee aka Joey Negro and today obviously Dave we're going to be talking about your career generally but one thing I did want to speak to about you first was your latest remix album it's a remix album of old disco records by people like Roy Ayres produced Russian, Ashford & Simpson, but I just wanted to ask you why is this different to a normal kind of disco remix album? I guess this is done from the stems, so I'm approaching this from the point of view of these are great records, fantastic original records. I'm not trying to remix them in terms of sort of like putting a loud house beat behind them and making them into house records. I just want to enhance what's great about them and just fine tune the arrangements, but using the original parts and tease in, you know, bits of like you might, for something like Patrice Russian, there's a string part that's... people would know from the original but I've just got it at the beginning over drums then dropping into bits which I suppose because these records have become you know in lots of ways they're classic records you can use the elements teasing the elements in a way that maybe you wouldn't have done when they when they were new records so it's about taking what was great about the originals but and keeping most of that but trying to make them playable now in a set up against modern house records so it still sounds like an old record but it still cuts it up against a modern record. So, I mean, to me, that's what a good remix of an old track should do. It should retain everything that was great about the original, but also make it playable now for the modern DJ in a set with, you know, new records. You don't, I don't want to, you know, I wouldn't, when I'm dealing with something like an Ashford and Simpson track, it would be wrong to get rid of... all the music or a lot of the music and replace it with something new you're kind of straight away losing a lot of what was magical about the original record so I've chosen records which which are all great records to start with. And say something like Narada Michael Ward and Tonight I'm Alright. I mean, I love the original record. I remember hearing that record back in 1979 and I didn't catch what the act name was and I was just like, wow, that's fantastic. And it took me a few, I suppose pre-internet, it took me a couple of months to find out what it was. But I guess with the original of that... It's just quite full all the way through. There wasn't ever a DJ-led 12-inch mix. It was just the album version. So it's quite a traditional arrangement. It's not very dubby. The drum's in all the way through. It's like, you know, verse, chorus, verse, chorus. A bit of a solo, then it's sort of chorus again. So I wanted to do a slightly more radical, try to put Beam Shep Pettibone or Larry Levan into my body this remix they would you know they'd have little bits like the guitar on its own and you know make it a little bit more dubby have longer breakdowns just make it and give it some of the dynamics and excitement we're used to in modern records with slightly longer drops and more anticipation keep it exciting but without trying to make it sound like a house record it's still a disco record these are still all disco records they still sound like disco records they don't sound i haven't tried to put like a loud house bass drum there because kind of that's not what this project's about it's about retaining the best bits of the originals but in a way that sort of like you know sounds contemporary so some people might say some of those records are classics and they can't be touched what would you say to that fair enough if that's how you feel about it I mean I don't say the original still exists if you don't want to listen to the remix don't listen to it it's not like I would feel like, you know what, there's records I feel like that about. I think, what is the point of remixing that? And if I see someone's remixed it, I might listen to it. I might think, you know, I'll stick with the original. Or I might not even bother listening to it. But it's a personal thing. You know, some people would say, I don't think anything can't be touched. If you can come up with a new creative spin on it. think there's some things you've got to be bloody good to better the original of yeah i don't think anything is untouchable to me i think but it's very much a personal taste thing isn't it it's all about taste and we all know one man thinks one movie's great and some other one person says it's the worst movie he's ever seen i mean it's all nobody's always right or wrong about what is untouchable what isn't untouchable so I just think, and I think if you're doing it from the stems, if you've got the multi-track, then you should be able to do something worthwhile. It might not be the definitive version. I think with most of these records, the definitive version will always be the original because it is the original. But sometimes somebody can do something and you think, well, actually, you know, that's an interesting new take on it. And, you know, if it brings back to life a new record that's sort of, is only known to an older generation to a younger generation then what's the bad thing about that? So it's interesting you know you're working with stems and multitracks on this compilation Dimitri's done some remixes in this fashion Con has J-Rock But where are you getting all these stems from? Because it seems like it's not the kind of thing that you can readily just go up to Universal and say, hey, hand over the stems of, you know, whatever act. I mean, it's down to knowing somebody in the label. I mean, the stuff, a lot of the tracks for this on the album, I paid for them to be digitised. They just had them on 24-track tape. And I said, well, look. Can I have the parts if I pay to have them transferred into the digital, sort of like into the computer? And they agreed to it. I suppose from their point of view, from a major label's point of view, if they can be bothered, it's a good deal. Because if someone's paying to digitise stuff, then... They're giving them some free remixes and they're getting an advance. So it's a win-win situation, but still they don't make it easy because it's just quite a lot of bureaucratic tape, red tape and lots of bureaucracy to go through because they're just not geared up for that. And, you know, it's finding somebody who's sympathetic, who actually thinks, well, actually, we might as well do this because we are making a bit of money out of it. You know, there's other, you angles that you know it's a good thing generally but they're not it's they're generally about just easy money which is licensing Rihanna to lots of compilation albums and just make that's and it's big money you know the sort of money they're going to make out of me remixing old tracks it's it's a little bit of usage of their back catalogue but they're not really about that so I think that there's three parts to actually doing an album like this. First part is actually getting the tapes, which is... bloody difficult and then doing the remixes and then getting the remixes cleared and you know it took about a year to get them cleared it just took ages because they have to go to the uk office then to the american office and just getting them to just listen to it and check the contracts if they need to go back to the original artist to you know or if they can clear them themselves and somebody somewhere has got to listen to them and say yes this is okay and uh just following that through it's very time consuming and one of those things you just got to think about well I'm just doing this because I want to do it not because I'm you know it's not a money maker you just you started it and you're going to finish it sort of thing so going back to the start do you remember the first disco record that you was really into perhaps as a child or as a youngster um yeah i suppose it would have been something like um the oh yeah i know it was it was heatwave boogie nights i think it was the first record like that where it started off slow with harp and i thought this is another one of these bland so and then it burst into this sort of like incredibly funky rhythm and i that was the first where i thought wow this is wicked and uh what if wicked wasn't the word i would have used then but um and i bought the record and I still liked I guess I still like sort of like you know I remember other records I bought around that time like like Boney M I bought Boney M um what's the one uh Rasputin and I bought Fleetwood Mac Dreams and just the odds you know I buy a single every three or four months as a kid and uh you know some poppy disco like Can You Feel The Force and I Lost My Heart To A Starship Trooper and other things like that but um It was around the late 70s that I started listening to Radio Luxembourg and hearing sort of non-chart disco and things like Asmuth Dancing in Outer Space and Patrice Russian and those sort of records which were, I was sort of amazed, God, there's all these other records that I thought, you know, I suppose naively up until a certain age you think that the charts is just it sort of thing and then you start... Because I was the oldest, so I didn't have an older brother or anybody playing music, which... I was kind of discovering it myself. And then, yeah, so I started hearing all this stuff like that. And they had an import show and they had a, well, on Friday night and on Wednesday night, the club play show and the disco album show on Monday night. So there's an awful lot. I was supposed to spend all my evenings in the dining room on my own, listening to it on this Phillips radio, just listening to Radio Luxembourg, terrible reception. I don't know, I don't think the really bad reception added anything to it, but it was just like, it was this, I don't know, it seemed like this whole world of music that I didn't previously know about, and then I found a shop. in Colchester that sold imports so I started buying you know imports and I guess and then finding out like oh Mass Production have got this record I'd never heard of Mass Production but then I'd think oh I'm sure I've seen one of their records in a second hand shop in Ipswich and then you go back a year later it would still be there you just kind of start building up a knowledge of you know what the bands who are coming out now that they've actually been around for like seven years or whatever and you know buying buying their older music and uh yeah it's um but i felt like i was the only person in the area who actually liked this sort of music because you think you'd hear like a new blackbirds track you think all right blackbirds i'm sure i saw one of their albums in norwich in our price and then you it would still be there so it was like like a year and a half later for 30p or something so it was fun because the music was worthless then you know so you pick up things so cheaply I mean these weren't really rare records but they were I suppose fairly obscure well they weren't obscure I mean they were major label things on Philadelphia and on other major labels but they just didn't seem nobody seemed to want them back then anyway no one in Ipswich anyway no one in Ipswich Norwich Colchester and Clacton-on-Sea yeah But it's interesting, you know, obviously this came later, but it seems like, you know, from Clackton-on-Sea, we grew up there. It seems like Essex had quite a big soul scene eventually as it moved into the 80s, you know, with, you know, places like the Lacey Lady and Chris Hill and all DJs like that. It definitely did. I don't think it had it in that particular bit I lived in particularly. There was a club called the Tartan House I remember going there, I won some tickets to a soul night there and they had touchdown, did a PA for Ease Your Mind and it was, yeah, that was quite a, and that's the first time I heard expansions, Loinlison Smith in a club, which was like, I can remember thinking, wow, this sounds great loud. generally most of my friends weren't really into the same sort of music as me so nobody ever wanted to go to these clubs and a lot of the clubs like the tartan house always had a bit of a reputation for being like quite a violent place so they never wanted to go there i'm not going there it's crap music and it's you're going to get your head kicked in so i'd always struggle to find anyone who wanted to go there's a place called the embassy suite in colchester on a sunday night and that was quite I think by the time I learned to drive and I had access to a car, it kind of finished. So it wasn't as... There were some parts like Canvey Island, I think Chris Hill's thing. That was quite a long way away. Essex is quite a big place. So there was... And I'll tell you what was good about it. There was quite a lot of good radio shows. So on Saturday night... Friday night, there was some good shows where you could hear a lot of good, you know, the latest music and whatever, and it was good, well, I discovered then you could actually tape stuff off the radio, and so musically, I heard most of the stuff. on radio more than in club I'd hear it on radio first then maybe hear it in a club but maybe that's maybe why I'm I suppose I'm not as into records that purely sound good in a club though I can appreciate it I'm generally I'm probably a little bit more of a someone who likes things that sound good at home and in a club. I guess your first break in the industry was actually working in a record store in London. Can you tell us a bit about that? Yeah, I was very lucky to get that job because I really wasn't qualified for the job and I was just lucky that I was speaking to a guy called Steve Goddard who was a DJ from London who used to DJ on some of the pirate radio stations and he... He'd advertised in Record Mirror as somebody who had a record-finding service, and I got in contact with him because I think I wanted a copy of the James Mason album with Sweet Power of Your Embrace. And I bought it off him for £15, which is quite a lot of money. then and it arrived and he said I'll knock off £2.50 because it hasn't got a sleeve and I said that's no good I want it with the sleeve and I actually phoned him up to sort of not to have an argument but to sort of say you know I really like the sleeve. And I ended up having... He ended up saying, I've just been offered this job in this record shop in London and I'm not going to take it. Are you interested in taking it? Because I think we'd had a couple of chats on the phone. Would you be interested in going? Not taking it, but going for an interview. And it's a record... Like a new megastore... at the opposite end of Oxford Street to where Virgin was, kind of near Selfridges, but a bit further, near Marble Arch Tube Station, in fact. And, yeah, it was like, it never really worked, this record shop, because it was just the wrong place. They just didn't have enough passing trade. But it was great for me, because it just got me to London, and I started meeting lots of people, you know. people like Jonathan Moore and Mark Moore and lots of these sort of people came in the shop and people I'd read about in Blues and Soul or in that magazine Morgan Kine had a magazine called The Soul streets yeah street sound was it street scene maybe street scene yeah yeah and i think when i first started so i went for the interview and they gave me the job and i was like the the buyer for the soul dance disco type section and um we actually used to do okay but i just think as a as a general the shop itself didn't did it was just the rent they were paying it was never going to work so i worked there for about nine months And during that time, it was just when house music was first, I think the Jack Your Body came into the shop as an import, like the first or second week I worked there. And a lot of the early house music, Anthem and Can You Feel It, all those early, not all of them, but lots of early tracks and DJ International. along with loads of really good hip-hop like Eric B and Ultra Magnetic MCs and all that sort of stuff. It was a fantastic time for music. And I suppose also it was when groove was a real phenomenon, a real big movement, so there was lots of... cutouts of old James Brown albums and you know my lunch I could go up to like Groove Records in Soho and Reckless Records and there's lots of other record shops in the area so it was a really exciting time and also a time I got heavily into debt buying a lot of music and not Didn't, didn't, didn't, not really spending my money on food and things like that, which I should have done. But it was a good, but it just got me to London because I was so paranoid that I was going to get this job. The shop was going to go out of business. I was just going to end up back in Clacton-on-Sea not knowing what I was going to do with my life. So... And then I got from the D-Mix, where was it? It wasn't called D-Mix then. Rough Trade had just taken on Rhythm King, which was like a satellite dance label of Mute. And at that point, they hadn't really signed that many people. I think they put out a couple of things, which Jay Strongman was involved with the A&R and whatever. And they just, what, Rhythm King. said they wanted somebody at rough trade who was like kind of knew a bit about dance music who would take care of the distribution and be their man at rough trade so i went for this job and uh yeah, I got that job. So I got, I was, I managed to leave the record shop before it went, went out of business. And, um, it was rough trade was a tough one for a while because rhythm King wasn't really a full-time job. So I was just doing anything to sort of keep myself busy, photocopying sales figures for people and had some pretty, and then just tell us sales. And for a while, it just didn't look like it was going to. Rhythm King weren't doing great and there wasn't any other labels no but you know and but eventually I mean I started doing it managed to sell some some of the sort of like um more dancey stuff from factory into some of the dance shops but just there wasn't enough stuff that a lot of the dance shops just weren't interested in buying I was supposed to open accounts with Groove Records and City Sounds and their equivalent in Manchester and Nottingham and a lot of them just weren't because they said, well, we don't really want the stuff on Rhythm King, and though some of these old 52nd Street or certain Ratio tracks are quite cool, you know, it's not really that exciting to us. So, but luckily... what really changed it is Mars Pump Up the Volume came out on 4AD and that was actually a massive record and Rhythm King I think got a bit disheartened with Rough Trade thinking oh this indie distributor aren't actually good for dance music they were blaming the fact that records weren't selling on Rough Trade but actually Rough Trade were fine it was just if you made a record that actually people wanted to buy so Mars came out and that kind of I think that was actually opened the door, that record, for a lot of people, DJs, starting to think, oh, I'll have a go at making a record, because it's CJ and Dave Durrell. So sort of Tim Cinnamon made a sort of, almost like a copycat of, it started off as a mega mix of Rhythm King tracks, but it was kind of, it was what James Hamilton would have called a volume pumper, and it was like a sort of house track with lots of... groove samples in it and hip-hop and whatever you know so all jack you know loads of samples in sort of like five minutes and that was a big hit for Rhythm King and then all of a sudden it all snowballed now I went from having nothing to do to just like actually making myself sick because I had so much to do and lots of other labels came out the woodwork and other indie labels started putting out like Big Life started putting out dance music and it got very very very busy And I ended up approaching Rough Trade saying, why don't you give me my own label? And then some of these ideas I'm giving other, some of the other labels we distribute, I could be, you know, putting into that. So they did that and I started up Republic. and that was cool for three years. I just never quite had the commercial success I think they thought I was going to have, because I think they were hoping I was going to have a pump-up-the-volume or type record, and I did sign some... I should have had a hit with Turntable Orchestra, but we didn't quite put it away in Phase 2 Reaching. It was a great record, but it just wasn't quite... commercial enough i don't think as as something like an adiva or a chanel one man which are the ones which crossed over so so yeah so that that rough trade were funding this label and i kind of did it i was doing the anr so i signed i guess when that started what i thought everyone was going crazy for acid house and i thought a lot of my friends were into things like blaze and um The guys I knew, I've met in London, these were into more and more soulful stuff from New York. And I thought, no one's really interested in that. So that's something I haven't got as much money as like the likes of FFRR and Crystalis, Cool Tempo, who were just paying ridiculous amounts of money for records. If they were interested in a record and you were interested, they would get it because they'd be offering like 10 times what you'd offer. So I thought, what can I actually license, which those guys don't want? And so I picked up some of these garage records from, or I call garage records, from labels like Quark, like Blaze Can't Win for Losing, and Arnold Jarvis Takes Them To The World. Time Out, Turntable Orchestra Phase 2 and did a compilation album called The Garage Sound of Deepest New York which was kind of like introduced that sound to probably a lot of people in England and it was, that was probably our finest moment because it was I just managed to get the timing just right where everyone was a bit fed up with Acid House and we carried on with doing putting out that sort of stuff but then I realized there's limited licensing music from other labels in America it was kind of it's cool to make your name or whatever but it's not as a long-term way of running a label it's it's it's you're not actually signing artists and you're not you're not originating any of the products so I tried to start originating some British products so just a step back you put out a compilation of paradise a paradise garage compilation did you actually go to the paradise garage or is you just licensed the music that you knew was being played there. I never went to Paradise Garage. I should have gone. I remember being in New York. First time I went to New York, it was just about nearing when it was closing. And I was in New York on my own. and I guess I should have gone really but it was one of those ones where I just didn't really know anybody I just arrived in New York I had a few meetings with some labels I did go out to a few clubs but I think the night I could have gone to Paradise Garage I think I'd literally arrived that evening and I just thought I'd I don't know New York. I don't know. I mean, I don't. First time I've been here. But it's something I regret, not just to, when someone asked me that question, I said, yes, it went. Yeah. But going back to your time at the label, you also put out your first track through that label. Yeah. And you know what? That's one of the best things about the label for me was it actually taught me about releasing records. I think. What working in distribution was cool as well, because it kind of, I knew the mechanics of actually selling in a record to the shops. And, you know, when I was working for Rough Trade Distribution in the last six years, months when we were like really distributing a lot of house music and house music anything the house in the title you could probably sell 5 000 of it was just there was a shortage of house music when you phoned up a shop and said we got a track called rock the house now was it house oh well at 15 you know it was just there was just a shortage of of house especially on uk labels because a lot of these shops didn't want to stock imports because they were too expensive so i I felt very in touch with what shops wanted and what would sell and what wouldn't sell. But it taught me about the mechanics of releasing records. And on my label, on Republic, the first release was my first record. It wasn't a particularly, it was a volume pump. It wasn't particularly a great record. it was something we'd spent ages on in the studio and we'd been just learning how to make music and there was lots of technical problems and just problems just not knowing what we're doing. But I guess when you release it and it comes out and it actually does okay and some people like it you think well it's not obviously as bad as I thought it was because by that time you're so fed up with it and it's not what you wanted to make I don't think many people go into the studio and their first record is what they had in their mind to go into the studio to make I think you kind of come out with something which hopefully okay but it's nothing like you just went in with some ideas and some records and you know you weren't necessarily don't have the um ability to turn what you've got in your head into something that's coming out the speakers that's something you learn to do over the course of you know more more sort of hours spent in the studio but initially you just just learning what what what the machines do and you know the difference between a closed hi-hat and an open hi-hat and you know all that sort of stuff so um but it taught me about the mechanics of releasing records and i've never been frightened of putting my own records out i'm not being someone who's because i often say to people who send me something as a demo of my finished record but they're chopping it around the labels why don't you just put it out yourself it's just easier to put it out yourself you can do exactly how you want you're not splitting the money with anybody else it's just you know you're not going to have somebody telling you to change the bass line or turn the vocal up or put less of the vocal in it's just you can do it your way the way you want it and um ultimately it's probably if it's any good unless there's certain labels at certain times where you're going to sell a lot more because you're on that label but generally it's probably going to do about the same whoever releases it you know so um I always say to people, you know, it's probably best to just do it yourself, especially nowadays. It's quite interesting you say that as a label owner. Yeah, I mean, you know, yeah, as a label. I mean, people, and I say it to people as a label owner who send me music, you know, I mean, because I don't want to, Zed Records, not wanting to digress on that, is mainly me. So we might, mainly my... production so we might release the odd record by somebody else but generally most of it's me so unless somebody sells me something sending me something which I absolutely love I'm generally probably not going to put it out so but so I say it to people a lot you know you probably want to just start your own label up and you know you're only going to build up a rep by putting music out so you're going to have to start somewhere and um it's not that difficult, you know? And I think that's what taught me during those days of like pressing up records with Rough Trade and making a few mistakes, putting ridiculously expensive artwork on things and thinking, God, we've sold 9,000, but we didn't make any money because I had a gold label and I didn't realise how expensive that was. You know, nobody told me, actually, this is a really stupid thing to be doing. So, but I guess by the end of that three years... We had some successes and some things that weren't so successful and I'd started trying to originate more product by the end and we put out things like a Dante feel it and a few things which British productions and whatever which I thought were cool records but we weren't selling enough that it was worthwhile for me and Rough Trade and all these other people to be involved. and they went out of business after three years or went into liquidation, so that was over. But then I suppose after that, when I did make my next record, I thought, well, I'll just press it up and put it out myself. I wasn't thinking, oh, shall I try and send it to him or send it to him? Because I hate doing that, and I've never had much success doing that. The only time that's worked is Junior Boys Own, but most of the time, and I've sent I tend to just send it to them and not tell them it's me and just see if they like it. And generally, I've never had much luck with anyone even listening to it. Well, I guess there's quite an interesting story with Raven Maze with you sending a record to a label and seeing how that worked out. There's quite an interesting tale there, isn't there? What happened is I did the Raven Maze track in Clacton-on-Sea with Mike Shield and whatever. and when we finished it I just felt, I thought this is the sort of record that would sound, I mean obviously it's a big cut up of Exodus together forever, I'm not going to pretend it's a really, we re-originated it, I heard Todd Terry, he did a track called Yeah Buddy by Royal House which sampled Exodus together forever. Nobody seemed to know over here anyway that it was a sample and I just thought I'm sure there's some other bits in that which I think you could do something else with it. I just thought so we did it and I thought it had a probably a little bit closer to the original. The Todd Terry one was a little bit more loopy. And when I finished it, like I said, I thought it would do better if it came out on a cool American label rather than if we just released it on Republic. So I was licensing quite a lot of stuff off Quark. and I'd had a meeting with them about, I think, licensing phase two. It's a mystery for a re-release of Reaching. We're going to put that on the B-side. And I said, well, rather than me paying you in advance, do you want to just take this Raven Maze track and we'll just do a swap? So they put it out. And I think, yeah, it did... Came out as an import. Everybody thought it was American. I found there's an album by The Reflections, a 70s soul album. We scanned in a picture of the guy from the sleeve and put a New York backdrop behind it and used it as a press pick and just made up this ridiculous story about this guy. prisoner and uh he just he was he was playing in a steel band in disney world or disneyland just just nonsense but it got printed quite a few times and the picture got used and i think we even got as far as doing some interviews but the guy that got to do the interviews quite found someone who i think i don't think he really pulled it off as actually knowing what he was talking about but those doing those sort of things are fun because you just think are people really going to fall for it? There's a few people who know about it here. Is somebody going to blab? And no one did. And yeah, no, it was, you know, it did pretty well in terms of sort of getting to like the sort of what's well, but got to number one in the Cool Cuts chart and all those sort of charts, which were sort of supposedly the buzz charts at the time. So yeah, it's fun. And I've done that a few times with the Head Boys and with the first During Negro single. I did that on New Groove and it comes over as an import. I suppose... It's like now being on, I don't know what a cool label is at the moment, but I mean, you know, like maybe Hot Creations was two years ago. I guess when your record, if you're on those sort of labels, you've just got an instant advantage. You know, everyone's going to listen to it at least. Whereas if you're on a... a label that's sort of like no one's heard of or on a label that's maybe perceived as like oh i'm not sure about that label you're gonna have to have an amazing record for it to sort of pull through that sort of like slight barrier of resistance i guess did you feel like you had to be an american producer to be taken seriously in house music in the uk or was or or was it was that real advantage being an american producer just in the uk Because that was the kind of thing with Raven Maze that you were pretending to be American. Yeah, I just think it, I think most, I suppose in those, there was some, I suppose most of the house music was coming from America. So probably 70 or 80% of the house music was, you know, from Chicago or New York. And there was some UK stuff, but there wasn't that many really good UK house records, I don't think, in the early... days i think something like um bang the party release your body was one of the first ones you thought oh that's actually almost as good as an american record you know and voodoo ray guy a guy called gerald that was there was a few you know there was one every three months but a lot of the uk stuff was more the volume pumping sample filled it wasn't what we you know the the the sort of train spotter types would say was they wouldn't take it seriously so i suppose you got taken a bit more seriously if you're on Trax or on Quark or on Easy Street or one of those labels that are putting out the creme de la creme of house music. So I don't think you, you know, but I think obviously that changed over the course of the, you know, as we got you know towards the late 80s early 90s there were more you know UK productions that were you know just as good but I think initially the Americans did invent it and they were better at it for a while you know so I think it definitely helped being on one of those labels not necessarily that you're American but I think it definitely, it was a leg up and I think it definitely, people took you a little bit more seriously, I would say, if you were on those labels. So how did you come up with the name Joey Negro? You know what, I came up with it very, I wish Raven Maze was my name. I wish that was the name because I like Raven Maze as a name and that was one which I... I'd used in this stupid board game when I was sort of like about 12 and I just thought I can't remember how I even came up with the name but it was just one which I thought let me use that name for a record and then when I had the record on Newgroove I should have used Raven Maze again for that but I think at that time Raven Maze was me and the other people I'd done Raven Maze with and we never had the discussion about who owns the name. So I had to think of a new name. And I'm normally quite good at thinking of names, but I'm not good at thinking of names under pressure. So if I've got to think of something or with anything like that, I've got to think of it in the next five minutes. And I couldn't think of a name. And I got to the point with new. groove where they'd agreed to put out the record it's all cool but they said oh we really need the label copy by next friday because if you don't give us it by then we're gonna have to put this record and this record out before your record you're gonna go back to after christmas or something like that i can't remember but it was basically get get it by you gotta get and i just couldn't think of a name and um I just had names written down. I suppose nowadays, the internet and things like that, it's much better for inspiration. And I just couldn't think of a name. And I had a pile of records next to my desk at work. And one of them was Pal Jari Reach Up To Mars. And another one was J. Walter Negro and the Loose Joints, Shoot The Pump. and I just I think I've written down loads of the names from these records and just thought I'm going to put what that sounds like together and I thought out Jerry Negro that sounds like Hispanic New Yorker because I always when I first heard Shoot the Pump I heard it on I think I heard that on Radio Luxembourg actually or maybe it was on it doesn't matter where I heard it but I heard it as it was always pronounced as Jerry Negro Or J. Walter Negro. So I always thought of it as Negro, not Negro. But... So, yes, I thought that'll do for that record. And I was never even that keen on the name. But I never thought I'd ever be being addressed as Joey or Mr. Negro or any of the things which I've since been called, you know, face to face. Um... and I put the record, the record came out in New Groove, it did alright, it did reasonably well, it didn't, wasn't like as successful as Raving Maze, but you know, it did, you know, people liked it, you know, people like Graham Park played it a lot, it got into, got into lots of charts and whatever, all that sort of stuff, and about a year later, I did a new EP, this was after I'd, Rough Trade had gone out of business and everything I had a bit more time to spend in the studio because I was doing the label full time up until then, The Republic. And I'd done this new EP and it was disco-y, quite deep house meets disco sort of stuff. And I was going to use Raven Maze, which is what I should have done. I was going to put it out as Raven Maze because I thought that's the name I prefer. And I played it to a friend of mine at the time who was a DJ. And he goes, oh, this doesn't sound like Raven Maze. Raven Maze was Latino. This sounds like the one on New Grooves. You should use that name. And I just said, oh, yeah, maybe you're right. And I you're not quite sure sometimes you know you take out sometimes take other people's something i've learned not to do actually so much but i mean unless you get the same opinion from a lot of people then they're probably right but not to be too concerned and i should have just started but yes i put it as jerry jerry negro and then that ep came out and that did pretty well and One of the tracks from that EP I remixed. There's a girl, Debbie French, who had been working with an act called In A Life, who I'd sampled. In A World, actually, not In A Life. In A World, who I'd signed to Republic, sort of like an indie dance act. And I liked her voice. And I got her to come and sing on this remix of a track called Take Me Higher. And it ended up... becoming do what you feel which got signed to virgin and it was actually a big track and um that's when basically at that point i think i'd had a that um jerry negro kind of became a name that sort of became known i suppose i became relatively well known with clubbers anyway and i think once you've done that it's um and I did a lot of around I was I was kind of like the hot guy of the month for sort of like six months you know it's funny because I've so many it happens every now and then you know every now and then all the time the new producer will come along and he just has that flavor of the moment and he'll be big for six months and then sort of like a year later people say I'm a bit fed up with him now I'd like this guy instead So you know, that's just the nature of dance music. But I was that guy for a while and I did lots of remixes and I got to the point probably where I overdid the remixes. But I guess I just, I've been working to get into that position for quite a long time and then all of a sudden I was in the position. I was, from having like, nobody was interested. And all these labels were phoning me up wanting me to do remixes of quite decent, you know, a diva and quite decent acts. So I was in the studio a lot doing remix after remix. This is around 93, that kind of time? 92, yeah, maybe 93, 92, 93, yeah. So, I mean, I did some, I mean, it was, we had a good... I suppose when you're doing that many, it is a little bit formulaic because you kind of don't have time to regroup and you know, you're doing a remix and then you're kind of doing another remix, then you're doing one of your own tracks, then you're doing another remix. It's kind of like a, but I suppose I was getting, it was a good time for music generally, you know, there's lots of, around that time it was Steve Saul Curley and I suppose... first wave of MK and, um, Basement Boys, that sort of early garage stuff, you know, so, um, Marshall Jefferson, I guess. So there's lots of great music around anyway. So I guess it must have been an interesting time. You know, you first hated commercial success, but you know, you're obviously still producing dance music. Has it been hard to kind of combine those two worlds, the commercial part of it and also kind of, I guess, underground music as well? Has it been hard to ride that line? I don't know. No really, I've always been someone who likes some commercial music. I'm not a snob, so I like some commercial music. I don't like a lot of commercial music, but there are tracks that have got, especially in the 90s, lots of great house records go in the charts. You know, I mean, lots of good ones. And, you know, so I've never been sort of like wanting to be Mr. Underground. I mean... good music's good music do you know what I mean it's what you personally like so it's not always um about sort of like liking something because it's underground or not liking something because it's was underground once but now sort of like it's got in the chart you can't like it anymore so but yeah no I mean I've I guess you know when you when you've had what I've also not wanted to do is when I have had commercial success I've not been like, oh God, that's all I want to do now. I just want to have hits because I know that that's going to be a musically a massive compromise. You know, so when, for example, when I had hits with later on with Jakarta, with that stuff. I did have the chance to just go more down that road and become a bit more of like that sort of big room DJ and go on tour with Jakarta as a live thing. And I didn't really want to do it because I thought it's just going to be music. I like what I did as Jakarta, but I don't want to just do that. I don't want to go on the road and be playing records, you know, having to play in bigger rooms, playing a bit more. just playing, I don't mind when you're playing a DJ set, playing some of that sort of stuff. In fact, I like that, but I don't want to just be, go down that road musically, just basic. So I've always been conscious of sort of like, having a bit of commercial success is nice, but not being totally sort of like, making that your only goal, that you just want to have hits and anything that's not a hit. perceived as a failure. Because it's interesting, you know, you've produced straight up pop records like, for example, Take That, Relight My Fire, which perhaps not everyone would know that you were involved with that. How did that come around? Well, I suppose that that was at that time where I was doing quite a lot of remixes. I was signed to Virgin and I'd had a couple of singles out with Virgin and I suppose I was seen as Mr Disco. So... People wanted a disco remix that my name was probably suggested, oh this is who you need to talk to. And this guy who I was friendly with said, oh I saw Take That's A&R Man the other day and he said he wants to take that to make some disco records so I recommended he spoke to you. So I had a meeting with this guy, Nick Raymond, and he said, yeah, I want to take that to make a disco record. And I played in Real Light My Fire, Dan Hartman, and I said, well, this is a great song and it's become an anthem, like an end of night anthem in the sort of cool clubs in London, but it was never a commercial hit. And he said, this is perfect. So, yeah, so it was funny because what was interesting about it, I suppose, is We kind of did the backing track. It was when I was in, I used to work with a guy called Andrew Livingston and we did the backing track and I used, on the backing tracks, a lot of the same people, like the guy who played on the Universe of Love, played the bass on that, John Noyce, and the percussion player, Robin Jones, a lot of the same people as on that. But, and we had got live strings and whatever. And then we, the guy, take that guys came you know it's obviously slightly different them being there than your usual singer because you you had girls hanging around outside the studio and that's sort of the thing which you get when you have these people who you know actually really you know famous on a sort of like you know a sort of celebrity sort of uh level that have instantly identifiable as they walk to the shop you know someone sees them and then someone else tells somebody else and all of a sudden you've got this crowd of sort of like girls outside the studio but I suppose what was interesting about it apart from there's a more backwards and forwards with the A&R saying you know you submit it and they like it but they want you to make changes which is always the way when you do their sort of pop projects you've got to be prepared for that sort of where you're happy with it but they're not happy with it and then they wanted to get Lulu back to do the bits and I think we wanted to get Gwen Guthrie or someone like that and they said no it's got to be you know that would have been amazing but I guess I think Nigel Martin-Smith who managed to take that also managed Lulu so that was the reason and to be honest with you I thought Lulu did a pretty good job. I mean, I was skeptical before she came in, but I thought, you know what, she's definitely not, she's not ruined it. She was, you know, she, and it probably went with Take That better than maybe, I don't know, you know, someone who I would have chosen. But I guess what was interesting is like, so we finished this track off. It's all, a lot of the stuff is the same sounds and same things we're normally doing. You're hearing it. everywhere joe you're hearing it coming out cars you're hearing it on eastenders you're hearing it and that's just the you see the power of actually the major label machine and having these sort of like you know this proper pop act front your material as opposed to a dj or dj producer like me who's not someone they're going to put on the you know in the bit of the sun where they write about that sort of thing or do you know i mean that that and and the you know the even though I was signed to Virgin Records and they made a couple of videos, it wasn't, they never, I never had that machine behind me and I was never, I was never probably machine worthy, you know, because I'm not sort of like four good looking young guys who are, you know, you know, got dance routines and, you know, it's, but it's interesting seeing how much difference. the same you know we could have done real light my fire with a you know a uk singer and a gwen guthrie singing the the lulu straight lolita holloway bits and it probably would have sold a few thousand take that do it and it sells millions and that's just because you've got to be realistic about what the audience is and once you get to that point where you're getting that much exposure, it's like if you made any sort of half-decent dance track the theme for EastEnders for a week, it would be a hit. That's why you get these things, they're on an advert, doesn't necessarily mean they're good or bad. but they've got the advert gig and then all of a sudden it gets to number one because exposure is so much. Yeah, it was interesting. I was reading that a while ago you were talking about Daft Punk's Get Lucky around the time it came out and you wasn't disrespecting it in any way, but mentioned that, you know, if say a new disco act had made that exact same record, you know, how much would that have sold? And it's the whole, I think you would... basically saying it was the marketing machine behind it. Yeah, it definitely was. I mean, I think it's a good record. I played a record, but I don't, I think it's, it was a good record, definitely, but it was an amazing marketing campaign. It's a phenomenal marketing campaign. And I just think a record like that to be a hit, it needs to be. it needs to be by a really popular act it's like I was saying to someone the other day Earth, Wind & Fire September came out now by an unknown act it would sell nothing but if it came out by Beyonce or by it would still be a massive hit so I think to be an unknown act I think just like the Get Lucky, though it is quite a catchy record, it's just not the sort of record that's going to get to the, without the marketing, I just don't think it's going to get to the place it needs to get to, to get heard by the people who would buy it. I mean, I know quite a few people who are not really into dance music, probably only hear what's in the charts. oh, it's the best record for ages. They love it, you know, but they're probably not hearing any other new disco records. They're not going on to track source and beat port and listening to the new disco top 100. So it's just got the exposure, which is, you know, people think maybe now in the internet age that it's easier. I don't think it is easier. I think it's harder, you know, because I mean, without that machine behind you, you i mean back in the in the 90s or in the 80s you could get a record that just some club play could get released it would sell enough to get into the charts and then once it got in the charts it could then build up and it could become you know a sizable hit but the initial impetus to get it in the charts was clubbers buying it that can't happen anymore because apart from the fact that lots of people are getting it for nothing, sales are just spread out over such a long period that you can't hold back a record and build up the demand to just release it after three months of club play, bang, it goes in at number 25 or number 15, and then... it gets to a new wave of people because now you can't hold back a record because people are just going to get it for free. So I think that's the big difference that's kind of ruined it a little bit for underground records getting in the charts. That's exactly what they've done with Storm Queen. It's number one this week, isn't it? Yes. They actually managed, I don't know how they managed to do it, but I guess it's the crossover from Club... to radio. They managed to hold it back from the general public for seven weeks until they brought up enough demand and it did actually go number one. Yeah, and it's also, I mean, especially the original Morgan Geist record, when that came out on Environ, you would never have dreamt that was the number one record. Never in a million years. It's just like saying, I don't know, an underground resistance track's going to get to number one. It's just not going to happen. But it's just a and interesting the trajectory of that record and how the MK remixes now that dub version became an anthem and then I suppose it's just become so big that they've kind of managed to get on radio in the way that they used to be able to do and they've got that radio version of the MK dub the vocal version that's kind of never been out before but that's gone to the masses now That's not clubbers, I mean, that's clubbers, but mainstream clubbers. So we mentioned you were Mr Disco, obviously. So you've been collecting that music since, you know, 80s at least. Is there still stuff on your wants list? Yeah, I'm still stuffy, of course. I mean, I'm still collecting records, but I'm not necessarily always collecting really expensive records. I think one of the great things with Discogs, for example, is you can go on there... and you can just like say okay someone like Patrick Adams I think I've got most of his stuff but let me just have a look what else he's done because sometimes he's done something with a pop act which maybe you didn't know like I found that Patrick Adams and Stan Lucas the guy did the Dazzle album have produced a track for Hot Gossip the British dance troupe who did I Lost My Heart to the Starship Trooper oh bloody hell they've done a track with them so I ordered it it's a picture disc and but it's just it's a sort of record i would never have picked up in a second-hand record shop because you're you're coming from a different angle so there's another guy carlos franzetti arranged strings and i like a lot of the stuff he arranged the strings on and you can just look and see not i don't know if discogs is completely right i don't think it's probably still missing stuff but i suppose at the it's a different reference point to coming than just looking through records in a record shop where through the country and western section or records get misfiled because of the sort of sleeves they've got or something might just have a completely off-putting sleeve so i'm still buying i normally buy probably buying three or four records a month or whatever but they're not necessarily um and they're not always disco records i quite like that you know i buy rock records or when i say rock records i don't know things like there's a guy jess roden i just bought one of these kind of blue-eyed soul type sort of stuff but um it's more a bit more rocky than it is uh solely but so i mean it just might be something you hear and you check out something but i i still like buying vinyl but i don't buy much new music on vinyl i suppose So, you know, obviously you've got a pretty wide taste in music. Do you get to display that much in clubs when you're DJing? I try to, but I don't think it always, it's not always what people want. I think a lot of the time, I mean, when I was playing in Paris last weekend and I played for three hours and I did play a lot of different sorts of music. You know, I mean, it's all predominantly. house and disco, but I played some sort of more, I suppose, I don't know what deep house is anymore, but I played some more sort of deep, what I would call deep house, and some more like more, almost, I suppose I quite like some empty sort of slightly techy stuff, but not much of it, but there's certain tracks like that, and I quite like coming out of something like Jackie Moore, This Time Baby, and into a techno type track. I think that's interesting and I think if you get it right and sometimes you don't do get it right and sometimes it sounds disjointed but I think it's I like that idea of the contrast of craft work and then something more soulful and then something more something modern then something old I think not always like complete juxtaposition but you know you might play a few of a certain type then change and I think but I don't know many people actually want that I can remember playing in a club a few years ago and I was it was more of an electro club and I got booked in this and this is kind of around the time of like early get physical releases and whatever so I thought I quite like some of that so I played some of that and I could see the guys who come to see me thought oh I was selling out but I thought I don't actually get the chance to play this very often and it's not like that's all I played I played a lot of what I normally play but I like to mix in a bit of that because I thought I quite like I mean as long as you like it I think that's the main thing I'm sure, I think the best DJs, you've got to sometimes challenge the audience and whatever, but I think it's become more and more normal. For DJs, you just play one style of music all night. That just seems to be, like for house music, you go and see a deep house guy and he just plays deep house for two hours or three hours and you go and see another techno guy and it kind of tends to be that people don't tend to switch between genres as much. It seems to have seemed a bit old school. personally that's why I prefer that and I think it makes for a more if you get it right it makes for a much more I don't know if I'm into the take people on a journey type thing but I think it's more of a an interesting idea of what that person's into musically than if you just hear you know three hours of records that sound pretty much the same as each other So what do you think of Deep House nowadays? You touched upon it, you don't even know what it is, but it must be quite interesting for you. You were getting Larry Hurd records the first time around, you produce his Akabu, which is quite a musical Deep House project. But it's the new sort of Deep House, isn't it? Which is kind of just house, really. I mean, when I was at a club in Shoreditch a few weeks ago with a friend, and it was all Deep I thought this isn't really, it's kind of, it's not really commercial house. It's kind of like, it's house basically. And it seems to be like the sample chord, you know, like when people have sampled a chord and they play the. chord up and down the keyboard that to create uh chord changes that's kind of like the style and little snippets of vocals it's kind of like the a cross between mk and uk garage with a little bit of deep house i guess i i I mean, you know what? I think it's a lot better than a lot of the clubs who were probably playing that were playing five years ago. So I think it's not bad. I just find some of it's a bit formulaic. Like any sort of... I suppose when that whole funky house, sulfuric type thing was happening, that got very boring for me. But I think disco music, everything gets boring because it just gets... too much of it and that's all you hear everywhere so you know within what is now considered deep house those tracks are really like um just think whole evening of it gets a bit bit samey for me it must be quite weird you know you've obviously got a lot of contemporaries on i consider you primarily as a soulful house dj i guess but a lot of your contemporaries have very much you know stopped playing anything with vocals and gone down I mean, just in brackets, deep house. I don't know. Is that a weird thing or is it? Yeah. It's a shame everyone's ditched Soulful House, but I can understand why. I mean, people, you know, ultimately want to, you know, want to be contemporary. I think people are worried about being like, oh, that's a bit old hat. That's old man's music. I don't want to play what's perceived as music that's out of vogue. I can understand that, but I just don't want to play... If there's still good Soulful House being made, and I don't think there is that much, but there's still enough to play three or four records in a two or three hour set. I just think it's not always about playing new records as well. It's like sometimes I hear someone's set and it's like they're playing all new records. And I think, well, why don't you play... If you don't find any... current vocal records you like, why don't you play a few old ones? There's loads of bloody good old ones. So I think it's important, you know, the fact that everybody's ditching is kind of sort of going down that road makes me not want to go down that road, to be honest, because I just, I've always been a bit of a resistor to doing what everybody else is doing. So much as I, you know, I play some of it. definitely not going to go 100% into that that sound because I just I just don't want to be doing what everyone else is doing I think and I don't I'm not I'm not a sheep I don't want to just think well that's what you know everyone's playing that style so I need to jump on that bandwagon though I like some of the music and I'll play some of it, I'm not going, I prefer to play it, in the way I just described, where I'm mixing it in, with other stuff, and not just, not just switching, be one of those people who plays that style for sort of a couple of years. And then when that goes out of vogue, I'm going to move over to what the next sort of like, you know, the stuff that's the mainstream underground, I suppose. It annoys me a little bit that people do that, to be honest with you. I think, well, what do you actually like? Do you like playing contemporary music or do you actually like music? And if you really like music, surely you exactly what's in vogue at the moment, you know, so, or did you ever even like that stuff before, or did you just play it because that was what was the music of the moment, so, but I mean, you know, different strokes of different folks, some people's taste just seems to change with what's in vogue, I mean, there's some people who it seems to me just... If it's what's in vogue, that's what they're going to play. So, you know, I've got the luxury. I'm not a jobbing DJ in terms of not working in a bar with a bar manager saying, fill the dance floor, otherwise you're going to get, you know, next week's your last week. So I understand that I've got a bit more leeway to sort of like, you know. play music that maybe isn't necessarily what everyone else is playing and without sort of like you know getting told to get off the decks and I guess I think the fact that I think also I find sometimes people just frightened of playing vocal records they think somehow people are going to come over and say get this off it's a load of rubbish I just think you can play, it's still a house record, it's still got a loud bass drum and an open hi-hat a lot of the time. It's not like you're playing a bit of classical music in the middle of a house set. I think sometimes it's just like people think, oh, you can't play that. I've even thought that myself. I've been DJing, the guy before me has been playing completely different music to me. I think, what in the hell am I going to play And I'll start off maybe playing a little bit more, you know, just to bridge it a little bit, a bit more instrumental, not instrumental, but not out and out soulful house or, you know, long sort of like flute solos. And after sort of like 15 minutes, 20 minutes, I realised that really you do what you want. Do you know what I mean? Within reason, you've just got to be true to what you like, you know. people are actually very, they're there to have a good time, they're not going to sort of, you know, you're going to get the old person saying this music's shit, but, you know, I'm sure Larry Levan or any DJ, everyone's going to get that, you know, you've got to, you know, you've just got to see past that, and there's nothing, like I, was saying to someone the other day, there's nothing wrong with clearing the dance floor if it's with a record you love. I was going to ask you how many records you own, but that seems like a little bit of a cliche question. So instead, how many hats do you own? How many hats? You know, that's it. You're very well known for your hats, Dave. I know, you know what, it's true, and I haven't actually got a hat on at the moment, but You know, I do ponder with the hat situation. I think it's really time to stop wearing hats because the hat becomes sort of like... What's the word? You just end up sort of... It becomes a thing where you think, oh, God, I've worn that hat. I've had photos of wearing that hat. I can't wear that hat anymore because nowadays with... with photos on facebook and all these things you just end up um i don't i did i'm sorry i don't like i've become the hat guy which is never sort of something i really wanted to be but um how many hats do i own i don't know 30 40 not that but i i like but the buying hats is cool i mean i like buying normally buy them online but uh because i've got a really really big head i have to order x x XXL or at least XL for it to fit me so you know you can buy some cool hats online but yeah I don't know if I'm thinking I should just shave all what hair I've got left off and just grow a really big beard or something and just completely change my image and just become more go for the Grizzly Adams sort of like stroke sort of, I don't know, you know, someone who's a bit on death row type look. Thank you. you
