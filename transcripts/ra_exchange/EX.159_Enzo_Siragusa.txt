Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Big things often have inauspicious beginnings, and that's certainly the case with the cult East London party Fuse. which Enzo Siragusa started because he didn't feel like going to bed come Sunday morning. Now in its fifth year, Fuse has become an integral part of Sundays for a certain strain of London clubber. Siragusa and friends have also begun taking on the wider world of dance music, throwing parties in Ibiza, and curating a label that's elevated their brand of dance. of dubby house music. He's certainly been on the rise these last few years, but "Syragusa" is no overnight sensation. "Fuse" is the culmination of more than a decade spent in the rave and behind the decks. R.A. Saoirse Ryan caught up with him in London recently to find out how it all came together. And in the face of a venue sw- and a new focus on the White Isle to gauge where Fuse might be headed. It's been an incredible year for you over the last two years especially. I think one of the major things that I'm sure a lot of people know about is you joining the Artista Life family which is also known as Desolate. Is, I mean, going from something like, you know, obviously doing a lot of your own parties and then going to such a professional organisation, is it very different? Are things still the same? Now you just have a bit more, I suppose, organisation with your calendar or how does it work exactly? I think things have changed a bit. I mean, it's definitely more organized. Yeah. Like uber professional. Does it take a lot of stress off? It does. It takes a lot of stress away. You know, I'd always had the bookings managed by kind of myself and... and my business partner, Tony and Fuse. So, you know, it was, and to be honest, you know, I used to reject a lot of bookings because I didn't really, I didn't like to play too many gigs unless it was the right kind of place. And I had Fuse every week, so I sort of... had my fill and I was quite happy but since joining them you know obviously things have pushed on since then to another level and there's a lot more bookings and I think having an agency that deals with that kind of thing that is professional and does that you know makes life a lot easier because I don't think I would be able to cope with the amount of I mean I've booked the wrong flights back, you know, I've turned up to the airport and realised that I've booked the flight the wrong way around, you know, and stuff like that. Yeah, so I would imagine, yeah, it's a lot less kind of scary when you're turning up to the airport and you know it's probably... Yeah, I mean, there's a team, you know, behind the scenes there doing logistics and all sorts. So, you know, it's a very professional organisation. Do you get much say in, and all the bookings are actually floated by me. and I still have that say over the gigs that I do, yeah. Okay, cool. It's not like, oh, by the way, you're playing here next week, you get to decide. Actually, no, I don't. No, I decide every single gig, actually, pretty much. Obviously, these guys are very experienced and they've had dealings with most people all over the world. Sure. And so they know who I, as a DJ, should be. playing for and who has the right kind of you know set up for me sound wise and stuff you know I'm quite specific about that so you know they're and they're clued up and they ask all the right questions you know okay so I mean what where they because you've a long relationship with let's say for instance local dice and I'm sure with the artistic guys Were they an agency or a group that you aspired to be working with at such close parameters a few years ago? I mean, yeah. Desolat was something... I used to love the music. The stuff that Martin and Dice were doing, it was something... That was a cornerstone of our sound, I suppose, going back about... four or five years ago um so yeah of course you know when they came calling it was it was amazing because it you know it was something i'd looked at and watched evolve and you know i thought that's you know that's pretty cool you know they've come from music to setting up this this record label from you know someone like localized playing at um DC 10 and his career evolving into a label and an agency so you know yeah sure I mean you know who wouldn't aspire to something like that of course of course do you think I mean that particular group and have really grown their fan base over the last few years you know the success has been like incredible Does that ever worry you that, you know, something might be getting too big and it's becoming like music for the masses because your history is very underground, you know, a lot of kind of intimate parties? Do you feel that you would in the future like to become so big that you're playing these huge arenas or would you like to stay at one level? Have you ever thought about it that way? I have thought about it. I think my feeling right now is I'd want to keep on the vibe that I've always been, which is kind of underground. I don't really subscribe to this. notion of underground it's not really you know I think for example with with Fuse we never professed to be underground even though people would call it underground and you know like now that the press is kind of getting a little kind of on the bandwagon and looking at me and looking at Fuse you know it's like all of a sudden it's the freshest thing to come out of London's Underground whereas I'm 35 years old I've been playing for 20 years nearly don't feel that fresh but I think it's more sub-cultural and with any sub-culture it becomes more available you know and it grows and and i think that's what's happened with with with fuse and i want to keep it on that level you know i'm never gonna i don't see myself in big stadiums if i'm honest with you it's not my thing you know i i play based on a connection and a feeling and i kind of want to keep that so that's that's that's where my what where my head's at and I'd like to play more parties like Fuse and stuff like that, that kind of size. Yeah, and coming back to Fuse then, what, about five years ago or so that you launched? Firstly, tell me, for anyone who will be listening to this, because we have a global audience that may not have been to a Fuse before. It's a weekly Sunday party. You can probably explain a little bit more to people who don't know it that well, and then we'll go into it a bit deeper about where Fuse has come from. So tell me about Fuse as a party. Yes, I mean, you know, it started as a weekly party. You start around 10 in the morning. So it's an after party, you know, and... And, yeah, it grew quickly. It took us by surprise, to be honest, how quickly it grew. And, you know, it was, the party was actually an afterthought because we were actually doing another party at the time on a Saturday night. What was that? Circuit at Home Bar. So we used to do Circuit at Home Bar, followed by... platinum we used to do the circuit after party at platinum and then we used to roll on to fuse at 10 and do that all day long until about 10 o'clock at night so it's pretty hardcore times mondays were fun yeah that was the after party for fuse um but no i mean you know um We were really just a bunch of ravers putting on a party at the time. Circuit was actually the focus for trying to create something and then it just happened to be the party that we weren't putting any effort into that became the special one and grew really quickly. So who was the core behind Fuse then from the very start? So, yeah, I mean, it was, you know, there's a core, you know, group of party people, really, which is what it was. You know, when I say, you know, I came from the dance floor, I actually did. It was a bunch of us that was just, you know, partying a lot in life. and going out, you know, just partying hard. So, you know, the core is still there, the likes of Rich Next and Seb Zito, Luke Miskelly. So they were there from the very start. Yeah, yeah. Ben Rao, Chris Moran, you know, and... Alex as well. Alex Arno was the older head amongst us, really. Like the daddy. Yeah, he was at the time. He was just a bunch of nutters just running around, you know, getting smashed and partying, really. But yeah, you know, and then it formed this, you know, group of residents formed and we've added to that, you know, the likes of Stuart Hawkins and, you know, Itetsu, Sam Bellis, people that have... have really come from our dance floor and the group has grown and it's still growing, you know. Do you think, you talked about the kind of immediate success pretty much. Any time I was at Fuse, I think I was probably there in its second year of being around and it was always packed. Why? Every Sunday? It's funny because I've been partying a long time. I've been raving a long time. And what I found in that party was for the first time in a long time was people were coming there and there was people that were having their first rave experience like I had when I went to Dreamscape in 1994. And we were just like... walked in and was just like wow you know this is amazing you know and and and that had a massive impact on on my life I think people were having that kind of experience there and we don't have that many clubs in London for people to do that in anymore good clubs you know with amazing sound where you walk in and and you know all your senses are just sort of you know, tantalised and played with, you know, and that's what, that's what 93 did, you know, with, with Fuse Air, you know, you'd walk into that courtyard, into that venue, off Brick Lane, which, was buzzing and you'd see all these weird and wonderful and colourful people from all walks of life so it was a real cultural melting pot if you like and then you'd walk into the room and it was like oh my god it was like this red raw and you know heavy sound you know like bass heavy sound that just sort of would vibrate your body you know and it was just like do you think Something about that room, I don't know, I could never put my finger on it, but it just had this vibe. I don't know whether it was the sound system, whether it was the red off the curtains, the low ceilings, the platforms. It's all of those things. Yeah, something though. Yeah, you know, I've... But the thing is, we've done parties in other places. We've done, I remember we've done a few warehouse events and we kind of recreated those things. We looked at those elements, you know, and the sound is something I've always focused on. massively you know and you know i you it needs to be shaking your sort of trouser leg and vibrating in your chest you know you gotta feel the upper upper sort of part of the kick sort of frequencies in in your chest you know the highs have to be comfortable in your ear and that's what you had you'd be enveloped by that sound and i think that that The red lighting in there, albeit super basic, you know, it's just I kept it red because I felt it just added that warmth and that feeling that came with the sound. Sure, especially at winter. Yeah. It was nice. It felt really homely in there, didn't it? Yeah. Yeah. And so that sound in there, did you work a lot with it or was it just pretty much the system? No, I mean, the original sound system we had when I went in there. It ended up being my monitors. We had five Mackie speakers positioned in various places and they would overheat during the day, like one by one, and we'd have to switch it off and fan it from behind and then switch it back on again. But we had the most amazing sub. It was just some old school. I don't even know what it was, what make it was, but this sub was massive. And I realised that's what made the difference in that room. So when we then persuaded 93 to upgrade the system, we had everyone come in and I worked with all of them to listen to the sound and we settled on DMB. So the DMB Audio Technic Sound System. And it was just like that made a big difference, huge difference, and really took the party to the next level. And then I took those Mackie speakers and I put them on. all of them in my booth. So I was just like... They're not going to waste. Yeah, exactly, yeah. So it was a DJ's wet dream, really. You know, you're just like enveloped by sound all around you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So was the sound in the DJ box quite different then? Well, I think because the sound was so loud on the dance floor, it kind of filled the room up. anyway and the whole room was just full of bass and the Mackies that we put in the booth you know just added that high frequency for when you were DJing you know but the bass was just all around you anyway in that room. You talked about people from all walks of life, which is, you know, absolutely so true. You can kind of go in there and there's like every culture in there. And yeah, a lot of people know each other. It's kind of like... family like when you've been gone quite a few times you know familiar faces but because you're in the middle of east london you're in the middle of brick lane you know so much goes on there you have to be very strict on the door and one thing fuse has done is door pick right yeah um i've seen a lot of people get knocked back a lot of familiar faces obviously get in very easily but how do you i mean it must be such a hard job because i think it's only problem one of the only parties that really does it so as strict as Fuse do is it because of where they are Or is it because you had an element that you had to try and get rid of at some point? Or how exactly did you decide you were going to do that? I think London changed around the time that we started the party. When we started the party, we had two security staff. And within a few months, once this party took off, it was like the Wild West in there. It was pretty ridiculous. And that's not sustainable. It's like someone could get hurt. There needs to be an element of control. Now, around that time, I think clubbing changed in London. We were saying about less venues and stuff. And the crowd changed. Just in general, in all clubs, I felt around four years ago. And it was like the masses became interested in, you know, in the music, which is cool, which is fine. But at the end of the day, we had a small club and it was like the Wild West and it needed to be controlled. So, you know, we decided that we'd introduce that door policy, you know. and where we were picking people based on a vibe and we'd build that party ourselves because it was the only way otherwise it wasn't sustainable it would just probably disappear because your core crowd of people that made the party what was so special wouldn't want to go back you know and that certainly did happen for for a while but then we turned it around and you know in that time i think i've seen in the last five years you know we've probably gone through four or five generations of clubbers and seeing new people come in you know and then for them to have their first sort of real sort of getting into it and culturing their vibe and their like attitude towards dance music and then going and exploring sort of other parties and other sounds and stuff and it's it's it's been quite cool and i think that's what's made, you know, the party interesting. And, you know, when I say like all walks of life and all types of people, you know, I was meeting people in that party that, you know, hadn't been raving for 15 years and had just stumbled across views and gone, this is what I've been missing. People seem very committed to it, so much so that I've even seen pictures of fused tattoos and everything. Yeah, it's crazy. Do you think that's because they just feel like it's somewhere they always know they can go and have a good time? Me, me. It probably means, it just means a lot to people. I remember when I was younger and growing up, you know, I was really influenced by the parties that I used to go to, the raves, you know, I used to collect the flyers, you know, I used to buy the tape. you know i used to you know buy the merchandise you know yeah yeah my wall was covered in in flies you know and and so it you know it really it meant something to me and i and i think that that's you know that's maybe something that that fuse has done for for some people you know it's meant something to them so which is good you know yeah cool so You guys were, I suppose, the victims of this whole issues with East London and licensing and cancel and everything and resale. 93 feet east which is where Fuse was for so long was closed down and you guys had to move right? Yeah. And we went to Village Underground which is I suppose in that it has just one room but it's a much larger room. Yeah. But how did that feel when you found out? Did it come to as a massive shock? It was a huge shock, absolutely massive, because, you know, it was unexpected. And, yeah, you know, it was... How did you find out about it first? I just heard, I remember I was just at... out and about on a Friday night and people were coming up to me going, have you heard about 93? Have you heard about what's going on? So you just heard through hearsay. Yeah, and then I saw her in the news, you know, and it was like, it was just unbelievable, you know, and we couldn't get hold of anyone. It was Saturday and we can't get hold of anyone, you know, we're supposed to be doing a party. So, for anyone that doesn't know, basically on Friday night it got raided by... A ridiculous amount. 200 police. 200 police. Two helicopters or something. It was just, it was ridiculous, you know. Why do you think they did that? When there was only about 15 people in the club? Yep, yep. So, I mean, my theory is that local government are just trying to clean up that area, you know, re-gentrify it and, you know, turn it into like every other street in London. So I think it's obvious. It's the gentrifying the area and raising property prices and making money. which is sad because, you know, Brick Lane is an area that, you know, culturally has meant a lot to London, I think. And certainly, you know, not just our scene, you know, the music, but, you know, artists and all sorts, you know, and any... kind of art form I think it's been a very important location and I just see that changing now yeah and being pushed out yeah and so when you guys had to then I suppose look at right what are we going to do with Fuse now that this venue's closed how did you make the decision to go to Village Underground? I think at the time, we just didn't know where to go. It was one of the first phone calls we made. We had a chat with the guys and, you know, it felt really right, actually. When we met with the guys, you know, they're just super professional. Got an amazing team of people there. And once we did the first event there, it really did feel like it was an obvious next step. You know, 93, we kind of cobbled everything together. It just came together somehow. I'm not sure how. It was hard work, to be honest, doing an event there every Sunday and managing it all. You know, the place was a bar. It wasn't a club. The team behind it weren't geared up to dealing with this kind of thing. So it was a huge amount of work. So I suppose when you've gone to Village Underground, a lot more things are ready, kind of made and tailored for what you're doing. Yeah, you know, and the guys that work there have a huge amount of experience. They've come from, you know, festivals, from other clubs in London. You know, there's an amazing team there. So, you know, it's enabled us to really start looking forward to where we want to take the party. And, you know, it's actually been really... really refreshing, you know, so, you know, every cloud has a silver lining, I suppose. And what was the feedback like? Because obviously, as we were talking about, there was a real intimate, like, homely, warm vibe in 93. The sound system, very different club, Village Underground, it's large, high ceilings, big rooms. It's the complete opposite. Yeah, yeah, pretty much. Do you feel like the party's changed at all or is it, you know, what have you done to kind of keep that, you know, I suppose, vibe? as you mentioned that was at 93? So, you know, I think the first thing that you should always do in any situation like this is not try and recreate something, you know. So we've reinvented it and, you know, we work very hard on the feel of the room. Done a huge amount of acoustic treatment for every event, you know, with draping and stuff. We add more sound. We make sure that from the DJ's perspective, when you're in that booth, it's amazing. I put a huge amount of focus on that. I bring in a DJ technician to make sure that... that the DJs are comfortable, the sound's good in a booth, so that, you know, the party starts in that booth, which was what we kind of had at 93. You were kind of enveloped by the sound, and it was just really nice to play there. So I've made sure that that's continued at Village Underground, and then on the dance floor, you know, the sound is good, and it's, you know... Because the first time we went there, it was overwhelming. It was a big room. Sound was all over the place. We had three days to organise the party. But I have to say, you know, we're pretty much there now, you know. And by having the right sound in the booth and for a DJ to do his thing and play and express himself, I think that comes across on the dance floor in the end. And I think that's what's happened, you know. I think the crowd, obviously at first people are going to go, this isn't the same. Well, no, it's not. you know just look around you this is something else now you have to make the choice as to whether you like this you know and then you know people have you know and then they're just like yeah I do like this this is good you know and it is a good experience and then we've kind of built on that and it's its new thing and musically you know we've we've started to change a little bit maybe you know maybe we are playing a slightly bigger room sound if you like but still our sound and it's our take on it and and i think all the djs have loved playing there you know so it's just given us something else it's just refreshing yeah something new For so many years, you guys were booking people, you know, the headliners when you do those parties. For instance, like a Cassie, a Loco Dice, a Toby Newman, you know, some major key players within the industry. They were free parties, so it was free to get in unless it's, you know, a New Year's Day or whatever. Do you feel there was ever any, like, resentment from other promoters who were doing maybe the same artist but on a Saturday night and charging 20 quid in or something like that? Did they ever feel like... I never got any vibes off anyone. But, I mean, yeah, sure. We did a... It was free, but it was just a different concept. And it was an amazing experience for the DJs to play. you know, at Fuse and, you know, so it was, and a lot of these people I'm kind of friends with. Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they're there at the party. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, and a lot of the time, a lot of DJs would come and play unannounced and just because they wanted to play, you know, so I don't think, I mean. if anyone resents that then yeah i mean you know fair enough yeah um so You were talking about maybe like your new sound. I mean, I know you're doing a lot of work in the studio at the moment. I've heard some really good things about your studio from various people. Tell me what's in your studio. What are you working with now? This is based in London. Yeah, so we're in Hackney. The boys and I have put all of our stuff together. What have we got in there? We've got a Moog Little Fatty. which gets some really nice bass sounds out of. We've got a Jomox 888 drum machine. We've got an old... And we've got my favourite piece of kit is a little Jomox M-Bass O1 drum module bass. It just does kick drums and bass tones. And so, you know, I'm just having lots of fun with that. Yeah, lots of pitching. Yeah, just some really fat sort of sub. bass tones really which is kind of a few sound yeah um i use a uh uh the apollo um the uad apollo sound card which is which is amazing so yeah i mean you know it's we've got a few bits and bobs in there you know it's got the deck set up and now i'm sampling a huge amount of my old jungle records i was gonna say to you come from quite a jungle drum bass background So you do use quite a lot of that in your own music. Yeah, I have done, yeah. I've sampled huge amounts of Jungle, you know, all the stuff from like 93 to 95, which was when I was sort of really going. Just getting into it. Yeah, you know, when I was just discovering, raving, you know, and it was, you know, my mind. So it's been nice to bring that kind of sound into my music, you know. And, you know, Rich, Rich Next as well, he's kind of from that era. And so we've both sort of embarked on our jungle techno. Yeah, that's nice. It brings, I'd say, a nostalgic feel. So... Just, you know, the next step, I suppose, was moving to Ibiza because you're doing the weekly party there. I take it the main reason that that was your, you know, step to move for Fuse at Sankey's. Yeah, I just couldn't help myself. I needed to do something every week again. Yeah, fair enough. And then you get stuck into another club every week. So we're at Sankey's. How has that taken off? I'm loving it. It's taken a few weeks to get my head around the sound. again but you know we worked on the sound I've had some really good guys come in and help me some sound technicians you know that really know their stuff from one of the guys from Cosmopop so we're there now you know and it's a place where I know I can walk in and play records you know play my vinyl I've got no problems And now it's time to just do kind of what we did, you know, at Fuse when it was a weekly party and start to build something. Sure, there's a lot of familiar faces over there. Loads, loads. It's just London, right? Yeah, pretty much. But we've got, it's funny actually, because we've got a lot of Italian and Spanish crowd more so. It's a real, which is what Fuse was in, you know, when we were back in London anyway. Yeah Because Ibiza has changed so much as well. You know, it's become very focused on Super Club. I mean, it always had its Super Clubs, but you know, you're talking about the way Ushuaia is now. It's, you know, a lot more money-oriented from my experience from living there years and years ago. So you have some small, like Sankey's would be, I suppose, a smaller club in comparison. Do you think that in the future you would ever go to one of the larger ones if it was offered to you? Or would you like to keep it at the kind of smaller stage? I think I have everything I need at Sankey's. I mean, it's, you know, we're only using one room. It's got three rooms. You know, you could stick near enough 3,000 people in that club. But right now it's a one-room party. We wanted to focus, it's myself and Seb there every week as residents and we're flying over one of the other guys or two of the other guys. from our roster with the odd guest here and there. Tinny joins us quite a lot, but she's on the island every week doing Tinny and the Gang. And she's one of my best friends, so it just makes sense. you know but we're keeping it like that so I mean yeah I've got everything I need there I've got a club that you know David Vincent there just pays attention to what I'm saying about the sound and is investing more money in the sound you know when I'm walking around as I do listening to each speaker and trying to EQ stuff and saying we need another can over there and you know so the guy listens to me so I don't I've got everything I need. Perfect, yeah. And I think that sound, I suppose it's hard to explain this for people who may not know the Fuse sound as well. It's quite dubby. I don't know how to explain it, but it has its own particular sound. Dare I say Fusic. I know. But it does... I've often heard people say, oh, that's a real Fuse sounding tune. I don't know what it is, but it has that kind of... I'm not sure what it is. I mean, look, as a DJ, I play right across the board. And people that hear me play, especially when I'm playing six hours, will hear me go from house into techno, into deep house, back to techno. Sure, it has a dubbier sound, and the sound that we've made, obviously, was a sound that was very much... There's lots of, like, sounds, isn't there? Like, you know, like, percussion sounds that have really been processed a lot. Yeah, especially when you listen to the likes of Ridge or Oitetsu, you know, there's, like, it's intricate and it's deep, but always with that rolling... dubby groove and some interesting bass lines typically um i think it's a it's a sound which has come from from london you know it's london has so much we have so many so many different sounds and scenes and i think all of us have come from you know jungle drum and bass hardcore techno you can hear it you can hear everything yeah you know garage it's all there you know and um which i'm i'm you know i think it's amazing that we've got that and i mean it's brilliant you know but now i'm seeing this you know people you know that are relating to it and then they're starting to make it their own and people from outside of london actually all over the world now that are actually so i suppose getting into the sound and and it's sort of Do you think it works in Ibiza? Because I mean, I think last year was when I first started seeing, you know, these kind of dubbier sounds coming to the island where it was a lot more in the past houseier, tech houseier, you know, and techno, it was that fast techno, you know. Obviously with Tini and yourselves who've been doing parties there for a while. But there wasn't really much else options like that. You know, you might have Next Wave or, you know, the Romanian guys, but they've only really started doing some things in the last year as well. Do you think that... kind of more, as we were saying earlier, Underground Sound has become more popular. Is it exactly what the island needed maybe? I mean, how do you think it's transpired over there? I think with the big clubs, you know, they've... In a big room, you need a big sound. You know, I understand that. You know, I play in some big rooms now, you know, and you can't... You know, luckily, I get to play the warm-ups, but, you know, sometimes, you know, like, I take my hat off to the other DJs. You know, they're able to move a crowd, and you need bigger sounds to do that, you know. this sound is working maybe in... as we say, a bit more underground. You know, it's in the smaller clubs and it works. Why is that, do you think? Well, because I think, like I said, in a big room, you play, you know, you have to play bigger sounding music. You have to fill a room, you know, frequencies have to fill that space. You know, so you need open, big open hi-hats. Yeah, and like big... and you need big noise to generate the energy to move through that crowd and get them energised you know so I think in the smaller clubs you know you don't have to play that music even though some DJs turn up and do that and when we're turning up and playing something completely different and our sound is moving people in a different way rather than getting your hands up in the air you're putting your head down and you're putting your head down and raving you know and it's more in the belly you know it's somewhere around there you know so I think that's resonating with people and it's working. Especially in a club like Sankey's, for example, where I've got the sound that I want and I've got it sounding the way I want it, I can play that music and I know how it's going to work for people. And that's why I think it's starting to work. And people come there, they're having an experience on the island over the last few years, listening to this music, you know, and they're just going away, taking that and trying to do that as well, which is cool. It's evolving and people are getting into the sound. It's working on a life of its own, yeah. Yeah, well, that's good news. What are your thoughts on how, I mean, you've been going to Ibiza, I'm sure, for a long time. It seems to take, like, certain, it goes through phases. So you'll have, you know, a couple of years where there's no outdoor events. It's very strict. Police are coming down hard and everything. Then it will go back to these kind of beach parties and everything's okay again What's it like now? What do you see? How is it for you at the moment? Things seem a little bit more relaxed, certainly. You know, there was that time over the last few years where you couldn't do anything. You know, if you ran over a little bit, you had, you know, there's the fine. waiting for you with the police outside. You know, you couldn't do any parties on beaches. You know, I'm seeing more and more little underground, you know, naughty little parties popping up, which is great, which is what you need because that's where the magic is. I feel on that island, you know, away from all the big money clubs. I think that, yes, the island is changing a lot. There is a lot more money and it is becoming focused on that. But I think as a result, I think this year, I sort of saw this coming a while back and I said to the guys at Sandys, for example, it's about... Not being greedy, you know and and and keeping pricing you know right and not ripping people off because I feel too many of the big clubs just it's just silly money you know you throw away two grand like in a week or whatever and I said this to friends and stuff over there doing parties it's like you need to understand as a clubber myself you know I went to that island and went there not even just as a club as a worker You know, I was a worker there. You know, I was for years. And you had to pick and choose the parties you go to because you don't have much money, you know. So you can't expect the same person to go to the same club. Yeah, and you're not going to go to the same club, you know, three times in one week, you know, if it's stupid money to get in. You're going to pick and choose which DJ you're going to want to hear. So I think that there's a harsh reality coming to a lot of the promoters over there. And unfortunately, it's hitting a few people where they're not getting the numbers that they want through the door. I suppose it serves them right, though, right? If they're charging ridiculous money. Well, yeah, and I think some of the promoters, it's unlucky because the clubs have a lot of say as well. But I think this is a year where that... starts to stabilise itself because there's only so many punters out there and people need to be a bit more realistic and hopefully that's happening on the island you know. Yeah and you said earlier that you're playing just mostly vinyl now and some you know CDs, USBs sometimes. Are you pretty much going back to that completely? Yeah, I've gone back to, I only really shop for vinyl. Where? Mainly Dex and Juno. But, you know, and I try to get into Black Market as often as I can just because I love that record shop, even from my jungle days, you know. It's just, you know, it's got a place in my heart. So, you know, I... Yeah, I've gone back down that route, really. And, yeah, you know, I'm a multi-format DJ. You know, I use, you know, USBs as well. There's a lot of the unreleased stuff, and, you know, I can't play it any other way. I use, you know, some effects units as well. You know, I loop my vinyls using a cycloop thing and, you know, I use a Pioneer effects unit, you know, just to add incidentals and stuff when I'm in bigger rooms. But, yeah, you know, I've come from vinyl and that's always where my head's been at, so... What I can see, it seems to be the popularity for it is growing massively. A lot of people have just had enough with Tractor or whatever and maybe there's a lot more good vinyl at hand's reach now. Have you seen from someone who's obviously... booking so many DJs, playing with so many DJs all around the world. Do you think it's growing again? I think it's definitely growing. I mean, I've seen my record sales grow, you know, vinyl sales. So, you know, I think that, yeah, it's, you know, it's definitely growing. I mean, as a DJ, I'm able to buy, you know, some vinyl-only tracks, which I know there's only 300 being pressed. If I get one of those records, you know, I'm going to stand out. It feels exciting. Yeah, it does. It does. You know, so, you know, again, it's getting back to, you know, wanting to play music that no one else has got. Absolutely. You know, so you're going down that route. That feeling going home, what, in the car, on the bus. a big bag of vinyl and you want to go home and play it and that's the thing is having something tangible you know I mean I grew quite disillusioned with a lot of the digital side of things you know I suspend you know and I still go through Beatport and Juno Download and stuff because there is some really good digital music out there But, you know, I'm spending two or three days going through Beatport looking for tracks, coming out of it with three or four tracks. Going to a record shop was just amazing. Striking up a relationship, a working relationship, if you like, with the person standing behind. They know what you want. And they know what you want, you know, and you'd be going through those records and they'd be picking out these gems and, you know, and it's just, it was the social aspect of it was... was nice and even going with your tunes around to your mate's house and playing your records which you know we're doing now you know and it's like you know getting excited about that piece of vinyl and your mate's going oh I can't believe I didn't get that you know and it's it's that it's the social side of it you know which I don't seem to do with like when you've got just up with a usb um so yeah i mean i think we've we've covered a lot of basis now obviously um we talked about london a lot and personally i see it in a little bit of turmoil now the way the government are coming down on a lot of the events here does it ever worry you about your own event Yes, a little bit. I mean, I think that... I think that maybe government is completely out of touch with what people want and what people do in their spare time. There's no clubs in London, everything's been shut down. Licensing is just, it's more and more difficult to do a party now. And I'm seeing so many friends really struggling to put on parties. Our scene is one that, for me, is kind of in decline, really. And London was really the centre point of electronic music. basically yeah it was you know and and it's sad because i look at you know all these people looking towards berlin all the time and looking for djs that are from germany to come and play over here and i'm like one of my missions with fuse was to grow like a london scene with london talent you know we've got amazing djs here but the problem is we don't have much air time you know And there's guys that are just, you know, really, really talented DJs and producers. And we just don't get to play, you know. So, yeah, sure. For me, doing my parties, yeah, I'd like to do more in London. But, you know, to be honest, I can't find a venue to do them in. So let's talk about you're doing a label as well, the Fuse label. With the stuff that you're releasing at the moment, are you open to going on a lot of other labels or do you want to push things to your own? I'm a DJ and that's why I'm not a producer as such, even though over the last... 10 years I've become a producer I suppose I'm able to make music but my emphasis is always on going out I love playing records out in clubs I love the clubbing experience actually as much as actually DJing itself so that's my emphasis and I would be you know I'm open to doing stuff on other labels the problem is I don't have that much time you know doing up to five gigs a week sometimes. Wow. So it's, I wish I had more time in the studio, but already this summer I haven't done anything, you know. I've done a few loops on aeroplanes. Do you get any pressure from, like, your agency to do this? Not really, because I think they know I'm a DJ. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, you know, I could have spent time working in the studio and releasing music and going at it from that angle. But I've sort of got to this point through my DJing more so than the music I've made. Yeah, it's more fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, you know, I've got my labels. and I'm kind of focused on them really. So Fuse label, Fuse London, record label that you guys are obviously working very hard on. Tell me a little bit more about it. Is there much going on for the future? Yeah, there's loads going on. We've got two labels now. So we've got Fuse London which... you know, it's the original label. It's for the residents, you know, for the guys that are part of Fuse in London, you know, that I feel have come from the dance floor from Fuse. So there's loads coming out on that. You know, the likes of Rich Next have probably got an album coming. He makes like a track a week. Guy is just prolific. I've been working on a collaboration with Roscoe and Luke Miss Kelly and also with Itetsu. Collaborations with Seb. Seb's just like Seb Zito's on another level as well, production-wise. So that's really grown well. You've got even extended crew and family. Dan Lively and Dan Fazzarelli, people like... It's just loads of people like that that are coming from the dance floor that are making great, great music. Then Infuse we set up because we're just inundated with people making music which is kind of inspired by our sound. And they're from further afield. So yeah, we set that up. You have an opportunity now to... platform these people's music globally. And it is a platform and that's exactly the way I see it, you know, and because we've never come at this from, you know, the perspective of having like the big remixes and all that, you know, I did feel that we should focus on what we do and put that out there and present that without the remixes, you know, paying money for remixes to sell records. I just figured if the records sell, they sell. We had to pay for our own press when we first started and stuff, but now people are more interested in what we're doing. The records are selling really well, so yeah, it's a platform for the guys. And we're able to make our own music, our own sound, and not have to rely on bigger, more sort of... you know, famous artists to sell records. It just seems like so much work. You're doing a party in London, a party in bloody Ibiza, the label, and then also doing world touring. Like, how do you prioritise? I'm working seven days a week. You know, I'm working on my flights. You know, yeah, we're all working. You know, all of the guys are involved in... running things you know uh sebzio for example is doing a lot of the anr on on uh on infuse with me you know all of the guys are coming to me with tracks that are being sent because inevitably um i think i have about 2 000 unread emails in my inbox. So the guys have, you know, have their own email addresses. Guys are sending them music and the ones that really stand out, they're sending to me, you know, so all the boys are doing that, you know. Are they, because it's... You know, when you take that, I suppose, step from maybe just having a full-time job or whatever to, okay, dedicating then your life to the music thing and doing that full-time. Is that what everyone's done? Because sometimes that can be a really hard, like, sustainable... Some of the guys have done it. I mean, Seb took that step, you know. I mean, I took that step, what, eight years ago, seven years ago. It's a hard step to take. What were I worked in IT sales for nearly 10 years. Yeah, it's a scary sacrifice. Yeah, it is. It's a big step for anyone to take. But I think it's a necessary step. I think it makes you... You have to make sacrifices. And I don't think this career comes easily, you know. And you need to, you know, especially now, you know, it's not just about being a DJ anymore, you know. Typically, you do need to make music. you do need to network and you do need to, you know, create. Marketing genius. Yeah, it's everything, yeah. So, yeah, you know, it's not easy. But the guys, you know, most of them are making that step, you know, and I've certainly, you know, tried to support the guys in, you know, Roscoe's done it. you've got the likes of Jun Nakamoto, who unfortunately isn't with us anymore in London. He lives in Japan, but, you know, he's done it and doing really well, you know, but they're all making that step and really working on their careers, you know, and I'd say anyone that's looking to do this, that's what you need to do in the end, you know. I mean, it's good to, obviously, sometimes it's all right to have, you can have that nine-to But I think you still need to make a commitment to your career and that's going to mean that you need to dedicate time to it. Yes, you can't be just going out all the time. It's not going out raving, that's for sure. It takes you a few days to get over that. Yeah, it does, especially when you get my age. ♪ ♪ I don't usually like to And not to say that I won't rhyme. I just don't like to force it. If it sounds forced, I won't do it, you know?
