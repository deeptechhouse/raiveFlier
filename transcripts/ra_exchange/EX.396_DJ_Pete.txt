Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with DJ Pete. Peter Kushnerat has worked at Harwax, Berlin's most influential record shop. since 1991, making him its longest serving employee. In the last few years though, he has taken a step back from the shop. Rather than selling other people's music, he's focusing more than ever on his own. His output over the years has been extraordinary, from his 1995 debut on Chain Reaction with René Loewe as Scion, to his live project with Sleep Archive, TR-101. But it's DJing that has long been his main mode of expression, fueled by eclectic taste, an undying appetite for cutting-edge records, and his ever-evolving, technologically deft style of mixing. In this recent conversation with Will Lynch, Kushnerite unpacks how his approach has changed over the years, and how hard work has shaped his life in music. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with DJ Pete is up next. You've been DJing for years. Yes. Where do you place the beginning of that time frame? Was it your first gig or your first time messing around with decks or where did those 30 years, what was the moment where that began? Well, I would say DJing means... that you go to a place where people listen to music or dance and you are the person playing music, right? So I would not include like birthday parties or something like this. So I actually started with a little bit of a residency in Berlin Kreuzberg. and that was in 88 i have no exact date it was during the year and i remember the place very well it's a place we call a tanzkneipe it's actually a pub that has a dance floor but it's more like a pub so you also you do not pay entrance You just go there for drinks, and if you're up for a dance, you just dance. You've had several people there playing during the night. And so my friend and I, we were playing there not very often, but I think at least once a month, something like this. And what's your life as a DJ like? today like you're traveling a few times a month for gigs or something like that and you record mixes and or how would you describe it i would start with a quite of a big change that happened in the beginning of 2015 where i decided to live from being a dj before I was employed at Hardwax and that, so Hardwax was kind of the center of my income officially. But then I switched it around, went to apply for the Künstlersozialkasse. And now, actually, since 2015, I'm officially a DJ. So Sozialkasse, can you explain what that is exactly? Yeah, the KassKa. It's a social insurance thing for artists, but it's pretty similar to... being employed with some company. It's not really being self-employed. It's something in between. How did it go? Or how has your life been different since then? Yeah, so I spend more time on selecting music, that's for sure. Before, everything was kind of like in a rush. I felt myself being in a rush during the week because I had a half the week working at Hardwax and then during the weekends I had, let's say, up to two gigs, for example. I always felt rushed to select records. And nowadays I have one day at the record shop, the rest is just for the music, which is great. What led up to that decision? Or, you know, did you go through a period of just really wishing you had more time to DJ? I think so. I think so. And it's a thing where you try to balance out, yeah, what's happening in your life. I mean, there are also like more... I had more requests coming in due to working with a booking agency. That's also another thing that I've not really done before. I was taking care of my own bookings for many, many years. And ever since I worked with an agency, I had more gig requests. Therefore, I needed more time during the week for the music. So that was my focus. You said you have a lot more time now to select music. What are your personal kind of methods for hearing new music and processing new music? How do you, you know, cycle new records into your DJ repertoire? Just how does all that work? It's a bit under construction at the moment. There is, of course, hardwax and hardwax. like offer music that is not on vinyl right yeah on the other hand i really appreciate going through music promos that you got sent which accidentally happened a little bit I have no idea how that really happened. You mean you receiving all these promos? Yes, but not on purpose. So I was never signing up with any services. So that happened and I really appreciate that. So I go through all these and luckily it's a lot of music that comes across. I haven't heard about and also some stuff that is also showing up at Hardwax later or other record shops worldwide. I recently listened to the mix you did for Mary Lou's show on Rinse in France. I mean, that seems like a very carefully constructed, it doesn't seem like something you improvised or it feels like there's a lot of thought behind the structure and the flow of the whole thing. Could you just sort of walk me through how you did that mix, how you planned it and how you executed it? Yeah, so there is all the music that I really like that is off the regular 4-4 techno world. And mostly I focus on stuff that is very influenced from England. that has quite a lot of music elements in it, more than just beats or percussions. And these are sometimes hard to play, or not hard to play. Actually, I do play them in my sets these days, which is very good. Another thing we talk about later, I'm pretty sure, when it comes to technical stuff. So there's this great listening type of music with slight grooves. And these I like to put together. with some broken techno stuff, you know, to make it, yeah, like a listening experience that you maybe not have all the day. And how does it work in terms of, like, you just collect all your favorite stuff of the moment and then just let it rip and see how it goes? Or do you kind of have a plan in your head? It depends on what is arriving, you know, in my archive or music archive. And you see something like Dominate. which you want to share with everyone, and you see a kind of a similarity in things, you can put it to a mix, which I like to do that you see a little bit of a theme. So the Mary Lou mix has more like a... earthy, let's say, let's call it tribal, emotional type of flow, as well as some more techno-y stuff as well. Even though it all kind of fits together, or it all seems unified by a sort of feeling? vague theme, the mix of genres and that mix, and also just the way DJ in general, I find it's quite broad in terms of genres. Like there's a bit of qualm in there, like you said, broken techno and James Ruskin, classic techno, having that sort of open-minded broad taste. Do you find that sort of essential to, I don't know, your approach to listening to music, your taste in general? It helps a lot to keep yourself interested in music and to keep yourself entertained. I think this is the better way to say it. If there's harmony between two pieces of music that are from complete two genres, it's great to put them together. And you also mentioned that you find you're particularly taken by things that come from England. And I guess to some extent, that seems to be the case with your role in the wax treatment series and whatnot. Why do you think that is? Or what is it about music from the UK that kind of speaks to you? And I guess it's not just you, it's kind of the Hard Wax crew in general. What's the essence there that you find so compelling? Yeah, I think it's music that has this emotional, out-of-the-ordinary cutting edge. Yeah, all this IDM thing and dubstep thing, it's so hard to explain. It's more like a gut feeling. Yeah, there were also like several things from America and France, for example, that were like crazy cutting-edge music, you know, that comes together in dance music in a way. So, yeah, it's still about cutting-edge dance music, I would say. And is that sort of always been your, the thing that gets you excited is that feeling of something being slightly different or cutting edge, as you put it? Do you have a soft spot for just like straight ahead bangers? The straight bangers can also have some cutting edge vibes, you know. If you put this together somehow, it's quite entertaining, I would say. So when you're playing gigs, as you just sort of explained, your taste is kind of heady, can be a bit left field. Do you ever find yourself placed in front of a big drunk crowd that kind of just wants party music? And how do you play that situation? The good thing is, if you have kind of like, let's call it the regular fall to the floor techno entertainment running. You can add all this other music that you love, the machines I'm using for DJing these days. It's very easy to combine these two. So it really happens that you have a normal techno dance flow and you hear some melodic stuff on top of it. Kind of tweak it a little bit and give the melodic one a little bit more attention. while the dance stuff is playing and the dance is continuing. Yeah, it's always about balancing out things, but the regular dance vibe should go on, you know? Right. So it's easy for you to find a compromise, basically. Yeah, these days it is. It's good. You kind of mentioned the machines you use for DJing. What is your technical setup at this point? So I come from the very old school way of playing music with two turntables. So you play one song and the next one is mixed in the end of the previous one and then it's an ongoing thing. starting to do podcasts and do more designing podcasts in the computer. I was always thinking about, hey, I would like to bring this to the club, the way I design the mixes in the computer. But it's not very entertaining, from my point of view, to have somebody just there with a laptop and designing stuff on the computer. So would you use Ableton or something to do podcasts? This is the thing I do most of the time. And in the clubs, I'm using CDJs. These two worlds come together, the way Ableton works with music files and the CDJ world that comes together in a way. But of course, using CDJs is much more spontaneous, and that goes back to the more classic way of DJing. So at the moment, I have a lot of fun with DJing this way. So what is it exactly? You're pretty much purely using CDJs and you're layering different things on top of each other. How does it work? That's the simple way to explain it, basically. So before, you kind of mentioned that you would have the dance stuff just running and that then you would float something else in on top. I guess in terms of track to track, are you just transitioning from one track to the next, or are you kind of getting fancier with it? There's various things you can do, but mainly one track's playing, and instead of letting the break drop, I put in another song that is on the third deck, which is more the melodic song maybe, and then the break of the techno song. is filled with a complete new song from a totally different genre. And in the meantime, another deck is preparing the next song that is going to play for everybody to dance to. And all these happen at the same time, in a way. Merged. It's a lot of working on the EQ, actually, on your mixer, to balance all these songs out. But it's quite fun, because it reminds me... on how like working in a studio, you know, when you equalize all these channels, you know. So it's quite a lot of EQing work during the set. Do you have sort of like the rhythmic tracks, like the drum heavy tracks and then kind of less heavy things or more atmospheric things that you can bring on top? Do you have kind of... different categories of tracks that all work together? Yeah, a little bit like this. So there are sections in my, let's call it iTunes or collection of folders where you name your folders and you throw in all the music, like the more dance stuff, the broken techno, not really intro techno stuff, but stuff without percussions, but things that still have a groove. When I have a great track that I want to play, I additionally try and find a non-percussion track that matches this one to make it a bit prettier sometimes. But that's just one way. During DJing, during the process, you also get loads of ideas and then you switch around and then you're back. into the regular world of DJing, where you... I have an idea and you do stuff that is not that planned. So it's kind of a combination of tracks that you know work together, but then it's also, you know, a lot of it's on the fly. Yeah, yeah. Sometimes people come to me after my set and they were really liking the remix that I was playing. And actually, it was not a remix. It was some combination that I found out, you know. that works fine together, but sometimes things are really well matched, you know, as if they were made for each other. That's, you know, arguably one of the most interesting things that CDJs have introduced to craft of DJing is that you can hold these mixes for so long and, yeah, sort of make remixes on the fly. Yeah, I think so too. And do you do anything else with the CDJs, like looping or any of the other kind of functions? It's funny, I have to laugh about it because there are so many functions in the machines, but there's not so much time to do all that because you're kind of like, I need all that time to balance out. the songs to make a match between each other to make it sound good. So it's a lot of equalizing that I do more than playing around with the effects. But a loop function is, of course, something I do too. The way I was using the CDJs the first time, of course, nobody told me how to do it and I had no idea, so I just brought some files. on a USB stick and attached it to it. And it was quite okay, but I felt very clumsy and insecure the first time. So you have two decks running and it's in the mix and you just drop in a third one from the CDJ. I wanted to go back to the turntables as fast as possible because it was too weird for me in the beginning. But then... Yeah, I fortunately met some people from the company, Pioneer. They gave me an introduction, you know, how to use these. And ever since, I focus on that much more. Do you have any streak of so-called vinyl purism? Or do you have any romance for vinyl as a thing? I think so. And there are really places where I really like to just play the whole track and give all the respect to how the artist wants it to be, you know. And that mostly happens when I play house music or dubstep, for example, or reggae-related parties. Yeah, so I definitely like to play records instead of the same song from another device. Sure. Do you consider yourself a collector? Are you heavily into just the collecting music side of it? When I hear about other collectors, how they do collect and how they do this thing, I would not call myself a collector. But I have a quite big collection of records. But I was always a DJ and I think I will always be. So, you know, I never put too much attention to, you know, if the cover is 100% high quality. I can have white layers and I draw on it, something like that. So it's pretty, you know, regular, wild DJ way of dealing with records. Right, your collection is always in service of DJing, basically. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Over the years, has your method, your approach to DJing sort of constantly changed? Or have there been eras where, you know, you did it one way and then... rethought the whole thing or you know how is how is your method kind of evolved over time djing in general like to make things with rackets more than just playing a racket that was something that always was interesting to me i never was a dj that could scratch but like using the crossfader and making kind of like tricks with double copies. That was something I really liked back in the days. When I saw other DJs doing that, I tried it also and it was a lot of fun, you know. And these were DJs from Detroit mainly. So there, of course, there was Jeff Mills, then DJ Godfather, DJ Assault. These guys were all, yeah, more turntablist actually. There was several years where I really liked... that and I was DJing this way. Like back in the day you said like when you're younger? Yeah I would say something between 96 and 2000 something like that. When did you become a resident at Berghain? Yeah I think the first flyers that I found were from 2005 where my name was included. That's like right when it opened. I think so. I was not playing every month, but it became more and more, so... Fidel, he was resident already at the old place at Osgoode and Panorama Bar. And I was playing at the old Panorama Bar a few times with him. He recommended to have me as well for some nights. And so I continued to DJ at Berghain. And you know, at Berghain you have a four-hour set. And if you are a turntablist and do all this DJ action for four hours, it's quite hard to do. And people there, I think they do not appreciate it that much. They want to more keep an ongoing flow and, you know, have like a solid, more grounded dance, I would say. I don't know how to say it in English. Instead of getting confused by DJ mixed tricks, you know. So my DJ style changed a little bit. Sort of forced you to develop a more... of subtle hypnotic style instead of the you know more kind of in your face trick heavy style you have before yeah the well it was not super trick heavy but you know it was more important to keep the groove and keep the flow instead of breaks and all that stuff you know and rewinds and Did you find that you liked this new style or was your heart kind of still with the other? Yeah, it was not a thing that happened from one day to the next day, kind of. It's more adapting during a period of time. So, yeah, it was easy and fun to adapt. If you are DJing for four hours in a row, and in the end, you do not realize that the four hours passed already, that's a good sign. So I've had these moments quite a bit. What's your kind of ideal DJ situation? What's the sort of... party or the style of DJing that would make you most happy? It's not so easy to say because I have a lot of fun doing all these ways of presenting music like live projects, collaborations with other artists that I have and just regular DJing, more bar type of DJing that I do sometimes. So what would that be, like Paloma Bar or something? Something like that, or previous years, playing at the second floor or third floor at a big venue or something like that. In terms of the regular DJ, like techno biz, I would say like... three hours are needed for me to play all the new tracks with the sound and style that I want to present. So that's quite the best time to do, actually. In terms of time, you know. Yeah, sure. Like a three-hour set is the minimum. Yeah. You've had other projects over the years. You've made music as substance and you do... TR-101 with Sleep Archive. But it seems like DJing has always been your primary, I guess you could say, mode of artistic expression. Is that how it feels to you? Well, it's the easiest thing to do because collaborating with other people always needs a little planning, of course. It's kind of easy to deal with yourself when you're DJing alone or playing live. That is the thing that I always focused on because it was easy. But at the same time, the other projects are really fun, and I hope to continue them as long as possible. So let's say TI-101 and the Tiki Man show, for example. That would be something I can do forever. I'd like to talk a bit about Hard Wax, since that's sort of a cornerstone of your identity and your personal history. I mean, I imagine... Anyone that's ever kind of spent any time at Hardwax, or something that always crossed my mind was even working there one day a week as you do now, your exposure to new music is sort of extraordinary. Just sitting there with music that gets played in the shop. Do you feel like that was a significant kind of... on the music that you play and your taste? It definitely formed me the way I am today. It's much more the things... that are connected to Hardwax in terms of that move that happened in '96 when Hardwax moved to Porlinko Ufa and where some things came together, the mastering studio. So there were some things all put together at one place where you saw all this record-making process happening in a way. So next door was the place where the records were cut and then sent to the pressing plants. And at one point they arrived at Hardwax and we sold them. So this whole process to see that was very important to see how everything works and how everything comes together. And that's at the new location? That's the new location, if you want to call it new. Right, the current location. Yeah, the current. That was very important and quite unique, I would say. But most of the time, it was the music friends that I'm working with. working with until today, I've all met them through hard wax. So there's Sleeper Kaif, there's Surgeon, there's Vankeur, to name the guys I still work with frequently. Yeah, so that was the best thing that ever happened. At that point where everything came together and you meet friends that you still work with in music. And you're talking about, is it dub plates and mastering? Correct. So it's just, it's like right next door? Exactly. To the record shop, okay. Yeah, same floor. Right, okay. So even beyond the actual exposure to music, it's the shop's role as a kind of hub. It seems like it kind of had the most value to you. And am I right in thinking that the way you kind of joined that family or became a member of staff was just from hanging out at the old shop? It is. It's very simple. It's like that. So the old shop opened in 89 in Kreuzberg. When I found out about it, I just went there and... Ever since, I became a frequent customer, hanging out there, making friends with everybody who worked there and the owners. And at one point, one person invited me to work half-time, and ever since I'm there. It's very easy. And back then, I guess if I'm trying to imagine the culture and atmosphere of Berlin and its music scene in that moment in the late 80s, what was so striking about hard wax or why did it have this magnetic pull on some people? Well, I was just starting being interested in dance music, like in house and techno. You go to the chain stores and you sometimes get other records on German labels that licensed music from American labels, something like that. That was the stuff that I first bought for my collection. And Hardwax was the specialist doing direct imports, which was completely new to me. I've never seen that ever before. That was probably very, very special. And also, yeah, just to focus on underground music in general. That's what probably was totally different for me. So with that, basically, in the late 80s in Berlin, records from other parts of the world are... not available at all. They're not easily available. And so that was something special that Hard Wax offered. That's true. And because these rackets are not really, were not available in the regular chain stores. And slowly you find out about original pressings from the original country and records that just got licensed. So that's the thing that started to be interesting, to get the originals. And Hard Rocks was importing these. And was it interesting to find, for instance, there was house and techno music coming from the States, or there was this weird music coming from the UK that basically beyond hearing this, you know, killer music, was it also just, was there a sense of discovery of finding out that these things were happening in these other places in the world? That was also very interesting because first I, for example, I've heard about house and acid house music via the UK channels. So there was a bit, there was an acid house hype in the UK and this is what I've heard first. And then later I found out that it all was rooted in Chicago. That was interesting to see. Beyond hearing these records, what were some experiences you had in that time that sort of hooked you on this culture, on this world? You know, nights out or early Berlin techno moments? Yeah, too many to mention, actually. Well, on the other hand, there were not so many locations where you could go to listen to that type of music. So there were these locations. Number one, it was the UFO Club. Later, Tresor and E-Work. So to mention these, these clubs, Tresor and E-Work, were around for a long period. But in the very beginning, it was the UFO, actually. That all happened in 88 and 89 and 90, but then I think it closed. So this was the place to go to listen to that original House of Acid music. And that was really mind-blowing because you go to a cellar and there's no lights. There's strobe and fog and just music. you don't deal with the people, you're just there with yourself and listen to this crazy music. And that was, of course, mind-blowing because until that point, you only know about discotheques or concerts. So that feeling of being kind of submerged, or like as you said, you're not really in contact. people there that was part that was kind of like a radically new thing i guess it was yeah you of course you're on your own and with dealing with yourself and the sound and the music and But at the same time, you're united with everyone else in a way, you know. And it was a small, kind of like a small, very small scene. So, you know, everybody knew each other. So that's fun, too. It was radical. Does that seem like a preposterously long time ago at this point, or does it still kind of feel fresh in your mind somehow? It's fresh in my mind, because I'm still using music from that time until today. So it's very real and very current. What were you listening to before that came along? I don't exactly remember when I kind of realized that I like a certain type of music. So let's say, because we're talking about 30 years, so... which is 88. So on the radio and on the music TV channels, you saw something like Bomb the Bass. I remember even, I think, Inner City had a release. Todd Terry had videos on the music television, for example. And this was all stuff that... Yeah, it was pop music, but still the beginning of house and techno. Which records from that time do you still play now? You said there are a few that you still bust out. For example, there's always some Chicago Acid records that I still play, which is Chris Westbrook's label, Westbrook. There was Bam Bam, for example. I play these still. A lot of future. Yeah, it's kind of hardwired in my selection, in a way. We've kind of touched on it in moments, but in general, how do you think it is that you kept such a healthy passion for this in all that time? Basically, for many people, it would be hard to, you know, it's one thing to like this music for all those years, but you've been really closely engaged with it. Have there ever been moments where you just felt sick of it? Or, you know, did you ever feel disappointed with the new music that was coming out? Or have you sort of had a, you know, a healthy relationship with it the whole time? Well, I think we have to go back to hard wax, what it does on me. So it was really a great teacher. And hard wax with the selection there is today and there was back in the days. helped to be interested in all these types of music. And I think the first time I remember when people at Hardwax played me reggae music, that was totally off the all-day thing you were listening to. and studio albums, no vocals, and just the regular stuff, the regular instruments you hear in reggae. And there are all these albums, and when you listen to these, you can just hear the grooves, and it was very open-minded to listen to. to that type of music, you know. That was inspiring. And to keep on listening to reggae and techno and all these other styles, but not only now, through the whole period of time, to mix these all together in your sets and play different locations, that's entertaining and that keeps me passionate about it. I don't know if I would have been that passionate about techno for all the years if I just would play techno. Yeah, sure. Not sure. So it's kind of just a matter of, you know, broad tastes, having an open mind and sort of challenging yourself too, I guess. I think so. That's one of the key things, I guess. So there are some DJs that are strictly professional DJs in the sense that this is how they make a living. They play as many gigs as possible, festivals, whatever. They just, you know, best paid gigs as frequently as possible. And then there's DJs who are kind of on this different tier where it's slightly more, they're not like famous. They're respected. Yeah, DJ's DJ is sort of a vaguely defined term. But I guess the interesting thing to me is there are people who have this kind of mystique of like a headsy underground DJ with really good taste. I guess in general, I feel like you sort of occupy this space of play a few times a month or whatever. And then you still keep one foot in the door job at Hard Wax. And I guess kind of that level of commitment to DJing, is that something that... you're happy with that you would want to just sort of stick with forever? Or if it were up to you, you know, would you just DJ? Like, would, if, you know, do you have this sort of personal fantasy, a personal ambition of, of just, yeah, being a full-time DJ, I guess. Yeah, that's actually the plan. to stay a full-time music person now. The DJs DJ thing is interesting, the way you explain it. I like it very much because there are these DJs that are able to play festivals where you play in front of 8,000 people and then you can play the bar where it's like 10. So this is actually what's happening in my life right now and I like that. I do not like these things where you really exhaust yourself with playing three gigs in a row. healthy at all, I would say. The super popular DJs, and I see them arriving at the venue, they go on stage and they leave right away, and then they go run to the next one. This is the job I do not like to do, you know. I still want to have kind of a club or music experience during the night I'm there. You want to hang out and listen to other people play? Something like that. Yeah, that's a desired thing. And it's happening fortunately, you know. So that can go on as long as...
