Thank you. you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Titonton Duvante. Duvante is one of the most interesting producers to emerge from America's Midwest techno scene. Alongside the likes of Charles Knoll and Todd Sines, he crafted a trippy, jazzy and minimal style of dance music, finding a home on labels from Planet E to Seventh City and Metamorphic. Although he's been in the business for around 20 years, he's experiencing a resurgence. A new generation of DJs have turned his classic records into hot commodities, and he's rebooted his own residual recordings with a string of reissues and new productions. R.A.'s Matt Unicombe sat down with Duvante before a gig at Club Divisionaire in Berlin to talk about his history and his steady return to the spotlight. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Titonton Duvante is up next. Bye. you June is pretty busy for you. It's been, yeah, quite busy. In a good way, yeah. No complaints about it. And you're coming to Europe pretty often now. Yes. Has that always been like that? There was a period of a lull when I was living in Brooklyn. I was really concentrated on surviving there, but not at all. things have definitely started to pick up again, which is great. And was that just a coincidence or you weren't able to work on as much music in Brooklyn? I definitely was not able to work on as much music in Brooklyn, for sure. It was rough out there, but learning experience. Definitely good to be there, but also happy not to be there anymore. How long were you there for? Eight years. Okay. And you worked, you had a normal job there as well? Had a normal job. Oh, yeah. Doing what? Running restaurants. Oh, really? Yes. So, it was very time consuming in that city. Yeah, that's like a high pressure. Yeah, indeed. And was it good creatively as well? Like, were you hanging with other producers and, I don't know, going to parties? When I could. I was going to the bunker party fairly often, but as time went by, I couldn't go out as much. Stuck in the kitchen. Pretty much. There's actually quite a few DJs whose other career has been restaurant related. There are so many cooks around. The thing is that it's a creative venture as well as you're mixing elements kind of similar to what you would do in a... studio you know you're doing that observing or participating in the kitchen so there's there's definitely that so are you only into high-end like food now not at all okay not not even close guilty pleasures all all around yeah so yeah what made you move to brooklyn just was it the first time you lived outside ohio for an extended period yes And it was kind of more of a personal challenge, really. In Ohio, there's not so much going on. I really wanted to go where the action was and didn't know I was going to get so sucked into just trying to survive there. The transition was difficult. Did you already have the job sorted? No. Okay. Actually, for the first three months that I was there, I was doing music only, and that was also very charming. Did you have a studio there? Or you could do it at home? I actually sold all of my gear and was doing everything in the box, everything in a laptop, which was kind of cool. That was the influence of working with... A couple of producers, mainly John Tahata. I definitely want to credit him introducing me to working on the software sides of things. for sure. I was able to reduce what I had and still get the same amount of expression. So no complaints about producing in the box. Yeah. And you're still doing that? Because I was reading that you saw it on your gear. Early 2000s. Yes. I am still on the box. I want to get a few bits and bops. It's a great time for hardware. Seems to be a hardware renaissance, actually, lately. Yeah, I'll gather a few pieces here and there. I definitely like being able to touch and twist knobs. When I do my live PA, I have a few bits of kit and also play quite a bit live as well. Like you can play melodies, or that's all done on that? That's the way I go. I play everything. I just have to do that. That's the way I always have, and I don't see that method changing. I mean, enough respect for people that look at a screen and a grid and program that way, because I can't do it. So can you work on the road also? I can, yeah. It depends on if I want to bring a controller keyboard. I do have a very tiny Arturia 25. Brought a couple times and worked on tunes and remixes on the road, but usually the schedule is pretty jam-packed, if possible. I kind of liked it. Keep it moving. You know, just make it all count. If I'm going to take the journey overseas, just be as busy as possible. Have you considered moving over here? Quite a few times. And what's stopping you? Yeah, what are your thoughts on it? The thoughts are I kind of would want to ease into it. perhaps split, you know, find a sublet and try it out for like two months and just play as much as possible and then go home. I'm a bit hesitant on diving all in just because of the times that I have done that. All it takes is for one or two gigs to fall through. You know, that can be a bit frightening. So kind of working my way towards the stability in the scene to where I would feel comfortable making that type of move. Yeah, that's a big one. If you've lived in one place, well, if you've lived in your home country for your whole life. Just a bit of a worry wart in a plan. So that's part of it as well. Because it's interesting, like, well, at least from my perspective, there does seem to be a lot of renewed interest in your sound. And I wonder, have you also felt that or have you just consistently had... Because you're kind of the producer that the people who know your tracks really love them. People are very much into this residual... kind of deep, spacey techno sound. Okay, yeah. As you know, like the parties you're playing at, like, for example, I saw, remember the Slow Life Party at Hobbitossa? Yes. This is a nerdy, like, this is a, this is like a headsy party. Right. You know, the people who go there, the people who play there, they really know music. Yes, they do. So, I guess my question is, when you're one of these producers that's so, I guess, beloved by this group of people, have you just always, does it feel like there's new interest or have you always just had people really geeking out over your stuff? It definitely feels like there's... There's a bit of new interest, especially with a lot of younger producers, DJs, promoters. I've played for people as young as 22, 23 recently. I'm like, how do you even know my tunes? Wow. So, yeah, I feel there in the last maybe five years there's been a renewed interest. And I'll take it. Thanks. And how were these tunes received when they came out? Like in 2002 or something, you put out a Spacey techno tune. What kind of, was it still just like headsy people really into this? Or did it have like a far wider reach? It seems like there's not necessarily going for a crossover and it seems like there's never really been that. It's just kind of an audience has stumbled upon it and gravitated towards it, which is awesome and much appreciated. definitely haven't had that signature hit, at least in my mind. As I stated, I'm not really going for that, but just trying to be creative and express myself. So I don't know. It's tough to gauge who you're reaching, really. Just make the tunes, put it out. Yeah, exactly. I'm grateful for people enjoying what I do, but who those people are? Yeah, I need to ask someone else. Yeah, because I guess this sound, you have to, at least the way I kind of see it, you have to somehow... appreciate good house and techno to love this kind of music it's not like it doesn't have this big obvious melody or some really like cheesy vocal You know what I mean? Devoid of hooks. Yeah, it's reduced, like, pretty, as far as house music goes, like, well, house and techno goes, like, fairly, like, intellectual music, I would say. Sure. It's for the mind and body. Yes, thank you. You know? Yeah, yeah. Definitely going for that. Yeah. Because it happens, like, at least with me, with this kind of deeper stuff, if I showed, like, for example, like I should send my brother who's not into dance music tracks all the time. It could be like the most amazing Apex twin tune that me and you would be absolutely like geeking out over. But for him, it's just like, oh yeah, cool. Because you have to already have that like, maybe history to appreciate the best. To a degree, I don't want to assume anything. You know, if often kind of like your brother, I'll show people that aren't so into electronic music, maybe not necessarily my tracks, but maybe like a Morgan guys track or curtain track. And it's kind of almost in the defense of. There are people that have this mindset that electronic music, it's computer music, it's cold, there's no emotion, and it practically makes itself and it's super simple. And then I'll show someone a track by those artists and they'll go, well, actually, I guess there is a degree of merit to this music and what's being done. That's not why I make music, but I definitely like pulling people in that not have had an interest before. I guess especially in the US with the whole EDM thing, that's just so far reaching. At least it feels like in Europe, if you're like a 23 year old kid, even if you're not so deep into like house and techno. you've heard good tunes somewhere. So when they think of dance music, they're not thinking of like Skrillex or Electric Daisy Carnival or something. That was the US more like five years ago. Okay. And basically either people have grown out of that or they've matured. Their tastes have become more refined. And they won't necessarily think of the artists that you mentioned. They'll think of something a little more quote unquote underground as, as it were. So yeah, that's, that's the cool thing about. the small and constantly developing scene in the US. It's interesting. Are you still meeting, are there still lots of people in the US getting into your stuff for the first time? Yes. So this thing that's happening in Europe is also happening in the US with... Like you say, these 22-year-old people putting on cool parties. Yes, that is definitely happening globally. It's crazy. No complaints, but yeah, it's pretty wild to have people. in their early 20s, like reference tracks that you made when they were born or before they were. It's like, whoa, okay, awesome, cool. Can you say why this stuff has stayed timeless? Like, what's your take on it? Can I say why? No. My only thing I was trying to do was just make quality music express. I guess I feel fortunate that there was no, at least in my mind, level of cheese. It's from a good place, a good intention. And I think that kind of lends itself to it being timeless. I don't know, that word seems so lofty, though. It's timeless. I made timeless tracks. Yeah, I just made them, man. It was easy. It's really wild for me. Like some of the tunes, I'm just like trying to make a jam. And, you know, 20 years later, oh man. Like the first Resilient release just in Paris recently, you know, person come up and say the B2 on that, my jam. I'm like, whoa. be like 25 feet that you were like five when that came out i don't even know what to say for me i just think it's because it's like it's this more reduced sound so there's not that much to make it feel dated or like annoying you know like uh so much stuff from that time i think all these like tribal house or like there are so many elements like kind of get your trying to get your attention that eventually they just get out of fashion, maybe. But when you think about all this, Daniel, at least when I think about all this, the house music from the US, the house and techno from the US that... that feels timeless. There's just like slicker. There's not as much... Yeah, sure. It's more pure. There's a purity to it. Yeah. It's just not overdone, I guess is the way to say. I don't know. Did you hear lots of music back then that you didn't like? You know, because if you go into... Going to Detroit to listen to all these great DJs, did you also know that there was this whole other corner of house and techno? Would you hear stuff and be like, oh, no? Or was the stuff you were hearing all, I don't know, to your taste? Well, being in Ohio, at first it was kind of get whatever you can take. And a lot of the tunes that I was... First checking, almost embarrassing, a little cheesy. I mean, full raved up kind of music. And then, yeah, going to Detroit. I was there a couple times a month for years. And hearing the deeper side definitely formed my taste. I would say that at that time I was pretty open-minded, though. I wasn't really hearing too much that I thought, oh, no, this is terrible. This is the worst thing ever, you know what I'd say. That groove's not really capturing me, but I'll look across the room and see it doing something for someone else. So the tune was doing its work. I can't really knock it because of that, you know? Yeah, it's fulfilling its purpose. Yeah, sure. Yeah. So in my eyes, that tune has enough quality to give someone life. So yeah, I'm not here to knock anyone else's productions, really. Yeah, yeah, of course. And it's all subjective. There it is. Keep coming back around to it. Yeah. Well, I didn't realize you're going to Detroit so often. Yes. A couple hours. And you would drive? Catch the bus? With a crew. My crew would go up all the time. Like from late 92, who I'm putting years to it, through 97, 98. in Detroit at least twice a month. And so what was, you would finish work or university on a Friday, drive there, and stay all weekend, or? For a while, I want to definitely say I was on connotations, but that was definitely the case where we'd just search out the music and, yeah, perhaps be Detroit on a Friday, Chicago on a Saturday, Cleveland on a Friday, Detroit on a Saturday. But every Friday and Saturday, we were looking to go to some event to hear this music. Just ravenous. I want to hear more. I want to see DJs do their thing. I want to dance. I used to dance quite a bit, actually. A bit old, so you won't see me on the dance floor as much, but it does happen. Were you producing at this time? Yes. Would you give your tracks to DJs? A little bit, yeah. A little shy. Always been shy. Still shy now about that. But would definitely give music to DJs just to kind of see what their reaction is. Get their feedback. I'd say it was good. The most often feedback was, this is cool, but I don't know if I can play this. It's a bit complex. to fit into a DJ set, but yeah, perhaps I'll try. It's okay. No complaints about that. It's all right. Now it's good because the parties go for so long now, so you need this slightly deeper stuff as well. Sure, yeah. I wonder if that's also part of the reason why this kind of music is working so well now, because this after-hours thing is so... important at least in europe and also in the states i guess but uh people like also need this deeper sound as well it can't only be like high energy all the time right sure there's more of a space to play this more complex this more complex music i see that and also uh extended sets are becoming more prevalent everywhere so you know if you're gonna play up set, you know, mix it up a bit, you know, to have a track. Especially back in the day, I feel like a lot of my tracks could stand on their own, where you could play it from top to bottom. Enough would be happening in it. It would change enough for, you know, have a B section to where that could almost be the DJ's, I need to go to the Lou track, you know, put it on for... seven minutes it's gonna be doing so many different things that yeah i need to take a break put this on there it is yeah yeah they're not just loop tracks no there's all they're always evolving and yeah yeah that's uh definitely very intentional trying to uh make tracks that evolve and unfold and change and mutate yeah it's uh Adventure in the studio. Yeah. I wonder if that's your, like, musical training. It can't, yeah, you can't just make a loop, a functional loop. There has to be some musicality. Yeah, that's part of it. But also listening to early jungle, hardcore. drum and bass a lot of those changes come from the influence of that style like listening to a four hero record you know from 1993 i mean that changing constantly changing evolving evolving and i took great influence from that yeah i don't know so much of this music like early hardcore oh yeah should check it yeah i mean it's it's actually Interesting to see it kind of making a bit of a, you know, a lot of breakbeats that are, let's say, 130 in tempo. A lot of sounds like really coming back. So cool to see some of it cheesy, some of it standing the test of time. And there are DJs that can make both ends of that spectrum, that sound work. So, yeah, it's amazing. So what came more easily to you, the groove or the melodies? I'd say it's about the same, really. If you're speaking in terms of production, typically I'll start with the chords, like a chord sequence. So, yeah, sure, I guess a groove and kind of build from there. But there have been times where I'll be playing around with percussion sounds and just have this rhythm. I'm like, oh, that's something I can build from that. So the creative process in terms of production, it's just kind of, there'll either be something in my head or I'll be playing something and build. And when it starts to gel, it's a wrap. It's a great feeling. And will you work on a track? Because there are so many changes in the tune, I assume you'd spend a lot of time on each track. Of course, that's also relative. It is relative. It depends. To a fault, I work, produce way too slowly to the dismay of many record labels and myself, actually. In fact, balance. Yeah. It's now to the point where if a label asks me for a track, I'll say, two things. I do work very slowly, and I've promised a bunch of other people music, so it's going to be... Join the queue. Literally months before I can get to working on something for you. I'm sorry. Also, I don't like to force creativity. I kind of, when I'm in the mindset, the mood to sit down and be creative or feel inspired, and that's when it really starts to flow. But yeah, I'm typically about to a week and a half on the track. And I know that. is so slow. It's terrible. Well, at least you can hear the care in the production. Like we were talking about, like, the track can't shift so much without spending that much time. It goes back to overthinking, though. Yeah. It would kind of be nice to just jam and be free. There are producers I know that I did an EP in a week. You know, I did three tracks a day. I'm like... to the album in the afternoon. Like, okay, that's amazing. I'm envious, but I don't know, it just don't work that way. When you do finish a track, are you happy with it? Or are you kind of just, all right, I can't spend any more time on this thing. Here it is. Well, my method of production is if I finish a tune, then I'm happy with it. That's to say that if it makes it to the completion point. Yeah, it's not like you make some chords and then realize. you don't like them okay i'll save them for later just get rid of them yeah i'll just yeah usually just chuck it and go on to the next next project yeah how much time do you get to work on production back in ohio uh not as much as i would like to i guess everyone would also everyone wants more time yeah definitely and every producer has this problem that I definitely would like much more time to focus on productions. But that's not complaining about playing. I go through time periods, kind of like right now, where I'm playing quite a bit. I want to focus on performing, playing DJ sets, and occasionally doing the live set as well. And with those... put so much time into a live set it's it's crazy like in my writer i'd like to have 12 weeks to prepare for a live set this because that's but how much time i spend working on it yeah so to answer your question Not as much time. I would like, always need more time. Yeah, yeah. So what is your life like in the US? I'm waking up way too early and going to bed way too early. Oh, way too early. Being made fun of for how early I go to bed. I'm typically asleep during the week by 10 p.m., 11 p.m. Sometimes nine, but I'll wake up between four and seven almost every morning. I wouldn't make fun of you. I reckon that's all right. But yeah, life is cool. Produce when I can. Play when I can. I'm involved in throwing a monthly party with three other really amazing resident DGs that we have. That actually takes up quite a bit of time as well, just promoting and keeping that end of things going. The event's called Midwest Fresh. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it takes up a lot of being involved in it. It's just giving the opportunity. It's all about community and being able to share. expose people who wouldn't hear these artists in my hometown, being able to curate quality so close to home. And where exactly are you living now in Ohio? Columbus, Ohio. Oh, Columbus, cool. Is the party just in Columbus or it moves around? Midwest Fresh Party is just in Columbus, yes. And once a month, typically last Saturday. And for a while, we were really focused on Midwest DJs. We've kind of branched out a bit. We've had some DJs from... and also from overseas, a few here and there. And what's the crowd like? Because it's a big university town. It is. The crowd is small, but very open-minded and devoted. I couldn't ask for a better audience. You know, 200 to 300 people. so open-minded. I think that's the comment that most artists that we have performed is like, totally go left with this crowd and they followed me. And you don't get that so often. I try to be, personally try to be very careful of the types of events that I'll play, but I know other artists don't necessarily get the chance to play for an audience that's so receptive. I don't know if that's a Midwest thing or if that's really happening everywhere. But kudos to the crowd. That's cool. Maybe inspires some more producers from the Midwest. Oh, yeah, for sure. So much talent. That's another thing really helping keep the scene going, not only in the U.S., but I also see in Europe so many talented producers, young talented producers that are blowing me away. Just hearing tunes by people in their young 20s. And I'm just like, whoa, what? Especially a lot of guys in France. Loop Exposure. This guy, Sharon. The list goes on and on. Sweely. So many super talented. young producers. Yeah, that's the thing. I was wondering if you're still finding lots of new music that you like. Oh, all the time. There's almost too much. And no complaints, but yeah, I'm always trying to find someone doing something quality. Floor FM, Taylor Hawkins. Blowing me away. There's so many amazing young producers and constantly searching for that. So what is it about, I know for you, this idea of space and how Syntechno has been around for so long now, do you still get this modern kind of spacey feeling from it? I do to a degree, but I will say, I wouldn't necessarily say I'm kind of a bit jaded, but I will say that. But yeah, when I was younger, it was definitely all about the technology and futurism and really into that mentality and vibe. I don't feel it as much, but still feel it. I will hear some tracks and say this is total future music. But nowadays, it's almost like... future retroism yeah yeah yeah i don't know like when you're watching sci-fi movies from the 50s and 60s a lot of the music this these days kind of feels like that to where it was forward thinking but retro at the same time yeah Yeah, I know what you mean. It's funny, like, I understand how deep you are into, like, the space concept. I saw that your first track was called Journey to the Stars. Yes, yes. So you're basically like a lifelong science space guy. 100%. I kind of just had a thing for astronomy at a very... young age actually studied at university astronomy when I was, how old was I? 10 or 11. They let me into the observatory and the planetarium and took a couple of week and night classes. So yeah, I've always really been into it. And what is it? Is it about the unknown or? I don't know, the idea that something else is out there? Like, what's the appeal? It's definitely the appeal of there's something out there. I mean, we're not alone. I'm not this really big alien conspiracy theory type of person, but... Yeah, exactly. Like, really, we are not alone. I mean, it's that simple. And just the birth and development of... A star. The gravitational... force of you know the center of a galaxy you know all this is so fascinating to me so are you still reading are you still up to date with modern astronomy not as much as i would like to be you know i do like hearing about oh you know this this exactly you we we think that There are only so many planets in our solar system, but there's actually these planets. There are these micro planets. I don't keep up as much as I would like to, but... Do you think the government knows that aliens, do you think there has been like contact made? 100%. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. See, I don't know. I don't know enough about it. That's pretty interesting to think about. Like Rockwell. What is it? The Area 51? Area 51, Rockwell. Yeah, definitely. You know, I don't want to sound like a tinfoil hat person, but contact. made like and so what do you yeah what's the government playing out by keeping it secret you can call it just create too much havoc maybe i mean it's a possibility that that's there's that but i also think you know it's what can we siphon from technology wise and use it to to our advantage. If you think about the development of technology, say, from, like, the 1940s until now, like, quickly, wide-ranging, or even speed it up to, like, the 60s now, the last 50 years. It's been, like, exponential. Yeah, it's insane. I mean, but at the same time, yes, there aren't flying cars. That doesn't exist yet. The technology is there. think that's that's being stifled but uh yeah contacts been made for sure i hope it's like in uh my lifetime there's some official like something happens not a war not like destroyed by aliens or something right but wouldn't it be good to know like just to really know for sure, yeah, that there was something. I mean, it's happened. I have no doubts. But, yeah, for it to be just widespread and in the open. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, in the open. Okay, you know, yeah, okay, yeah, we know about this colony over here. They've actually, we've had contact with him for, you know, a solid 70 years. Sorry. We could have been having holidays there for 70 years. Take our day. Keep it a secret. Yeah, but that seems to be missing from... It's not as common as it used to be, this idea of the future and space. Why do you think it was so important in the US? Like, to Detroit? Like this futurism and this... Well, if you look at the conditions of some of the cities, you know, all you can do is look to the future and look to space and especially like a Detroit, you know, it's the Motor City and, you know, you have big factories becoming automated and you had to... Just think about technology. Think about what's next. And now it's in your face. I mean, think about a cell phone. I mean, really, it's in your pocket. It's a seriously powerful computer. Think about a cell phone in your pocket and think about your Commodore 64 computer from 1984. And your cell phone is so many times more powerful than that. So you back away from that and it's almost like you take technology for granted. I think that's why it's not as prevalent. Pardon me. of a focus in dance music because it's so in your face, you know, you have a Yeah, and it's just accepted. It's just the norm. Right. I guess, yeah, the 90s was such a time of change, yeah, as you say. Yeah, if all of a sudden there were flying cars and now we just get Netflix. Yeah, I mean, it's not going to – the flying car thing is not going to happen overnight. Yeah. Do you DJ differently now compared to, I don't know, 10, 15 years ago? Yes. And what – yeah, what's the difference? That's part of it. I think I'm constantly trying to evolve my DJ style. And I will say to a fault in the past, it was more about just playing a few of my favorite jams and not really building a set. And, you know, some people have said that I'm a okay turntablist or whatever. And in the past, it was more about cutting things up and doing tricks. And I have always spent quite a bit of time searching for quality music. And there was more focus on what I could do on the turntables. instead of this really high quality track that I want to feature. So I've come a bit away from that mixing style. No more spin backs. No, it happens. It definitely happens, but it's not the focus. The focus isn't me and what I can do. The focus is to present in a creative way. other people's amazing productions. I guess like let the tunes do the talking rather than... Yeah, I mean, I'm still more aggressive than other DJs, but it's not no longer the focus. And that's, I'm constantly trying to evolve better as a DJ. Definitely my own worst critic. very rarely satisfied with my DJ sets. So what would you be happy about? What's something that would make you think it didn't go well? Don't think it usually goes well. So I really just have to track flow and the set builds and then has an ebb to it and flow to it. I kind of like the set to tell a story to where... I'll have a starting point and it'll just build from there. And then once people are going crazy, just have a cool down, cool down period as well. And if a set does that, tells that story, executes that well, and the mixing is relatively clean, then I guess it'll be okay. I guess they're pretty high standards, though. Yeah. I'm glad people enjoy what I do. I've learned over the years to simply say. thank you. If someone's like, no man, you're lying. You say, well, I appreciate what you're saying, but you know, 20 minutes in when I tried this and it went awry and then the needle slipped at this point, you know, people don't want your, your, your essay on, on, on everything that went wrong in your set. So just try to simply say, thank you. Thank you. Bye.
