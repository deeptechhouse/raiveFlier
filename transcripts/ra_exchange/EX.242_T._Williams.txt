Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. UK dance music moves fast, and Tesfa Williams knows that better than most. By the time he was out of his teens, Williams had already enjoyed huge success as part of Grimes' first wave, only to see the whole thing crumble around him as the music mutated and audiences moved on. When he re-emerged in 2010 under the name T. Williams after years spent honing his craft, his new house-led sound dovetailed neatly with the burgeoning UK funky movement. But by this point, Williams was operating free from any one sound or scene. He recorded a string of music for Tom Lee's local action label, including the smash vocal house track heartbeat. He eventually fell in with PMR Records, winding up touring the US with Labelmates Disclosure. These days, Williams is most interested in bringing the entire melting pot of UK club music together, which is why he started Today Tomorrow, a label that will embrace stylistic fusions and focus on new talent. He's a proud ambassador for the UK scene, but as he told Ryan Keeling in London recently, its thirst for innovation can come at a cost. I wanted to start by asking you about the RA cycle that you did with us at the end of last year, because I wasn't on the cycle due to laziness, I guess. But I wanted to ask how that experience was for you. I keep telling people this. That's probably one of... one of the most amazing things I've done via being a DJ via my music that's probably one of the most amazing things and one of the most amazing experiences I've had with obviously not really knowing many people that were cycling and then getting to know everyone and the camaraderie and everyone kind of like helping each other along and I was definitely in a group that we had a few people in our group that had a few injuries and stuff like that and was all together and it was it was amazing and an absolutely amazing experience similarly I felt like I knew Europe before I went on this cycle, I felt like I'd seen Europe. I was like, oh yeah, I've been to this country, I've been to this city, that city. But really and truly like, Getting out there on a bike, cycling across Europe was, again, another mind-blowing experience to actually get to see the European roads on the ground rather than in a car from an airport to a club, back to a hotel. Yeah, it was a real and amazing experience. Are you much of a physical activity type of guy? Well, I cycle nevertheless. to and from my studio when the weather permits me to do so. I'm not really a fan of cycling in the rain. But yeah, other than that, I've had my times with sport and not doing sport, but I'm not a regular gym guy or nothing like that. No, definitely not. So to get us started properly, I wanted to kind of... or for you to take your mind right back to your early teen years, because I've read in a few places that you got your start on producing and DJing very early. So my first question really was, what gets you into that mind frame? Like what inspires you as a sort of 12, 13 year old kid to, you know, get behind the computer and start writing music? Yeah, if I take it back to there, it's really funny because I didn't actually know... I knew I was making music, but I'd always attempted to make music in whatever way, shape or form I could. Really back to before I was a teenager and I was a real young kid, my sister had like a Casio keyboard, as most homes did. And we had an old Fisher-Price tape recorder. and an actual hi-fi set and I used to like record layers so play something record it on the Fisher-Price tape recorder and then play that back and then record another layer via the Fisher-Price so like found my own way of like doing like an 8-track scenario and stacking things up but all on the between two tapes so I'd always done that that was that was from I was really young and again I didn't I didn't know what I was doing I just knew that that was the way I was going to be able to get a drum beat, a piano, a crazy car sound all together in one. And then one of my really good friends at high school, he had an uncle that was doing music production and made music. And again, I didn't actually know how music was actually made on a computer or anything like that. But he gave me a copy of Cubasis on... floppy disk which is like the sort of stripped down version of cubase yeah okay original version um on a three and a half inch floppy and um i took that home to my family pc and secretly uploaded that in the nighttime and um yeah didn't didn't have a clue what was going on or nothing like that but just I just tiddled around until I found a few sounds and started from there. And it was just the same hunger from when I was an even younger kid that you just wanted to compose. You wanted to put layers of sounds and music together to try to build what I was listening to at the time. I mean, I was nowhere near the mark, but try to build what I was listening to at the time. And what were you listening to at the time? I was into Jungle, Jungle and Drama Bass. Like I got into Jungle when I was like nine, 10 years old. My dad was a youth worker, part-time youth worker at a youth club and he used to buy Jungle records for the youth club. My dad's a record collector anyway of reggae and like dub reggae and soul and funk. he just decided to let me have a listen to this kind of stuff. Do you know what I mean? And one of the kids at the youth center, um his name was dj stretch i'm not sure if he's doing anything now but um he he made a tape and this tape my dad gave me this tape or i got my hands on this tape should i say i used to just take my dad's tapes anyway and um yeah it was jungle and it was it just blew my mind it was just it was like it was my dad's music like with the reggae samples and all that kind of stuff but it was mine it was like for us young people So, yeah, I got into it. That's what I was trying to, I was attempting to make Jungle at the time. So how does a kid sort of in his early teen years go about approaching that and like deconstructing the sound? Like, how would you even start? Because I mean, I guess we're in a time where there's not loads of information available and it's not like you can just pull up a tutorial on YouTube or something. So how do you go about that? Where does your information come from? just being an inquisitive child like or teenager should I say so my dad again massive influence on me being able to like make and create music for what he could do for me at the time but he used to be in a band which meant that one of his really good friends owned a studio. Actually, two of his good friends owned studios in London. And kind of in a way, I got an insight into, I mean, I didn't know what was going on in the studio, but I kind of got an insight into the fact that you need to have a few different things. Like you could have a sampler. You needed a desk at the time. You needed these things in a studio to make. quality music this was where a lot of music was coming from so in my head my whole aim of aim as a teenager was to learn how to use the program that people was using which like Cubase was one of them and to kind of like figure out a way to kind of make money to to buy like my first sound module to buy my first sampler to get my first desk mixing desk like to to build a studio that was the whole aim of the game I didn't know how things were put together I didn't know how I was going to make the sounds from the sampler or anything like that I just knew that music, jungle, be it whatever, came from a studio that had these elements. And I was just striving to like save money to do that. And in the meantime, I just felt like I needed to, I needed to get the ideas that were in my head like down. Whether it was like the worst sounds in the world, whether it didn't sound anything like the genre, I just wanted to get those sounds down and show people that I could, I can. make a song. Like whether it be, it didn't, like I really was terrible back then. Even as I listened to some of my productions from like when my, my early teens, which I've got mini discs of them, they kind of, I can hear how I was forming. Like I knew how like, okay, well like eight bars, 16 bars, 32 bars, like, and, and learning where things should change, where a crash should be. Do you know what I mean? And just learning those, like. basic structuring of music itself or dance music to say i was only trying to structure dance music so yeah dance music because you hadn't had any experiences of like clubs at the point assuming or well this is this is this is an outsider story i mean i find it funny and weird to think back to my early days of actually going to clubs and and my first moment of seeing like maybe something like nikki back market being a young junglist but in my area again by my dad there was a gentleman called Joey J who was at the time was on Kiss FM as it was a pirate station at the time. And he played like roots reggae and his, his brother is Norman J and they ran good time sound system. So my dad was really good. Went to school, went to school with these, with these guys as well. And my dad was really good friends with them. And so Joey J being the person that he was like, and he decided to do party for under 18s in my. area in Southall so all my friends from my high school like from my high school like and loads of friends from my area like we all we'd all go to this this this night called tomorrow's people and um he would not only like do that but get like you know I mean the top DJs like so we got to hear like Nicky Backmarket do you know what I mean like got to hear Brockie we got to hear MCs like Skibbity like MC Deer like Shabba like we got to hear these people with all of that it kind of gave me an insight into what clubbing was like again it gave me that kind of like insight to want to go to clubs so what happened was that that was when I was like 11 years old and what happened was I've got an older cousin and I'm one of six children and I'm like four so that I've got older siblings and so my parents were quite quite cool like they they let me go with my older siblings and my cousins and stuff to to over 18 parties way before I was anywhere near 18 I don't know how I mean I used to have long dreads. So I suppose I looked a little bit older than I maybe was at the time. So from that perspective, going to a club and hearing things, I had a really strong foundation in clubbing. Like I said, it wasn't every week, but I'm talking, I mean, I got to see like Adrenaline Village. I got to see like someone like... the iconic clubs in London or iconic venues in London as they were like Bagley's and things like that as they were like in their heyday as a teenager and And that kind of definitely shaped me in terms of the way that I made music. Definitely back then I was making music, trying to make music for the club. Like from pretty much the time that I really got into making music, I was trying to make music for the club. I tried to make those, make it sound sonically, like amazing for the club. Like have like that weighty bass that I've like, I hear when I'm in the club. I mean, I didn't have it, but. I was attempting. Sure. And were you passing your music around at this time? Were you getting it to DJs or sending it to labels or anything like that? No, it wasn't until maybe I was like, I was still very young. When I was 15. So when I was 15, me and one of my good friends, the guy that gave me the copy of Cubases. We decided that we were going to do a label and we were going to try and get our music out there, obviously. And we took the pilgrimage to music. house in uh instanton light and we decided that yeah we took a day off school basically or we bunked school to go to music house and sit there we sat there all day we saw some of our heroes like walk through the door like ray keith saw him walk through the door um and it was just it's just an amazing experience to to do that obviously my mom didn't know that i did this but nevertheless yeah, what we used to do is we used to go cut dub plates and just cut dub plates. Then when I would get the opportunity to go to a club with my older siblings or cousins, I would go and I would like hand it to the DJ. I mean, never really worked, never worked at all. So you didn't get any traction from that? No, zero traction from that. Like it was, yeah. Or we'd take it to like the record shop, like Black Market. town or at least the groove or any of those record shops that were going on in London at the time and take the dub plate with us and kind of like be like oh this is like our new track whatever and people were really quite helpful as well some people were just like you know I mean let us know what we needed to do to kind of like take it a little bit further and yeah and that was like basically we'd go halves he would have he was still into jungle and jungle base so he'd have the one side and i had the other side which was like garage like yeah yeah i was going to ask about garage because i assume by the time you're attending like over 18s parties like garage is massively on your radar yeah a strong part of my late teens so when i was like 18 19 i was into i was into garage and going to those clubs. I mean, I didn't really go to those clubs at that age, crazily, when I was actually over 18. By the time I was actually over 18, I was kind of... felt like I was done with raving to be fair like I felt like yeah I was like I was kind of like okay well I've done this like time and time again and in terms of how clubs were in and around the UK at the time for garage music it was kind of like a dark time for garage at the time as well it was kind of it was quite dangerous to be fair so around like 1890 when I'm actually over at the age to go to clubs I'd go I still go do you know what I mean but and that's when like maybe like when I was like 19 yeah but 18 19 grime was like really starting to like bubble it was like that kind of darker kind of garagey sound was kind of like creeping its way in like so yeah I wanted to ask about that do you sort of have strong memories of like that period when it did start to mutate For sure. Literally, like I can remember it started from like a few tunes. It started probably from as early as like tunes like Scrappy and Down On Me from Wookiee and with the surgence of like track from So Solid called Dilemma as well, which was a very basic track. And it was like a kind of like, so I would have been like 17 when this was going on, a music 2000 track. So it's like 99, 2000. yeah the track was actually made on a playstation so it was the beginnings of that thing that grind thing obviously wookiee track wasn't made on a playstation but that track those two darker style of like garage tracks came about and they took a hold of the crowd at the time and really like pushed things forward for someone like myself who was into like kind of like i was into like i mean i was into drum and bass and jungle but also like this garage thing but i wanted to like merge those two worlds together and kind of like bring that dark side from the jungle into the garage and it kind of like made it possible for me to maybe like do that and maybe like a whole load of other people that were living around the uk at the time to kind of be like okay well we can make dark garage now this is like this is totally fine do you know i mean and um and bit of a story track and track one track after another it would slowly but surely slip in and i've had this conversation with many people time and time again it's like all the big producers like the mj coles the wookies like the artful dodgers those kind of people at the time They kind of disappeared. And what I learned is their disappearance happened because they all got signed to major labels and were doing like major label deals and producing for like artists, which gave people like myself at the age of 18 and 19, an opportunity to kind of like slip in because the market wasn't, there was nothing in the market at the time. Like all the top producers were away making albums. producing for big stars like Craig David and things like that like yeah that gave us an opportunity and that's when that's when it really we really took a hold of the grind thing really took a hold like yeah it's interesting you've got this sort of like vacuum and it's being filled by these like very sort of dark stripped back instrumental tracks in a way it happened and it literally happened in like it felt what felt like a second for me it was like from one year to the next we literally blinked And it was like, oh, it's okay for me to do what I do. Now, like, and it was, it was an amazing moment for some people. Obviously they didn't, they didn't really like the change and it was not for them. But for me, it was an amazing moment in time that, that, that scene, that the kind of like tracks. like, Pulse X and by Musical Mob. And these, like, kind of, like, people from my local area surrounding me in West London as well, kind of, like, everyone was just creeping slowly but surely into, like, the fold and going to, like, club nights, like, Smooth at Ministry of Sound, which was, like, an amazing garage Friday night down there and hearing, like, my tracks getting played as a teenager. was just yeah it was just mind-blowing a mind-blowing time and whereas I'd admit like maybe like two years or a year prior There was no way for me to get into that because it was all vocal. It was all very like happy. Sort of like high production values and happy and like vocals and stuff. Yeah. So your artist name at the time, Dread D, DJ Dread D, was that sort of intended to evoke the style of music you were making? Do you think that sort of like reflected where your head was at musically? Funny enough, that was literally just a name that people, I mean, I had long dreads at the used to call me people still call me like from my area people still call me dreaded to this day like do you know what I mean it's It's funny. For me, it's still funny to go back and like, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, that's just how it was. Like, I was at school. All my, like, close friends called me Dread, like, and it was just like, that's what it was. It kind of fitted. It fitted the genre, but it didn't fit the genre of music that I was playing maybe when I was playing, like, the Happy Garage stuff in my, like, mid-te that my friends gave me. So how far does your relationship with Johnny Cash go back? So I met Johnny when I was 16. Basically, I went to college, City Westminster College in Paddington. And I met a guy called DJ Dice, who was closely connected to like tied with Lush FM and a few pirates around London. And he knew Johnny as well and was part of like Johnny's collective as a DJ. And he, again, so at the time I was, so now I was 16 and had a little part-time job on the weekends. I was pressing up more dub plays, giving them out to more DJs. And so my friend in particular, DJ Dice, I just, I had like a, like a box of like dub plays and I was just like of different tunes that I pressed up over the years or whatever. And I just gave them all to him so he could play them on radio. And he's played them on a radio show with that he's done with Johnny and Johnny was like these these tracks are like really good like I like them I want to put them out what's what's what's happening with this guy whatever and so he just introduced me to Johnny when I was 16 years old went down to Johnny's studio in Lambrechove and I was I was just like, I mean, I remember being like, I was such a little kid, like at the time, like to think back to it, I was so young, but yeah, I just sat with him, sat in with him and he gave me a few pointers about what I should do and what I needed to do to kind of like step the production game up and kind of like what needs to be done in terms of like sound wise. So I can actually, it was at a quality level that he could actually press up on vinyl and cell obviously. And yeah, I just took heed of what he said. Went back in the studio, but yeah, our relationship started when I was 16 years old in college. I mean, you must have had like some level of success from the point of your first release. Is that right? See, it's funny because being as hungry as I was as a kid, I pressed up a vinyl with another friend of mine. We went halves on a release when I was like, I think I was still in high school. I might be 15. We went halves on a release and basically we done the first half. And then my friend didn't have for the second half to actually get. So we've done the test pressing, had 10 test presses and went out there, get them out. But he didn't have the money for the second. half to go off and actually press the vinyls. So we just had these like 10 presses like circulating. That happened and then another label called Natural Essence when I was 16 came in and was interested in like my music again. They took too long to release the track that I had at the time. By the time they wanted to release it on their label, musically I had to kind of like moved on. So I was like, I don't want that to happen. And so my very, very first release, like proper official release was on Black Ops and was Invasion. And like I say to the day, I mean, I thought that was like a normal thing to happen. But like my first release and selling like, we sold like between like, I don't know, it was seven, 8,000 records or something stupid like that. It's kind of crazy to think about now, isn't it? To think about like my best selling record to date like it's insane and yeah I thought that was normal at the time but like now I'm a lot older and like do you know what I mean I'm a lot wiser I know that that was not like the norm like that was definitely something that that was definitely special to that piece of music I mean how how long would you say that golden period lasted for like for how long were those sorts of units being shifted for us it was definitely it was like maybe like a 12 to 18 month period for us like of like really shifting units and really like people like pre-sales like flying out the door having the money before you've even gone to the pressing plant yeah like I'd say about 12 to 18 months that was like the amazing period and that was probably the most amazing period for grime as well like I'd say at that period of time just really shifting units like of vinyl and it and again it was just at the moment of like the internet like really being a big playing a big part in the music industry and music in general do you know I mean this is pre-iTunes like this is this is pre most of most digital download sites do you know I mean so it was like just as those things were coming about and just as those literally just before that that was the moment and as soon as those things happened it all changed yeah we would sell we would struggle to sell like 500 records was that almost overnight is that how it felt it felt it felt like overnight it felt like one minute you was like hotcakes like and the next minute everyone still thought your music was hotcakes so people were still talking about on the forums like they still were talking about your music like it was amazing you still held it's like someone that people were looking for releases from But in terms of sales, it didn't reflect the hype and what was going on at the time. Yeah, I mean, tell us about some of the broader market forces at that time. What led to such a dramatic shift? So, again, I feel like within that scene, again, what happened was a lot of people got signed and a lot of deals were made. Obviously, with most of us coming from... a garage background, you kind of had a stronger understanding of like how the garage circuit went from like being something really underground and really niche to being very popular and commercial and like a music that was like very UK synonymous. So kind of in a way you kind of saw that. And some people had a good view of it, some people had a bad view of it, but nevertheless, you could see it happening. You could see that major labels were paying attention and understanding that this was part of it. So this is the same time as people like MIA was coming around. Lady Sovereign, The Streets, like this is the same time as all that stuff's going on like and so you can see like how like our music is kind of like is breaching like between those two worlds like the commercial side, the wider market and also like the underground at the time. And yeah, with a few artists, some people like Dizzy Rascal getting signed and these things happening, it just changed the way things were happening on the underground circuit. I mean, for me, I think we had like, we had opportunities to like produce for like other MCs and stuff like that. And I mean, I never did it. At the time, it was pure. probably arrogance I'd say like from the people I was around at the time it was we felt that there was they didn't give us enough money or give us enough leeway to do what we wanted to do well I mean how do you view looking back on it do you think they were thinking back were they sort of sound deals or opportunities or There were sound opportunities, like very sound career opportunities on a very like singular level. Like it was, it would have been a good opportunity for me, but on a musical opportunity for the actual like scene and the genre itself, maybe not so much good opportunities because again, like as soon as you delve into that world of kind of like maybe a major label A&R letting you know that. this and this might need to change because it won't sell in the market which is understandable as pop music yeah that kind of dilutes what you're doing as a producer and dilutes what you're doing as an artist so this eventually leads you to kind of falling out of love with what's going on around you yeah completely it felt like it was completely changing and it felt like for me like I said it was like the MC were stars nothing against mcs but the mcs were the stars of the genre and i mean were you still feeling everything musically musically i was still feeling it but as a as a as a producer someone who wanted to be involved in it yeah i i felt like i at some points it felt too easy as well because the simplicity of like i love music that's like simply great like you know i mean but For me, I was like growing up, I was getting older. I was feeling like musically, like I wasn't getting to like push the boundaries that I wanted to push. You know what I mean? There was, there was things that I wanted to do. I wanted to work with vocalists, like singers and songwriters and stuff like that. And there was stuff that I wasn't getting to like experiment with. and push myself like as a producer and I felt like as well this is what came into that as well at the time was the whole change in music production it was moving from being you needed a big studio to just being able to like make music on your pc or your laptop and I felt like I was getting left behind as well let's say at the same time with the music genre that i was doing i felt like i was getting left behind with the fact that like things like dubstep was coming along and people were like really taking product music production seriously like as a form and i felt like with my genre at the time i felt like i was getting left behind in terms of production levels and in terms of like like musicality yeah i see i mean do you think if like for example if some of the instrumental grime tracks had of you know maybe had a production value that was like on a par with some of the early dubstep records do you think there could have been like you know more of a cross-pollination like could that stuff have been played at some of those parties like you know sort of dovetailed the rise of dubstep well what's funny about it is that For me, at the time, and this is how it felt just from me as an artist looking in, it felt like if you made a track that had intense emotion or musicality about it or a higher level of music production, then it would get hailed as dubstep. And if you made a track that had a lesser production value or whatever... then it'd get held as grime right i see so you look at people like joker who was making grime but because he produced his production was like definitely on a high level of music production and definitely musical he went dubstep do you know i mean but yes it was a weird time it was like really the lines were already blurred anyway like we would get to play like with me being part of Black Ops we'd play a lot of dubstep parties we'd play like one of like Amsterdam's biggest dubstep parties we was like there in the early days it was called Oi like it used to happen at Paradiso we was there early doors we were getting flown out there early doors to play there also pinches night in bristol we'd go down and play that subloading yeah we'd go down and play that we was getting to play like we was playing a lot of the early dubstep raves like i i met like these guys like when i was like really young but again it was just the music production values i mean i think i felt like it was like you'd be on one tip if you was at a certain level and you'd be on the other tip if you was at another like a lower level to say if you want And it was, yeah, it was really disheartening as a producer who, for me, I didn't feel like my musical talents were based on a genre. Do you know what I mean? I felt like everyone's free to do what they want to do. And the genre, like, wasn't more what I was focused on. And I kind of felt like it. because of what I'd done prior, you was in a genre, you was in a genre, you was in a scene, you was in, you was a part of a crowd, you was part of a certain thing, a part of a movement and being part of that thing, you didn't have any movement to do something else. Like subsequently, if you look at me now as T Williams, you can see that like fully like being free and like exploring every avenue of what I want to do and what I feel and what I like Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, looking back on on your story, the sort of think about the next sort of four or five years, I think it was it was really striking to me that, you know, reading that what came next for you was House. But then also you took this huge break, you know, between releasing records. and, you know, learning that this break was, you know, something of a voyage of discovery for you. You know, you were getting into house but didn't necessarily want to just like throw yourself into that game without the necessary experience. I wonder if you could talk a bit about like what that sort of process of education was like for you and why you were kind of taking it that seriously. Yeah. For me, I take music seriously and I have always taken it very seriously and I've always respected anyone's like, anyone that's making music and being creative like with music. I've always respected their art form and I feel like it would have been a disrespect for me to think that from one afternoon to the next. I could just jump in and be like, okay, well now I'm a house producer and I make house music because I was so ingrained and so deep in the UK, like kind of like grime and like garage circuit doing stuff like that, that, do you know what I mean? At the end of the day, it felt disrespectful for me to even turn around and think I could say something like that. - You have to go back to school. - Yeah, go back. you gotta go back to school you gotta and that and that was that was it was a good time for me because i went back to partying i went back to enjoying i didn't really enjoy part once i got into like the grime circuit and i was into it and i was i was there already i didn't enjoy partying so much like he's more going to hear your like to see the reaction to your one of your tracks or it was like it was work it was business like do you know i mean and it changed everything and then of like digging for my roots and digging through like my garage records that i had house and garage at the time and seeing like people like arnold van helden and people like that that was there or like masters at work and tunes that i had from them those guys that were in my collection and look at them oh wow that's really that's that that was that was house music do you know what i mean then kind of like rediscovering like what how i really connect to this music itself yeah it kind of led me back to parties led me back to being like going out and being a raver and enjoying being a raver and being someone that like literally can be part of the party i can be a part of the party it's fine who would you go and see at that time do you remember Like, here we get you out the house. What's funny is like at the time I wasn't even listening to like big artists. I mean, I went and saw like Kenny Dope when he came to like Ministry of Sound and stuff like that. And again, those parties for me weren't necessarily the most educated because I wasn't, I was educating myself from the past for like coming forward. Yeah, I see. So the music that I wanted to hear wasn't necessarily the music that like the legends that I was talking about would So the parties that I had the best time at, to be fair, was just like mates of mine's like, that were getting into house music just like me and going and hearing them DJ at local parties in East and like. around central London and places like that. And they would just be playing old school house records, but it'd be full education. It was me starting from, from zero to, to, to present day. And I, it took me a time, took me a while to get up to it and understand how the music has got to where it was at. Yeah. And understand it, really understand it and really enjoy it. So then for about three or four years, you're just in the studio, just like hammering on this house and trying to get things into a good place. Is that right? That's absolutely correct. I moved to a flat in South London. I had my studio set up in my front room. And yeah, I was just like most evenings, I'd just be there and just be listening to house music and listen to producers that I like. People like Henrik Schwartz, again, like Dennis Ferrer, like people like that, like, and just kind of like. really trying to pin down what I liked about what they were doing. I kind of like extract that and kind of like, like really like hone it in and be like, okay, well, well now how can I? how can I make music like that, but unique to me? And like, there's loads of tracks that I made that probably sounded exactly like their songs, but like, you know what I mean? I'd never, I would never be the type of person to kind of just show someone that I'd be like, how can, how can I push this forward? How can I make this like relate to what I'm doing and where I've been, my journey and kind of bring that forward. And it was, it was a massive talking to people or did it did it you know was there a defining moment or anything i never felt ready really never felt ready like i've managed to like connect with a few people and i'm always i've always been that person like kind of connecting with people and so i'm connected with a few people i was into like like-minded music and like-minded people like and i had like a dj set up in my front room as well so i'd invite people over and like maybe we'd go to a party and we'd have like And I met Koolie G who was a girl signed to Hyperdub, but this is prior to that. And there was another guy, a good friend of mine called Seth. And we all was like, and even my friend Jay Bevan, we was all there in my front room, just jumping on the decks and playing songs or whatever. And yeah, it was basically via like doing mixes, just mucking around mixes with them. And those friends of mine telling me like. I didn't know that was the whole song. I thought that was just like a normal house song that was out there. Like, wow, this is, this is crazy. And, um, yeah. And basically bottom line, I didn't even want to put out my music. My friend, Seth was like, he's going to put it on the SoundCloud, not SoundCloud, MySpace. He's going to put it on. He's going to put it on a MySpace and we was going to start a label. And I was like, cool. We went and saw a guy that I thought was a good producer, like a house producer. I was like, he's good. Like I can, I'd be proud to release his music. So we put together a site releasing his music. And he was like, okay, we should throw one of your tracks on the SoundCloud too. Like we should, we should really do this too. So there was which was like a kind of like Chicago house track like, but then I threw up one of my tracks on Saga or he threw up one of my tracks on Saga and that got a lot of traction from people like Sindon even like Diplo at early doors and people like that like came like looking at what's this oh right and this is just from Myspace so Marianne Hobbs as well which was she was a great advocate of our music as well at the time and this kind of gave me the confidence but I still didn't care about releasing my own music I still didn't release my own music Tom Lee. from like Fat Magazine told me he was starting a new label starting a label and with Phonica and whatever and told me the deal was like I really want to release music for new that I was kind of like oh well so sorry to clarify this you weren't even really aspiring to like have a career or anything at that point you were just kind of like doing it for kicks literally just for kicks like I didn't I didn't think I could have a career from making music it was just literally I just wanted to be able to like master the sound of house music or try to attempt to master a sound that related to me of house music that was it and I also kind of had a thing where it kind of felt kind of elitist as well so I felt like I always wanted to like tap into that elite market that I I felt like being a grime producer that people would be like shocked, like, oh wow, a guy who made grime made this. Yeah. So you kind of stung a little bit from that experience like back in the day. For sure. It's stuck with me to this day. Yeah. It sticks with me of how... limited it felt to be a part of a scene that was so fresh. It was like so fresh but how can it be so limited so early? It didn't make it didn't compute with me. It was like how can we be so limited at such an early time? This is like the time for experimentation. This is the time for to really like push the boundaries of the genre. Let's talk a bit about UK Funky and that sort of emergence, I guess, was like around the time you started releasing music again. How excited were you personally by that development and how much was that kind of influencing what you were doing? So UK Funky, again, I'm definitely very proud to be from the UK and proud of like what the UK has brought to the table music. around the world so when UK Funky came along it felt really good and it felt for me it felt like a resurgence of like the garage circuit it felt like it had come back because garage had completely like died off and it felt like all the old ravers that I used to see when I was like a teenager they'd be out as well all the old producers people like even like someone like Skepta made a funky June night back then and it was it was it was like all the old guys were like everyone was jumping in and tapping in or you might see like a garage MC just there partying as well or like and it was just a good time for like London and UK like just coming back together so it influenced me kind of like maybe realized that like it didn't have to all be like so in your face like it didn't have to be like a bang like it could be like a little bit softer more vocal more for the ladies and people could really still get back into it it was fine and yeah so it definitely spurred me on but it spurred me on in a way not necessarily to be a part of that scene because I still was still adamant that I was going to like make house music like i was gonna be like okay i'm gonna make house music but it kind of gave me that insight that to be like okay well let me make the house music that that that has influences from everything that's come through the uk be it grime garage dubstep jungle or funky let me bring that all into like one basket and make house music that sounds something like that Yeah, no, I see. I mean, how would you sort of define funky? I mean, there's definitely like people who'd be listening to this who wouldn't necessarily like be able to identify a funky track if they like, you know, heard it in the context of a DJ set. Yeah. A UK funky track on bassist elements has kind of like an Afro beat drum pattern running through it. A lot of the time, at the time, it had like... piano stabs like kind of like 90s house piano stabs going going through them and then the influence from like the garage circuit which was like the bass like actually having a drop in the track itself it would get you have an intro and a drop in an arrangement and the drop will be when the bass kicks in yeah no i see Pretty simple. I guess the lifespan of funk as a genre was like fairly short lived around the sort of like 2009, 2000, 2011 period. But as it was a sound that was viewed as like the next development in like, you know, UK club. you know, the hardcore continuum, how you want to kind of define it. Is it sort of striking to you that nothing's kind of come up in its wake? Like you wouldn't necessarily think there's been like a new development since it. I wonder if you kind of had a theory on, on why that might be, if it's something to do with the, the internet or. I personally feel that. the whole continuum like happened but it happened without it being defined as a genre or just being called bass yeah to say the least so if you if you want to connect the line between like people like Night Slugs um Hesel Audio um Joy Orbison even like myself and people like that have come from being influenced by like dubstep and funky and then have moved on so they that's a solid timeline there and then how that timeline moves forward from there because most of us are playing like quite house focused music now how that timeline forwards from there is disclosure and then it goes from there because they were influenced by like the hessle audio lot and so that's how it like for me that's how the continuance happened without being defined as a genre it's just continued via like stylistically by the music itself and yeah I presume like I said I'm happy to part of that do you know what I mean and part of that continuance and kind of like see it from the outside looking in as well like Yeah, I mean, you mentioned Disclosure, your kind of label mates with PMR, you've toured with them. I wanted to kind of ask you about PMR because, you know, in terms of the music that we're discussing and, you know, this kind of like strain of like crossover UK dance music, like, you know, they've just been killing it in many respects. You know, they've had lots and lots of success. I just wonder why you kind of thought that was. Are they doing anything in particular that really gets them to that place? Clearly, to be honest, it's just good A&R in picking up people at the right time and picking off music at the right time. As a label, when I signed, it was just super strong. And I basically... talking about night slugs, I basically signed because Elvis 1990 was the first person to sign to the label anyway. So for me, it felt like a really good home. If someone's going to sign like Elvis, like 1990 at the time, like maybe a year prior or two years prior, maybe it just felt right and good. Like, do you know what I mean? It felt like it's coming from a genuine place and yeah. And that's, that's, that's it. Just great A&R in like, and boundaries and push things forward yeah sure did you meet Disclosure through the label yes I met them through the label yeah obviously I only knew of their music prior to that but yeah through the label which is another good thing about the label as well they kind of like they've built like a kind of like they've got a family home like it's like most people on the label know each other like even right now I'm actually out of my deal with the label right now but I still work closely with them and I still like even the guys the new guys are coming through the label I'm still helping out with their projects that are coming through so it's really good in that in that respect it was like he was becoming part of your part of a family yeah and I said you know I mean yeah like I don't know like I was in LA the other day and like science this one is grammy and all the pmr a lot of them all the method there and everyone's there but like i've still got an invite to the party you know it's yeah it's a family community vibe and like even like jesse where like most of us has actually i think most of us producers that were on the label have done a jesse where remix like I'd say like, do you know what I mean? Or we've all remixed each other's music and things like that. It was a cool, it's a cool home. So when was it you toured the US with Disclosure? Just coming up two years ago. Yeah. I just really wondered what that experience was like. for you I mean seeing this kind of like very UK style of dance music and performance in like these you know big US venues like yeah but what does that look like what did that look like at the time yeah so at the time The show wasn't even that big, to be fair. It wasn't nowhere near as big as they are now, obviously. At the time when I toured with them two years ago, the show was a decent size. I feel like some of those, the crowds, it might have been the first time they've delved into dance music itself as well. So even me DJing at the start of opening for Disclosure became very apparent that the people that were in the crowd... Because again, they're not allowed to party in clubs until they're 21 in America. There was 18-year-olds there. There were some people there with their parents. Do you know what I mean? And it comes very apparent that this is like maybe the first time that they're actually seeing like a DJ in a setting like this. This is like... their first entry like and seeing the reaction on the internet to that and then them kind of like feeling like they've experienced something so unique because there's a dj then there's then there's this live dance act and it in america it was it was For me, it was insane to just see how that went on. And it was like still on a smaller scale. Latch hadn't even been released in America just yet. It was, this is all just off internet hype. Yeah. Like, and. So anyone that did know would know because done their research on the internet. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, it was a strange dynamic. I mean, I've seen them now in recent times and it's completely different. Now, as soon as they turn up, it's... all glitz and glamour it's all going off like i mean whereas now they still had that thing where people knew their songs but they really still had to like perform and i mean not that they don't know but like yeah they had to win it really worked yeah yeah win that to win it like i mean and own it yeah and it was it was a good time so you've just come back off a us tour um how did this last one compare to the tour that we're discussing this was a club tour anyway so i was I think like club shows yeah massive majority of time but still same same thing like now they're just they're well advanced they're a little bit ahead they're kind of understand like what's going on yeah i was brought it to us really have you seen that kind of like advancement in people's understanding of what you do i mean it's probably a blessing and a curse with us being here from the uk that we kind of like always move forward like so kind of like you go places and you kind of people don't understand that you're maybe that you might not play like the acts that they expect you to play so i may not play a disco I'd play a disclosure track and I probably won't play a Gorgon City track. Maybe not. Do you know what I mean? It may not happen. But I will play music that's got the same kind of like aesthetics. I'll play music that can kind of like pushing forward from that sound onwards. Like, whereas I said, sometimes maybe with America, maybe they expect you to play maybe sounds that like sound like that. But always at the end of a set, it kind of always got to a point where people were This pushing forward, this hair is definitely like, I'm getting to hear something unique again. Yeah. And it's always, it's the continuation of what they were listening to from Disclosure and the other guys that have come around in that, in that, in that time. I would just go. to something you were saying um do you almost think because of the speed that the um sort of dance music scene operates at in the uk can actually be like counterintuitive because by the time like you know people in other countries get to hear it the people who've actually made the music have like moved on to the next thing or they're like you know a couple years down the line 100 i've traveled the world and people get disappointed by uk djs lot because we are either directly on the curve or we're ahead of the curve like and we and i i love that's why i like being from here is that we are that's what we are we're either on the curve or ahead of it and And we're never going to be behind it. We're never trying to be behind it. Like, and so with that, well, yeah, people get disappointed. People, people, people just think, well, why is he playing that? Like, this doesn't make any sense. Or like, maybe he thinks he's a super cool techno DJ now or whatever. But not realizing that maybe you're playing music from your mates. You're just playing music. You're playing the music. that you've been that you like and all your friends have given you like that are from the uk and it's very much what's going on in the uk right now but they don't i can't see it just yet because they might be looking at your your mix that you did from yeah sort of 12 months ago i want you to play that track that yeah yeah do you know i mean and again that's definitely something that i find is great about the uk but it's definitely it's a blessing and a curse because we do like to move forward and not like kind of like play dumb for the crowd. We're not going to play dumb for the crowd. Like, do you know what I mean? I definitely don't attempt to do that. I'm not going to play dumb for you because I know you're as intelligent as I am and I'm going to give you intelligent music, do you know what I mean? And keep giving you like stuff that's going to like challenge you, do you know what I mean? Whereas again, sometimes people don some points I guess it's just getting that sweet spot isn't it between pushing things forward and then like you know pleasing pleasing the crowd a little bit there as well again there's nothing wrong with that but if you if you can challenge if you can do the both and kind of find that sweet spot perfect do you know what I mean but as any DJ would tell you, like, or say, you know what I mean? You win some, you lose some, do you know what I mean? At the end of the day, it is what it is. But for me, if you lose some because you played new music, then you still won. Yeah. Yeah, no, I do see. Let's talk a little bit about your latest project because I was sort of interested to sort of learn about the nature of some of the, or at least one of the early releases because it feels like you've kind of come full circle in a way. So you want to talk a bit about the new label? So last year, I mean, travelling and like being signed to a label like PMR, I kind of felt like... I was getting back to that point again where people are expecting stuff from you. Expectation is nice when people like it's nice, but the kind of person I am and how I am with my music is I like to, I like to shock. If someone's expecting something from me, I'll definitely run in the other direction. Do you know what I mean? So with that and being part of obviously a label that is a commercial label to a degree. I felt like I wasn't quite right at the time. And I'd always had in my head that like from what I was doing a label from the deep technology days to like five years ago to now, I've always had the thing in my head where I wanted to do like create a new label. I met a young gentleman called Kenneth like and on my way back from Ibiza, not last year, the year before. So two years ago, I met him on a plane on my way back from Ibiza. young guy 18 years old i went and sat down next to him on a plane and he looked up and he was like oh like t like t williams there and i was like i was like yeah like he was like oh wow i'm really into your music i was like sweet so he sat there and spoke to me about his music i spoke to me about my music for the mass matriculars journey journey back to london and i was like this is cool but i was like so like what do you do like kind of like well you know so much about my music and like all the music that's going on around around me what do you make music or what do you do so the guy decides to tell me that um basically makes music anyway we get off the plane his mom's on the plane as well His mum's like, oh, you need to help, like, my son or, you know what I mean, return the favour now, whatever. I was like, cool, whatever, took his number, took his SoundCloud, didn't listen to it. Like, done the most standard thing that a DJ that's out there doing his thing could do, just didn't listen to his music, didn't go on his SoundCloud. And one day I just decided, I just decided, I looked for my phone and I decided to this point in time i was doing my radio one residency directly downloaded one of his tracks and was just like look i'm gonna play this on radio one like i mean that stuff's amazing like i really like it whatever again really wasn't expecting it really blown away yes i played on radio one he got like a nice amount of plays on his sound card now and it was it was it was good for him fast forward he's been like holding back for I don't know however long and then just at the end of last year he just decided to hit me up again and just send me a pack of like new music and I was like this is amazing this stuff is actually amazing and the world needs to hear this this is like something fresh this is definitely something this is definitely direction i'm going in like it's like a cross-pollination between like dubstep and funky and like garage and house it's everything in one like but in a very clever way and so i was like yes this is definitely a do and he's young he's like 19 years old i was like this is this is like this is like how i was this is the freedom And just lo and behold, at the same time, roughly around the same time, I met these other guys, this trio from South London called Priest. And they've decided to basically throw down exactly the same flavor that I've been like. We've all been like thinking about and like this, this guy Kenneth from America has shown me as well. So I was like, wow, this is, this is amazing. Like there's, there's definitely freedom in this. So I was like, you know what? There's so much, there's only so much you can shout about someone or play their music in clubs or like play their music on radio shows. Start a label. makes sense like it makes perfect sense you know i mean and i always said i was never going to start a label if i was going to start a label to release like similar music to everyone else like i've always said i was going to start a label to release unique music again like just be releasing music that's very unique and that's been that's my ethos like right now and every act that's been that's coming on the label the music that they've given me has has been like so unique and I've definitely shown both producers that like I've fully signed to the label. Like I've shown people like that are well respected in the industry, their music and people are just like so excited and not so have they got management and have they got an agent and you know what I mean? And all the rest of it is really exciting. And there's nothing on the internet of these guys. There's no, like literally no SoundCloud, no nothing just yet. It's, this will be the first intro. So to sort of summarize their music and to summarize where you're at, you're talking about sort of like a, it's almost like a post everything headspace in a way because you're, you know, you're bringing everything together. You can say you're operating in garage or grime or jungle or house. You're kind of the aim is to bring everything into one place. Is that kind of what you're saying? Definitely. The aim is to bring, the aim is just to bring music forward that has every element of UK influence. Every track doesn't have to have every single element, but just has those elements of UK influences going on. Like, and the person doesn't have to be from London, doesn't have to be from the UK either. But if you've got that sensibility that has those elements from UK music, then that's what the label's about. I'm doing a special series as well, which I'll be releasing like tracks from like early doors. So Johnny Cash will be a release that's going, going out as well. It's just, it's just grand release music that some people have heard. Some people will know it. If you were part of the grand genre, like if you wasn't, then you'll get to hear it for the first time via my label as well. And that will be vinyl only as well. Like, so going back to that, like selling and actually like dipping into like being a part of like the solution. So I say like, I'd like to be part of like pushing things forward. You know what I mean? That's what I'm attempting to do with my label. - Are you able to talk at this point about the collaboration that we were? - Oh, it's definitely, definitely great. So like, so people that follow me know that like I'm a massive garage fan and. literally I've managed over the last couple of weeks to get in the studio with two of my heroes as it goes like so I've been in the studio with MJ Cole that track's actually finished that's coming out that's going to be on this EP so it should be landing maybe like april 2015 like so another couple of months or another month sorry should be it's done and does this well on its way already and then um i managed to get in the studio with wookie as well which is another one of my absolute heroes massive influence on my music and um we've been like we spent three days just talking like literally just talking about music and talking about our both our influences and It turns out, I mean, I'm a little bit younger than him, but it turns out that we've just got the same influences. We've come from exactly the same place. And I mean, I probably could hear that in his music. And yeah, so then we spent three days just chatting, eating, listening. to music and then on the last day we got into like making a track together um which is at the moment as it stands very soulful it's got like yeah and we're looking to bring that kind of that kind of element of the uk like the rest of souls like phil ashes like time like bugs in the egg that kind of flavor into what we're doing and uh bring it forward and finish a little two track Is there something you sort of identify in him that maybe you see in yourself that kind of allows you to, you know, roll with the times in the way that you have? You know, you've seen so many different like musical movements like Come and Go. You've weathered so many like different little, you know, periods of UK club music. Like, you know, is there a spirit that you guys share that has, you know, allowed you to stick around for so long? for sure I mean like coming into house music I looked at him he was he was a template that I looked at and saw that he definitely took a massive step away from garage and started making house music but he was making house music like it was undoubted like you could not deny it it was house music and that he released a defected and so when I was seeing all that's that's all part of the time that the period that I was like literally just sitting back and like taking a look at what was going on and really understanding what was going on what I wanted to do and seeing him do that and looking at how he his sound his sound changed from it was still him but how his sound had moved forward had progressed into like house music it really spurred me on and really influenced me and it kind of like yeah we say share that similar turnaround in time he was like the same he was like went from selling like crazy records and crazy units to like a down period where like no one wanted to hear his house music into a period where Defected kind of like had picked stuff up to a period where he had to kind of like decide whether he wanted to go into the funky UK funky scene because he had a big tune over there and kind of like stay away from it and he had all these stories for me so really like we have really come through a journey I mean I don't like to put myself in the same light as him because to me he's such a legend for me do you know what I mean at the end of the day but the story isn't that dissimilar in terms of how you've managed to kind of like keep yourself relevant in terms of like different times and make yourself happy with what you're making as a musician You can throw behind. You can throw behind. You can throw behind. Throw behind. You can throw.
