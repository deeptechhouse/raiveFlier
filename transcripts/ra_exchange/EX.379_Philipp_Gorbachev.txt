you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Filip Gorbachev. Even in a scene full of eccentrics, Philip Gorbachev stands out. He's a central figure in Moscow's tumultuous club scene, and his sound is defined by contrast between warehouse raves and post-punk. He recorded his last album with artists he met on Craigslist. While on stage, he's a truly flamboyant character, partial to orange jumpsuits and black shades. But speaking with Will Lynch, now Berlin office, it's clear that his quirks are matched only by his optimism. As difficult as things may be, he has unshakable faith in his city's club scene and believes fully in the value of Russia's contribution to electronic music worldwide. ♪ You live in Berlin, but you were born, you grew up in Moscow, is that right? Yeah, yeah, that's correct. I spend most of my life now in Berlin, as I've been living here with my family in the 90s. and it was a recent more grown-up decision to move to Berlin in 2010 when I was around 21 or something like that. And that was because I was very much wanting to be part of a certain dance movement, a certain dance culture. It was a time when I got a chance to play music together with They call them people. And that's the time when I got to know Reboledo and Matheus Aguayo. And through these people and their friends, I basically got involved in parties and music making out of Russia. What's it like being a young person interested in electronic music in Moscow? Well... It really depends on the times you live in, I think, because obviously now in 2017, what I see is that there is big interest in dance music, if one can compare this to the times when I was entering my 20s. because it was more of a private party scene. you know, places where you could get into only with a guest list or you are friends with friends. And the audience there was not particularly young. It was just a mix, a crazy mix, a very social party with people from, you know, luxury world, some politicians going off and, you know, it was just... Adult entertainment zone. And maybe a little more elite, it sounds like. I would say the dance movements that came from... people that don't have actually time to find a gasless spot on these elite parties, so to say, of the music that comes from the streets, in other words. It took time for things to kick off in this direction. And I think that Dan's scene that I have now in front of my eyes and in front of my heart in Moscow is very much the result of this development of... people who bought a little drum machine, saved some cash from their jobs or whatever savings and went to a couple of festivals and seen, wow, you can do shows using this drum machine and this microphone. Or you can just play the DJ set with this certain groove attitude. And the world is full of possibilities. So let's try to experiment. in this direction. And I think that all these people now that grew up from this idea of making music, all this generation now is very inspiring. So it sounds like basically there was something like a renaissance of underground electronic music in the last five, ten years? Well... I don't know, underground, I'm not a big fan of underground world. A rise of creativity and activity that comes from own initiative. So to say people started to believe I can make this beat, I can make this song. I have a vision and I have enough instruments to share it. And so there's no big amount of industry and middleman between this artistic idea to share something and the result that you play at the party. Because many parties in Moscow, you know, are organized by more or less the same people. And you can have a constant dialogue with the audience, which is pretty cool. But, you know. There's not even a single serious booking agency nowadays working in Russia that can help connect independent artists and independent clubs because there are basically maybe five clubs in the whole country where you could play on a proper sound system and in a proper setting, you know, so where you can play the music that flows out of you. not being afraid that some night manager will come and say, this is too tough or we want something more dancey. I mean, this is part of the past. That's great. So it's basically, I think, a struggle for independence of personal and collective artistic ideas. And this is just, I think, a great start on a long trip to quality and unity. You said before you described the current scene as the one... in front of you right now, the current scene in Russia. So even though you live in Berlin, it seems like you remain pretty closely connected to the scene there. Yes. I think I'm sort of a weird patriot in a way because I totally love playing in Russia. You say a weird patriot? Yeah, patriot. Yeah, patriot. Because... There's things I don't like in Russia, but there's things I very much like in Russia. And of course, dance music and parties I like very much in Russia. Moscow has been, in my memories, always a great place to have a proper party. And it remains like this. And I think that the general distance between people at the party is very, very low. What do you mean by that? You can talk to anyone and you can hug everyone and basically there is no feeling that you are... trying to get into some secret society or something like this. It's very touchable and I like it very much. And I think it's going to change because it's going to develop, of course, but it's just very fresh. It's very young, you know, it's just the beginning of the body language and some fashion for the dance door. people making some DIY clothes and t-shirts and printing some obscure logos and stickers and dream about having a record label and all those things. So it's very interesting to be part of this. I just like it very much. The personality types that populate this scene you're describing, would you say they're misfits within Russian society or are they sort of classic young Muscovites? I've changed my mind towards many ways to describe certain scenes because I came to a point where I, among other things, stopped to believe in scenes as categories. Because from my experience, good music and something that we call a scene is a result of a friendship. And so basically a scene is a big network of friends. I also think that something like friendship or art or music doesn't come from a certain prerogative from above. It's something that flows naturally and grows like a tree within a friendship. A certain sound, a certain beat, a certain joke. or a certain code of behavior. So for me, it's all about just people trusting more in relationships rather than into some role models that come from anywhere. Because with friendship, it's a great thing. You can build up something together that is yours with some other people that you feel good together with. or with whom it's a struggle, but it's still good. And these things are charged with the special energy of love, because it's basically love. You spread love from your side, there's people who spread love from their side, and then you do something together. So you create something together. And I think this is very much independent from nations. and different political regimes because basically people want to be together but there's a lot of things that are separating them or are meant to separate them. And I think music is a power that holds it all together because with the music we produce sounds that celebrate the moment, the unity. It's not sounds that are meant to disassemble the people. I mean, that's my personal opinion, because otherwise no party will work. People will just go home and run away from these horrible sounds. And from these... you know, strange people playing their strange sounds. But there is a reason why people get attracted to this. And I think it's all in love. It's all in unity. Moscow definitely, as any place on the planet, has this unity. And I think the more tough the environment is around, the contrast in the society, the more valuable is a situation where... It's 11 o'clock in the morning on Sunday. You're playing a totally packed warehouse or any sort of a historical building at, for example, an Arma 17 event in Moscow. You feel really good. You feel the really, really, really right place. And that's my condition, mental condition, when I play parties in Moscow, that I feel that we're doing something very, very great, totally great at this moment, that we're uniting people. As I told you, this feeling is general, but maybe just as a person that comes from Moscow, I'm super glad that these things also happened there. It gives me hope. You're speaking about music as something that unifies people. That might otherwise be separated by political differences or general kind of forces at play. Yeah, all sorts of like, you know, gender and political choices, you know, involvements or disagreements with some minorities or whatever. I don't know. I never experienced really things like this on a dance floor. The need to be separated. I always felt a chance to be united. And I think this is something a lot of people from the society can learn from dance culture in general. Because it's basically self-regulating working water. A big lake. That's an example of how you can keep the molecules together. I don't know why it's together, but perhaps it's because people really love it. I want to talk about the way that it seems like in Moscow, club culture is a game of cat and mouse a little bit. Or maybe that's just ARMA 17. I'm not sure. Well, to take ARMA as an example. If you look at the timeline since 2009, it just seems there's a weird amount of intrigue and the club seems kind of persecuted. It burns down in a fire and then the new one is shut down by the police and then their festival. is shut down just before it starts. And then now, just recently, their birthday party in St. Petersburg was mysteriously shut down as well. And also that my understanding is a couple of those incidents outline in the most recent birthday party. It seems like they waited till the exact moment where the club would lose the most money. All the artists had been paid and the equipment had been leased. Anyway, it just seems like the state has some kind of very keen interest in keeping them down. I guess, first of all, is that a general thing with club culture in Moscow or in Russia? Or is it just Arma 17? And in general, why is that happening? Why are the police so interested in this club, this promoter? There are at least five different versions why this is happening. And all of these versions are also generated within the more, I would say, management circles of the club and of the community. So I don't want to sound muddy because I don't know. I don't know. It can be many different factors. And especially in a political system of my country, the reason can be extraordinary. You never know. It's usually a combination of different factors. Well, anything is a combination of different factors. But I don't know. I don't know. It's just sad that I lost the great platform. But on the other hand, there is also different kinds of festivals and music. enthusiasts that create different events. So let's see. I really hope that this will come back and the situation will be cleared. The reason why I really love ARMA is it's a great example of how a dance party and a festival can be an art form in itself. I know that the people who organized it, Natasha Abel and Jenny Sobel, They're investing so much creative energy, but also artistic vision in their event so that the event itself becomes an art form. And this I totally love because it's great to play in such a context. It's a fantasy. And it's fantasy on such an interesting level of... style combinations that became really my favorite place. And I was super happy when I could offer to be, well, a member of this community, not just a guest, a resident. But for example, there are also people that never played Arma. and are also very interesting musicians. So it's just, you know, it's their child, RMS17. It's nine years old. Right now I'm working more closely in Moscow among all other musicians with a group called Interchain. their founders there are two guys um abgon andrew lee whom i released on my label pg tune and um is a guitar player and a leader of another band called glint shake so I'm just telling this story to show that, for example, these people have a very powerful live approach on stage, which refers to me as well. They're showing that a proper dance party in Moscow with their participants is not a party where a DJ plays a sublime set for 10 hours, but it's a party where there is a... live dance project in the middle of the lineup that heats up the energy for almost two hours with all things that the audience allows them to do like scratching some metal panels with a microphone phone and jumping on the table and then the crowd and dancing and moving like there are no cameras even invented in the world you know things like this things like this and i like it very much you know that you can really you can you can you can go go much much far as a performer and uh this is great this is perfect yeah this is perfect I know your influences are not strictly just dance music, things like post-punk. And I know you were into the Russian band Kino. Kino. I mean, I have to because they've been friends of my family. And I was very young, it was a very small baby, but maybe I still could feel the physical presence of the band that was having breakfast with my mother. Things like this. But they're an influential band in Russia, right? Of course, yeah. To be in the dance music scene and have some of your biggest influences not be straight up club music. but more sort of post-punk and that kind of modern rock. Is that something that's relatively common in the club scene in Moscow, or is that more particular to you? Well, everyone knows Quinoa, everyone knows Zvukimu, everyone knows Kuroishin and most of the clubbers watched something like Tarkovsky, Andrei Rublev. And most of the clubbers go to church. It's actually something I came to a conclusion. And most of the clubbers and most of the people who love dance music, they may have been taken to church with their parents when they were young. So I think that the whole melody of Russian-based sounds, so sounds that come from Russian artists... have very much to do with a certain melodics, of course, of the Russian language itself. but also how you can express certain spiritual conditions of your soul and of your mind through this language. So for me, this is, for instance, a big, big influence of how I shape music as a person who was born in Moscow. For example... When I see some works of avant-garde artists as avant-garde, I mean, they later coded avant-garde, Malevich would never say that he's avant-garde. Anyway, you know, the Black Square or E. Lysitsky, you know, all those, you know, strange red and black and white figures that clash in space. Well, as they call it, suprematism, yeah? The most important of all styles, the style that is above, you know, the absence of the subject. Беспредметная живопись, yeah? So it's not abstract, it's the absence of the subject and all those things. I think that they influence very much how people understand music. and time and space in general, you know, the groove of elements, the groove of energies, which is for me very much musical. Because if you look at the rave scene, of course, from the late 80s and the 90s, there have been people that said, OK, I want to have a dance party. I invite a couple of teachers from Berlin. a couple from Paris, we're gonna play all new records from Chicago and Detroit and some new stuff from Frankfurt and we're gonna have a crazy crazy crazy party. But it's more like a social environment because till now the majority of music that was being played in Russia was not made in Russia. And it's great because it unites people, it shows different approaches to music, which is international. Dance music is international music. But I think recently people started to think, okay, my own country has so much interesting, undefined magic. in the communication which is not used on the dance floor. So this is for example why I got totally inspired by the idea of singing in Russian. Most of my songs are in Russian or have Russian lyrics elements because otherwise I wouldn't connect to the people on a dance floor. I mean I can go out in Moscow and say You know, where's Ronnie Douglas? And everyone would shout, he was killed by the CIA. But if I want to touch a couple of, you know, more intelligent topics, there would be not so much response, you know. So, or some other jokes. So, and, you know, this idea of using more Russian-based elements in dance music saved my life. I wouldn't be able to create more music and record new albums if I wouldn't realize that. And this is something really cool because it gives me, you know, certain ground to sit here and to tell stories how different and interesting Moscow is because I loved it on a much, much higher level actually after I had to leave it. after I left the country. But then now I can't imagine every two months I have to be in Moscow because I have to play shows, but just I miss it very much. But I get charged and then I have my own quiet time in the studio because I prefer when I work to have complete isolation from things that could disturb me because I need to work. Do you work here in Moscow? I work in Berlin. My production hub, my platforms for creating music are in Berlin. It's the District Union Studio, which we created with Matthias Aguayo when we moved to Berlin in the same year, almost to the same street. And it's also my little hideout place. isolated location near the lakes in West Berlin. But it doesn't matter where I live. It's more that when it's totally quiet and then when I can concentrate on the subject, on the topic. Because since a couple of years it has been my rule to first of all I avoided all my personal social networks communication. I'm not available actually for chatting or sharing links all the time and discussing some news from the top 10 wall posts of the community. I think this is something, it has a stop, you know. We can share all our life online, but there is a certain limit where... it becomes more or less useless. Because as I told you, I don't know any other better situation than a dance party or a party. or a gathering of people that came there out of their own interests or anything that came out of your own interests and out of your own dream. Something that you really wanted to do and something that you sacrificed for what you sacrificed a lot of things in your life. What do you mean, sacrifice? It was not easy for me, for instance, to move out of... Moscow to a country that I don't know so much to adopt to the language system I didn't use so much to live without my friends not see my parents it was an exercise how I can adopt to someone of how I can learn different languages, how I can learn different cultures. And I think it was a very valuable experience because I like to know more about the people that I could potentially meet and work with. Because otherwise... I can't really believe that the world will have a major interest in Russian people without Russian people. I mean people that grew up in the culture with the Russian language at its core. I don't believe that the world will make a first step. It's about us stepping out of our comfort zone and see if a dialogue is possible at all. I can call my friends and we're going to have a couple of buses and making the wildest party in this office right now. But they won't do it themselves. The majority of them don't even possess a passport that can allow to leave the country. They're not really interested in this. A lot of people from the Western world, they have no idea what's happening in Russia. So there is certainly not a curtain. I don't know if it's iron, but it's a... Certainly, there is a buffer zone that is hard to break. It is there. We cannot say it's not there. And it's a totally different environment. I mean, Russia has borders with countries that's, you know, from Norway to USA. It's basically all the countries that you can imagine in Asia and Europe. So when people, for instance, also speak about how horrible it's with some human rights there or that minorities, gay people, get almost killed in certain republics. They do get killed. This is because we live in a world that is not developed equally. You know, what happened to some people who tried to open new continents or to find new islands? They got in touch with the locals and the locals, they... basically ate them you know so It was not so long ago. I think it's interesting to consider the factors that isolate people within Russia, especially if you take people that are interested in electronic music, the reasons that they wouldn't be as easily plugged in to the international scene as someone just like them living within the EU, for instance. I think I've read you mentioned before, you said something like how people in the West wouldn't imagine that something like getting a good mastering job or you mentioned it earlier, getting a booking agent, those kinds of things just aren't as available to people in Russia as they are in the West. And so basically there are real factors at play that... prevent this dialogue that you're describing from happening. Do you think that's true? Real factors are having that there's not so much money and not so much people who believe that with music you can create something sustainable and independent. Whereas to the big extent, I feel that's something that we have now. in the music world. I mean, it's something that I try to fight. I'm just talking about my personal approach to this, that there's very much happening with inertia. Is it a good word in English? Inertia, yeah. So something that was a big, big movement, and then it fell apart into different pieces. And they're like asteroids still burning through the atmosphere of new generations and new youth cultures. So they think that in order to, well, they think, I thought so. I'm not speaking about anyone else. I thought so. It's great to jump on a certain trend, wave, ride it and become this or that, depending on how I feel something is spreading. The information is spreading in the world after a certain. explosion or crash or extreme development of music and the record industry. That you can, you know, make a song, sell records, get the money back and, I don't know, go to an island and have a private party all in white and whatever. It's a fantasy. The reality is that you have to create your own context and you have to fight for it every day. If you do it like this, then maybe you have a chance to have a proper sounding... dance music output because at least I feel good if I know that I worked it out that I know that there is nothing else that I could imagine that requires additional movement you know there is always room for improving you know the quality the how it sounds just how rich the music is or how correct the communication is but all my attempts to think about music ended in a catastrophe because I'm a person that can't stop making music and can't stop being the rhythm, being the groove. I'm a drummer so basically as an artist I gave up to understand what's happening around myself. in a more regulated logic world of music, of the world where there is not only musicians surrounding you, but also people who have their personal interests in how to use and spread the information. with music but all I want to say is that a musician has to play music that's all it's great where there is a context for that a playground but the judgment of the musician should be depending on his last record and on his last show These are the only platforms that I feel are true of what I'm doing. And I think that most of the online platforms for what I'm doing are not working. I'm not a person that grew up out of Internet. I am a person that grew up with a happy life and then suddenly I found myself in a situation, a happy childhood, a happy socializing. I found myself in a situation where I have to somehow rearrange totally the way I have to communicate with the world. Why is that? Well, because of the social media, I think, of the social network, of how people started to around me, for example, to put more values on certain things. You know, I have this friend who told me, Conan, enter. I can introduce you to my partners in America, to this booking agency, because I think you need to make your first USA tour. you have to have at least 5,000 followers on Instagram to be able to start working with them. And when I hear things like this, I value much more my few soul shows, live shows that I have, because I know that there is a different way. There is a different way. There is a different way to get out your word out there to the people directly. And this is very much we have to preserve. I think the natural things, you know, that we can touch people by the hand or say, hey, I don't think you're right. Come over and we talk about it, you know. And you listen to some music together. You go to a party to make some music together. It's just, you know, mutual support, mutual healing, you know. I'm a fan of the idea that all the technology that we have around us, crazy planes. Crazy communication networks, crazy mixing boards, crazy music equipment. Things like this, they are there for us not to control each other, not to spread our own power over each other that is based on the idea that everyone is controllable. But they're instruments for us to help each other to get closer, to use them to express the same ideas that we would have if we were just about to invent a stone hammer. or a fishing rod for the first time in our life, you know, then you can catch more fish to your family, right? If you have too much, then you share it with your neighbor, or you can maybe sell it for a little sum of money that allows you to buy another rod, right? But there is a limit where values get mixed up so much that it's time to read the Bible. It's time to read how Christ came to earth and how he showed us what's important in life and that the hunt for more power and money, the hunt of domination of one knowledge over the other one is a path of death because there's one love and there's one God, you know. And this is something that I think also holds me very tight together. That I can just, you know, basically work and pray. That's all I need. But we have to preserve this understanding, especially when children grow up, the people that are young and entering the world, well, they know anyway, sooner or later with their own mistakes, but dance music is a celebration of this freedom of spirit that allows you not to take from someone, but to give. Because the stuff that you gain is not the stuff that you steal from someone. It's the stuff that, it's love, you know. You fill yourself with love and then you share. And this is it. This is life. You're having a lot of club experiences in Russia and then club experiences here and the other cities and countries where you perform. Do you feel like club culture means something different in Russia than it does in the West? Well, again, club culture, it's a very heavy term, you know. I think totally club culture can work if you present this idea to a certain high level of social organization, to a politician. But I also don't think that people, especially in remote areas where it's a great situation where you can, out of making music, out of playing shows, that you can pay your bills and get a couple of new... toys to play around in the studio and share these toys with some other people. I don't think that Club Carter, again, should be very much defined what it is because it's too early, first of all, and it sets up a certain framework that people... can go to but I don't like it so much I think it divides the whole friendship into categories again and the scenes and the genres and all these things I guess I just mean more the act of going out of going out dancing yeah well going out is Something that you do if you don't play computer games at all, basically. It's just very natural. To give an example, I find that in a place like London or New York or Berlin, going out and dancing all night, it's been around for a while. It's a kind of mainstream phenomenon that everyone knows about. And it's almost kind of like you have it on tap, like everybody, thousands of people do it every weekend. Whereas in a place like Belgrade or Tbilisi, it's not, it doesn't have quite that sort of consumer element to it. Or at least at some of the clubs, there's a richer dimension there that has to do with more than just going out and getting drunk and having fun. maybe getting laid. Of course, of course. Yeah. So I guess I'm wondering, I get the impression that in Russia, there is sort of a spirit to the act of going out that separates it from, you know, Western cities. And I guess I'm curious how you would characterize that. I think it's just very fresh, you know. Because people feel that there is a possibility to unite again, to unite with similar people and with people who like similar sound and similar styles. There is this idea of the brotherhood. And since there is not so much offering, not so much parties where you can actually go to, And make a proud selfie or proud picture and say, I'm here because it's so, so cool. Look around. Everyone is so... just so nice. I want to party with everyone. I want to touch everyone. I want to be part of this and want to contribute to this. I think that at least when I was starting to discover this world, I felt so grateful that I can go out to these events and not be, for example, part of more. traditional culture phenomena because I don't I mean don't get me wrong Russia has a big history of music acts okay we have people from the 80s like legendary avant-garde really independent original music musical artists like Zvukimu and Kino, Kurochen the guy who has this lecturer that Lenin was actually a mushroom. You know this? Just Google it, it's super fun. Just the whole mystification and the whole freestyle jazz jam with certain social facts and historical... But then there is of course a big scene that play more new metal or metal or heavy sound inspired music. There is bands like IFK or Kirpichi that play very tight heavy guitar music and are still very very much cool. Of course there was a time where there was MTV with some real heroes from the scene, you know, that you could actually watch after you come back from school. And wow, this band is so cool. It's there on TV and I want to buy their record and go to their concert. Like Gidpichi or IFK, they played huge gigs on the Red Square. The Red Square was full of punks and people with crazy haircuts, with huge leather boots and with crazy outfits and all this counterculture movements. We're not a country where there is either a dance or a techno party or it's songs about flowers for grandmothers on public TV or some American import to the country of some mass media entertainment. So there has been, of course, a very rich tradition of people finding their own independent ways to come together, starting with literature, with visual art, with film in particular. It also, you know, doesn't grow in a very empty space. All I want to say is that there is, of course, a lot of interest to international acts because the quality of their show is very, very high. There is not so many musicians from Russia that are taking care of a certain quality aspect of their show in presence. I think because of the absence of special standards that the culture creates after years of its existence. And it's rough, it's fun, it's cool, but I also like very much, for example, to spend a couple of more hours for a mixdown. to go to the mastering studio and to see how the record gets mastered or how the vinyl cut works. And this is all very, very interesting knowledge that, of course, for example, in Berlin, it's fantastic to get it from everywhere, from so many people that I'm happy to work together with. Because I don't want to turn this into a name dropping podcast, but... I must say that I was first of all very very lucky to get into the hangout and the group of artists and teachers I'm having a close communication and relation right now relationship right now because most of them have been such far away stars and names for me as a young boy listening to pirate mp3 diy collections of some techno or house sounds from a certain country, from a certain label or other strangely compiled pirate CDs because there was not even a possibility to collect some vinyl records or be into this culture. I mean, I had no money. All the friends that had money to buy a vinyl step... And actually bankers or people who started to work in some more solid institutions or in the corporate world. But still, through the internet, I think I got connected still to the music around the world because it's for free. The idea of a network where everything is there, you just need to get it. You need it. You press the button and you get it. It's a really nice idea. Of course, knowing some great artists from the first hand and being able to work with them, not only from the electronic music production idea, which is very much based on how the frequencies work on the dance floor, but also, for example, I mean, I worked with. Paul Leary from the Butthole Surfers, which is the band that I was listening when I was 15. And the Locust Abortion Technician album that was given to my family by Piotr Mamonov, the guy who is the lead singer of Zvukimu. So it's a very mysterious world. Zvukimu being another sort of seminal. Post-punk band, is that right? Well, I don't know the genre. I mean, yeah, it's... I think this involvement in international context is very much important for every artist. Every artist that comes from a country where he has to fight his own path through the hard context around him. You can maybe call them third world countries. Maybe Russia is really part of this. a group of countries in some terms, but that this integration that many artists from around the world are looking for. I'm talking about myself, maybe young or a couple of months ago. I'm not looking for money, obviously, or I'm not looking for fame, ideally, right? I am looking for a chance to be integrated, to basically have a communication with people in the world. This is the basic intention that I have as a dance music artist from the very beginning when my friends started to make raves at the riverside near my place outside of Moscow. It was more like a party for 70 friends and their friends that was lasting for the whole weekend. Everyone was doing everything there and my old friend was playing, well, he was a young banker at this moment and he was playing basically some great records from Planet E and Metroplex and early Compact releases. house records and crazy stuff you know and i was just going out there i was 15 or 16 and hanging out with a little bit grown-ups that are maybe a little bit more connected to the 90s in russia because of course 90s in russia is i don't know perhaps People felt it also in Berlin, when something big and not properly functioning is dying in the society. And people start really to show interest to each other and to believe that it's their time right now. Because, you know, it's written in many books in Russia that people in my country are waiting for someone from above to come and say, I'm going to save you. I'm going to show you the way. I'm going to give you security. This is the way we do it, you know. And, of course, you know who I'm talking about. It can be reincarnating in different, different persons. with time, you know. Basically everyone who is wearing a symbol of power is a person that you kinda have to trust all the time or have to be dependent on. And I don't think this is a good idea, you know. So anyway, the 90s I think were a little bit different. It was a time where there were so many possibilities and everything was so, so, so free. Good man. I've been looking at all of the animals by the ghost man. What's so hard to find?
