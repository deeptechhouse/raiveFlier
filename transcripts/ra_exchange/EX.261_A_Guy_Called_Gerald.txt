Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is a guy called Gerald. And yes, we pretty much had to play Voodoo Ray at the top of the podcast. It's his most famous track and arguably the biggest acid tune of all time. But it's hardly the end of the story for Gerald, as Ryan Kaling's interview with the Manchester Bread producer makes apparent. The conversation keeps coming back around to Gerald's passion for production and studio work. It's the unifying feature of a long and multifaceted career in dance music. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. A guy called Gerald, up next on The Exchange. Okay, so your career, I guess you could say it's been broken up into like three quite distinct phases. So we like had acid house years, if you like, when you sort of early to mid 90s jungle period and then like last decade or so, loosely speaking, like house and techno. So I wanted to kind of work back. through these and sort of begin by talking about the here and now. So my first question was really like where are you at now? Are you managing to spend much time in the studio? And what are you working on? I'm not spending as much time in the studio as I'd like at the moment because there's never enough like hours in the day really for the studio. But I'm getting in there a little bit and there is a lot of preparation for what I have to do. So I'm doing a lot of preparation on the road and also writing on the road too. Whereas, say, 10 years ago, writing on the road was pretty hard. And 20 years ago, it was nearly impossible. Yeah, it's great actually. I feel like the times have actually moved with what I needed to do. So is the main reason you're not getting the studio due to gig commitments? Would that be the simplest explanation? Yes, yeah, yeah. Like going out and playing live. I mean, it's actually becoming more of a passion to do that and I'm enjoying it more and more, whereas years ago I used to hate it because it was like, oh no, I have to leave the studio, actually leave the creative process and start to get more into performance. And now I've actually... I actually like, I enjoy the performance thing now. It's taken me like nearly 30 years. What changed? My attitude has changed and also it's a different generation. There's a lot of people who have kind of grown up with the music so they're a lot more responsive, they understand it a lot more now. So, yeah, I think that's probably it. Like, all of us, we've all changed. Yeah, no, I see. I mean, have things become more exciting on the sort of gear front, like technology-wise? Have there been things that have maybe, like, you know, got you more involved and excited in performing? Oh, yeah, for sure. I mean, like, every time I... Like, I have a look online, I see something, and I'm, I want that! I need that! Wow! They were thinking about that. Wow, you know. I feel a little bit guilty because there's so many people kind of going down the road of... like, oh, it's not like the original, is it? It doesn't have wooden sides on it, does it? Oh my God, it's not vintage. And I kind of... In my head, I've looked at that and I've analysed it because I do that a lot. And I've kind of put it down to they think that stuff from the past was like quality because the machines were quality. But I think what I've put it down to is a lot of the producers were actually quality. You know, the producers and artists, you know. That was their life, you know. They didn't do that because they wanted to get, like, a couple of gigs, you know. Like, they actually lived their life for the studio or for recording, you know. And, you know, I think that's the attitude that's needed now, and then people will appreciate the... machinery or the software even that's about now if you gave like one of these old guys from the past like a bit of software to use they'd you know it'd blow their minds you know it's like well it's like forever expandable you know they would make they make a tin can into into an orchestra yeah Whereas now it's like, oh, I've downloaded this keyboard and it doesn't sound like someone from the past, so I'm going to have to download it. Then three years' time they're like, oh, MP3s or this download stuff is really rubbish because it doesn't sound like that really old authentic track that I used to like. well uh yeah to think about your theory for a minute i guess if you're talking about like you know take the late 80s for example the barriers to entry was so much higher so the people who wanted to get into making music would really have to want it and i guess like you'd be talking about saving up for for years in some cases to get the necessary bits of gear. And before you got it, you'd read the manual from back to front, you know what I mean? And you knew exactly how it worked. And, you know, there was no, actually there was less information about things because, like, there was not that information age. So, but, like, you would really, if you was hungry enough. then you would get it and you would hear people's hunger in their work. If you really wanted to get something or you really wanted to do something, it was there. So the people that were kind of half-hearted would fall by the wayside or they would just not be involved. I remember a few people... like buying and selling 303s in the mid-80s, you know, and like if you said that like now to someone who's just started to pick records up or something, I mean vinyls, sorry, they would be like... Oh, my God, they sold their 303. You know, whereas, like, years ago, it was like, oh, it's a plastic box. You know, it's not a bass. It doesn't sound like a bass. And a drum is not a drummer. You know, this was, like, a constant thing that I would hear. I mean, I did a track called Emotions Electric because I was constantly getting beaten up for playing music that was non-emotional. It was blips and squeaks and like that was analog machines. Yeah, so I mean at the time when you were writing music on this stuff, did you think it was kind of like somehow flawed and a bit goofy rather than being something that was like, oh my God, this is incredible. Yeah, it was. I mean, because you're talking about instruments that were trying to emulate real sounds. And if you have people around you saying, like, this has no soul. Yeah, yeah, basically. So it was left of center. It was like the quirky people were into it. You would go down to the music shop and it would be like the... bloke in like the like the Macintosh and like long hair and like you know his face was really grey and he'd be like trying to make helicopter sounds and Doppler sounds with like an SH-101 and stuff like that you know and it was like kind of pre-sampler so you know you would really you know you was trying to make realistic sounds like dogs barking and stuff with synthesis you know and People would really get into how our sounds were created, not just like... grabbing bits and pieces so you would get really deep into into the sounds and also there were people who would get in deep into the processing of the sounds and like you know there was all these different techniques and stuff and you would swap things around i would go into the studio recording studio and i would spend a lot of time like with the engineers like asking them different things about reverb techniques and how to use reverb in different ways i mean you would have a reverb like box and it would only have a certain amount of like um patches or whatever in it so you would have to use it in different ways and like try and utilize what you had i mean there were recording processes where you would have to record things like a few times before you got a certain thing to happen you know i mean and Like to do that today, I'm thinking would be, you know, I mean, for me, it's great. I mean, I still take time and I'm glad I've kind of had the patience. kind of one of the major things you needed at the time was patience you couldn't just download something yeah it's funny because um i guess in those days if someone had offered you some of the solutions that are available now you would have bit their arm off And now we've got modern producers who are looking back to your era all misty-eyed, thinking, oh, God, it was so much better. It sounded so much more authentic. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I kind of like the stuff that's available. I'm like, oh, my God, you can do, you know, like I used to have to, okay, to put like a beat together, right, I would get a multi-track tape. That's a two-inch tape. Before you actually put it on the machine, you had to clean the machine, demagnetise it, and then you would put the tape on, you would have to spool it through the heads onto the tape machine, and then you would, like, wind it through, and then you would, like, stripe it with some simpty, so it would actually have a code on, like, say, Channel 24 or something. And that would take nearly half an hour at least before you'd actually switch. Just for the preparation. Yeah, just before you switched any machines on or anything. And then you would start switching machines on and you would have to make sure that your MIDI to SMPTE machine thing was in sync. And if it wasn't, then you would have to rewind it back to the start. And sometimes things would drop out and then they would come back in again. You would have to go back then and re-record it. So it was a really long process of, like, trial and error because it was at a time when things were changing from just, like, regular recording to MIDI and, like, you know, so it was a crossover between, like, I mean, I suppose, like, nowadays they would call it analogue, like, digital, you know. Back then, yeah, it was, like, live and computer, you know. It was... I mean, it was kind of pre-computer, but it was at a time where you're starting to use machines to do some of the processes that would have been done live. And for the type of music... it needed to be like that, you know, I mean, like, basically, it was just about the start of, like, this industrial type thing, and, like, I basically, I grew up in an industrial city, and I thought, wow, this is my music, this is how we do it, you know what I mean, like, it's all kind of, like, mechanical, and, you know, this, you know, so you really kind of got into the way that the process was, and, like like a doctrine for me. I could have easily played a bass, but it was, for me, actually playing, having the computer or having the sequencer play a bass was kind of a lot more kind of part of the scene of what I was doing, you know what I mean? It's like if you was a realist painter, you would paint in a certain way. And, you know, I seen the art form as something that had to be kind of sculpted together with machines. I mean... You talked about it in terms of my music and my sound. With the type of music that we're discussing, was this the first time where you really felt like, in your core, I identify with this thing? This is mine, maybe in a way that music, other music I was into, belonged to other people or other generations? Yeah, for sure. Something that, I mean, it borrowed from all these other things and at the same time it was growing. I felt I was growing with it. So I was like, well, you know, obviously if I'm growing with it, it's there and I'm kind of... not being left behind and it's it's basically it's um building itself around me then it must be something to do with me or it's mine or you know or it's i'm part of what it is yeah i mean you you must have had the sense like i'm here i'm kind of in this on the first floor you know i'm seeing this from its like grassroots stages i mean i suppose you didn't know if there was going to be another level level you know you were just basically working with what you had i mean like in the in the early days there was no or very little sampling i mean it was very aware of like um what was happening with sampling but it was just way too expensive like sampling was like the high end, you know, like sampling was like Art of Noise or Peter Gabriel, you know what I mean, using the Fairlight or... So it's pretty much stuff that was only available in like high end studios at that point, yeah. So, I mean, basically when the Akai came along, the MPC-60, it just kind of, I mean, like the, what was it before the MPC-60, it was the... Rack mounted stuff like the S950 or the S900, the S1000, basically made sampling accessible to people in what you would call a bedroom studio or whatever. So I totally got straight into that because I had all these ideas and stuff that I was doing with the analogue stuff. can only do so much or you can only shape so many sounds and you would never get the same sound so you know sampling was a way into that you know it was like a real jump it was like in the early days you would still process you know so you wouldn't just sample like a snare drum and like that would be the snare drum you would sample it and then you would put it through an envelope and then you would put that through a reverb, so you would still treat the sound, you would want to own everything that you had, especially in the mid-sampling era times where they started to... sue people and stuff so the game was to try and yeah disguise your sounds so that nobody would understand it you know i mean no one would recognize it sorry which was really useful i thought because it just added to the to the skill that you needed you know and like um especially in the kind of early days of like um Post-rave, early jungle, you know, it was like basically you would be showing off your skill as a producer with what you could disguise, you know, so you would take like the most known sample or whatever and then you would like totally cloak it or, you know, you'd find a new way. of using the sampler to cut it up. Right, so you could say to your friend, you'll never guess what that is. Exactly. That was the game. I mean, like for me, you're like, you know, and you would, you'd like totally cut things up and rip them apart. And, you know, you could use the same break as somebody else, you know, or you would even sample from their track. But you would just totally rip it apart. in a way that no one had thought of or whatever. It was really exciting. It was competitive. It wasn't just like, okay, that was a big hit. I'm going to take that because there was no hits. It kind of felt like... There was nothing to lose. Yeah, sure. You know, so you would just go, you know, but you was part of a scene. It would be like, you know, I suppose like before pro skating was about, you'd have all these people doing these crazy stunts and stuff like that. But like once they started to skate for real, then you'd have to have like certain rules and things. Anyway, yeah, it was kind of similar, you know. Are you still looking for that sort of technological kick these days? Are you still looking for something that could, like, you know, make you look at sound differently? Or are you still, like, chasing that sort of buzz, would you say? Yeah, always. I think that's probably my problem. I've never left it alone. I should go to myself, oh, wow, you know, let me just make some stuff like Skrillex or someone like that. You know, see if I can, like, go... ..instead of, like, using B-lines and stuff. But, no, I mean, I actually enjoy it. And there's always another level for me. I always feel there's another step and it's not actually just stopped at what you can do in a studio. Now I want to process the club environment. I really want to make a club environment that is, I'm sure it's possible, like a studio because there's no one that actually... has heard the music like how it's heard in a studio, I don't think. I mean, how do I explain it? How it sounds in the studio is totally different to how it sounds in a club, say, because you don't have the same acoustics. So you say a lot of the stereo imaging is lost, say, and if you put depth into your music and stuff, a lot of that can be lost because of distortion. in a club and I would love to create something where it was actually the club environment would actually absorb the excess sound so you could actually hear the depth really that simple but not only that but just changed the whole setup. So instead of having this guy on the podium who basically could be miming, who knows, have a thing right in the middle of the dance floor. I mean, for me personally, I would have like... all the machines kind of in a circle so I could run around in a circle and like kind of like sequence and change things around and like basically them guys who kind of just go up to the DJ box and kind of like stare at what's going on could then go back to the dance floor and like hang out there. Yeah, I see. Not only that but I could actually I wouldn't need, because I'd be playing live, I wouldn't need monitors so I could actually be hearing exactly the same thing. Yeah, it's a very good point actually. I think it was Bernd Friedman in an interview we did last year raised this idea that the way that we have monitoring set up in a club. is actually based on an outdated idea of performance and you'd have instruments on the stage to have them away from, or sorry, the microphones on stage to have them away from the PA. But we don't actually have this problem with this type of music, so why wouldn't you be in the field of the system? Exactly, yeah, yeah. It's totally, I mean, back then they were dealing with what you would call live noise and now it's... Basically, there's a lot of the stuff that is amplified and stuff a little bit, but it's all internal, so there's very little feedback, or none at all, usually. I mean, it does seem crazy that the DJ or the performer would be hearing a different signal than the people on the floor. I hate it. I always turn it off most of the time and try and listen to these speakers that I like. You know, they're right in front of me. I mean, I can't really hear them as much. But once I turn the monitors off, I can actually get a little bit of a feel of what the people are hearing. And because I'm controlling everything from, like, the hi-hat to the bass, I can actually... kind of balance things out a lot easier than like if I can't hear it I mean because like I've got I mean usually I'm playing like material that is like uncompressed and stuff and like it's not being mastered it's just because it's basically being done live and creating it live in the club so it'd be really nice to actually monitor it like the same time as I'm making it. Sure and you know especially as you seem to be someone who has this idea or like your brain seems to function in a way what are you thinking about sound in terms of the frequencies a lot and sculpting the sound and you talked before about like the sounds gelling together and kind of like sculpting the frequencies in that way so hearing what's actually. It's really important to hear what's going on because I mean, you can actually create really nice environments. I mean, there's a lot of audio illusions you can create and all that. People basically, I think they would really enjoy it. It actually makes people... You can create feelings of well-being just by the sound itself. It's played in the right way in the right environment. But you have to actually hear it yourself at the same time. That makes sense. It would be nice. Are there things that have come along in the last five to ten years that have maybe made you think about music production in a different way? Or do you have favourite new advancements or plug-ins or synths or something that have really pushed things forward for you? The first thing for me, the computer. I mean, like, when I started to use the computer, actually, I think it was 2003 or 2004. Before that, I was using a sequencer and basically recording onto tape still. Like, a lot of people, I mean, like, from the early jungle days, they were using the Taries and stuff. I had an Atari, but I was using it to automate my desk. But, yeah, once I started to use a computer to actually produce music, I was, like, blown away by what you could actually do, you know, like the... that you could go into it. I mean, I felt that I'd been missing out on a lot, you know what I mean, by just using the hardware stuff all the time. And then I noticed that I was actually using it in a little bit of a different way than most people. I was still using the... Even though I was using the computer, I was still using it like a tape deck. So I would be recording stuff linear and then going back and then doing, like, a mix later on. So you hadn't really, like, dug into the capabilities necessarily. Yeah. But, like, that was really cool. And then, like, then later on, like, the synths, I realised that, you know, a lot of them were open-ended and I started to... I'd say I have a synth that only had maybe a couple of envelope generators on it or whatever, and then all these kind of software synths came out where you could actually build your own generators, and then eventually you could build your own synths. And I was like, oh, my God, like, you know, why are people slagging this stuff off? You're building a synth that generates tone, you know, and it's up to you how the tone sounds. You can't, you know. And then I realized, hang on, it's another generation of people. And then I kind of thought, okay, so if these people were back. in the days where you would walk into a shop and see an SH-101 or something on the stand, they would have been like, there's no sound in this. Or it sounds like, you know, it's like really plasticky or whatever. Because they wouldn't have, you know, recognised that you actually have to chisel the sound out yourself. You have to actually make what it does. You can't... Because, like, now they just download the sound or they use presets. I mean, like, years ago, it's like you'd go into the shop and you'd kind of play around with a keyboard and you'd be like, oh, my God, it's like, you know, that's the preset. So you'd instantly, you'd get busy and you'd try and stretch the synth to its capabilities. You wouldn't just, you wouldn't take the preset as gospel. And I've kind of watched some young people doing production and stuff, and they'll download a synth, and then they'll go through all the banks of presets without actually stopping on one. kind of tweaking it about and making it as something else. Sort of reverse engineering it or something. Yeah, it's like, you know, you actually, that what you get isn't what, you know, what you're given isn't what it has to be. You know, you can, I mean, like that's what you're supposed to do. That's what all the little knobs are for. Yeah, sure. I mean, if you're thinking about then and now, do you... think there are any downsides to like modding recording setups probably yeah i think probably the just the over um accessibility to everything sure probably i mean like because i think one of the things that call it a karate in a way basically having Having less can be more. Basically having to make do with what you've got, stretching it to its capabilities instead of trying to do one thing and then throwing it away. You kind of lose passion and lose ideas. I think you need to grow with something. Say with the... drum machines and synths from the past, I felt I was growing with them. I mean, I'd learned how to use them and I'd learned, even though it sounded the same as what somebody else was doing, you'd found that you could make your own thing from it if you... kind of just worked with it and then you got used to doing it so much just over time that you could just do it with your eyes closed you know i mean and like if you can't work i mean you can't find a sound with you know with your eyes closed then it's gonna sound totally strange you know i mean so yeah i mean do you personally succumb to like the abundance of choices. Do you find yourself also getting a bit bogged down in like all of the options these days? No, but I do have... Some favourite synths, I kind of have a backlog of things to go through, synths and stuff that I need to go through, but I've got this habit of not throwing anything away because I never grew up with synths and stuff, so I'll go through and I'll go through it with a fine tooth comb in a way. a way of just you know going through the sequences i'll first try it out for the bass sounds and stuff And the best thing to do is, if there's a preset that has, it's like a string preset, you can, with the envelopes and stuff, you can change that into a bass sound, which has never been obviously heard before because it has always been that string. So I kind of try and switch stuff around and mess with... If you can get inside it, I mean, like, you know, I'll try and mess with the waveforms or the samples or, you know, and then the other level is actually layering, where you can, like, usually there's a lot of these things where you can layer stuff and make something from that, you know. I mean, it's pretty endless. So if you limit yourself to one... one machine at a time and then you discover it's basically it's pros and it's cons and like basically you know you could go into circuit bending it or whatever but you know if you can like actually work with that machine, then, you know, even when you're like, okay, you know, it doesn't have the sound that I want, I want to use something else. Or you've seen that ad for that other synth that sounds really cool. I mean, like, you know, you still, I think you just stick with it. I mean, because, I mean, like, it was so easy now. I mean, like, back then, it's like you had a SH-101 and I'm looking at the Jupiter But then I found a kind of way to create almost like a vibrating waveform that almost sounded like it was polyphonic or something, you know what I mean? But then that comes out sounding like something else, you know? So you never know. I mean, say like with Voodoo Ray, it was monophonic synths and I wanted a bass sound that sounded like it was polyphonic. So it didn't come out like that in the end, but what I did, I recorded the bass three times. And each time I recorded it, I was... modulating like how the bass was in like there's certain points where it crossed over where like all three kind of were oscillating in a certain type of way which created like some kind of weird metallic sound yeah sort of the relationship between the different lines yeah yeah yeah so i mean you never know what's possible with like experimentation you know i mean you just have to And so, like, if you're trying to reach a goal and you're experimenting, you know, you could, you know, on the journey, you'll probably find something else. And that's what that taught me, actually. use your limitations to, and like, if you've got no limitations, then try and limit yourself. So have you ended up with kind of an insane amount of gear at home? You're saying you've never really sold much stuff. Yeah. I mean, there's loads of gear. I mean, there's like some of it that's broken and like smashed up and, but I still got it. You know what I mean? Well, I mean, usually I have like a few days of kind of trying to mess around with a few bits and pieces, but most of the time I'll just kind of go into the computer. It's easier. So where are you based these days? Actually in Soho at the moment, but I've got a studio in Hackney. Okay. So how long have you been back in the UK now? Since December. Since December, okay. Because you were in Berlin for, it was a good few years, wasn't it? It was like 10 years. Right. 10 years there. It was really cool. I mean, like, I didn't kind of, didn't really do that much of the party scene, party party scene there. I mean, it was more kind of local. I was kind of part of... art house or Kunsthaus called the Tacheles and I did a lot of work there with them like kind of trying to do little bits of fundraising for them and basically trying to get things off the ground there and like help out and because they were like left of centre and like well it was under threat for a long time wasn't it yeah basically yeah and like the government wasn't really helping out like they should have done or they did but then in the end they put the hell's angels to come in and kick them out and sold the building. So what was the dispute over exactly? Was it just like a sort of classic Berlin squatting situation? No, I mean, like there was actually, there was rent being paid, but it was like it was funded by the government too. But there was a bit of a squabble between like the people that were upstairs and the people that were downstairs. and a lot of things were being left by the wayside that should have been looked at. And Berlin was changing at the same time, so the banks saw a bigger value for the place. It was like, wow, we could do this or whatever. Because it's in a really central location, isn't it? Yeah, it's like banks. It's right around the corner from the Reichstag, basically. I mean, did you end up feeling quite at home at Berlin? Yeah, oh yeah, it was 10 years. So yeah, I mean, I was totally at home there. I mean, when I first got there, it was like a blank canvas and there was just so much room for experimentation. Musically, they kind of discovered one brand of techno kind of thing, in a way, and I felt that working there, I could show different levels of what modern electronic dance music was about, or electronic music. So by the end, I had like... a theatre that I could use, like, any time. So I used to have a theatre to record in and all sorts. Oh, wow. It was lovely. Was it a tough decision to leave in the end? Yeah, yeah, it was totally a little bit sad because I was like, well, you know, I've got to kind of go back and... In one way, but then in another way, it's like, you know... It was time, I mean, like ten years in the same place kind of thing. I think that's the longest I've ever spent anywhere. I was in New York for about five years, I think, before I left there. Yeah, it was nice. It was nice to kind of... be there and be part of a community that was really progressive, really creative. And they were kind of, I mean, they still are. And they do their own thing and they do their own festivals. And it's all kind of self-funded. And they actually show. showed me that, you know, you could be independent in art and still do something creative and make it work. For sure. Yeah, I mean, I guess there is a sort of prevalent DIY spirit. in the city that you perhaps don't get elsewhere. Yeah, yeah. Because they basically, they had to make do, you know what I mean? There was no one that was going to help kind of thing. So they had to help each other, you know, and it was like this, I suppose, you would call it socialist type. of working I mean originally the Taclus was a place where when the wall came down it was a place where artists all over the city could go and eat for nothing so there would be people making sandwiches there and tea and stuff like that so it was kind of like a soup kitchen for poor artists and then eventually like you know artists move into there and There was loads of different people have been through there. It's got a crazy history. I mean, if you have a look at the Wikipedia of the tackle list, I think it's probably tacklelist.de. You probably see a bit of the history of the building and what it was. I mean, it's amazing what happened there. And I've met some amazing people being through there. It kind of made me look at stuff in a way that, you know, if you believe in what you're doing, then you have to really go for it and not kind of sell out, so to speak. So, yeah, they really kind of encouraged that. I was really happy to be there, actually, and part of that whole thing. And if people are strolling down Iranian Burgh's Trust, they should look out for the building with your big face on the side of it. Is the mural stood up on the side of the building? Oh, I'm not sure. I remember these people, I think it was some French people that did that, yeah, because I actually had it on my door at first. Yeah, okay. And they really liked it. painting the underside of the building, which was pretty funny at first because it was like you're going down the building and you're like, oh my God. There's a picture of you on the side of someone's building. That was enormous, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah. So I wanted to talk to you a little bit about, well, something that was really coming through club music, particularly in the UK over the last couple of years, which was people using samples of old hardcore and jungle records. Like, were you aware of this kind of going on over the last couple of years? Were you sort of like... noticing more of these original sounds coming up in tracks? Yeah, yeah, I've actually. And I suppose it's kind of, for me, looking at it, it's post-Two Step and Speed Garage, they had to, you know, there was something that was, you know, these things or these kind of sub-genres or genres were borrowing from... So I suppose the next move would be to just go straight in and kind of use the actual things itself. And in a way, I think it's kind of flattering that it gets to that kind of almost James Brown status of being sampled. Yeah, sure, sure. I think it's a kind of incredible state of affairs in a way because, you know, with Juicebox and, you know, your label and some of the work you were doing in the early 90s, you're widely credited as, you know, laying a blueprint for what became Jungle. at that time you're using sounds that are themselves 20 years old. Now we're in a position where 20 years later, people are picking up on those sounds again. So I wondered if you had like an opinion on just like what it is about these sounds that, you know, makes them have such an enduring quality. Like why are we still fascinated by things like the Amen break, for example? I think it's rawness, isn't it? It's like, I mean, it's got, it's got a history. I know, but like the actual energy of it, the raw energy of how it works. And I think if people actually looked, I mean, if you actually broke it down, you know, it's the syncopation, you know what I mean? The actual, it doesn't let up at any time, you know what I mean? But at the same time, there's a pattern to it. It's like, you know, the... we call it the golden circle kind of thing. You know, it's got this balance to it. So like where, you know, where it ends, it begins kind of thing. And, you know, I mean, that's, so I always try and look for in like when I'm trying to create a beat or when I'm chopping something up, it's like trying to create this energy circle within like the actual groove itself. Because it's, I mean, it's so easy with a machine just to go with, like, just the step of what the machine is, which, like, basically starts and it ends. Yeah, I mean, I kind of got into this loop science thing earlier on, and I used to do all sorts, like, I would... kind of grab, you know, like a load of knives and stuff and kind of drop them on the floor and do a field recording and then loop it. And then, you know, grab like, you know, part of it that sounded like it was the most syncopated and then like create like a whole groove around that kind of thing. So it's this idea of trying to come away from linearity. Because I guess if you think about like a jungle break, for example, like what you picture in your mind is something more circular rather than it going in a straight line. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Articulating that in a great way. No, no, it is. It's something that's kind of, it can actually travel and all. I mean, I think the best stuff kind of starts off really sparse and then it really builds. up into this kind of crazy kind of thing and maybe drops off or dies down again. I think over time, because of sampling technology and looping technology and stuff and the amount of samplers that are available and how cheap they are, Basically, all this affects the way that the music actually develops. And I think that a lot of it is basically regurgitated and regurgitated so much so that it needed to go back to the beginning. I mean, it got really, I mean, not ridiculous, but it just got to... like a state where it was unrecognizable for me anyway as a form of something that I could dance to. Sure, yeah. You know, I mean that happens like so many times that pattern. I remember in the early 80s listening to like Wizkid and like all these people cutting and scratching like Jam Master Jay and people like that and it was like there's a real musicality to what they were scratching but By the time it came to when the DMC was invented, then it became more of a sport. And then, like, you know, it would go out to a dance and there would be someone there practising. for DMC, you'd be like, hang on a minute, let the track go, let it go, let it go for a bit. I was enjoying that. Let us hear it, yeah, yeah. So basically that kind of thing starts to happen where you lose the dance ability by getting so technical. If it gets too technical, you can... You kind of veer off from the actual groove and I mean I've been guilty of that myself, you know what I mean? Where you just kind of just go off into like a... it's not even jamming anymore, it's just like this crazy, crazy sound or whatever. I'm really interested to know about the sort of transition period for you between when you were making kind of the earlier acid house tracks into something that was more resembling what would become Jungle with things being sped up. Like, I wonder if you could tell us about what that sort of time was like for you and whether it was something that was like really was interesting. intrinsically linked with the technology that was available to you i mean was it a case of like okay the sample time is now this and therefore i can achieve this like what sort of gets us from a to b would you say well i kind of started off like wanting to do like really experimental like acid and like Basically, I was limited at home because of studio space, well, studio equipment and stuff like that. Then I did a deal with a major record label. because I wanted to basically to get more equipment and have a space where I could create or go deeper into this acid thing. Unfortunately, I didn't realise that they weren't behind that idea. They were in pop records. So I kind of, I was getting more and more agitated. Around about the time as I'm getting agitated, like the whole scene is kind of growing from acid through into like kind of more kind of rave. Then the samplers come into play and, you know. I kind of, I get hold of a sampler and, you know, I'm trying to explain to the people at the label that, you know, like, you know... yeah, OK, yeah, I'll get a girl in with big tits to sing at the front, like, back box, but, you know, I really need to experiment with, like, this sample of stuff and, like, get, you know... Because there's another direction happening here at the same time as Snap or whatever, you know what I mean? There's a lot of this stuff where I come from, on the street, like, where things are developing, and they're not interested whatsoever. you know what i mean and like you know like i think they should have been interested because i was like kind of like look i can be a man on the street you know i mean yeah i'm trying to give you the next mutation basically you know like you know i'm honestly i'm i'm not not just doing this for myself and um i could have been like the one going the mp3s are coming But anyway, there was a turning point where there was a few people asking me for plates, dub plates. And I was with this label who refused for me to give away any of my material until it was released. And I was like, it's not working like that on the street. You know what I mean? They just did not want to know. I am kind of slowly backed away from it a bit. I'd done an album for them. It disappeared into the annals of their thing. It was like an album with vocals and it was called High Life Low Profile. Never got released. Kind of disappeared into their thing. But at the same time as I was doing that album. I was also doing a load of this stuff with brakes and stuff. I was experimenting with... High Life Low Profile was kind of like a crossover kind of thing. There was a lot of kind of brakey type stuff. some acid-y type stuff, but with songs. There's a few songs in there and a few, like, you know. Actually, I think one or two of the things probably were similar to some of the stuff that were on 28 Gone Bad Boy, the album. But, like, they didn't want to know at all about this stuff, and I was like, well... At one point, they weren't returning calls or anything, so I was like, OK, well, I guess I should just do my own thing. So I contacted a distribution company, and actually my agents at the time started a distribution company too. I decided to start a little label myself because I needed to put this stuff out. It's a bit kind of left of centre. I'm really into how it is and I've been going to some of these parties where they play this kind of music. So I started to put some of this music on my label, put it out. The next thing you knew, I was getting a call from some people down in London saying... yo, you need to come down here, man, to check out what's going on, because, like, it's kicking off. So I went down, I think it was Goldie actually called me up, and he was like, you know, come down to check out what's happening down here. So I went and I was listening to, like, people like Groove Rider and Fabio playing, and I was like, oh, my God, this is... Because I'd heard, like, some of the stuff that was It was kind of almost like post-rave. It was a little bit raw and then rave. One of the first things I heard, it was a Nicolette album called Now He's Early. And that was like songs, but like with breaks and stuff like that. And Shut Up and Dance, I think it was the Shut Up and Dance guys that did that. I was like, this is totally us, you know what I mean? It was like, wow, you know, it's like the reggae influence from the background, like all the kind of hip-hop and breakbeat that we'd grown up with and also like new wave. It was basically all gelled into one. I was like, oh, my God. How could I even think of looking back to just using a synth anymore? You know what I mean? This actually is a way that I can utilise synths and sampling and recording and going forward. You know what I mean? There was so much space in front. I had to kind of just stick with doing this label. And, like, you know, I think I was releasing one EP every month and I was actually still using... the record labels cutting mastering plays to new mastering. Because they never got back to me. I mean, I would call them and I could imagine there was someone, oh no, it's him again. And they wouldn't answer my calls. And I was like, you know, going, oh, you know, I was going to be like this. Oh, there's this thing happening, by the way, if you wanted to know. They were interested in Michael Jackson's next big hit. You know what I mean? I was like, well, fair enough. You know, like, you know, there's things happening down here that maybe you need to know about. Yeah. To kind of look back on that time, it was just seen as such as like fiercely creative and innovative periods in dance music. Did you have the sense at the time, like maybe for yourself and the producers, like your peers, that you really were doing something that was like really forging forward? Like what was the atmosphere like among, you know, in the scene at the time? Well, I mean, I don't know what it was like for a lot of other people. I mean, like they were, a lot of them were kind of, well, there's a few of them were looking up to me like, wow, I can't believe that in doing this music because you're the guy from Voodoo Ray and whatever. And I was like, you don't understand. This is us. Everything about this is what's happened. You know what I mean? Before, there was some stuff that came from America and we were kind of imitating it in a way. that as usual, that's what we've always done, or when we've done reggae, we've done stuff from Jamaica, you know what I mean? Or we've done kind of pop, but this is actually something that is from the street, from the concrete parts of England, or Britain, Great Britain, you know what I mean? This is a sound that's never been here before, you know what I mean? And it's basically... come out of all the junk that we've, like, basically glued together, that we've had here. You know, like, listen to it. Wow, you know what I mean? Of course, I'm not going to be, like, you know, yes, I'm the lord of this and black, you know, like, this is all of us together, you know what I mean? Like, everyone that was, like, raving, who basically came together in the early rave days, I mean, like, you know, this is us, and, like, listen to it. Wow, so it was really local. Didn't think about it being anywhere else at all, you know what I mean? It was, like, only on the pirate radio stations, and that's all I would listen to. Actually, I would come down to London because they only had two pirate radio stations in Manchester. So I would come down to London and listen to the pirates and be like, oh, my God, you know, like, there's this going on and that going on. And there's all sorts of different things happening. And, you know, the energy was, like, amazing, like, considering, like, you know, there was no kind of... major kind of funding and stuff people were kind of it was like self self kind of rewarding where like the could have like about half an hour of adverts on the radio station and that was just like how many dances that were going on that weekend you know what i mean and like you know and then this person then you'd hear a new track And then there was all sorts of different kind of systems going on, like where, you know, like music houses where a lot of the stuff was like being cut and stuff. But like, you know, a DJ would go down there or a producer DJ would go down there with like a load of mixes and he would have a different mix for each. DJ you know I mean and he would know the style he'd know that like Randall's like mixing was different from groove riders mixing the way he would do the mix though like the intro or whatever it would be for their style you know I mean there's a lot of stuff like this going on yeah you know so there's a lot of things suited to to the DJ and so he would so that they could cut plates that would be for the way that they would spin, so it fits into their system. I was totally blown away by this. I was like, oh my God. When that first started to happen, I was still with this major record label kind of thing. I was like so jealous. I was like, oh my God, like, you know, they're allowed to make tunes for like DJs that are getting played. But my stuff is like, basically they wanted me to do like this big thing and then go on a tour of this place that was totally outside of my kind of zone. You know what I mean? Did you come to regret that decision for signing for a major? Or like, how'd you look back on that? No, it was an experience. I mean, it was something that if I didn't do it then, I might have been caught in that trap later on. You know, like I learned a lot of things. I was like a fly on the wall at that time, you know, and I could see what they wanted. I could see how innocent and kind of greedy they were. I mean, the music kind of was just like a product, but they never really looked inside of... To me, anyway, what I could see was that they didn't really look inside how people would want it, you know what I mean? They just basically wanted to dish it out, you know, in volume, you know what I mean? And the important thing was the volume and not that sure how... people, you know, were interested in. So if there was a smaller group of people, you know what I mean, they would be totally overlooked, you know what I mean, where I was kind of like coming from an opposite way, you know what I mean, where I grew up in communities where... a lot of the music we were listening to never got heard anywhere else outside of that community, you know what I mean? Or in little pockets all over, all over the country. So, you know, and I, I wanted to cater for them people within what I was doing. I mean, how much were you traveling in the kind of like jungle heyday? Like how much were you getting to play abroad? A lot. The kind of peak of it would have been like in 93, 94. I was kind of doing this thing. It was mainly Europe. Okay. We was kind of doing this like kind of what we would call sowing the seeds kind of thing where we'd just go somewhere and like, you know, there'd be some rave or something going on and like it's coming with some beelines. Like it broke it, you know, smash it up kind of thing. And they'd be like, oh my God, what's going on? So it was, I mean, it was, it was interesting because like it was, it was kind of like an introduction, but like, I think what blew it up was. when it hit the States, and it was things like, I think, originally, I mean, before even metalheads or anything like that was happening over there, there was, I think, somehow like this, well, original nutter, that happened. And once that hit there, a whole kind of thing happened. I kind of think it was on the ground. Later on when I moved there, I think I moved there in like 97, 98, I think I moved over there and I started to kind of... like, kind of delving of what happened in America with Jungle, how did they actually kind of get hold of it? And, like, you know, it was... Their Jungle was totally different, but, like, because, you know, it was... What they'd actually got was, like, um... Like, not the really kind of technical stuff, and they didn't have, like, you know, like, we had all this, like, kind of reinforced. and all that and like moving shadow and yet you know it went through different periods depending on like what kind of month it was even you know I mean it was like kind of like a time where it was like really dark and then there was another time where there was this like other thing going on you know I mean but like they just got like this kind of they got the amen and like sort of like the the kind of jump they got jump up and because you know we was always on like kind of what next you know i mean because you know it changed so many times you were just like waiting you never knew what was going to happen so you were just waiting for to them it was like okay rock and roll or whatever jungle that's it you know i mean that's it's just happening like as it is were there other countries that it sort of took hold in particular there's a few different places um like going back now I think another place I can remember was Switzerland. Really? It was like where it totally, it was tearing it up. It was totally tearing up Switzerland. I think a part of Germany, definitely there's like little places in Germany where it was having it. Mannheim, definitely. I can't remember off by heart now, but like when we was on a little tour, we had to kind of... I don't know, we had to run around and kind of explain to certain people what was happening, you know what I mean? Before it was almost like there had to be some kind of preparation before we went and did this thing. More like this is about to hit you. Yeah, yeah. Kind of. It's not the same as like the, you know, some people were expecting it, you know what I mean? It was really cool. So to sort of take your story back to the place where like lots of people know you from Manchester and you know this is definitely an era you must have been asked about like millions of times before. What I kind of wanted to know or was interested to know is like you know with the passage of time and this sort of thing. How do you view like... the way that that story has been told like you know you you think about you have your classic stories connected to like manchester hacienda those sorts of things like are you kind of satisfied with the way that that story's been told over the years do you think more people or different people deserve the limelight like how do you sort of view it Well, yeah, there's been loads of different stories and obviously the thing that's the movie kind of sticks with that 24-hour party people, which is... I suppose you've only got a certain amount of time in a movie to explain certain things in a way, you know what I mean? So a lot of things were kind of skipped over. I mean, I was kind of... a little bit disappointed that like um kitchen was like this after hours didn't play more of a part in the in the movie you know i mean because i mean for me that's that was where a lot of stuff kind of happened you know i mean there's a lot of things that you know people that kind of went there and um even before then i mean like the the dance scene in manchester was It was really healthy. I think the thing is with the Hacienda, it kind of brought indie together with dance. But before then, there were so many dance places all around the North really. You could actually go all the way back to Northern Seoul and follow the progression right through to... to the hacienda if you were really going to get deep about dancing in the northwest Yeah, because I guess things like Wigan Casino, like not a million miles away. Miles down the road. And like, you know, I mean, like when I was growing up, the whole thing was about all dayers and all nighters. And like there was DJs like Greg Wilson, Chad Jackson, even Kev Edwards, Ewan Clark. There was a million and one DJs that were going around back then and the dance music kind of went from electro-funk to jazz. to Northern Seoul and all this stuff kind of was like floating around since like I mean I mean I remember it from 83 onwards you know I mean and it was like I could go out every night of the week to a dance club you know in Manchester without going to the Hacienda You know, so, you know, it was, you know, there was a lot of stuff happening. I mean, I suppose you couldn't really put that. I mean, if someone was really going to do like the dance history of the Northwest or something like that, then I suppose it would be Greg Wilson doing something like that because he's like pretty good at that. And again, you know, this is a subject that's like been brought up a million times with you in interviews. And I just really wanted to know what your relationship is like with your most famous track these days. Like, can you still stand to hear it? Do people still ask you to play Voodoo? They ask all the time. Do they? Yeah. I mean, I remember, like, probably, it was probably like... 10 years ago now I did a really horrible thing where I'd got like every mix that I'd ever been like someone asked for it at a gig and I just went okay and I just started playing it like about like half an hour later I was still playing Beauty Ray you know what I mean and like But like when you play it though, well, when I play it, it's like they never want you to stop playing it. You know what I mean? It's like, well, I'm not going to come to a place and play like the first track that I'd kind of. ever done like out forever and ever and ever you know i mean it's like it's not not going to happen like trying to do this from my position yeah exactly it's like you know you have to you know i mean i usually say to them what you know what were you doing like 15 years ago 20 years ago you know i mean well you do the same thing that you was doing and then i'll do that and oh That'd be really cool, you know what I mean? I mean, it's nice, you know, if it's like someone's birthday or something, and it usually is, you know, and you go, oh, you know, I've come all the way here and I wanted to hear this track. And so, I mean, if I'm playing live, you know what I mean, it's a little bit harder, but I can usually do something. But it's like, it does get a bit tiring, but I If you're playing live, you can kind of chop it up a bit more. And I suppose with the new instruments that they have, natives, and all these people, you can actually kind of make on-the-spot kind of remixes. The purists want to hear the original stuff. What a lot of people don't know is that it was actually one of the first digital recordings. I actually recorded it on F1 tape, which is Betamax. So when people go, oh, you know, like that old analogue stuff. Yeah, really? It's digital, mate. No, I mean, with that track in particular. I find it interesting that it did seem to take a while for UK producers to start writing their own house and acid tracks of note. Like, you know, there would seem to be a surprising lack if you sort of dig through the history books around that sort of early days, there seemed to be a surprising lack of like. homegrown house anthems if you like why was that were people just sort of too busy having a good time like dancing to the imported stuff or like what's your theory well originally um i mean the way i see i mean i remember doing stuff with 808 state i was actually showing them what what i was using and i was like kind of so excited that the machines that I was using were the same as the machines that, well, they sounded like the same machines that these people from Chicago and Detroit was using. And so straight away, they wanted to form a band. But like, so I remember we did an interview with... radio station, might have been Manchester Radio and I remember Martin going "oh well you know nobody knows what this acid machine is but like you know we've got it" kind of thing and so basically in the early days they heard the music but like no one actually knew what the instruments were and stuff you know there was like people using like a DX7 trying to make acid sounds and stuff. So obviously, you know, they didn't really know. And I kind of, so I had like a little bit of an upper hand because I kind of just knew exactly what was going on. How? At the time. Basically, I'd followed the whole electronic music from, dance music from, well, from 81, 82. onwards so i mean like when the first time i went into a second hand shop and i heard a roll in 808 i mean i knew it was the same machine that was being played on planet rock and i knew it was like the same machine on loose ends, like I'm hanging on a string. I knew that the AEIOU was like SH-101. I mean, I was basically breaking music down into its, when I was hearing it, into its little bits and pieces before I'd even kind of seen a synth, you know what I mean? So, I mean, because I was, I mean, growing up. I was like crazily into like jazz rock, like Chick Corea and stuff like that. Actually, my favorite band was called Return to Forever, which was Aldi Miola, Chick Corea, Stanley Clark, Lenny White. So I was like banging to all this stuff. And like in them days, there was no internet. So the way you would find out about an artist or what they were doing or whatever, you'd read the back of the record cover. Some of these record covers, they would have the instrumentation, what they were playing. It's like Chick Corea, Mini Moog, Micro Moog. like Art Podicy, da-da-da-da-da. So, you know, and then when I go down to the secondhand shop and I see Art Podicy, oh, my God, Mini Moog, that's what Chick Corea plays, and then you start playing around in it. That's how I kind of learnt about synths or got into synths. So, yeah, then you see the drum machines and you start hearing them. And you go, oh, my God, I've heard that on this track. You know, so that's kind of one of the ways that I learned about these machines. But at the same time, you know, a lot of people, I mean, they weren't really taking note of that. They were more into it. I mean, I was in a kind of hip-hoppy kind of crew. called the Scratchbeat Masters. And I noticed that these guys were more into the tunes than how they were made. I wanted to turn the room that we was DJing in, I wanted to turn it into a studio. And they were pissed off because it was like, no, it's like... So they were more DJs than into the... And I wanted to make the music, you know what I mean? So because I was so interested in all the ingredients more than the actual... thing itself the the actual final process i suppose that's how i got to to know these machines pretty early on oh it's funny you said it took like 30 years almost to like properly warm up to the idea of live performance yeah yeah yeah for sure because um I mean, I was a studio bod. I mean, like, my favourite place was just, like, a studio. I mean, originally, I mean, like, when we did that album with... I did an album, New Build, with 808 State. I mean, I literally pulled my studio apart and set up camp in the... studio down on um tariff street in in manchester i mean for me it was it was it was brilliant it was like downstairs in the basement there was no windows or anything and like you know they had a desk down there it was the first time I'd used a mixing desk or whatever and like you know I kind of got to kind of hone in on what you would do in a proper recording environment and I was like sometimes left in there on my own you know what I mean and there was a studio next door it was actually it was a recording engineering school but like um you could graham had access to it at night so you know we used to get like a lot of lockings in there and like sometimes him and i think martin and that they would go off clubbing And, you know, I'd been left in the studio. So, yeah, I mean, like, kind of since then, really. It was, like, me, the studio, and, like, the soup machine. I mean, is it still your happy place in the world, would you say, the studio? Yeah, definitely, yeah. I mean, are there still things that you really want to achieve, like, in your music? in the studio? Do you still have aspirations you could explain? Yeah, for sure. I mean, the spatial awareness with sound and stuff, but to a level where it kind of spooks you, you know what I mean? I want it to be, I want to be able to move. I mean, it's totally possible. move sounds around in a way so like you feel there's a ghost going through you kind of thing I want to do that I mean it makes sense as a rave experience doesn't it for sure yeah Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you
