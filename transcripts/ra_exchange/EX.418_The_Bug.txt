Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resonant Advisor. Right now we're listening to a track called Dream Forger off the first album by Techno Animal. This is a project by Justin Broderick who did an exchange a few weeks ago and Kevin Martin who we're happy to have as our guest this week. These days Martin is best known as "The Bug" but his early years in London saw him becoming emblematic of the crossover between supposedly disparate cultures like free jazz, metal and sound system music. Martin was one of these figures that showed that these sounds share a common energy. and that understanding is crucial to the direction his music took in later years. We were here mostly to talk about London Zoo, which was the album that cemented his relationship with dance music, but we ended up focusing mainly on the years leading up to that point, to get a sense of the mentality and personality behind the music he makes today. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with the bug is up next. You know, on paper, it's pretty extraordinary. You know, you leave Weymouth as a young man, arrive in London, and within a pretty short period of time, you're working with all these people who are, like, quite significant figures. What was your impression of the... of the city when you first arrived way back when? London was my city of dreams, really, because I grew up next to grass and beach. You know, Weymouth is like a... brightening miniature. I was desperate to get out of there, you know, it's great for my mum and old people but I needed to fulfill my artistic cravings. In my heart and soul I knew that music was what I needed, you know, part therapy, part escape, part parallel universe. And I just knew I couldn't achieve that to the degree I wanted to and needed to in Weymouth. You know, it's a small town, you know, even to go and see shows at that time was difficult because you had to. It was quite an adventure to go to the nearest big cities, which would be Bristol or Bournemouth, I guess, to the north and east. And so for me, London offered dream fulfillment, you know, really it was and it was it was fantasy world for me when I first moved to London, I thought it would be easy. You move to London, you get shows, you know, you play, you know, just totally naive, naive beyond, you know, and The harsh reality hit quick, you know. I realised very soon that I had to pay to play, really. You know, I was in a band. I moved with members of my band from Weymouth and we were practising in a garage in the back of the house that we were renting and having rocks thrown at us by local kids because they hated the noise when we were practising. And it was just, how do you get shows? How does it all work? I went from knowing absolute, I came to London knowing zero, apart from being a complete music fanatic and desperate to express myself through sound, you know, and through my voice at that time, ironically, because subsequently I hate my voice and very happy to have stopped. doing vocals you know but I needed that that primal scream therapy of screaming into a microphone extremely emotionally, you know. And London was, I felt, my passport to freedom, actually. But the reality was it was probably more like a prison, moving to a pleasure prison, you know. And that became more and more apparent the longer I lived there, really. But certainly it was an eye-opener moving to London, you know. It was hard to get shows, nigh on impossible, really. And if you did, you'd be playing when doors open, when there's no one there. You wouldn't get any fees at all. You wouldn't get soundcheck. It was starting very much from scratch. Having learned that it was impossible to get shows with zero contacts, not knowing the city, not knowing any friends who were in the industry. having no possible path to getting what I needed, which was a way of getting shows to express myself or to release music or find how to release or record, because my experience was so limited at recording as well on home studios in Weymouth. Me and the guy I moved up with, who was a mentor of mine, actually, he was a bit older than me, a guy called Nigel Armstrong, had moved to London with a vocal PA that we'd somehow scrambled the money together for a crappy H&H vocal PA. And we were like, well, fuck it. If we can't get shows, let's try and do it ourselves. And I can't remember how I discovered it exactly, but I subsequently found a back room of a pub in Brixton. The pub was called the Canterbury Arms, which I think someone said is demolished now. It's been demolished for a while, I think. But it was ironic because it was right behind Brixton Police Station. And the back room was a carpeted, chandeliered, really old school. pub atmosphere you know it looked like it'd been built in the 50s probably and every Friday night myself and Nigel would put on a show there and I was pretty naive you know I wasn't I didn't expect money from this. All I wanted to do was have it as a rehearsal space. And we were just looking in magazines and papers, or in Godflesh's case, on their record sleeve. There was a phone number for Justin and Benny. And I just called them off pat and said, hey, we've got this club night. Totally naively. I can't guarantee you any money, but you can take all the money that comes in. I'm not going to take a penny. And that was the case, you know. And in fact, I remember when Mickey Harris, I invited Extreme Noise Terror to play and Mickey Harris offering me money back because they'd never been paid so much money. And he couldn't believe that I was just giving them the whole door, you know. I was really idealistic. Having been in shit situations with bands, I thought it was cool to just pay every single penny to the headline artist who had done the show out of good grace and hope that they'd have a good time, you know? So it was... It was bizarre because the club started with very few people. I mean, I gave Godflesh their first ever show, you know, and they played to maybe 30 or 40 people, you know, on a carpeted venue through a vocal sound system. And they were stunning, you know. And I remember we booked Pulp at the time. And this was before Pulp were known. And there was maybe 20 people to that, you know. But it went from the first year of tiresome scrabbling to get anyone in there and not knowing what the hell we were doing in terms of advertising or promotion, really just standing, giving flyers out in the middle of Brixton stupidly, you know, like as if some of these names would mean to anything to hardly anyone walking past. to suddenly being in the right place at the right time, you know, whereby Napalm Death suddenly, Q Magazine, I think it was, sent photographers and journalists to a Napalm Death headline show I put on there. And at this time, this was just before that scene really exploded, you know, and Q did this massive photo spread. And from that point on, everything changed. You know, suddenly it was full. I got bands like Loop to come down and play. It was basically a mixture of noise, noise rock, experimental music, and anarcho-punk music. So the ironic thing and the really funny thing is on the other side of the bar... you'd get all these off-duty coppers having their drinks. And in our side, it'd just be dregs, drug dregs, musical freaks, just losing their shit to the weirdest. most antagonistic fucked up music, you know? So that's how I really got going in London. Sounds like you couldn't make up that context these days, right? It just sounds like something out of a fantasy land if you're like, you know... born 20 years ago in London or something, right? It's a dream for me looking back. It's a mad dream. I mean, music is generally for me. My path through it is still fantasy-based, you know, in a way. And that's the good and the bad thing about it, you know, because you realise when you're in an industry, there's so much pressure and compromise. thrown at you. It can be difficult for many people to keep their fires burning and to keep their passion for what they do. It's very easy to become jaded or give up, as I've known many people to do. But I don't really have any choice. I don't have rich parents. I don't have a highly educated background. I don't have a fire escape. For me, it's music or nothing, you know, and it always has been. So it's been that continuous desperation for expression and fear of not being able to do anything else. Just for the timeline's sake, when did you start doing these events in Brixton? And I'm not being evasive. I'm just shit with dates. So no pathological started in 89? Yeah, it would have been the same time. Because a lot of the contacts I made through the club night ended up on that compilation. So did you have Coiled down there as well? No, no, no, no. I didn't have Coiled there. But I went to meet them. And that was bizarre. I mean, I was a huge Throbbing Gristle fan. So I knew well. bought coil's first album and was a big fan but to go and meet them i was terrified you know because their reputation i mean you know i mean scatology horse rotavator you know some of the titles and i i didn't know what to expect but they were actually sweet as pie and they couldn't believe that I was inviting them on a compilation with Napalm Death, because they loved Napalm Death and they loved thrash metal. And they were like, wow, yeah, amazing. You know, we'd love to be on there. You know, no one ever asks us. We always get asked to be on these boring arty compilations. But yeah, this is totally different. So yeah, count us in. And ironically, later on, I invited them to be on a dub compilation. Which, again, they were over the moon because they said, we love Dubb. We're huge fans of King Tubby and Lee Perry. But, again, we never get – no one makes the connection. You've made a connection that people normally don't see. But Dubb's a massive inspiration on us. So they were great people, man. And it was a joy to be able to work with them. It's interesting you said that see the connections that others are missing. So pathological. Started with this compilation, which we've been talking about with Coil, Godflesh, Napalm Death and stuff like that. But pretty soon afterwards, you're putting out, you know, I just want to pick out a few examples. Like, put out a record by Peter and Casper Brotzman. If anyone listening hasn't heard of these guys, Casper is the son of Peter. He's a guitarist. Peter Brotzman is a... tenor player who basically turned the saxophone into like an assault weapon or something. Although he can play really, really sensitively as well. I reckon you should check out a record called Machine Gun, which basically sums up his approach at the time. But anyway, so this is like really extreme free jazz and you're coming from a, you know, I'm not the best with the genre indicators of like grindcore or whatever you'd call it. Like the name doesn't matter, but I just want to know, like you're doing these sorts of bands at this event. How do you like sidestep into putting out like a Broadsman record? Well, first I'm impressed you know the Brotsmans, because very few people are aware of that area in dance music, that's for sure. So it's amazing that you name-check them. Well, you only have to read WIRE like one time, right? Yeah, I know. Peter Brotsman's like the patron saint of the WIRE, yeah. You know, what you've got to remember is my band, the whole focus of what I was trying to do was to mix noise rock and free jazz, you know, because my first instrument that I'd learned was a saxophone, you know. So for me... that's not such a leap of difference. You know, free jazz has the same energy for me that punk music did or dancehall does or hip-hop did when it first started. You know, it's a music of resistance. It's a music that questions what music actually is structurally. a gale force wind of invention, you know, and as far as I'm concerned, all the musics that mean most to me are musics that are sort of revolutionary in a way and have a context. and have this fire music ingredient, you know? And working with Peter and Casper was a dream come true. When I approached them, they weren't talking to each other. They hadn't talked for years, actually, and they hadn't got on. I'm not sure what the history of that was, but they were quite surprised that anyone had suggested it. But for me, it made absolute sense. I was a fan of both separately. Caspar Brotzmann, for anyone not versed in what he did, he played music like he's a virtuoso guitarist, but his main inspiration is Jimi Hendrix. And I've got to say, I hated Jimi Hendrix and guitars generally for years because my mum used to torture me by playing the worst rock music continuously through speakers piped to every room of our house, you know. So guitar music was the enemy for many, many years, you know, which actually explains a lot about my back catalogue anyway, I think. But... I ended up loving Caspar Brotsman's sound because he stripped the blues away. He got rid of the solos. He reduced Hendrix just to slabs of metallic riff, you know. And I don't mean metallic like heavy metal. I just mean it sounds like... the material, it just sounds like this huge chunk of nastiness, you know, and Peter Brotzmann, as you referred to with Machine Gun, that's just war music to me, you know, that's just basically, like you said, it's a full-on, full-frontal attack on the senses, you know, and it's soul music of the most intense kind, you know, and I think that... being able to bring them together again was another dream come true. You know, I'm a dreamer. Like some people may listen to my music and think that it's like aggressive or anti. My music is absolutely linked to my idealism, you know, and my passion for sound and music as being something that makes a difference. Music changed my life. It's not very... fashionable to talk in those terms now because so much music is just an accessory to people's lifestyles or music is just now product you know for me it it was a a passport to um question everything and to understand everything a lot of my knowledge was gained through music interviews you know i would get turned on to incredible literature through interviews with Genesis Peorage or Nick Cave, you know. I dropped out of college very soon when I discovered drugs and girls, you know. And for me, it was like formal education never grabbed me. You know, it never inspired me. It's a pity that the best tutors I ever had were at the college I dropped out from, you know, because... There was a couple of tutors I was studying sociology and philosophy. And those tutors were the most amazing tutors I'd ever come across because they actually nourished me. But that was coming through reading music press. My lifeline. from Weymouth, which was a wilderness to grow up in, was John Peel's radio shows on one hand, and Bieber Kopf writing for The Wire on the other hand, or various journalists writing for NME or Melody Maker, who were introducing me to worlds that... spoke to me, you know, growing up in a troubled family background, growing up in a town, which I have to say, Weymouth is the most violent place I've ever experienced. You know, London, of course, when violence happens in London, it's deadly and sporadic. In Weymouth, there was violence all the time because it was a small town surrounded by an army base, a navy base. and an Air Force base. And these lunatics would come in every weekend and most nights, realize when they were drunk, there wasn't enough women in town. So what do they do? They take the violence out on local freaky looking people like me and just, I got mashed up, you know, beaten up a few times, thrown through a window by these psychopaths, you know? So for me, it's like, I needed some ways to explain the craziness of the world, you know, and seeing my father abuse me and my mum on a regular basis physically, it was just like none of it made sense to me. And somehow reading about other people's traumas and needs to make music to offer an escape from brutal reality. is what led me to investigate a lot of the genres and areas I investigated. The writing, music connection one is perhaps a... jumping off point for you also did a Lydia lunch record which is it I haven't been able to hear it online but it's it's unlisted as spoken word on on discogs is it just like it's her doing a spoken word performance called conspiracy of women cow Yeah, the cover art's really good on that one as well. Yeah. Oh, on the version, I think it was reissued. You may have seen the reissue. No, no, no, the original one with the black and it says cow. Yeah, that's right. Oh, you like that. Okay, cool, cool. The reissue one's just like... Okay, I just thought some people may prefer the reissue, yeah. Okay, no, no, that's interesting that you Look, for instance, OK, I met the editor, now editor of The Wire, I think he's the editor, Chris Bond, Bieber Cops, by literally knocking on his front door about eight o'clock at night, holding a record, the pathological compilation, and just saying, look, I've been a big fan of your writing. something you might like that I've put on my label. And he crazily, very kindly welcomed me into his house to talk. And the same with John Peel, literally waiting outside the BBC until he arrived, thinking he must arrive for his radio show and handing him a record, and he played it the same night. Like I said, it's naivety and fantasy combined. And I don't mean Dungeons & Dragons fantasy. I mean it's a dream, making dreams real. You know, Coyle were believers in sort of Crowleyan. philosophy of willpower and how to fulfill your dream fantasies. I believe in it too, you know. I'm no fucking hippie, but I believe that it's important to focus your energies on what it is you require in life and how you can exist in life, you know, and what it is that can make this life bearable, you know. You're going on so many tangents. I was about to bring up... Bring up England sit in reverse and talk about all that shit and stuff. There was only one more little thing that I wanted to pick out from this period, which was I saw on the liner notes for one of the early God records that Eddie Prevost was credited for percussion. Yeah, Eddie Prevost from AMM. Sorry, I've pronounced two legendary people's names incorrectly so far in this interview. Eddie wouldn't give a fuck. Yeah, Eddie Prevo. Basically, God had two phases. It had its early phase, which is my apprenticeship in London, which only the bass player I invited to the next phase. Nigel, who I told you I moved to London with, it proved too much for him, London. He ended up moving back to Dorset, I believe, because it was a struggle. Also, the other members of my original that had moved to London with me moved back even sooner. We would generally support bands like the Butthole Surfers or Killdozer and be a token. London noise band to open up for the latest American thing that would fly in and get hyped up. And it was cool, but I think the sound we were playing at that time was too derivative of that music. And I knew it wasn't going further enough. It wasn't incorporating enough of the influences that I felt I wanted to. And it wasn't giving me enough freedom of movement sonically and thematically or conceptually. And I just wanted to work with more players that were involved in jazz and improvised music because I felt that songs already were feeling... the song structures were feeling as if they were... There's a constraint of song structure whereby at that time I wasn't interested in song structure. That was one of the things that me and Justin bonded on when we used to hang out very early on. we were both looking for avenues that were anti-song, you know, and that may sound a bit artsy or, or bullshitty to people, but all it means is. what's possible that isn't, you haven't heard before. Why revolve around making music that follows conservative structural patterns? What else is out there? So it would lead me into this, into wire world, actually. The wire was this tome of knowledge for me, you know? So I would discover contemporary classical composers. I would... discover soundtrack composers, I would discover global music forms, anything that made my jaw hit the floor, you know, and think, wow, sonically, what the hell is this about, you know, was for me a very high goal, you know. So I'd seen AMM, Eddie Prevo's band. play shows in and around London and been completely blown away. I mean, for anyone that doesn't know AMM, they started, I think, at the same time as Pink Floyd. He told me that they used to support Pink Floyd at the Roundhouse and stuff. but their music is nearly silent and it has peaks and troughs and you question what music is after being to one of their shows, you know. It turns all your regular understandings of music upside down because it's impressionistic more than in your face. And Eddie, again, like everything else we've discussed thus far... I just really walked up to him and said, look, I'd love to involve you in this project I'm doing. Would you like to be involved? And I'm still shocked to this day he agreed to do it because honestly, man, we were loud, you know, and they generally weren't, you know. And I think he appreciated, I know he did because he told me and I ended up inviting him to work with Pete Kemba in Sonic Boom in EAR. And he joined us there too, you know. He's an incredible guy, you know. He's an incredible musician, theorist. and open-minded that's the most important thing for me with most people i work with you know We talked earlier about Justin Broderick, for instance. What Justin and I share is this huge appetite and thirst for the future in music and how to use music to explore your own personality and just how you can express ideas that haven't been expressed elsewhere. You know, freshness through sound, you know, in a way, I guess. And Eddie Prevo still has that. And like I said, he was playing music in the late 60s. And for him to come into this racket of noise and bass, I mean, again, for those people that don't know my first band, God. there was that second phase where it was really about free jazz and noise rock and a fusion of the two. There was three bass players. There was two electric bass players and one double bass player that I'd invited into the band and two drummers and then Eddie Prevo on percussion. You know, it ended up... The last show we did, I think there was something like 13 people on stage. There was African percussionists from Ghana as well. So for me, the bass thing isn't a new thing. It's not like I have to laugh at people talking about bass music as if that's a revelation generally, you know, as if that's a philosophy in itself. Yeah, I'm addicted to bass. Yeah, I'm addicted to volume. I was doing that before it became a supposed genre, bass music, whatever the fuck that is. You know, it's about the physicality of sound. You know, again, being tangential, moving from Eddie Prevo to sound system, sound clashes. When I first moved to London, within the first six months, I saw my first sound clash. reggae sound clash between iration steppers and the disciples and that really had massive impact on me you know it had reminded me of a swan show i'd seen by chance before i'd moved to london when i just came to london on a holiday i I happened to see Swans play the ICA knowing nothing about them before, just going on a timeout review that made it sound interesting, you know, and being completely floored by the sheer visceral avalanche of sound and space, you know, between the notes. And when I went to the Sound Clash in a tiny warehouse in the East End of London... I didn't know what to expect. You know, I'd heard the expression Sound Clash. Yeah, I'm there. You know, Sound Clash sounds amazing. You know, war of reggae sound systems sounds brilliant, you know. So I went there and it literally was that. It's a tiny room, two sound systems on either side of the room, audience trapped in the middle. These guys at war with each other sonically playing three versions of each song back and forth, back and forth. louder and louder each version of each song getting more and more psychedelic and tripped out so the third version was always the mental version you know and just having a light bulb above each other's mixing desk and just like for me it's just like what the hell you know it's just The feeling of bass, I could feel my larynx being squashed at the back of my head. My ears were flapping, but I knew I needed it again. I knew it wasn't particularly healthy or it wasn't advisable. But what it had that Swans didn't have, I guess, was a use of... song structure and melody, albeit mashed up and getting more mashed with each subsequent song. So it had elements of things that the Swans' physical experience didn't really. So I don't know how we got from Eddie Prevost to there. But that's the whole point, right? So these things aren't as far away as they might seem. Yeah, exactly. AMM could also get pretty loud, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think Oren M. Barchi's label Black Truffle just put out, maybe last year reissued AMM Music, I think it's called. Okay. Yeah, it was an amazing album. Another recommendation. That was the first thing I ever heard. Yeah, Insanity. You mentioned Justin there, obviously like a really key figure. We were talking before about he did it in exchange recently as well. And when I was personally listening to it and stuff like that, his passion was very touching or something like that. biography's sake wonder if he had that impression when when you first met him he's never changed he's he's the same now as he was then he's still gushes enthusiasm and again he's another person that people might expect to be mean and moody you know he's not that at all he's he's just a a ball of enthusiasm you know and we share that you know for me he's like a brother he's like my little brother really but he was teaching me so much, you know, like, all I had when I started making music was a saxophone and some effects pedals, you know, he threw deals with with Columbia when they licensed ear eight releases for the States had some studio, you know, he had a mixing desk and he had a sampler and, and stuff like that, you know, and I'd had small home studio setups in Weymouth. But in London, I had nothing. So my sampler was a CD player with A to B starting points. So I would have all these CDs, because I was working as a journalist at the time too. So I'd be getting sent a lot of music and I'd just sample the shit out of it, you know, but tiny segments, like two second segments and loop it up on the CD player and then have to write down the loop points. and bring the CDs to Justin to sample up, which became the first Techno Animal album. You know and just sitting behind him being a gobshite and watching what he was doing inspired me To know that I really wanted to work more and more with studio stuff. I've been invited by some Swiss jazz guy Who was in an incredible band called 1617 who When I formed God, I was ignorant enough to think we were the only people that had ever thought of mixing free jazz and noise rock, you know. Then someone said, have you heard 1617? Who it turned out had been doing it five, ten years before, you know. And it's incredible what they were doing. And as chance has it, I invited a Swiss piano player to play on the first God album. And he then invited me to produce his album because he felt what I'd done was impressive. When I was bluffing it, you know, to be honest, that first God album, John Zorn did the primary production on it. And we were doing it at Bill Laswell's studio and Laswell had incredible engineers. So all I was doing was sitting at the back saying change levels, you know, because I was still learning what a studio was really and what it was capable of, you know, and then. This piano player, Peter, Peter Crow, I think his name was, invited me to produce his band album. And I just remember like, A, I was broke. B, I'd never produced properly anything in my life. I just been, like I say, someone at the back of the room saying, can you turn the level of this up a bit or turn that down a bit? Send the odd statement. so I had to bluff it and I wasn't going to give up the opportunity it was like okay I'm going to try this shit and I remember literally going to engineers that I'd worked with before going to Switzerland to produce this album and asking their advice and taking notes of what the most important things like a crash course in studio production you know And this guy, Alex, was playing saxophone from 1617, Alex Boos, on this Swiss band's album. So I got to meet Alex and we got on super well. And again, he seemed to like whatever it was I was doing for that album. And he then invited me to produce his album, you know, which was like an honour because I was blown away by him as a musician and the sound of his band. And then it was just working at his studio particularly and having worked at Justin's studio that I just knew I needed to be... There's an alchemical process for me of working with sound in a studio, you know. It's part spaceship, part science experiment, part drug replacement. It's just... The potential for what you can do with sound in a studio is limitless. And for me, I just fell in love with the studio as an environment and the gear therein and how you can turn songs and music upside down, inside out, back to front, stretch it, squeeze it, et cetera, mutate it into any form that your imagination will allow, you know. So for me, it was working with people like Justin, working with Alex. I just knew I had to work more in a studio. And that's ultimately around the time I fell out of love with working with a band, you know. Half the time, people in the band wouldn't be that committed. A lot of the jazz players were so great at what they were doing, technically, they didn't really give a fuck about the aesthetic. It was just another gig for them. And for sure, there was amazing players in God, which I still think were incredible to work with. But at the same time, I just fell out of love with being in a band. The last show, by God, when I finally decided to jack it, I've talked about it before, but it was at the Garage in London. And I'd invited Graham Sutton. I don't know if you know him, but he was part of Bach's Psychosis. And then I think it was under the name Boimerang. He recorded for Metalheads. He ended up doing Jungle for Metalheads. So he went from indie rock to recording for Goldie and made it seem easy. And he and I were good friends at that time. And he was experimenting with Jungle, you know, in the same way that Kevin Shields from My Bloody Valentine was. the first person that introduced me to jungle, ironically. It sounds crazy because the industry and media are so keen to compartmentalize and box every genre up separately. But it's quite natural when you live in London. You know, that's one of the things I miss about London in Berlin is that things morph and you float between scenes, really, you know. the influence of counter genres are there all the time. So basically I invited Graham to put his proto jungle act together. And I invited the disciples to bring their sound system, their reggae sound system. and with my band in the middle. And actually, what happened, God, in the middle, and what happened was, A, there was loads of complaints at the soundcheck from Neighbours at volume. B, amps were blowing up for my band at the soundcheck. Then... Graham Sutton's band played and fans of God were throwing bottles at them because they were too dancey, I guess. And then after we played, most of the audience left, virtually the whole audience left before Disciples even started playing tunes or within the first two tunes they played. So it was basically me and half of my band, God, just getting lost in their reggae sound system. But at the end, I just felt totally depressed and demoralized about the whole event. It's like... It was a lot of questions. I'd already thought, well, the disciples are doing everything, and Iration Steppers were doing everything I wanted to do with sound, and more, actually, without compromise. And they were stretching sound in ways that I wanted to do with a band, but I felt that there was constraints within a band. And I don't mean personally, I mean literally sonically, you know. So for me, after that, it was like, fuck being in a band, you know. And I say in a band like a gigging normal band. Obviously, it was around the same period where Justin and I were starting to work more with Techno Animal. which is a band or was a band and has now been reborn as Zonal but in a way it was like hanging out with your best mate and just loving making fucking with sound basically and seeing how far we could push and pull sound and test speakers I wanted to pick out one track actually from that first Techno Animal record you know you said it yourself however many minutes ago but that you know your music's not all about like aggression and bass weight and all that stuff like that The track's called, what is it? Dream Forger. Dream Forger. I knew you were going to say that. Fucking amazing, man. I got to get the CD or the record or whatever format it's on because there's no band camp for this pathological stuff, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I wanted to use that example as a question of like, you sort of answered it before with taking samples of CDs to Justin and stuff like that. But yeah, so basically it's like there's a sax line, it repeats, there's some delay on it, a complimentary sax line comes in and just builds in this really like honestly beautiful piece. I'm just wondering whether you're putting this stuff together in kind of like a performative like take, almost like an electronic version of a band or is this more very like... Because early samplers must have been a total ball to work with. Was it this kind of laborious stitching things together or did you have a workflow where it was more performative? No, it wasn't about performance because at that time with that album in particular, we weren't even thinking about performing. Again, it was just how we can fuck with effects. and falling in love with Eventide effects units, H3000s. We just wanted to make hallucinatory, psychedelic sound, you know, or supremely brutal sound. we wanted the two extremes. Still to this day, the music that bores me is all the middle mass, middle of the road shit. What I love is music that has either great beauty or great intensity and dirt on the other side. And with that track in particular... I can remember where the sample came from, but I'm not going to say where it came from. Well, I assume it might have been you on saxophone. No, a lot of people did, and I very ungenerously didn't admit it wasn't. It wasn't me playing sax. I wish it was, you know. But... That track, for me, what's interesting about it is when I heard William Baszynski, it echoed exactly what we had been trying to do, which is, and I've been thinking about it a lot because I'm working on some music at the moment for collaboration with a person from a very different area. which is in that style, you know. And it's like dream cycles when you're listening to that. It's like, like I said, it's like audio hallucinations when you hear what the effects add to it. to the original source material. It almost gets to the point where the original source material loses a lot of the significance and what you drift to is the effects chain of wall of mirrored delays and echoes and... the sensory magic of reverbs, you know. So for me and for Justin, with that track, it's very much about being hypnotized by sound, you know, and that's what we were attempting, really. A lot, like the irony is, I can't remember if Justin talked about this in his interview, but... We came to this, we would come to know if something worked because he would smoke a lot of weed and drink a lot and I never touched drugs and haven't done for many, many years and I'd already given up at that point, drugs or drink. you know so we knew if it both hit us in the same way it hit the mark you know and basically it was to have that the irony is one of my reasons for giving up drugs and drink was because I felt there must be other ways to get the same shit that wasn't damaging me as much you know And the best music hits me like the best drugs, you know, and still does. It has that symbiotic impact, you know. And for me, that's what that track does. It's funny. Somehow I knew you were going to say that track because there's a sort of magic in it that is very much down to the guy that played the original line, of course. But we just try to amplify his magic. And you kind of referred to this when you were talking about Earache getting a Columbia publishing deal. So the second Techno Animal album re-entry was on Virgin, which is unusual in hindsight considering it's a double CD record where all the tracks are mostly between 10 and 20 minutes. It's like post-rave psychosis dub. It just seems crazy that major labels would be getting behind something like this. Can you just talk about like the- That was a total freak. There was a guy, Godrup. released our album Possession through a Virgin subsidiary. And the guy that was the assistant of the guy that ran that label Venture, Simon Hopkins, ended up getting a job at Catalogue, I think they call it, at labels. And he was putting together compilations. I think he did one for David Toop first before ours. And he was just a fan. He would come to God shows and wax lyrical, but he was like an encyclopedia of knowledge. And Simon was like really deeply into the most eclectic musics possible, you know. And I just... winged it again. I was just desperate for money. I couldn't pay my rent at the time. Same reason I started journalism. My girlfriend at that time was paying the bills and I had no money. And I just winged it then. I said to Chris Bond at the time for The Wire, look, I've never written in my life, but I'd like to do an interview with Godflesh for The Wire. And at the time, you've got to remember, The Wire wasn't what it is now. It was strictly classical and jazz with the very odd freaky column by Chris, you know. And it was the same motivation, you know, that when I approached Virgin about doing Techno Animal. we just knew there was money to get from them. We knew they were giving money to Paul Schutz and to David Toope, and I knew it was via Simon, so I just tapped Simon and said, look, man, this is the techno-animal stuff we've done before. This is what we're planning. We want to invite John Hassel to play trumpet on it. which we did, and we want it to have two sides. We want one disc to be beat-orientated, because me and Justin at that time had become really enamoured by Jeff Mills' early shows in Britain or the very first Plastic Man shows we'd seen. I wasn't a raver, I was the opposite. I didn't like rave. I just thought they were fucking hippies, like a new phase of hippie, you know. But some of the craziness of those shows, like seeing Jeff Mills play sets at maybe four, generally four or five in the morning to roomfuls of people mashed up on drugs. And I wasn't. But hearing how fucked up his music was and how intense and how... polyrhythmic it was and just how combative it was and crazy was mind-blowing to me you know um i wasn't a techno head either generally uh justin was the guy that was more into techno than me but underground resistance jeff mills the first plastic man stuff uh rung rung clear with me, you know, it felt like it was all done for the right reason. It felt like science fiction and rawness and a sort of punk energy again, really, and mentality, you know, and just a thirst for experimentation and finding a future vocabulary for sound. You know, so when we went to Virgin, it was like, look, we want to do something that's inspired by crazy acidic machines. And on the other side, we want to do a disc that's just imaginary soundtracks, you know. we'd always been in love with a lot of soundtrack music. And for us, it was like we knew that the chances were minimal of us ever getting there. Things, again, have changed quite a lot now. It's much more possible now. But at that time, we knew it would be virtually impossible for us to do them. So we were like, fuck it. If we can't get them, we'll do it ourselves. It's that DIY ethic that, again, has followed me through time. When I got into music, it was through post-punk music and labels like the Crass label or Throbbing Gristles label, you know. It was do it yourself because no other fucker's going to do it for you, you know. And it's like in order to do things with other people, there's compromise involved. Why do you want to make compromise, particularly for your art, you know. Try it yourself, see what's possible. People can only say no, you know, bang on the door and see what happens. And that's what I did with Virgin and that's how the Technonium album happened on Virgin. Just one more Justin relevant question. You did a drum and bass record together as White Viper. Oh shit, you did do your research there. Oh, I know you did. Okay. Man, Discogs, just the best thing ever. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, he said in his exchange that he was really into drum and bass, but he got sick of it because DJs were basically like the gatekeepers where like something wouldn't get put out if it wasn't like mixed down in a way that the DJ wanted it. has to be able to stand up next to whatever he's mixing out of or whatever. And I was just wondering whether, were you into drum and bass at the time or was this kind of like you were just working with Justin and... Oh, no, no. No, look, generally most genres, I feel there's not, like, it's true of virtually every genre actually. I find it hard with trance. Virtually every other genre. Man, there's some good trance. I know. With breaks in it? Yeah, I know. People tell me that. People tell me that. 95% of every genre is shit. And there's 5% hardcore that's wicked in every genre. Some genres I prefer to others. So I'll investigate every genre. And for me, drum and bass, I mean, fuck, of course I was going to like it, you know, because there's levels and layers of everything, particularly on the first waves of Jungle, you know, because you just never heard anything like it. Like I told you, Kevin Shields was the first person to really play me. jungle, you know, and I... And I was blown away, you know, because it didn't sound like anything I'd ever heard before. And a lot of the music that I cherish most, quite often, has been music that when I first heard it, I just didn't have a fucking clue what I was listening to. And just, it disorientated me to the max, you know. And that was the joy in it. It's like discovering a whole new world. And I think that Jungle, as was, definitely got me interested and I knew that there was a lot of influences of things that I loved in there, whether it be dub, whether it be hip-hop. But I cherish Dillinger. For me, he was the dude that really made me turn around and go, whoa. I remember me and Justin watching the Metalheads documentary where Dillinger's in the studio working on a hat. The crazy way he made his tracks. And we were like, wow. You know, and at the same, just after that, unusually, normally the second wave or the second generation of every genre starts to lose its shit. But both Justin and I became really enamored by Bad Company's first releases or Ram Trilogy's early shit or Fotex stuff. Well, Fotech had been earlier, but we liked the sort of riff stuff, this heavy riff stuff that came through. And we were big, big fans of Fotech's, I think it was called Special Forces, was it? He had that one-off label. It was a huge influence on us because it actually was like Basic Channel. done to Jungle and drum and bass where the surface noise was as important as the musical components on there and there was hardly anything on it was minimal It's moody as hell and it was I believe it was if I remember rightly and it's a long time ago for me to remember But it was I believe it was photek and digital together doing this stuff. I think it was special forces under the name I'll look it up and I made it you yeah, yeah But it was hugely influential on me and Justin, you know, that sound and those records at that time. So, yeah, no, I was definitely, he was more into it. And what Justin does often, like he's doing it right now with techno, he wants to be able to make note perfect. genre specific music you know like he'd done it with metal he did it with uh techno he did it with drum and bass i'm not that you know i like shit that just sounds mutant you know and i away from a genre you know in a way I'm trying to create my own world through sound whereas Justin is a craftsman a higher form of craftsman than me even because he can basically take genre and then fuck with it he can recreate a genre note by note skillfully and then move away from it I just don't even bother with that first part I just move away But drum and bass, going back to your original question, drum and bass and jungle was a huge influence. Seeing DJ Hype shows very early on, just as he started, Ganja was a big thing for me. Simon Reynolds invited me to shows. I was a big friend of Kojo Eshin, and we used to go to jungle raves. So for me, of course, it was inconceivable that you wouldn't... feel the impact of Jungle in London because it was blasting from everywhere, from car stereos, pirate radio stations, in the end, boutiques. And actually, suddenly, what killed it off for me a little bit... It was oversaturation. You couldn't get away from jungle, you know, and it just lost its initial impact, you know. And generally I'm drawn to more slower, more intense shit, you know. And when Fotech, not Fotech, when Bookham came through, and that happens a lot with dance music for me, where you get suddenly the term intelligent gets bandied around. And it's like kiss of death for me for any genre, you know. It happens with ambient music, with techno, with jungle. And then I'm just like, I'm out of here, you know. And it's not because I'm a thug or idiot. It's just it becomes the intelligence that music is judged by is actually cliched for me. It's like when... Very often when dance music incorporates jazz as well, it's a really superficial incorporation of jazz or intelligence that actually seems dumb to me on both sides. So I'm just out of there. We're inching forward through time here. Sorry, man. No, no, no. in your arse off sorry no it's definitely don't ever hesitate just to say shut up and just move on but it's like now I'm kind of like throwing in a tangent okay yeah do it turn into wicked because you did graphic design I mean the extent of which I know is as the pathological puppy yeah that was me and it's kind of like pre-internet collage based kind of like post rave steve stapleton or something like that i'd never even thought of in terms like that what it was was buggy g rip head who did all the graphics for uh future sound of london i was just wondering like um where because would you have to source all these images yourself yeah and i got i got taken to court for it with the second God album because I sourced images from a basement of a medical department in an obscure London bookstore and I found these pictures of anatomical malformations and I ended up putting it on the front sleeve, scanning it And I thought at the time that the law was if you change it, negatise it. morph it in a strange way suddenly the copyright reverts but I found out to my pain that that's not the case and we got fined I got taken it was an out of court settlement that Big Cat my label at the time had to go through but yeah basically I was looking for images everywhere you know and like you said it was pre-internet so I'd be like rummaging around in obscure bookstores and flea markets looking for strange images to incorporate. But like I said, Buggy from Future Sound of London. I didn't have a computer. All the artwork for the first Techno Animal album, for the re-entry, was done over his shoulder in the same way I was over Justin's shoulder. He taught me everything I knew about Photoshop. And he was totally into that acidic, crazy collage, post-rave collage. And his whole visual style was very symbolic at the time. But I wanted to stay away from that. I'd always been a huge fan of movies and art anyway. Again, learning mostly through music people, one film director leading to another, old sci-fi, and same with art, just living in London, going to galleries all the time. Like I said, London was my passport to artistic. freedom like whether it be going to the what was the scholar at the time when it was a cinema and you'd get like the craziest all-night Pasolini movie events or David Cronenberg events, which I would never have been able to see in Weymouth. All this sounds so dinosaur now because of the age of the internet, but at the time it was a big deal to be able to go and see Cronenberg films all night in a cinema, you know. Where can you do that now, actually? At home, again. That's it. Everything's just separate. We're all living in these pleasure prisons now, isolated, and so be it. All right. The bug kicks off at the tail end of the 90s. And you can kind of see it's not necessarily a huge departure with what you've done before, but kind of like there's this new magic ingredient, which is the dancehall raga influence. And again, similar sort of question. I'm just wondering where that... germ cell came from like where were you first exposed to it and thought like i'm going to incorporate this into what i do okay man honestly i do feel bad because you're realizing how tangential i am actually it wasn't the first bug the first bug thing i actually did was well i know the soundtrack yeah exactly there was another interview where you said like oh i don't really have an anomaly exactly you're right you're right and i do feel it's an anomaly but Yeah, dance all itself and the impact it had on me and why I wanted to go for it. I'd started as a reggae snob. You know, I never liked dance. Hall, to be honest. Like I said to you earlier, a lot of music I end up cherishing is stuff when I first hear it, I just don't know what it is, or it just presses the wrong buttons, and suddenly I get more and more obsessed and compelled to investigate, you know. I was living in northwest London, you know, so my local hoods were Stonebridge Park, Harlesden, Wembley, Wilsdon, you know, and... reggae central you know just like wall-to-wall reggae stores in harleston you know and i was basically token white kid going into the shops being looked at like a complete freak waiting for the latest batch of seven inches to come in from jamaica and just standing there asking them to play seven inch after seven inch for me um and just getting my education in record stores in in halsden and in um uh in wembley you know and for me i'd been involved in and around the breakcore scene And DJ Scud, who you probably wouldn't know, I guess, who was a sort of alumni of Digital Hardcore and Alec Empire. You had a record on Digital Hardcore recordings, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But Scud had recorded this breakcore track called Total Destruction. And it was basically noise with a dance hall acapella. And I kept saying to him, because we were good friends at the time, man, you should just work with Jamaican MCs and do the shit live. It'd be destructive. It'd be insane. And he kept making excuses why not to do it. And the more I said it to him and the more he blanked it and blocked it, the more I just thought. Actually, what the fuck? If he's not going to do it, I'll do it, you know? And it was a rhythm called Street Sweeper by Steely and Cleavey that really hooked me on dancehall, that rhythm particularly, because it's odd as hell. It's militaristic. Some of the vocals that were put down on it were incredible. That was the rhythm that got me into dancehall, particularly and primarily. But there was still a lot of elements in Dancehall I wasn't relating to, whether it be the melodic elements or sampled components I just would never have done. So my thing was, okay, I don't want to copy Jamaican music. I don't want to copy Dancehall. But I can see that there's a real future shock impact in Dancehall because it just sounds alien. It sounds like from a different planet, you know. The same way when I first heard reggae at a very impressionable age of about 14, I'd heard Bob Marley, of course, you know, but I heard a Prince Farai track called Foggy Road, which was literally like... coming from another planet in some other universe for me because I didn't know anything about the reference points, you know, but it was like intense, you know, the voice of Far Eye was intense and it was the same with a lot of dancehall. It was like, fuck, man, what is this shit about? But realising that I wanted to do it on my, through my roots, you know, so yeah, overdriven. dirty disgusting and i wanted to end parties you know i wanted to the the the razor x tracks i wanted to really literally be the the the tunes that would blow up your system and just fuck off the people you know and and and that was my my original original stamp that i wanted for the razor x stuff you know i think i i called it killing sound or something I wanted it to be brutal as hell, you know. But at the same time, with the first Bug album, Pressure, there was the working with Roger Robinson for half the album, which is the tracks that never really get spoken about. He and I still laugh about that because the ones that do get spoken about are the dancehall tracks, not the poetry tracks, you know. So there was a schism on that album anyway. But the tracks that... that I think were most successful and not, I don't mean successful in terms of reception. I just mean for me artistically with this, this, this new, this new vocabulary for dancehall, which is just basically absolute brutal, intense, but still swinging like crazy. You know, I remember the first time I played bug tracks live. It was just by coincidence at the end of a Techno Animal show, one of the last Techno Animal shows we ever did, we had some spare time. And I said, hey, Joss, do you mind if I just chuck these on to see how they sound over a rig? And straight away you saw all the dudes sort of start in black, start to sort of disappear. And their girlfriends moved forward. And there was like three women jumping up on stage in front of our mixer, dancing their asses off. And we're just like, wow, what the fuck is going on here, man? It's like, this is unusual because you've got to remember, Godflesh, Techno Animal. Part of the reason we jacked Techno Animal in the end was it just seemed so predictable and boring, the audience, you know, white male dressed in black, wanting just to have their ears like mashed. And for me, it was a revelation just seeing instantly on that night the reaction to the few tunes I dropped. And there is something about dancehall rhythms. that connects to women's hips. You know, I did the swing and the syncopation. It was just a case of, wow, okay. So with Techno Animal 2, for us, it was a sort of revelation when we first toured with Techno Animal with 4SYNC. We toured, I think Justin talked about it. I heard him talk about it. It was like, what the fuck, man? It's like we're playing through these massive rigs with... huge bass spins this is like our dream come true because our tracks were all about bass but we were having to play in shitty venues with shitty rock rigs you know and this was like impact you know and also just to see people dance their asses off to the shit you know it was like this is part of what we wanted you know it's not about limiting anything like in terms with techno animal and the bug I've never been interested in limiting my audience in terms of demographic or in terms of reaction. I want as many people as possible to hear the bug. And we felt the same way about Techno Animal. You know, it was never meant to be ghettoized. It's interesting what you said about Scud. Was that his name? Because I was going to ask, like, with pressure, I was like, it's maybe hard for an artist to say this about their own stuff, but were you kind of looking around and being like, oh, I think I'm kind of doing something which is, like, out in my own little area? Or did you feel like that, I mean, you've basically answered this question with the Scud thing, but it seems like even in hindsight, and It definitely has that, feels like it's standing out on its own somewhere. I just wonder whether you had that perception as it was happening or anything like that, or if you felt that yourself at all. Yeah, I mean, for sure. I think generally that always seems to be my chosen path. It's a lonely path, you know, in one way. But it's the only one I feel comfortable going down, you know, that I want to make music that I haven't heard elsewhere. That's actually a big criterion. It was a big criterion working with Techno Animal. Whenever we worked on something and it sounded like something else. or reminded us too much of someone else, we'd drop it and restart, you know? I think with the bug stuff... In particular, there was a track called Killer. And, you know, tip of the hat to the Roots man who linked me with a lot of the vocalists. He gave me the acapellas for a lot of the early Razor X stuff to rework. And he linked me up with Daddy Freddy in the first place, you know. And he was very crucial. He came from punk, but he made reggae and he was based in Yorkshire, you know. He made proper reggae, you know. And he, but he empathized, he knew I was trying to do something different and he knew it had that, that sort of post-punk meltdown effect, you know, and... It was quite funny with the bug. You know, I started the bug partly out of fear because I knew Justin was too busy with Godflesh and I had to do something on my own. You know, I couldn't keep waiting around for him. And I'd fallen in love with sound system culture and I'd inherited a sound system through basically jacking it from a major label, you know. I found a way to get them to pay for a sound system and walk from the deal with a sound system. And then I was like, what music can I make? All the music I'd made before then was very mid-range orientated. What music can I make that's going to sound good on a rig that's singular and me and no one else? And I want to do something that no one else has done. Going back to the first God album, there was a track on there called Soul Fire, which was inspired by Lee Perry. Going back to the Ice records we made, which were very inspired by Pill. A lot of the post-punk artists like Killing Joke. Public Image Limited, Joy Division even, they were all big reggae fans and the bass was the lead instrument, you know. So for me, with a lot of bass music and dance, of course there was bass-driven tracks, but it never had enough intensity for me, you know. It always felt too formulaic. So for me, with the... a bug it was like how do you invent your own formulas you know how do you how do you find a direction that no one's followed before and you know it's going to be difficult because of course you know the easy route is to follow the herd if you're the i remember there's a verna herzog movie with about suicidal penguins or something where the whole herd goes one way and this crazy penguin walks on itself on the other way and verna herzog is like Well, that penguin was never seen again, you know. That's why you should stick to the herd, you know. But actually, the idea of finding your own path is always going to be thankless in a lot of ways. But weirdly, with the bug stuff, when I started, a lot of people I never expected suddenly were gravitating towards it. I mean, AFEX signed me, you know. It's like, that was like, what the fuck, man? I was meant to release the first Bug Stuff on a different label, Anne-Marie Shields, Kevin Shields' sister's label. And she was trying to learn her trade through Warner Brothers, like I had, basically winging it. And suddenly I get an invite from Richard's business partner, Grant, saying, look, Apex loves your, he's heard your first single, which was with Daddy Freddy and Ticky Man. And we'd really like to put anything out that you do in that direction. And straight away, I was like, well, this is weird. You know, I'm having Apex knock on my door. And suddenly it would be like massive attack, Tom York. I remember sitting next to Grace Jones on a couch in a hotel, having her recite a killer acapella next to me. You know, just like pinch yourself. I must have lost my mind. What's going on, you know? But knowing that something must be being done right here to attract people I respect who are seemingly giving me respect in return. I didn't set out to hook Aphex Twin. I didn't set out to come into the consciousness of Grace Jones. But suddenly they're showing love for something I'm involved in and do, you know. And it's an amazing feeling. But at the same time... When you have that thirst to continually reinvent yourself and find new paths all the time, you put yourself under a certain amount of pressure. And sometimes it's tough. And I find it tough in myself, you know. But still, all the more determined to be an individual in terms of what my output is. For me, if you make music that's individual, it should reflect you as a person, not reflect a peer group that you're involved with or a fashionable trend. Speaking of fashionable trends, in the years between pressure and London Zoo. Things like dubstep and grime are starting to take shape. In what context were you being exposed to this stuff? In clubs? Were you buying records? I was going to clubs all the time, of course, in London. What else are you going to do? So I moved there, you know? So for me, firstly, obviously with... with Jungle and Drum and Bass Nights, I was going to the end and getting my head hammered by Andy C, you know, then Grime came along. I can't remember... Actually, I do remember, A, I'd fallen in love with grime in rough trade of all places when I walked in there and someone said, hey, you should check this white label. And it was I Love You by Dizzy Rascal. And I put it on the headphones. I just had my head blown straight away. So this is incredible. You know, it's shocking because it's got all elements that I dig. It's got it's funky. It's noisy. It's fucking sci fi. I'm not even sure I'm allowed to swear on this. I've said fucking maybe like half an hour ago. So basically, yeah, I Love You was a big moment hearing that for the first time in Rough Trade, which still is. And his first album, I still think is a masterpiece, you know. But at the same time, I remember I'd been booked to do a bug show in Amsterdam. I didn't know, but it was with Roll Deep. And it was their first ever European show, you know, and just seeing them in action and just watching them before and after the show was hilarious too because they were just like kids in a sweet shop going mad in Amsterdam and just seeing how potent it was, you know, and seeing grime. Parties that I was going to, there was fights on stage, off stage, you know, I mean physical, not just on the mic, you know, literally members of the audience would go and punch some MC in the face and then dudes would be jumping into the crowd. It was madness, you know, like punk as fuck, you know, and the productions were raw and dirty and DIY, but... like nothing I'd heard before in lots of ways. That hooked me indelibly, you know, and then Wiley's devil mixes, you know, devilish mixes were incredible. But at the same time, Code 9 had interviewed me. I can't remember the synchronicity of this, but Code 9 had interviewed me just after Pressure for Accelerator magazine. And I'd never met Code 9 before. I was aware of him. He hadn't really released much himself at that point, if anything, actually. But I'd been aware of him through his writing and presence generally. And we got on really, really well. And we talked for a long time after the interview. And at the end, he was like, come to this new club night that started called Forward. And it literally just started at Plastic People. I think it had one venue before then. But I went down to Forward and there was like 20 people there. That would be like Benga, Mala, Lofa and their girlfriends. And that would be about it, really. It was just starting, you know. And I could empathize with a lot of what they were trying to do. But I'll be honest, dubstep wasn't magnetizing me. The scene as a group of people was amazing. You know, they were very welcoming to me. I'm a total stranger to these people, you know. And they were all quite, they could have been very close with their Croydon thing. But I guess because they respected Code 9 because he had his regular dubstep shows on Pirate. they trusted him in bringing me to their party, you know. And I used to go down there a lot because I was living just around the corner. So Plastic People was actually like my office. Not even my office, it was my escape space. I was having to live in my studio. So just to keep sane, my escape was going to Plastic People most nights, you know, and I would go regularly to Forward. And then... And during the friendship that happened with Steve, I remember at one point, I'm not sure exactly when, he was like, look, I love your tracks, but make some tunes at 140 and I'll play them on my show. I'll be honest, which will be hilarious, particularly to resident advisors, listeners. I never thought in my life of making a track a tempo, you know, given tempo. I was like, what? Why would you make a track? a certain tempo because i wasn't interested in beat matching you know or seamless dj sets they to me a lot of times that was actually a bit boring a bit passe you know no matter how skillful you know and actually i started making the tunes at 140 bpm just so steve would play them you know as a challenge to myself as well and to learn something new you know and Like I said, for me... The connection to dubstep has always been one I've tried to avoid because I was doing this stuff before, really. You know, it's like London Zoo was a continuation of the work I'd started with Pressure. You know, I didn't see it like a massive change or shift in direction. There were some tracks that were done at 140 BPM which would fit in DJ's boxes and in DJ's sets. I would have lived in my own bubble. making pressure. You know, I didn't even think anyone else would play my tracks. I just wanted to make my own tracks because I wasn't hearing that sound anywhere else that I could play live. You know, I wasn't thinking of DJ sets, you know. And to be honest, because I didn't come from DJ culture, I wasn't even that aware of technically that, of course, for a DJ to beatmatch, you have to have the tempos at the same... the same BPM, you know, for seamless DJing. So therefore it made sense that now DJs were going to play my music that hadn't played the stuff before, you know. you know, like a light inside my head just because it hadn't been my world, you know. So it was an eye-opener for me to get involved with dubstep producers and give them tunes I was finishing and seeing what happens. You know, Code 9 and Loafer ended up being my missionaries. You know, they were the ones dropping the tunes because I wasn't getting the shows at that time. So I'd get a text from Code 9 saying, yo, I'd be reading it in my studio at 4 a.m. saying, yo, Kev, like, Poison Darts just destroyed 6,000 people at Sonar. And just giggling about it, him giggling on the text and me laughing at the reaction, thinking this is mad, you know. And then I'd start seeing it happen at DMZ, you know, after 4. I think it was, I can't remember. totally remember but basically the transition from forward to DMZ, Lofren Code 9 were dropping my tunes and I was watching the reaction and just stunned you know and very obviously happy and you know it's it's amazing to see people show positive reception to something you work on in isolation you know and so would you be aware of the track like skang being a insane banger before you send it out to people no not at all you know chance and chaos plays a large part in my life okay and it's not always pragmatic decision making it's just like like my conversation with you is tangential Things just fall into place. You will them into place in a lot of ways, you know. But with Skeng, for a start, when I worked on the tune, the rhythm, it felt special to me, of course. Otherwise, I wouldn't have kept working on it. But when Flo Dan came to the studio the night it was recorded, he brought Killer P along. And I didn't know Killer very well. And it was to record on a different track. we recorded the first track and we'd finished work on it about 3 or 4 a.m., I think, maybe 4 a.m., something like that. And Flood, I just wanted to take off afterwards. But Killer was buzzing after the first track and he was like, yo, what else you got? And I said, well, I'm just finishing this beat, which is sort of sick. I dig it, man. And he said, put it on, put it on. And I put it on and Floodown was like, no, I'm feeling this shit. You know, let's go, let's go. Yeah, yeah, no, no, he was not feeling it. And it was due to Killa very much saying, no, let's stay, let's have a go at this. And Floodown was sort of, I'm in an iron about it, but in the end decided to stay. Then we took a I think it was Killer that started it, actually. And then Flo Dan started doing his known phrasing and flow. And I said, nah, do it half speed. Do it like a chant, you know, and that's what became his growling, skeng repetitions, you know. And I just remember through a lot of recording of that song, we were just on our backs laughing at the lines. They were writing them as they were spitting them, more or less, you know. It was done off the top of their domes. I don't know how much they'd written before of the lines that were included. Obviously... Some of Killer's Delivery harkens back to classic dance or lyricism, Ninja Man. But the lyrics were incredible, you know. I couldn't believe they were just dropping these lyrics one by one, you know, that were so dark in one way, but sort of darkly funny in another way. It's the sort of lyrics that Nick Cave would get or Bob Dylan would receive Adelaide. accolades for but because these are urban rappers you know i remember getting a lot of shit on dubstep forum for releasing it because people said i was glorifying violence and there's always this bullshit about how grime glorifies violence you know what's not seemingly allowed is for young black men to be given the kudos for being incredibly literate and incredibly succinct storytellers, you know, and to do it with flair. And that's what they did with Skeng. I'm still blown away by the lyrics to Skeng, literally. Well, it's interesting because if it wasn't clear, and it's probably not, but this is the period when Skeng's on London Zoo, for instance. I think there was another track on it. It's the Space Ape one, Fuckers. The lyrics on that one are awesome. And they also seem to like really play into the narrative that you built around London Zoo. And so I was wondering how much direction is there when you have like a thematic idea for an album when you're working with MCs like this or how much of there is this kind of strange like symbiotic like just... Like this situation where you just described doesn't sound calculated, for instance. Yeah, no, no, I didn't direct Skeng lyrically. They decided what they wanted to spit, but I knew it fitted. And you've got to remember, there's a lot of tracks that didn't end up on London Zoo. So for me, there was a narrative I wanted the album to have that came through selecting what would be finally on the album. Different MCs, different situations, different cases. In some cases, like Ricky Rankin, I helped with the lyrics. In other cases, like Tipper Irie, I suggested to him, I wanted him to write a track about what makes him vexed on a daily basis. What winds him up. about living in London and he came in with Angry. So, yeah, I definitely, obviously, you know, decided the shape, the mood, the story of the album. But in Skeng's case... They came with their own subject matter, but I knew it fitted what I wanted for the album. It's a case-by-case scenario, but I knew what I wanted from London Zoo before I even worked on it. The album took three and a half years to make, something like that. And I just knew that I wanted it to reflect what I saw as my view of London and how I felt in London. positive or negative. I wanted it to be a collision and have friction, but also have a beauty to it, you know, because I think London has all that, you know. I loved it and I hated it as a city and I wanted those emotions to shine through on the record, you know. There's certain tracks that are spoken about all the time on the record. We're talking about them now, like Skang or Poison Dart. They weren't my favourite tracks, actually, on the album. My favourite tracks are never talked about. Like something like... the Ricky Rankin track on there. Oh, fuck, this is embarrassing. I can't even remember the title of it. Yeah, okay, it's not Murder We and it's not Judgment. It's the Dancehall one. For me, it was like, this is some mental mixture of Ortega and Steely and Cleavey, you know, to Dancehall. And I was really proud of it and I'd worked really hard to do something different, but no one talks about that track. You realise, and You know, it's the same. It's a process of craft that you do to construct a piece of music. The people that decide if a track resonates are an audience. And I went from God, where I actively despised people in an audience, to now relishing seeing an audience go mental to my tracks, you know. I'm not interested and haven't been for many, many years in emptying venues, but there was a time I was, you know. But as far as I'm concerned, I've realized that whatever my preference is in my output has little consequence to anyone but myself. The reaction to a song is very much with an audience, you know. Was your living condition improved afterwards? I didn't get any money from London Zoo, man. You know, that's the irony. If London Zoo had come out 10 years before and had the impact it had, I would have probably had a big benefit hearing how records by Wiley were being sold off the back of... cars in thousands. God, I wish I'd had that sort of access, you know. I didn't benefit from it. I was living in my studio until I left London, you know. My studio was a shithole without a shower and without a kitchen, you know. I had to join a gym. In order to shower, I had to eat out all the time because there was no facilities to eat in. I was broke. And still, my security, the irony is, some people seem to find this... Imagine, because you have a big tune or what's seen as a big tune, you're minted, you know. I wish, you know. For me, Skeng was only pressed once on Hyperdub. It wasn't released on Ninja because Ninja didn't feel it had, quote, commercial potential. which was a big discussion at the time. All it's helped really ultimately is give me a reputation that people will consider booking me for shows. You know, that's how it's helped. That's the way it is nowadays, right? Absolutely. It's all flipped. You know, I talk about this all the time with virtually everyone in music these days. You know... You may as well give away your music as people like Run the Jewels and Death Grips have in the past, you know, to get attention, to get... shows and hope that the quality of what you give away will get you the shows you know because it's hard to get people to put their money in their pockets but i understand that too you look at the prices of records 20 euros 30 euros for an album it's a lot of cash to shell out for you know um yeah it's it's it's a difficult time as a as a musician now because Of course, I've always valued live shows anyway. I still love the live environment. It's like a gladiatorial arena for me. Obviously, as a studio obsessive in my space capsule, I would wish the time spent would receive income. that would allow me to feel safe in paying my rent. And it doesn't because I've chosen a path which you've discussed earlier, which isn't genre-based. I'm trying to be for artistic integrity, you know, which means you lose the security. You know, if I made straight dubstep, I could play a straight dubstep session. A dubstep audience wants dubstep music to be played in a dubstep way. That's not how I play my live shows. My live shows are like a series of explosions. They're not really about a linear, horizontal experience, you know. And that's not to knock. You look at DJs like Youngster or Hatcher, how they DJ. They're masters at what they do, you know. And like earlier when I was talking about seamless DJing, I'm not anti-seamless DJing at all. There's artistry involved in that too, you know, of course. Incredible. But it's just not my chosen way, you know. The same way I've seen, I remember seeing Alec Empire play a show after the Beastie Boys, literally having waves of glasses. thrown at him just playing this series like warfare weapons at the crowd and i just loved it you know or seeing shaka or abishanti halfway through a record pick the needle up pull it back say a few words and then put the needle back on i don't mind about the context What I mind is about the emotional impact and the creative impact and the freshness that I'm a witness to when I go to see a DJ session. My chosen style of playing live is one that I've developed over time that makes me feel it's an original individual presentation of what I do. But that makes life harder, as I said. You know, and going back to your original question about money and benefiting, it's like I'm still extremely fortunate. to be able to pay my rent for music. So many friends and much more talented, technically speaking, producers or musicians have either had to jack it, give in, or just lost confidence or faith in the whole industry. So I'm fortunate that I can still do what I love and sometimes get paid for it. And that makes me a happy person. That sounds banal. It's not meant banal. It just means that... wow, I'm glad people appreciate something that I've done or my presentation. But I know it's tough. It hasn't got any easier with or without London Zoo. And I know that, as I said, if I was part of a metal band, you have a fixed metal circuit. If you're a reggae DJ, you can play the reggae festivals. There isn't a bug circuit. You know, it's an army of one. Maybe the repress will make you millions. Yeah. Yeah, I wish. I wish. Thank you.
