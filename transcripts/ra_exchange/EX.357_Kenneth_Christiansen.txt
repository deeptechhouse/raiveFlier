you you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week we're going to be talking to Kenneth Christiansen, who's been a key part of the Danish scene for well over a decade now. His label Echo Chord is one of Dub Techno's best love imprints and is currently celebrating 15 years in operation. He was also a founder of the Copenhagen club Culture Box, which quickly became known as one of the city's finest. On top of that, he spent much of his time working in record stores. And it all adds up to an unusually broad perspective on underground dance music, spanning label and club management, distribution and music production. At Unicom, heard about all this and more when Kenneth visited. our Berlin office a couple of months back. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Kenneth Christensen is up next. So how often do you come to Berlin, Kenneth? It's just a quick trip today, one day. Today is not normal. Normally I'm always going here on the weekends. And I've been going to Berlin over the last 18 years now. No more, actually 25 years. Since the night, oh. Yeah, 92 was the first time I was in Berlin. So yeah, it's actually 25 years ago I was here the first time. And I remember it very much because it was my first time and I went to the old Tresor club, the old Evag club. And we were like a lot of ravers going in a bus from Denmark to Berlin to go to Love Parade, of course. So that was the first time. And then we have been going here like a lot, like every year for sure. And then I started to DJ here in 1999. And then I would say, especially over the last five years, it's maybe four or five times a year at least. So you are like an original techno tourist if you've been doing it since 92. I don't really feel like a tourist anymore because every time I go now it's because I'm DJing. somewhere. Now it's Tresor I play every time. Yeah, it's work now. So it's kind of work, but yeah, of course, the same time. When you're in Berlin, you always feel a little bit like a raver tourist. It's nice. So what kind of people would organize these bus trips? Would it just be like the clubbers or was there a company? I mean, it's not there anymore. In the beginning of the 90s, it was always warehouse parties in Copenhagen. We were a lot of young people together who just organized it together and went away. I've heard they used to do it in, you know, Dorian Paik, this German guy. He was also telling me they used to do it within Germany. Like there would be some bus organized to go to some rave or party. Yeah, at that time. And they would leave at like 8 a.m. or whatever the next day. At that time, you couldn't take the flight. It was way too expensive. And from Copenhagen to Berlin is still only like six hours or something. You just have to take the ferry boat, which is also funny when you are in a party mood, you know, with a lot of ravers. We should bring it back. Imagine that, just a bus drops people off. from like in front of the Berghain door. It's funny actually. Nobody would get in, but yeah. Yeah, pay the bus ticket, but entrance isn't guaranteed. You just have to wait around for like 12 hours. So yeah, I mean, I've been a lot in Berlin and I have a lot of friends here over many, many years. So I always love to go here. Did you ever consider moving here? Yes, I did actually. It's like 13 years ago. I've been working in record shops in Copenhagen for many years and also did warehouse parties, legal parties and clubs. And I decided to stop working in record shops because I wanted to try to do something else. And I wanted to open a club, like a steady club. And I have some friends in Berlin who really tried to get me actually to do something here because at that time there was not really like an in-between club for like 300-400 people. But I decided in the end to stay in Copenhagen and try to do something in Copenhagen and not be one out of a million DJ and one out of a million record label. So I'm actually happy now after all these years that I stayed. Yeah, because it means the scene in Copenhagen. It means you're contributing to that scene. Exactly. Instead of just, yeah, moving somewhere else. Exactly. That was the right choice to do. So Culture Box started in what year? It was 2006, beginning of 2006. Yeah, because you just had the 10-year. Yeah, we celebrated 12 years of Culture Box in January. So yeah, around that time. But I actually just stopped there to work there. Really? So yeah. Man, so this is exclusive. That's my next step. I will now focus again to do more music in the studio with my partner Rizzo. focus more on my labels and my DJ gigs, my showcases, and maybe do some events somewhere in Copenhagen, but we will see about that. So what led you to give up working at Culturebox? It was actually a decision I made last year that I wanted to... I had the opportunity to get out of it, sell my shares. Because there were some people who wanted to get in and also invest some money in the club to improve the club at the same time. And I thought, okay, this is my chance to move out of it. And now I'll be there a few months more and then that's it. So how does it feel? Are you looking forward to the future? It still feels very strange because it's something that you build up yourself together with my partner. So it will always be strange, but sometimes I also think you have to move on and try something else. It's so many years and so much responsibility. And yeah, it's been a lot of work. I think it was a nice time and you got a lot of contacts and meeting a lot of people. presenting a lot of music in small Copenhagen that would not have been there. So when you look back, of course, it's nice. So if you're running a club, what does your week look like? Like how many hours? Is it more or less like all day, every day, you're doing work-related things? It can change a lot because one thing is that you have to be on like 24-7. Because when you are in control of all the bookings and you fly in maybe five or six artists every weekend and you deal with writers and hotels and flights and counseling flights and all this, then you have to be ready for anything all the time. So it's a lot of work in the office more than you can imagine, I think, because a lot of people say, OK, what are you doing in the daytime then? And I mean, running a club with 30 people working there and flying people in all the time and everything. Of course, we had a lot of people around it, especially in the last years. But still, it's... It's a lot of responsibility and that was one of the reasons that I had to try to get a little bit away from that, make a little distance. Was it stopping you from doing other things? Like if you say there was a lot of responsibility, were you thinking like, oh, I'd rather not be figuring out where... this DJ should stay. Yeah, I mean, I think, especially last year, I think it was, you get really stressful in small things because... you look at all these crazy writers and all this, you have to deal with so many things. And also it can be difficult to run an underground club in Copenhagen. Copenhagen is a very small city and the scene is not that big. So we had our ups and downs and every time you have these downs, you always think, okay, maybe we should try to do something else because maybe it's not really worth it because people don't understand it anyway. But it was more like the last year. I said to myself that, yeah, it's maybe a good idea to do something. So when you talk about ups and downs, what's a down? Like people just don't come to the party? A down could be like if you lose, use like, for example, six months trying to book. This act that you really like yourself and that you know this act is really popular everywhere else and you bring him or her to Copenhagen or group or whatever to Copenhagen and then in the end you have maybe 80 people showing up, you know. Then you can be a little stressful about it and think, what the fuck, you know. It's like, it's crazy, you know. Of course, the time is getting better and better now. We have more and more people coming. to the club regularly and all this. But when you have these periods when you don't even know if you have money enough to make coins in the banks for the club, then it's not funny anymore. And when you started the club, was it a struggle at the beginning or was it kind of a hit straight away? It was a hit straight away because when we opened it, I was opening a club with a guy called Loke and when we opened the club, there was really nothing in Copenhagen at that time. There was very few big parties, maybe once every third month or something. So we needed a place for electronic underground music every weekend. So that was the main reason because we were so much into the music and we needed to do something. So of course in the beginning it was a huge success and then slowly it went a little bit down again, got into a normal thing and you find out, okay, it's difficult and it's very expensive to do this project. And then it gets suddenly better again and yeah, it's been up and down. I guess it's this uncertainty that could... get difficult after a while. It's like, as you say, you book someone that you think will be a success. Yeah, you can just get really tired. So has it become more complicated to book DJs when you talk about these crazy writers? I mean, it depends who you want to book, but I think these days it is difficult. And I also just read an article on RA here the other day that you were writing about the problems for promoters and clubs, actually, that... Especially this period we have now, it's more about hype about the artists instead of the music, which is sad, I think. So you see the same 20, 25 artists playing everywhere, in the big festivals and in the bigger clubs, and they get a huge amount of money. If you want to present something that is in between, maybe a little bit like what I am or my artist. It is not that easy at the moment because I think this generation we have now is not that curious. They just want to see the same artist, the really big, hyped artist. And at the moment you have like a festival. We don't have a festival season anymore. You have festival every day almost all year now somewhere, you know, and people are traveling more also. It's so easy to travel now. So it's not that easy. So when do you think this shift started to happen? Because you would have had a front row seat to it all. It's not that long ago, maybe a year ago. Something like this, I think it started to be more complicated and more difficult. Suddenly the artists don't only have like an agent anymore, they also have a management or whatever, you know. You have to deal with a lot of people when you send an email. There's maybe 10 people there. It's not like one or two. That's what I think. There's so many like, it's somehow become weirdly professional in a way that isn't needed. It can be difficult, for sure. How was it? In the 90s then, in Copenhagen, I guess everyone knows a lot about Sweden and Svek and this Icelandic dub techno thing. So what was happening in the rest of Scandinavia in that time? I moved to Copenhagen like in 1996. I'm from the countryside, where it's south. Oh, really? But I started to go out in Copenhagen like in 1996. 1991, when the big warehouse rave started to, not every month, but maybe every second month, there was something special going on where everybody was going. And then slowly we had some clubs or venues that tried to do some more electronic music. We had a place called Vega. Yeah, some other clubs. I started to play myself in Copenhagen in 1996 in a warehouse kind of place. But the scene was not that big. We had some really nice record shops from the beginning, but it's not been that easy to make underground music there or parties there. Because kids are into other music? Yeah, also it's maybe not, I think we had a long period where it's not that easy just to open up a warehouse and do a party. There are many, many rules with the fire departments and all these kind of things. So unless you want to take a big risk and rent in everything and like what we did many times, then you don't know the police can come anytime and close it down. So you really have to have the nerves also to do it. So yeah, it's a big work. It was a big work to do something. Is there a lot of regulation when it comes to opening a club as well? Oh my God, yes. Yeah, because I can imagine it. Too much. But in a way, of course, I also understand you have these kind of... You have to be sure that the guests you have are 100% safe. That's the most important thing, of course. Yeah, this makes sense. So what kind of things, like if you're running a club in Copenhagen or Denmark, oh yeah, if you were running a club. If you're dealing with the government, what do they want to check? They want to check the fire safety, of course. It's mostly about fire safety, yeah. About how many people can you have in the club at the same time. Stuff like this. The cleaning in the fridges has to be checked. If you sell cocktails and using fruits and stuff, there are other kinds of rules. Then you are suddenly into some kind of kitchen rule that you have to do this and this. And you have to make these checklists on everything when you close down the bar or open a bar and stuff like that. Checking that things are clean. Yeah, for example. There are no rats running. around that's not gonna work in company also the employees you are hired that it's legally hired that they have a Danish CPR number and stuff like that how many things like a tax number yes tax number oh I see yeah but that's in general that's not only in clubs that's for everybody you know so And has it become more strict over time? Like in 2006, is it? No, I don't think so. I think it's almost the same. You say there are 30 people working now. There are like four people in the office like almost every day and then we have all these people in the club when it's open like bartenders, runners, security guys, stuff like that. Yeah, because this is always a big responsibility. It's like not only DJ fees but it costs a lot to open for one night. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I can see how it would be. And a big rent. In Copenhagen, it's very expensive to rent anything or buy anything. It's really, it's not like Berlin. So how did you find this space? Well, that's a long story. I was looking, we were looking for spaces for a long time and we needed to find a place that was not too far away from the center, but also we wanted to be close enough to the center so that people can still walk or take their bicycle to the club And in the end, finally, we found this. It was used to something else. I think it was like a wine cigar club or something. But it was empty some years when we found it. And it all has to be totally rebuilt and everything. But we could see the potential in the place. And we had the two floors. And we could do a wardrobe. And we could do this and this. Then, yeah, we took it and started from scratch. So how long did it take to renovate? I think it took half a year or something. That's the thing, when there's so much money on the line and time, it's a pretty serious decision to want to open something somewhere like that. Yeah, it was a little bit more serious than I thought. Expensive hobby. Yeah, exactly. There's a lot more going on than most people realize when they go to a club. There's so much behind the scenes. There's a lot of things behind that you don't see. So a lot of work during the week that you don't see. Yeah. So what are you going to do during the week now? I will have a little break, I think. Use some more time for my kids also when I have my kids every second week. Go to the studio again with Dennis Rizzo. We have this project called Pattern Repeat together and we now finally have a time again to maybe go to the studio once a week or two times a week instead of once every six months. It's a little better. And he also have a little time now, very soon. So that's the plan. And focus more also on my labels now. I just hired a PR agent and I think he was the guy who got in touch with you so we could do this also. It already works. And that's a new thing for me also to try to maybe invest some money in my labels and see where it goes. I mean, I think it's time to try to take it to another level. So are you asking producers for tracks usually or is most of what you get sent? Mostly it is what I get sent. Times can really change. Sometimes nothing can really happen for some months and then suddenly I get so much sent. For me it has mostly for a long period been like a little family that I'm using. I used a lot the same artist, my main artist. And then suddenly something comes up. I hear about somebody from another label or from another artist or I'm following somebody for a certain time and then I got these tracks and I'm like, okay, yeah, cool. Right now there's a lot going on. I mean, it's crazy. So it's really, it seems like a good year. That's the thing with this dubby kind of music. It's always just stayed strong somehow. Yeah, I think so. I think it was disappearing a little bit, I would say maybe six, seven years ago. As people started getting into this harder sound, maybe. Yeah, and then suddenly, but it always comes back in a way. Because if people are going to the more housey scene or the banging techno scene, sometimes they end somewhere again in a more deeper stuff that I like also. I think it will always be here. So how did you get into this deeper stuff? You can't really play that at a warehouse. You can, actually. If you have a really good sound system, maybe it's possible. So, no, but it was from Berlin, actually, when I... It was like, I mean, everybody's maybe saying this, but it was the old Chain Reaction, Basic Channel stuff, and the old Dean label, and when Stephen Bickert did the pole stuff, and I also listened to a lot of dub and reggae stuff earlier. But also, I mean, I'm not only playing dub techno, I also play techno in-house. But I'm more focused about this kind of dubby thing somehow in my labels. And yeah, I've always liked that. So what did you like about it? Was it this hypnotic thing or was it like gave you a nice like positive feeling? Like what is it about these dub techno lovers? Because I also have some friends who are obsessed with this sound. That's a good question. I mean, I just like... the sound in it I mean the deep sound and the bass and the whole thing I think it's beautiful were you already into techno when Basic Channel and Maurizio yes came out yeah can't imagine what it would be like to hear this stuff for the first time it was Maurizio or something it's like It's always amazing when you have these times when you maybe see a new genre somehow and it's not really happening that much anymore because every time you hear something that is nice, maybe you heard it before somehow. But yeah, for example, the Basic Channel or when Paul did his first releases or Burial for me was also something really new and fresh. James Blake did some stuff. And when you really feel, okay, that's really something new here, that's really interesting, I think. That's amazing. Yeah, it doesn't happen so often anymore. Nope. Well, for me, every time I hear something, whoa, this sounds so fresh. This sounds so good. It's just someone remaking 90s stuff, which can be cool. Or maybe it's a repress from 1992, but you didn't know it. Yeah, exactly. Would you buy records in Berlin when you would visit? I just did. I mean, like when you would come for your techno trips. Yeah, yeah. Would you go visit the record shop? Yeah, for sure. We also bought records from the beginning at that time. I was actually working in a record shop from 89 to 91 in the countryside where I grew up. Like House and Techno? Yes, we had the first Warp releases, the first Iron S releases. We also saw like the Pitch Mode and more like new wave stuff and pop stuff like Pitcher Boys, whatever. But we had these new underground stuff in a small city for 25,000 people. So how was it in 1989? If you were like some... 40-year-old guy or girl, did you still have to be a real music lover to buy vinyl? Would the average person go and buy a record? Or had CDs already taken over? The CD was taking over slowly, but still you could get vinyl within all genres. And lots of people would buy it. You didn't have to be some music lover. nerd. No, it was later that the CD took a lot more over, if I remember right. Did this affect the record shop you were working in, in the countryside? Yeah, you could see that we got one more CDs we had to sell as well. Also, in the last one I worked in in Copenhagen, we sold a lot of, for example, compilations, like CD compilations for ambient or downbeat stuff or whatever. But that was the way to have the vinyls, to afford to have selling their compilations then we had a good advance on these but you know not so much on vinyl so it was about finding the balance all the time because you know now people are so uh yeah i'm a vinyl lover i love vinyl etc i don't know i always find it interesting if there's someone that's been a vinyl guy or girl since the very beginning because now if you're if you're playing vinyl it seems like you're of course you love it but It's a bit more of a statement, but I find it so interesting when there was someone who was around in the early 90s, CDs came out, they seemed so new and convenient, but they still chose vinyl, you know? I'm the right guy to talk about this because I still only play vinyl and I always did and I think CDs are so ugly. Yeah, so what happened? If you're a music guy or girl... And then CDs arrived. What did you think? Were you like, what is this crap? I didn't really look at it. I mean, on my Echo Chord label, I also did CD releases on the albums. In a way, of course, I think I have to, and I think also, of course, it's nice to have, but for me, it's the vinyl thing to do. I mean, if I could not sell vinyl, I would not have a record label. For me, then it's not Did lots of your friends switch to... Well, I guess vinyl stayed with DJing until the end of the 90s. When did digital start to take over? What I saw was that people started to play the CDs, like home-burned CD stuff, for a long period. And then after the digital got more and more in, they used USB sticks, for example, over the last... years I see but still I see like new generation now that also what you just said that that are just playing vinyl and they love it as well so for me it's just nice to see this generation you look at yourself like 25 20 years ago or something you know it's I think it's nice yeah there's still lots of people using vinyl yeah it's beautiful yeah I don't know what I would have done because like for me I'm 28 my first contact with music was through CDs you know so for me to then go and use vinyl it's a bit more like it's a bit more of a sentimental thing maybe my first thing was cassette you know the cassettes yeah when I was like 12 13 or something so you've always had analogue yeah real analogue guy yeah Why did you decide to move to Copenhagen then, in 1996? How old were you? I was 23, and it was a natural thing to do. You move to the biggest city in your country, and I wanted to work with electronic music, and that was the only place in Denmark, and I had a chance to move. or to work in a record shop there. So I started that. So what was the record shop called? It was called Street Dance Records, a really ugly name. But it was the first record shop in Denmark that was totally concentrating about underground electronic music. They also had hip-hop and stuff, but a really cool record shop in the beginning. I was there exactly three years when it turned into more commercial dance music stuff, selling PlayStation stuff and I was like games and stuff. And I was like, okay, I have to try something else. So I decided to try to open my own record shop with a good friend called Morten. At that time, there was too much competition. So after one year, we found out that these records we wanted to sell was too nerdy for Copenhagen and it was not. It was not possible. And then I got the opportunity to work in another record shop and I did that for four years before I moved on with the club thing. So what records were you selling when you had your own? We wanted to do very much like a hard rack shop in Copenhagen. A lot of Berlin stuff and a lot of Detroit stuff mixed, and it was difficult. But we tried. If it lasted for one year, when did you figure out that it wasn't going to be a long-term thing? I think after half a year, then you find out that it's not possible to earn anything or to survive. It was too expensive to... I mean, at that time, at least, if you buy in 10 records... You just settle nine of them to break even you know there was no advance on the record so then it's difficult if you sell free and you have seven then you are actually fucked unless you have a lot of money to put in to make a very big back stock and you can just take it easy or sell something else in the shop that's what you also see a lot if people opening a record shop for example now these days you maybe have a hairdresser next door you have a coffee shop also there or selling books or whatever yeah it's the way to do it if you want to unless you are like a really stable shop that has been here for many, many years. It would be pretty hard to run a record store, I can imagine. What was the one that you worked in after you closed yours? And what was yours called? Mine was called Science Fiction. And we named it after a track by Daniel Bell on our old Tresor compilation. And after that, I moved to a record shop called Loud Music. And it's been existing for many years. And it was some really good friends working there already. And Dennis, actually, who is my partner now in Pattern Repeat Reservoir, he was actually also working there. So he started his own label also when I went there and saw my label. And yeah, we talked about everything. And then we started slowly to have these things together. So something really good came out of it. And I still remember the good times there. Yeah. So how many years in total did you say you worked at Record Stores? It must be almost 10 years. Wow. There's a general opinion. If you work in a record shop, people are mean. Like you're a grumpy record store guy. Why do you think that is? Why does that stereotype exist? They can be. Not always. Not always. obviously lots of really nice people. But I think you can see that in all kinds of shops actually. If you have been doing this for so many years and you have some young people coming in then you know that you know more than they do so they should not say anything about anything. It's maybe a little bit like that. But for example the record shop we had in Copenhagen the last one it was very important for me to be really really polite and to really really help people and really trying to help them to find the right records. Because, I mean, it's a jungle. If you don't know anything, you have to keep the customers. So what can a customer do to annoy a record store clerk? Like what's the what's a bad customer? I don't really see any bad customers I think if people are coming to a record shop it's because they're curious about this music you're selling and then I think already when they step in it's Unless they do something violent or anything then I think it's a I cannot see why not to treat them, right? I mean, yeah exactly so in London I've had some like rude workers. I think I'm pretty friendly when I go to a record shop and it's just funny when that isn't reflected back at you. But the thing I was thinking is like, I've also worked in shops before, like before I started working here. while I was at university in Australia, customers can be pretty rude. Not saying please and thank you, just rude. So I was thinking maybe a record shop is one of the jobs where you don't have to be so, where customer service isn't so obsessed over. Yeah, maybe people more feel like home there. Also, if they go there a lot, they feel like they're home in the kitchen or anything. They just chill out and maybe are not so busy using a lot of money sometimes. I don't know. Yeah. Who else from the Danish scene have you worked with in a record store? A lot of people? A lot of people, but I don't think anybody that you would know, for example. More local guys? Yeah, local guys doing some local stuff. Were you making music in this time? No, I was not making music before we started Pad and Repeat, me and Dennis, which is, what is that, five years? ago or something maybe I don't remember oh so you had the label before you started making tunes Echo Court is 15 years ago now so you had the label way before you started making tracks I didn't realise that I thought you were making tracks this whole time no It was only because Dennis and I had this idea that we wanted to try to make some music in another direction that could fit to my label Echo Chord or to his label Baum. A little bit more techno in a way, this more metallic kind of techno sound. And he got this super cool studio a little bit north from Copenhagen. In the beginning it was actually in Center, but now he moved north. Crazy, crazy studio and really amazing. Yeah, I went to his place and we just tried to do some stuff. And very fast, we had the same kind of idea about which direction to go. Then we just thought, okay, shall we send it to someone? Or should we maybe just try to make a new project together? And I called Compact again, saying, hey, we have this project. Yeah, I'm not buying records this time. I've got a new, I'm selling records. So they said, yeah, of course, Kenneth, we are ready for you. So it was super cool and easy. So is Compact distributing Echo Chord? They've been distributing from the very beginning and they've been a very big help for me. I've known the guy Michael, Michael Meyer and Wolfgang before because I've been working record shops. So I started to deal with Compact with the distribution even when I started from the beginning. So we already knew each other, so when I sent them the tracks they were really positive with the first releases with Mikkel Metal. I got a go from them and said, okay, let's do it. Yeah, that's the thing. When you find a good distributor, I guess it's really encouraging because it gives you... It's so important. It's like a safety. Also when you know the people and it's all about music. It's all about music. It's so important. Her record is 15. That's 2001 or 2002. It was actually, I think it was end of 2001, I decided to do it, and the first release came beginning of 2002. So it's 15 years ago. So how many records would you press in 2002, if you don't mind me asking? I think it was 250 or something. Okay, so it's not like thousands. No, no, no, absolutely not. And it still is not. Yeah. Was vinyl going down at that point in 2001? Was it still like... No, I think it was not going down. I think it was later. They had a little down going when it really got famous to download tracks. And when you saw Beatport and all this coming up, easier to travel with a USB stick, somebody found out. Maybe they're old. I don't know. But then it went a little bit down and then suddenly you see this new generation again and the popularity of pressing vinyl, all kinds of music. You see jazz music or whatever, pop music. I think it was last year the biggest vinyl sale for about 20 years. Yeah, that's what they say. That's crazy. I mean, it's really, really nice to see. Because for me, to make the vinyl is a process. It's like put a lot of energy in it. You get somebody to master your track. you have somebody to do your artwork or you do it yourself maybe and you have to think a lot about how it should look like it's like a real product instead of just putting up a track which is not even mastered somewhere Where are you getting the records mastered? It's mastered in, I think it's just outside of Cologne. It's one of the guys from the Compact family doing it. It's always been around Compact. So have you visited Cologne a lot? Yes, many times. I play there like at least once a year for many years and also went there a lot just to see the... The factory, I say, the big place down there. See all the guys, the offices and studios. How often are you playing in Copenhagen? It's not that much because the last, especially the last three years, I've been really busy playing somewhere else in Europe, also America. So when... When I had a weekend home without my kids, which is every second weekend, I tried to focus on something else. I've been a lot to the club, of course, but... I just played there like once a month for a period. And then long, maybe a year ago, two years ago, I also played like maybe five, six times a year. But playing somewhere else in Copenhagen is not very often, maybe once a year. Yeah, I see. And there are lots of people putting on parties outside Culture Box? Yeah, there's a lot of smaller places. We have this meat district area with a lot of bars and smaller... kind of clubs in between things. Of course, there's a few clubs also with electronic music and there's always some pop-up parties somewhere. So there's a lot of things going on actually. Does it seem like Copenhagen is especially busy now? Bonanza Music, like busier than it was when you started culture works? It's busier now than, yeah, definitely. Because I think we just got a generation that got more energy for this. Also, we have a new record shop, record shops and new labels popping up. And we have some... local DJs that are playing also around Europe. Not only me and Martinez or Trenemüller, who else is popular. We have some really good upcoming young people now that are really traveling also and doing a career about it. So it's really nice to see. I guess it would be pretty hard to do music full-time in Copenhagen. Yeah, especially this kind of music. Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out how, like, how much you need to play to live off music in Copenhagen. Like if you're some 25-year-old living in a share apartment, how many euros do you think an apartment would be? It really depends where you live. If you live in the center or if you live like, let's say, out in the suburbs somewhere, it can change a lot. If you want to live in the center, it's maybe... At least maybe a thousand euro for a room if you share an apartment. If you want a small apartment, maybe it's 2,000, 3,000 euro. Yeah. But then you can go maybe far out and maybe you pay the half or something. I see. But still there's a lot of money. Yeah. So you can see why so many people want to move to Berlin. I totally understand it. I totally understand it. Definitely. I mean, I just talked to my agent not too long ago, and we talked about it. She just moved there. And I mean, if I was 25 years today and had no kids and, you know, then I wanted to do this kind of career with this music, I would definitely also live here. Was it an option? Like, as you say, if you were like a 25 year old into this music. in the 90s was it common to go and move to another city not to pursue your you know dream not really it's it's because everybody is the whole world is getting more easy to to move around people are traveling all the time it's getting much cheaper and also if you want to go home to Copenhagen yeah it takes 45 minutes and it costs like maybe I paid I think 100 euro a day for return flight to London now it's like what 50 euro or something So it's another time, you know. Yeah, it's not such a huge daunting task to move to another city. think so much about it anymore if you if you see some oh that's a nice festival somewhere where you just you go it's funny like i just wonder if uh because berlin has become so huge if that affected other scenes because so many young people into this music move to berlin to do their parties and try and become a dj that means they're not in their own home city putting on events So it just drains the people, like other cities, of enthusiastic people. I think so. People can see what you can do somewhere else. I mean, also you are sitting here in this office doing RA in Berlin. Yeah, I'm not in Sydney. I don't think you're from Berlin, right? So, I mean, that's a good example also that people are doing what they want to do and they live where they want to live. They have energy and they can see everybody else is trying to do something. You see the same in, I think also, especially Amsterdam. It's amazing what is going on there. Paris also. And Amsterdam is not a big city. It's a very small city. And there are so many things going on also. Like music stuff? Yeah. So what do you think Amsterdam has that other people don't? It's just this music is ingrained in their culture more? Or it's cheap? Because it's also not so cheap. I think it's somewhere in between Berlin and Copenhagen, but I also think it's the city in itself. It's so beautiful. And also maybe it's because it's not that big. Some people also really like that. They can, you know... overviewed very fast if they go there like a tourist and want to see some stuff. You can go to the boat and to the canals and if you like to smoke the big cigarettes you can do that. I mean it's a... I love, I think it's a very nice city. Yeah. So how was the party at Shelter? It was fantastic. Because it's always good to play in Amsterdam. Yeah. People are so into it. Echo Court, 15-year Echo Court show, that was great. So where else were the 15-year parties be? Oh, we've already done a lot. We did one in Tokyo. And we did, of course, Tresor Berlin. Oh, yeah, of course. We did a big one. It was recently. Not that long ago. Actually, I come back and play here 1st of April again, very soon. But yeah, in Cologne, in Gewölbe, yeah, many clubs all over Europe. And how have they been? They've all been very good, all good. And for me it's always nice. One thing is to go and play as a DJ. But when you can do a showcase for your label, it's always something special. You meet your artists from somewhere else in the world and you have this thing together and you can build up something special. People are coming because of the label also, not only because of maybe a bigger DJ than you are going to warm up to anything. I really like the whole thing about doing these showcases. And then I guess the music throughout the night is more likely to have matched together. Exactly. You can control the music the whole night instead of having maybe sometimes some young DJs performing and playing some banging stuff. So does this happen pretty often? It happens, yeah. Because it seems like it's such a cliche that doesn't really happen. But I've asked so many DJs and they're like, yeah, man, it happens. Yeah, it happens. But yeah, Concrete also in Paris and we did many good places so we did Lyon also it was really really great so yeah I'm really happy and we will do a lot of showcases also the next period Is it like a competition to see who's playing the deepest tracks in an echo chord level? But it also really depends why you play. Is it a club for 300 people or is it a club for 1,000 people? You know, it can change a lot. It's like if you're a dub techno guy, you're playing back-to-back with someone. It's not who can play the biggest banger. It's like who can play the deepest. normally the big artist on my label is playing a little bit harder than me like Lucas or Mike Dienert or Deadbeat and stuff So normally I do the warm-up to them and make sure that it's not too crazy before they went off. Yeah, because then you can guarantee that the warm-up is good. Sometimes also playing the very end I did last time in Tresor in the morning. That was also funny because then you can actually take it down again and do your deep stuff because then people are ready for it again. So that's also funny. Do you prefer... closing or warming up? If I can do a very long warm-up set, that's the best thing in the world for me. When I can really play the first record and play maybe three, four hours and I can see when people are coming slowly and build it up. That's my favorite position. That's for sure. So how do you play? Because a warm-up set, everyone knows how it should be. This gentle rising. Like, what is the key? Is it about knowing the different energy levels of the tracks? Exactly. Because some people can do it so perfectly, can't they? Like, you listen to a proper warm-up set and it really is this smooth rise. And maybe it's the most difficult thing to do as a DJ because if you just play primetime, you can just really, like, play your banging stuff. But if you really want to put more and more energy into each track almost, you know, then it's a journey. I guess it really becomes about selection. Yeah, you have to prepare it a lot and to really make sure that you're maybe the first hour still here and then can push it a little bit. Of course, you have your extra records with you. If you suddenly can see a totally full dance floor with hands in the air after half an hour, you have to maybe do something else. It feels really good when it works. It's very special. It gives me still a lot of energy after all these years. So what's the sign that a warm-up set is going well? Like people are... I guess it's like you can see people are into it, but they're not like... Yeah, when you can see... They're just happy with the level that you're on. Yeah, exactly. You can feel it. I mean, if you stand there and you look at people, you can see that... Is it just practice or you teach yourself to think more about the records? I think it's also experience. If you have tried it many times, different places. I mean, it's very different if you play a Dimensions Festival or in a small club in Italy. But yeah, you have to know your records right. And also if it's an echo chord showcase, always try to play as many echo chord records as possible because it is also a little promotion thing, you know. And people also expect that. So it's about knowing your records and knowing how to mix it and when you have to mix it in. And also at the same time, look at the crowd. Do the right thing. Yeah, if you're playing like more... peak time stuff you don't have to mix so delicately maybe it doesn't matter if there are two synths it's true yeah if you do this warm up maybe you have a longer period where both records are running and you know you don't cut it like But it also depends on how you play it. If you play vinyl or you play USB and sync it, some people do that, and then everybody can be a DJ, I think. Yeah, well, the thing I don't like about this USB style, when you see some DJs play, it all basically sounds like one really long track. because the mixes are so like beatmatched so perfectly. I love when you can hear small mistakes. You can actually hear that somebody's working up there. I mean, for me, it's perfect that you can hear something. I mean, it gives some energy also, I think. You've been DJing for so long. What mistakes, what can go wrong with one of your sets? Just a wrong selection? You don't know the track so well? Or, I don't know, what makes you think, oh, damn it, I shouldn't have done that? If you can be maybe getting too much into the party or to the vibe, that maybe the worst thing could be that your record is running out. you know, for example. I mean, I haven't tried it for many years, but I remember I tried it and that's absolutely not funny. People are, I mean, you're standing with your headphones on, you cannot hear anything, you know, and people are just standing there screaming. Oops. Yeah, it's a long time ago I tried it, but of course it can happen. I mean, but otherwise I would say, yeah, it's all fine. But I also prepare my set a lot. I'm not just taking my record back and putting in 100 records. I really try to have my set almost prepared. Of course, I have some extra records in between and see what I can do, but at least I have most of everything ready, especially if it's a place I haven't been before. So when you're packing records, what are you thinking? Are you thinking like, oh, okay. I'm going to pull out this Thor record. I know this goes really good with this deadbeat. I mean, if I played in a club in a weekend and I had a set, a warm-up set that really worked perfectly, let's say a free-out set, and I'm playing in totally another club the weekend after for the first time, I could say, okay, I could try to actually do the same set there and just bring some new records I just got or maybe find five old records up there. put them in as well you know but sometimes it can also be that okay now I'm totally tired of this I just take some a lot of old records and mix them with maybe two new records so it really depends and also if it's an echo chord showcase I maybe find some really old echo chord records and put in yeah so how often do you get to a club and the vinyl setup isn't It's funny because many people ask me that because I also have, of course, all my DJ friends, a lot of them are using the USB stick now and they're always complaining about the setup is bad. The needles are broken or whatever, but maybe I've been lucky. I don't know. Maybe it's because it's really specified in my writer from my agent that this really needs to be ready like fresh needles and this kind of mixer and this kind of turntables and stuff like this. I actually never tried. Of course, you can try to have a needle that is maybe used too much, but then you get a new one. I mean. So maybe I've been lucky, also in the festivals I've been playing. What's the story with funding and CultureBox? Because I remember recently you guys lost funding. Yeah, what is really amazing about living in Copenhagen or in Denmark in general is that maybe it's the same in some countries, but also in many countries that can't do this, is that it's actually possible to try to get some control funding to what you do. It can be all kinds of things. It can be running a theater or a museum. But there are these fundings where you can try to get some support for different things. And in the beginning, we got some money. It was called honoraster. It means you get some money, but you can only use it for artists playing, for paying the artists, not for running the place in general. And can you pay... Is there a rule about who you can pay? Yeah, and how much also. Yeah. Do you pay... just Danish DJs or you also use it for other DJs for abroad? Yeah, but only a small amount you could use for it. So, and after like, it was I think one year, we were so lucky that we could get another kind of money which was for also to support the subrunning the place in general. And that was taken away from CultureBox like last year. So now we are back again to where we were in the beginning, which can be a little difficult because then you don't have this extra money to use for something else. It's totally located to these things. So why did they stop the funding? There was another government, you know, that wanted to support other things. They decided to have some of the cultural money, for example, in Copenhagen or Aarhus, which is the second biggest city, and move them out to the countryside. Because the countryside is getting more and more dead in Denmark, people are moving to the big cities or out of Denmark. So they want to try to put back some energy in the cities or building up a museum or something else, which is stupid because people will not move back because of that. So then there was less money left for Copenhagen, which is crazy. And so I guess a lot of other cultural businesses in Copenhagen also got their funding cut. It was also museums and theaters and everything. But it's stupid to do it, especially now when we have so many, more and more tourists coming to Copenhagen. Copenhagen is growing like crazy. We're building and building apartments a lot. New hotels all the time. It's all covered with people. And then at the same time, you know, they should instead put more money in the city and make more money. And so were lots of other people protesting, like the museums and art galleries? Yeah, there's been a lot of protesting going on. But there's nothing to do about it. But we were lucky, or CultureBox was lucky, to get this other kind of money still, to have some money to pay the artists, which is also... Spence. Bye. you
