My name is Mark Smith, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Detroit's movement festival has become a pilgrimage for dance music heads in North America and beyond. But when the Paxahow production company took over the reins in 2006, the festival's future was anything but certain. In this week's exchange, R.A.'s Matt McDermott speaks to Paxahow's core team about the process of making movement into the celebrated festival it is today. In conversation with Jason Hoover, Jason Clark, Sam Fotis, and Chuck Flask, we hear of Paxahow's roots in Detroit's 90s party scene, the importance of working with the city's artistic community, and the challenges of running one of dance music's defining events. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Paxahow is up next. Hi, my name is Sam Fotis. I'm the Operations Director and I look over city permitting, production, general operations of the event and integrating all of the various departments into the execution, planning and execution phase of the event on site. as well as most of our other large-scale events. My name is Jason Houvar, co-founder with Jason Clark of Paxahow. Our background was producing underground electronic music parties in Detroit in the early 90s, and we started Paxahow around 1998, and we've been producing parties and... other events and music festivals since 2006. My name is Chuck Flask. I'm the talent buyer. I've been buying talent since 2006 with Paxahow. I also manage our club events and talent relations, I guess you would say. Jason Clarke, as Huvar said, started Baxaha with him in '98, creative director. So basically, just anything visual that relates to the festival, I'm either designing it or overseeing the designers who are doing it. Let's start out and speak about the 20th anniversary a little bit. Jason H., would you mind telling me a little bit about PAX 20? It was in Burt's Warehouse Theater, Richie Hodden was DJing, like what was the significance of this event and how did it bring you back to the early days of PAX Ohio? I mean, 20 is a big number and we didn't really start celebrating anniversary parties until four. And it was really because that was a good name for the party that month. And once you do one, then you're kind of hooked. So we've produced one ever since. Richie's been a part of our history since the beginning, and he's participated in a lot of our anniversary parties. And every one of them has had kind of a unique element to it, whether it's the venue, the combination of DJs or producers that we curate, or something visually. And when you get to a number like 20, even though it's kind of a funny thing to look at anniversaries or look at the number in general as being significant, it is. It's just something that's embedded in people's minds, and we want to do something special. So we had done a number of different parties that were at unique venues, or some went later, some went two days long, some had a... you know, dinner element to it. And this one, we really just wanted to get back to basics for a couple of reasons. One, we missed it. And, you know, producing dance parties at clubs and having more festivals go by than we can count, you just naturally will lose touch with kind of where you came from, which is that really deep, dark, late, loud, you know, techno room. And we wanted to do something that was an homage to the past, but also something that we wanted to educate our audience now that had grown with us to something that many, we realized, had never truly experienced. Because they grew up now listening to techno in nightclubs or at music festivals, and they never really heard it in a warehouse setting. So Burt's has always been a favorite venue. We've always wanted to do something there. There was a lot of reasons that we hadn't done anything there yet, but the combination of elements and the availability of Richie and John and Tom, our other friend that helped us with it, it just felt really natural that we should do something like this. And the venue was available in... friendly and we walk through it, you know, introducing two staffs that have worked together as long as our two staffs have can be challenging because everybody has got an idea of this event or events should, you know, execute. We had a unique, you know, set of circumstances that allowed us to. produce this event, make it special. We created a budget that was by no means responsible financially, but it had to happen a certain way. Everybody was in. And we went into it with the right intentions. And fortunately, the event executed exactly as we had hoped for. And the peak moments of that, which happened late at night, really reminded us of not just where we came from and what we missed, but being able to experience through osmosis, you know, the 1,700 people that were there and knowing a fair percentage of them had never experienced a techno party like this before in Detroit was really incredible. And it was a great thing. to experience. It was a fun anniversary to celebrate and recognize that we're still all working together. And we're still all friends. And, you know, the city is still really our closest partner. And it's what makes these events feel so special. And in the past, you said, you know, the ideal setting for this music is a dark room, a police beacon, like an amazing sound system. And, you know, this is what you're getting back to with something like PAX 20. You also mentioned that it sort of brought you back to when you originally fell in love with this music. What were the first dark rooms that inspired you, or the warehouses, or the Packard Plan? When did you fall in love with this music? The Bankel Building and VOOM warehouse parties. And Rishi, you know, those are the real easy targets. I mean, there was a lot of activity that happened in the early 90s in Detroit, but those three things specifically are what sort of woke me up. inspired me to make some life decisions that I'm still inspired by today. Jason Clarke, when did you meet Jason? You know, I started going to parties, I'm from Dayton, Ohio, and then I came to a party in Detroit, and right away you could just tell the difference. In all the Midwest rave culture, everyone was like, oh, the parties in Detroit are the best. So I went, and yeah, it was just dark room, giant sound system, and a couple of lights. So I actually went on the night there was supposed to be a big party at the train station and it got shut down and then there ended up being a party at 1217 where Jason and a bunch of other people lived and that's where we met. We're all downhill from there. Pico's Techno Rebels, he speaks about the blue loft space sort of like laying the roots for Pax Was that the 1217 lot that you're speaking about? And this is like a more like communal living type situation? Or can you describe what was going on there? Yeah, there was, you know, it was a building here in Detroit, a little district called Capitol Park, which at the time was empty. And, you know, one person from our little social group had discovered this building and met this landlord that had all these empty loft spaces. They were like 2,600 square feet apiece, and there were six floors, two on each floor. And he kind of brought it back to the group and was like, you know, we found this building, you know, I've got an opportunity here to fill it up, you know, if anybody's interested. And I think at its peak, we counted 23 residents. And it was, I mean, looking back, it was exactly communal. You know, at the time, it was a bunch of, you know, cowboy kids going down there and, you know. roommates in a spot and ultimately it became a very wired place we had there was a live studio in one place there was two dance floors there was a place that was always a chill out room which was you know mostly my place in the blue loft um you know we had we had different types of people and artists and and promoters and you know they were all living together and ultimately we We began to open the loft building for the most part every weekend. So if there was a warehouse party, we would do the after parties there. And if there were no parties, we would do the whole parties there. And we, you know, get 600 or 700 people through the doors every single weekend. And this went on, you know, for a fair amount of time. I think that that period was so inspiring to everybody that experienced it that looking back and referencing 1217 to a certain generation is always going to get... that sort of lean back eye contact if you were there. And I'm sure that there's other people from other generations and other shows. It's almost like a Woodstock sort of I would probably relate it to in our lives. And there was just a lot of really incredible dance experiences that happened there, a lot of incredible introductions. and most incredible inspirations. Nobody walked out of there the same. And almost everyone that was involved in that property in some level stayed involved with the electronic music community for many years. many years to come. It's interesting, like you were speaking about like this sort of wistful lean back, kind of like misty eyed look. And you sort of got that when Sam, when we were talking about 1217, but do you, do you remember any particular experiences? I just think that we were all incredibly fortunate. I mean that, you know, the, the timeline of the scene here in Detroit has been documented in nauseam and in various different ways. But, you know, there's a, there's a group of us that still stay in communication with each other or are fortunate enough to still be involved in the industry or the scene that recognize the fact that we were able to all exist together, uh, during a, a very strong epoch moment of the scene. Um, where everything was kind of culminating this second wave of artists like Richie and John and all those guys. And it really created a very strong bond. You know, it was those cresting moments of a scene that... you don't, you tend to only read about, like there's very few people that really get to experience them, like the advent of the punk scene in New York or the hippie scene in San Francisco and things of that. When, when these things are, are all of these facets are coming together and creating these magic moments, you know, these. DJs playing together or people dropping, you know, you're dealing with a time when nobody knew the records, nobody had cameras, nobody had phones, you know, it was only like these moments that if you weren't there, you didn't experience them. And if you were there, you had this collective kind of energy of connection with everybody else that was there, right? So it's a very kind of cohesive bond that we have with the people that we are still friends with or even the ones that we don't see very often that were always around back then because the place, 1217, was also kind of the crash pad hostel for kids that came from out of state or out of city when there were big parties. So it was like... everybody was hanging out. That was like kind of the nucleus, the hub where everybody was catching up. And that's where everybody was like exchanging information about what was going on in the scene and their locations and stuff. And this is pre-internet, you know, and, and all of that stuff. So. It was an incredibly human conduit of information exchange. You know, it was personal. It was tactile. It wasn't cold and isolated like everything is via social media now. So by default, those relationships that you had with people were stronger because it was a personal thing instead of through a computer or through a phone or. of those things, you know, and, and we all knew we were, we were experiencing something special, like we could feel it, you know, so it was just, it's a very, you know, sometimes it gets emotional when you think about it because it's, you know, that, uh, it's very hard for things to come together in that way, in a subculture to, to then go on to become a $7 billion, a year industry globally, you know. But I know I'm very thankful that, you know, A, that I met these guys there and B, that I was able to experience that in my lifetime. I don't think a lot of people. really do. And Chuck, was the second wave of Detroit artists in 1217, was being a part of that formative experience for you as well? Well, I didn't know these guys when they were living at 1217, but oddly enough, some of my friends from high school moved into 1217. right around 1996, late '95, early '96, and we would go down there just to hang out with them. And late night we would hear bass or something from the basement. I had no idea what it was, you know, and I asked my friends, I'm like, what is this? You know, every time we're here at like 12 or 2 o'clock in the morning, there's, you know, space. So anyways, they told me to go down there and just say I was friends with the people who lived in, I think it was 2 South or was it 2 North? It wasn't the blue. Blue was on three, so it would have been two. I don't know. It was one of those. Anyways, they lived in there, and they just said, go down there and say you're friends with the people who live here, and they'll let you in. And it was my first electronic music experience. I was still in high school. And it was like, wow, this is crazy. You know, like I've never seen anything like it before. I was going to punk shows and like 404 Willis and random other stuff like that and hippie stuff like Grateful Dead and stuff like that. But this was my first experience. But I didn't even know these guys yet, you know. So it was just kind of weird, you know. But that was my experience with 1217. Because after that it kind of faded away, I think around like '96, right? - Yeah. - So. - And you had met them Well, no, I actually met these guys around, I met Sam earlier, probably around 99. I met Jason and Jason around 2000, randomly, I was DJing. My friend Keith Kemp was friends with these guys, and he said, you should go play on their radio station. They have this internet radio station that they archive all these DJ sets from. from Detroit, you should go play on it. So I got in contact with the guys and they had me over to the radio show in Jason's basement and I played a set down there. And that was the first time really meeting these guys. And then randomly we threw a party where I was living downtown and I invited the guys. Bring your own meat. It was called Bring Your Own Meat. It was a great party. And, you know, I was really like, you know, I really wanted the guys to come, you know. And it was funny because I was hitting up Jason a lot. And he's like, a lot. He was like, bro, he's like, you've called me more than my girlfriend or something like that. So I was like, all right, fine. So I sent him a fax. to the party and ever since then we were just like friends you know they came to the party you know very funny yeah our lives will forever be measured by before chuck and after you know But we started working with each other. Jason asked me, I think it was the second festival, second DMF, and he asked me if I wanted to take pictures and help him out with certain things. And I was like, yeah. And that was, I guess, what would be considered one of my first days on the job. Wow. Yeah. We got a bunch of pictures from that because we used to put a lot of pictures on our website. Yeah, we still have that whole... It was when the digital cameras first were introduced. Yeah. And we could... I mean... He had a really kick-ass camera. You know. It was manual. You had to put two pages in it. It was a lot of pages It was like two megapixels of Canon power shots. And all the first archived pictures on the website are from that. That was when we first started taking photos. There's not a hundred photos from every year before that total because they're all filmed and we didn't have cameras at our parties at all on purpose. And when that came out, we were like, you know, the ability to take an action shot and put up on the web because the web had just kind of been developed and it fit. He was the right man for the time. Yeah, it was great. It was great. It's interesting. There's always been this, drive towards archiving with Paxahow like whether it's photos or I remember when I was first coming to movement I think in maybe like 2007 The friends who brought me are like, yeah, you missed this set here, check it out right here. Or every single set is online within the following months of the festival. And obviously radio was really important to you guys as well in the early days. And why is archiving such a big part of what Pax Ahal does? Well, I can answer for myself, which I made a lot of those decisions early with Jason. I've personally always been a saver. I've accumulated lots of stuff. regardless of what phase I was in. I'd always save and organize toys and then... save and organize family, you know, heirlooms. I really saved and organized t-shirts and it was just an instinctual part of my personality, really. And I've always been sort of a, who's that from that one show, grumpy librarian, you know, I just, I thought it was really important to preserve things and order them. Even when those things were, you know, maybe meaningless to other people at the time. And when we, Jason and I were studying technology and internet technology, pretty front row for a long time. And when MP3 streaming was developed and introduced, we were testing it immediately. We were testing. how it worked, what sort of bandwidth we needed, how the compression of the audio, how it actually worked digitally, how this could potentially function as a tool in our wheelhouse, because we were both coming out of this. sort of the dark ages when parties started to get busted, so there wasn't really a very strong underground scene. We had already made our life's decisions, so there's no going back. And the scene had not evolved into the club community yet, so there was this weird little dark period. And that just happened to be at the exact same time that MP3 streaming was introduced and ultimately Shoutcast and, you know, Winamp. And it all happened within the same year. So, you know, when we first announced the Paxahow project to the world, it was through this medium. And our anniversary that we celebrate is really the anniversary of when we registered Paxahow.com. So we had already been operating sort of in the shadows developing this idea, but that's when we first launched online, and then that fall is when we started broadcasting and we figured out how to broadcast from the basement. So the broadcasting and the archiving were the sort of two phases of the original project. The broadcasting, you know, was something that I mentioned we were working and studying on and testing and, you know, trying to basically be like the pump up the volume of the techno community because that was an inspiring movie. There was a pirate radio station in the UK that was a big inspiration to us that was already... doing it and the fact that you could listen to live music from anywhere in the world on your computer and the music was underground. This was way before licensing or the business got a hold of it. So there was no interrupt. There was no sites getting shut down. I mean, this was just raw access to the feed, which was tapping into that same sort of energy that we were exploring at underground parties. So we just went all in. It was all we were doing. And the archiving was a very natural secondary part because we had the equipment. We were just digitally recording everything, and then we were compressing it. and putting it up on our site in the archive section. And what started as, you know, last week's show or two weeks of shows ultimately became a thousand sets. And that was from parties, the basement, as well as Motor Nightclub. Yeah. And just to get the timeline correct, the period when the underground starts to have some issues in Detroit is like 97. 97, I'd say, was the center year, you know, with a little shoulder. time around it. Yeah, got it. And then 98 Pax Hal begins and then there's the parties that happen in conjunction with the World Cup somewhere in there as well. There was one attempted event in Pontiac that was around the World Cup, but what really changed everything was the opening of Motor Lounge in Hamtramck. That's what brought everybody out of the shadows and put them back on a regular dance floor was Motor. Yeah, got it. And Josh Glazer was booking up there and okay. And then Can you speak about when the EMF starts in 2000? Like, you guys are all in Hart Plaza for that. And did that feel like, I mean, from what I gather, nobody knew what was going to happen, basically. Like, leading right up to the actual event, the permit is pulled the night before. People are setting up all night. And it ends up feeling, from what I understand, fairly triumphant for the scene that is gathered from 1217 into Motor around all these amazing second wave producers who have somehow managed to pull this off in downtown Detroit. Can you describe the event? Like, Chuck, you were there. I was there. It was still, I think, a little pre before knowing these guys because I met them probably right around that time frame. It was right around there. The first photos were. from I don't know that was 2001 so I it was around that time frame that I met you guys but I went it was cool it was like nothing I've ever really seen I never went to a festival before I've been to big concerts and stuff but was never to anything like electronic you know techno DJ stuff And it was cool to check out, you know. It was neat to see, you know, it go down, you know. I thought it was cool. It was cool to see Richie play, you know. Yeah, man, that's deep. Well, I don't know what to really say. You know what I mean? I went. It was cool. It's like you said, I don't think a lot of people really knew what to expect at the time, you know. Pax Ahoy hadn't really We were all still working. I was working in development at the Detroit Institute of Arts, you know, and I was working late that day and I'm like, well, I'll go check it out. You know what I mean? And then you get down there and it's just like, oh, my God, where are all these? people coming you know what I mean so it's one thing to it's kind of a multifaceted thing you know like one thing seeing something that you are passionate about like getting recognition that you feel it always deserved you know and then being a lifelong, you know, born and raised in the city, the city and its cultural influence, getting that recognition as well, you know, was definitely moving and motivational, you know, and I feel, I really feel that that was a catalyst for us as a group. kind of see the viability or the quantification of what we had been kind of pouring all of our energies into after we finished work that day to get together at Jason's house and write proposals and emails and you know what I mean? It was validation that... we had made the right kind of choices. Like there's traction here, you know, and things of that nature, you know. So it was very enlightening, you know, from that aspect. And as Chuck said, I mean, we had been to concerts and stuff like that, but festivals really hadn't existed. And seeing something as multifaceted and complex, you know, at that time, you know. seeing what was possible was pretty cool. I'll just say, too, we were like a night culture. And then to go to this festival and see people during the day, it was just a novel experience. At that point, there was no day parties. That just didn't happen. So A, it's a festival, and B, it's in downtown of the city, and C, it was awesome. That was cool. I mean, it changed everything. It changed a lot of things. Like Jason was saying, we were a night culture. Looking back, a loose network of communication from city to city. We didn't ever have any units of measure in to determine how many people were really part of this global, national, and local community. We just didn't really know. And one of the biggest speculations about... You know, the first festival in 2000 was like, how is this going to work? Like, who, you know, is going to care, you know? And the turnout was quite remarkable, seeing how many people really cared about not just electronic music, music, but cared about making the trip to Detroit. It really changed everything. Especially because back then, a big party was like a thousand people. A huge party was a thousand people. At least here. And so to fill the bowl where The movement stages now is just like something that's somewhat unthinkable before. It had never occurred. I mean, music festivals didn't really exist here. You had Lollapalooza, which was still moving around, and there were no examples of daytime electronic dance festivals at all that anybody had to. reference in the States. There was some stuff going on in Europe, but back then, it's just a different world. You can go over there and visit and check it out, but you never could apply any of that experience to the U.S. before that. And then simultaneous to this, this predates Pax Ahau's involvement with Detroit Electronic Music Festival. It predates the movement brand. But you guys were developing a reputation for throwing club shows that were sort of on a different level than other things that were going on. at the time. Can you speak a little bit about the early 2000s? You had been going for a couple years. Obviously, the advent of death had lit a fire under everyone's asses. What was going on with Pax Ahal? before getting involved with movement? Well, I'll speak briefly. The big difference, you know, I don't even know if the festival was the actual turning point for what is the most significant difference with early Pax Ahal parties compared to later. Packs of Howl parties. But the early ones, we would literally sit and design the event from scratch. So we would identify a venue. We would work together to identify what, you know, talent we wanted to have and who we wanted to play. And we would contact the artist directly and bring the artist over to curate these events. And we were doing between, you know, 10 15 a year for a very long time. The significant shift is when the popularity of the music globally hit a level where agents were made. And then ultimately schedules, which ultimately became touring schedules. So then that communication shifted to where now the calls were incoming rather than outgoing, where, hey, guys, I've got an artist coming over to the U.S., and there's a chance for a U.S. date on this. Does that work for you guys? And they were still very spread out because North America just wasn't ready for what it now has immersed itself in. So that, to me, was the big shift is these were kind of parties. It didn't happen very, very often. We used to do a lot of decoration, unconventional venues, and then when we went to the clubs, we would decorate the clubs so hardly because we didn't have them every single weekend. So if we worked three, four weeks on an event, that was kind of common. So decorating for two or three days was kind of like the way it worked. And then these parties would happen. They were theme related and they were fun and the music was great and they were the closest you could get to an underground party being at a legitimate venue. But they lived somewhere in between where we were and where we are now. Where now things are for the most part, you know, Chuck Fields, you know, agency offers from touring musicians. Yeah. And, you know, we had all kind of one of the underlying themes or connective threads, you know, particularly between Jason. Jason and I was the appreciation of ambient music, you know. So, you know, anything from like AGF to Vladislav DeLay to Biosphere, you know, I mean, these were all people that were. We were trying to fold into the mix, you know, because of our appreciation for them by having them at these, you know, at the events along with Mono Lakes and Chris Leavings and Marcos and things like that. And, you know, it's unfortunate because you just don't see that anymore. I mean, there used to be like a chill out room culture or a facet to the parties here in Detroit, you know. And it was something that we were always kind of wholeheartedly engaged in as seeing it as a necessary facet, as another kind of portion of the scene that deserves appreciation, because these guys are doing amazing, amazing work in music. You should bring the chill-out room back. The chill-out room is slowly coming back. Stephen's doing some parties with the chill-out rooms. They're small, but they're cool. I can't wait. It's interesting for me attending movement. I remember It was maybe 2008, but I think at the time it was probably... the Beatport stage facing the river. And it was like Clark Warner opening at maybe noon or one. Yeah. Yeah. And, and this was like, it was really, it was such a beautiful set and like an ambient techno set. And, um, You know, a few people from Detroit came up to me and they were like, yeah, he is the warm-up guy. And so that was still coming across. We're thinking about the day in this way where we start out with ambient, or even having somebody like Mark Ernestis play earlier in the day or something like that. That's how we typically try to program our stages. It's a little harder now to do a lot of ambient stuff. We love it, you know? But unfortunately, you know, you bring someone to do an ambient set and they're on stage and it's early in the day. So not a lot of people, like, run to it, you know what I mean? And we just started feeling bad for the artist. And then, you know, another stage opens up and it's, you know, it's loud. With the increase in after parties, it became the natural increase in sleep-ins. So, you know, in the very early days of the festival, this was the first thing everybody would do every day in that... then the parties would go to two or three with a few exceptions, and then get up and start the next day. I mean, Saturday at noon, lying down the sidewalk. And like Chuck said, this is the kind of music that we're very fond of, we feel very close to, and putting a lot of effort into something for a limited audience or maybe just not the right time. We think about it a lot. Yeah, we always want to do it. I just think that we would need like a room or like a dome or something to do it. And then there's nowhere to do it on the venue. You know, like that. Sound bleed. There would be sound bleed. And it would be a total buzzkill. Let's talk about Heart Plaza. And... You guys got involved with the festival in 2005. Pax Ahal took over the underground stage. I don't know who would be best for this, actually, but can somebody describe what Hart Plaza looks like to somebody who's never been to Detroit, who's never seen the grounds? That would be Sam. Sam lives there. Sam's got a little address. Um, you know, there, there, there's, there's multiple ways that you could look at it. You know, us having such an inherent or prolonged amount of time there, you know, it's kind of a love hate relationship, you know, um, designed and, you know, by Isamu Noguchi, it is a, you know, the only park in the world that he has had his. hands in on that level and from somebody or a group of people that appreciate architecture and and you know kind of things of that nature i mean we love it you know um but on the other hand it was it was designed in a time where they were not even thinking of multi-use facilities, you know, and the materials and the way it was built and things of that nature are not exactly conducive to the large scale things that have gone on there long before we were in there. Over time, it's taken its toll. I think that there are a few of our patrons that are returning fans. We're very fortunate to have a very enthusiastic fan base that have been to every festival, that have come back. I think maybe they kind of notice it's a little ragged around the edges. But it's, you know, Detroit, everybody's aware Detroit has been through a lot of... to malt from an economic standpoint over the last decade and stuff. And, you know, it's the unfortunate truth that when things like that happen, some of the last things that are put on the list are maintenance and upkeep of facilities like this because of other things that are higher priority, you know. neighborhood services, things of that nature and stuff. So, you know, but we're incredibly fortunate. And I can't stress this enough. Our partnership with the city is so strong. And the people that manage and run the facility have as deep of a passion to make sure that the event. in a happens and happens in a safe manner and that the facility is ready for us you know I mean we've dealt with some obstacles here and there but you know for the most part it is you know the park is almost like like a person that's part of the event you know it is it is that familiar face that you see, you know, no matter what we do in regards to stage design or infrastructure or whatever, it's those, those familiar turns and, and, and radiuses and whatever that for those returning people, it gives them that sense of home with the event. And for the the new fans that come to it it is unlike any other scape you know what i mean it's it's a hard scape place with these amazing monuments and and you know turns and and things and and i feel that the that the magic of the place kind of outweighs the tatterness of it you know And it really becomes like a throbbing heart during that event, for lack of a better metaphor. I mean, there's no, for people that are, you know, true kind of keepers of the history of the music and whatever the significance of... collectively being together within this park in the middle of the city where the music was created, which is why all of these people are here, they get it. You know what I mean? They have these magic moments throughout the weekend where they're like, holy shit, this is really amazing. Um, but yeah, it's, it's, you know, obviously there's things that, that we would love to see happen there, you know, but we'll, we'll take it, man. I mean, we, you know, we love that place. It's, it's our home. I get the sense that Heart Plaza is movement. Movement is Heart Plaza. It's just this association that can't be broken. It was originally designed as an outdoor showroom. They used to have, so in the 80s, They used to have, it was basically, because there's, you know, Detroit is an incredible diaspora of culturals, you know, different cultures. You know, there's Italians, there's Polish, there's Greek, there's, you know, Arab Americans, there's Chaldeans, there's so many. So in the summer, it used to be, every weekend was a different ethnic festival because at the time... sprawl had happened, but a lot of the core ethnic groups that had been around over the generations were still kind of, you know, centered around the churches that kind of were on the outskirts of downtown. So... had the Greek festival in there, you had the Italian festival, and of course, Jazz Fest, which we're also involved with now, you know, started in Hart Plaza in 1980 with the Grand Prix the first year in 1981, which it was actually Formula One, which I wish they would do. That's so sweet. But, you know, and it was really kind of, you know, it was... a community park where these things could happen, you know, and then, you know, it's just obviously Detroit went through its economic things that everybody's aware of and stuff and, and more and more sprawl started happening. So these cultural groups started having their festivals out where their people, you know, kind of moved to, you know, and, um, yeah, that's. I mean, I think it's a typical case of any city or municipality that does not have public transportation of sprawl. You know what I mean? Like, it's kind of that big bang. Everything expands away from the center. And, you know, gems like this end up being left in the wake, kind of. Why did you prefer, Jason, when you guys were given the underground stage in 2005? Like, I believe in another interview you said that's the one that we wanted. We preferred the underground stage. And... Why did you prefer the underground stage? I'm just going to get the stamp back into it after Sam looks on tape voice. I got so relaxed there. Just tell me about Heart Plaza. So the underground stage is the only stage with a cement roof and had that as close to warehouse feeling as possible. It was definitely the orphan of the property. Nobody ever wanted it. Nobody ever really saw the same value that we did only because of our background. The guys that started curating the festival in the beginning and through 2005, had seen some of these global events in other places and were associating some of the outdoor areas a little closer with their vision. So when we had been asked to produce a stage, we put together a proposal. And when it was basically revealed to us that the underground stage is what they were thinking, we were really happy because that, in all of our imaginations and all of our discussions, that's what we were really hoping for. So that was a great moment when we realized we were all working on the same idea. And then we moved in there. That year we kind of brought in as many of our friends in a concentrated form as possible. I think we had a Tronic day, we had a Mutech day. So we reached out to other friends, other promoters, record labels, artists, just to try to do... kind of an all-in-one as much as we could of our history and the kind of music that we were representing, which was different. It was just a different lane than most people. And it was a great success. And I like the weatherproofness of it down there. We like the concrete. We've worked very hard to address the sound reflection over the years. It's always been a favorite. It's a very difficult stage to make sound good, and it's also a very difficult stage to program because if you make it too obscure, it's empty, and if you make it too popular, it's overcrowded. So to get in that... sweet spot, you know, and book proper techno, because down in the pit there is really where the magic happens. You know, Chuck's done a very good job, you know, over as many years as I can count now that, you know, getting the programming down there right. Sam has put the DJ booth now back to where we put it in 2005, which allows for, it's kind of on a balcony there and faces out, allows us to project. project the sound towards the main stage, which is the best sonically. And there's a little utility room back there that's the green room, you know. So when you have someone, especially people that have come from a long way away, there's an area to sit and talk and hang out and put your stuff and, you know, snack and whatnot. But, you know, when we first opened that up for RA, you know, when we started that partnership, I mean, this is relevant to the... of the topic. We hadn't cracked that door open since 2005. And when we opened it up for our eight, because there were so many people coming and we wanted to have a nice hosting room, you know, I don't know if it was Sam called someone on the radio or something or took a picture and sent it to all of us, but the door opened and no one had been in there since us. And all of our stage notes were still on the wall from 2005. Yeah, it was pretty cool. Yeah, so that was a pretty cool moment, and realizing how much time's gone by and how much we love that space and what great use we make. You did a really good job booking that stage. That was one of the last things you booked. Yeah. You did a really good job, Jason. Jason was our original talent buyer. Yeah, he did it. I was really good when we had to deal with artists. Artists, yeah. Agents came along. It was my turn. Yeah, I didn't do so good. So you mentioned that the 2005 underground stage was one of the last. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think that was it. But then, I mean, it's just that there were times. But you mentioned that the lane that you were in sonically, aesthetically, was different from what was going on at DMF as a whole at the time. Can you describe how it differed in some of the acts that sort of... Yeah, it was a techno, IDM sort of, you know, smart guy, you know, kind of programming. I mean, techno used to be, aside from our... Underground events was quite nerdy when it came to being taken seriously in the music business and you know when you know trance which evolved into EDM then even house in a lot of ways started to become more and more popular techno was always this nerdy orphan that you know nobody really completely understood or really wanted to deal with but it was it was more than our passion you know we had already been programmed and and made these decisions and we were wired for it. So, you know, these techno people, you know, all sort of knew each other and had known each other since the early 90s because there weren't that many of us around. And over the years, you know, producers, promoters, you know, alike were all friends. And the different roles. would get defined as time went by and as the relationships evolved into different areas. So we had been working with New York and New Tech and a few guys for a fairly long period of time at this point. These were some of the people that we were. reaching out to and bringing in Detroit for our parties. And these were places that we would go visit as a group, you know, true friends, true family and music based. So when, when we, when we got the opportunity to produce that stage, it was like all hands on deck, you know, and everybody worked really, really hard together. We had badging and branding for everybody and just wanted to make sure that we got as much visibility as possible. We had names for everybody because they were still lesser. Nobody really would know who they were. So we wanted to make sure that when people photographed the sets... They would have that name that they could reference later, you know, because the names were, you know, so not as well known as they are today. Sure. And then 2006, prior to WMC, that's when everything really, really changes. Pax Howell is given the keys to the, keys to Hart Plaza, essentially. Exactly. And then you kind of haven't stopped working since. We're in a nice office on Rosa Parks Boulevard right now. It's a pretty typical office, but where were you working out of at the time, right as you got there? Well, actually, no, we had the Clintdale spot. Yeah, yeah. So in 2004, we saw some guy tacking a for-lease sign up on this old building. I don't know if it was a... It was a print shop. It was an old print shop. And it was a for-lease, for sale. And I remember pulling up and asking him about it. And, I mean, it was an empty building. It was dirty in there. It was like dirt floor in the back, you know. It was people. Yeah. And it was weird, strange, and it was perfect for us. And we just asked the guy. you know, if he'd be willing to entertain unique offers. And he was a very straightforward guy. I remember him saying, like, look, let's just pretend like we just spent two months going back and forth and save us the time. Here's my offer, you know. And it was something that we were able to, you know, through our group of relationships, we were able to strike a deal with the guy and shake hands. And we worked on the place for months. I mean, that's what we were still painting ourselves. I've got a great picture of Sam after a tanning session in there. cleaning the floor. I mean, we just, we, that's a, we get, so we photograph that whole process of tearing it out and rebuilding it. And we were, we were in that building. We had, we had inherited or been given or asked to take some old furniture from a family office. So it looked like a, The back office looked like a car dealership from the 80s or maybe early 90s. And we all had our little cubicles and we put everything together ourselves. It took forever. And it was almost like the universe knew that we needed a home base for what was about to come. Because we were proactively trying to create a professional environment that we could go to every day. We could have real phones and a real address to get mail and a real place we could meet people. We kept the table. There was a print table there that we kept, and we cut it up and made it our conference table. It's still there. It's a shelf now. Yeah, it's a shelf now. So we had our first conference. conference table, all these chairs. We went down to the used furniture place. I don't think that place is still open down here. I don't think so. And I just grabbed a bunch of stuff and put it together and it was just perfect. So the night we got the news, which was our self-imposed deadline we gave to the city, we actually got the news, I remember it was one in the morning before Miami and we were all in there just working like crazy and it was a it was pretty exciting time but I'm very thankful we had that infrastructure. Did Clark Warner came over? Clark was there we had a little cheers. Speaking of Clark. Yeah. And at that point, the city entrusts Toxahow with the festival. It only gave us two months. We had eight weeks. We had met, so just a snapshot, and I don't want to take all the mic time, but I just know the timeline really well. So we had been working for Kevin. And after 2000. I was very clear with him that we wanted to take on a larger role because we could see the festival needed it. And Carl, Derek, and Kevin had all been instrumental in the years prior to us. But you've got to keep in mind, every element of electronic music is growing at the same time. So these guys weren't home anymore. They were traveling and constantly touring. And this, you know, we learned very quickly that the festival was not a part-time job. So I want to say it was pretty late. We worked through the winter. It was probably, I can't remember the month it was, but there was, let's just say early winter, late fall, Kevin decided that he was going to focus his attention on his music career. we didn't have anybody else to work for. It was like February 20th, I remember. Exactly. I was about to go back to Berlin and then Kevin announced his thing. I'm like, oh, I guess I'm sick. So we wrote a letter to the city and got a response. and became part of a vetting process and ultimately a grooming process without even knowing it. We had a really incredible liaison that ultimately became a great friend, very instrumental in training us how to work in a public forum that we had never done before. And we had a deadline of WMC because we needed that event to promote. It came down to the day of when we got the news. And we've been working on it, like you said, full-time ever since. What was the attitude of the city leading up to 2006? Was it like... Cautious. Yeah. Very cautious. Yeah. In the beginning, the size of the event took everybody by surprise. It shaped a lot of personalities and opinions very quickly. By 2003, the city wanted to keep it as closely related to the music culture as possible. But keep in mind, there still aren't really blueprints for this sort of event, especially in Detroit. It just wasn't happening. So it took a very long time to understand the event and understand. the responsibilities and requirements, you know, for the event. And by the time we found ourselves in interviews, um, cautious is, is an understatement. I mean, we were, we were really, really under the microscope for a long time. We were being interviewed and tested daily for eight weeks, which is like going to school, you know? And, um, So it was, but, you know, there's a lot of uncertainty on both sides. I mean, the city and our side during those eight weeks. And ultimately, a decision had to be made because we were out of time. And the city felt we were the best candidates, and we felt that it was the best city. The first year, fortunately, was a success, and everybody was held accountable to their promises, obligations. And then it was immediately after 2006 that the relationship was really solidified. The city needed the festival to happen as well. Can we speak a little bit about downtown and what was going on? in downtown at the time and the importance of movement as this annual economic shot in the arm. Well, I mean, I think that there had always kind of been... It's a little bit of a multifaceted thing, right? Because there's the one part of it is the understanding of the impact globally of this culture that was created in the city and the need to recognize it, you know, that had kind of been established, you know, on the timeline. And then the other thing is the economic impact. As we've alluded to, I think it had been kind of reaching, in the former incarnations of the event, I think it had been kind of reaching the threshold of tolerance because of... different you know inadequacies of various things you know so I think we were kind of reaching that that point to where if it hadn't really kind of made if it hadn't made sense after 2006 I don't know you know what I mean it's yeah you know so because it's it's it's it is a taxation on you know human and physical resources for the city for the police department you know for traffic downtown things of that nature you know so if it's not if it's not you know meeting up to its obligations in regards to you know partners and the city and sponsors and things of that nature then there's it's a law of its diminishing returns you know um So it was that was a whole nother kind of subliminal or subconscious kind of pile of stress that was on us, like understanding the significance of needing to stabilize, stabilize. That was our theme that year, you know, of stabilizing this thing so that it could go on into perpetuity, you know, for the hundreds of thousands of people that had grown to see it as a yearly kind of pilgrimage, you know. These are things that you just wake up at night like, oh, my God. Because you're not even thinking about it until it comes like a javelin into your brain. And, man, that first year was insane. We were doing so much of it on site ourselves, running ice and this and that and whatever. We all wore pants. Yeah. It was 95 degrees. Prayed for a week. No rain, no rain, no rain. All of a sudden we're like, all right, the prayer's getting enhanced next year. It was 95, 96, and 97 were the three days. And it was really hot. Kind of like last year. Yeah, exactly. So, Chuck, to speak a little bit about the cultural significance of movement, obviously our listeners can't see this, but you're wearing a sweatshirt that says, Support Detroit Artists. And, you know, you've spent a lot of time... the years, understanding the second wave, understanding the third, fourth, fifth wave of Detroit artists and navigating a musical ecosystem that's pretty complex, actually. I've heard Detroit called a hater city here and there. And I mean, like... Like, how is this, like, this is your job to sort of, to some extent, be a steward of what's coming up in Detroit's scene for the world, to some extent. Yeah. It's not an easy job to make everybody happy, and you have to learn that you're never going to make everybody happy. You know, we have a lot of great relationships with everybody. You know, I don't think we have that many enemies, I would say. But... Ourselves. Right. But... You know, fortunately, like, you know, you know, we work with a lot of the Detroit artists throughout the year. We work with up and coming artists. We do, you know, work with Carl and Kevin, you know, and Stacy, you know, Stacy's residency here in Detroit. We do a show with him every three months, you know, and he does. really well you know it's great he does better than a lot of people that we bring here you know You know, it's just working with everybody. Communication is key, you know, making sure people understand what we're doing and stuff like that. You know, when it comes to the music that, you know, we're booking, we're trusting in a lot of acts, you know, to keep, you know, developing them here. And, you know, it's pretty neat watching a lot of these acts grow from... you know, being an act that would only do a couple hundred people to now headlining huge festivals all over the world and they're getting paid godly amounts of money and just like all types of stuff and it's crazy you know it's you know techno and this kind of music has only been around for so long it's not like rock and roll or anything like that you know so it's always evolving you know what i mean so it's it's it's a It's a crazy ride, you know? I don't know how to really explain it, you know? I think that we're really inspired by, you know, Detroit artists and what everybody has done to, like, lay out the blueprint of sorts or whatever you would call it, you know? So, you know, a lot of... Detroit artists and local artists are our inspirations when it comes to DJing and stuff like that. It's crazy. I don't know. Some of the Detroit locals here are some of my favorite DJs ever. They're really good. There's a lot of them. This city has probably more DJs than any other city next to Berlin or Amsterdam. Good DJs. They're all really good. You can't be shitty from Detroit because there's so many examples and styles in front of you. If you can't at least get to a starting point, you're not going to ever really get heard. People are real picky here, though. You know, they are really, you know, really opinionated. People really pay attention to music here. So it's not, you can't just bring someone. You know, you have to, like, make sure that it's going to make sense because if it doesn't, either no one will come or we'll lose money or... someone something's gonna lose you know or like the artist will their ego will be bruised or like whatever like who knows you know what i mean but some stuff works here some stuff doesn't you know there's a lot of risks you know so we try really hard to like ride that wave of taking risks and not taking risks at the same time with our events you know and furthermore for movement you have a difficult job in terms of making the nerves happy. Yeah, it's not easy. Yeah. You know, well, you know, ever since the internet came out, you know, and everybody's like on the whole, like, Jane Silent Bob vibes, you know. We've experienced, you know, you book an act and everybody hates that one act. And it can completely, like, mess you up, you know. It completely derails you, you know. We experienced a little bit of that last year. And it was just crazy to us, you know, because technically we sort of almost kind of booked the festival the same way. way, the formula the same way every year, you know, for the most part. Like, you know, we do always kind of look for, we're always looking for new stuff. We're looking for awesome legacy stuff. We're looking for everything. We're trying to make everyone happy. It's a multi-genre festival. You won't hear any, like, rock and roll or nothing like that, obviously. But it's all, like, techno. You don't really, we don't do any EDM, you know. And, like, we dabble with it, like, light EDM, but nothing super EDM-y stuff. Like, we don't do that, you know. And it's really hard. You have to have faith in the artists in some of them, and some are hot, some are not. It's a really weird thing. And we just try to stick to what we feel will make everyone happy. By the way, too, we're following the blueprint of how the festival was done before us. Well, we did. Yeah. We've always, like, paid attention to the way the festival was always curated. You know what I mean? We always have a hip-hop act. We always had... Yeah, we always had... They always had a hip-hop act. They always had this. They had that. You know, there were multiple stages, you know? So it's... Every stage, we book it a certain way, and it kind of flows that way, you know? And... Sometimes I wish we had more room on the plaza to do more stages or do more artists, you know, or have more genres, you know, like I would love to do a bass stage, you know, I would love to do, you know, certain things, but there's not enough room for all that, you know. Yeah, there's about 90 slots, something like that. you know, 85 to 90 slots, something like that. And they fill up really fast. You know, each day is five or six slots per stage, you know. So it fills up really quick, and it's hard to get stuck booking it. You know, it's like playing chess with DJs. You're like, I got to book this, but then I got to book this first. and then I got to book around it. But this needs to make the ultimate sense first, you know, to go and book the things around it. You know what I mean? So there's a lot of, you know, we listen to what people say, you know. We pay attention, you know. We do polls and stuff like that. We keep our hands to the pulse, I guess you would say, like we listen. We pay attention to music. If there's something that we're not familiar with, we pass around the links. We listen to the music. we barely like look at what likes are on Facebook or any of that stuff. It's just like the way that music, you know, reaches out to us. And if, you know, there's like some sort of relationship, whether we know the person or not, like we go after it, you know. And this year worked out really well, I feel. You know, we've got a really, really good run so far with our campaign. And it's not like last year, you know. We, there was always like the joke, oh, you booked Diplo. You know what I mean? And it was crazy, you know? And it was just a big nightmare to deal with. But he came and he had one of the best sets at the festival. And a lot of people came that wouldn't normally go to the festival to see him play. And that's the whole point of a festival is to go and learn new things, learn new music. That's why we used to book Benny Benassi. things like that on the edge. We broke Skrillex there, Pretty Lights, Bass Nectar, you know, Girl Talk played there a couple times. There's like a lot of those weird acts on the side that aren't really techno, but they're in our electronic music scene, and they bring people and they find the underground music. They come to see Pretty Lights that year, but they stumbled across the underground stage. heard some techno that they never heard before and then all of a sudden they're in techno, you know, and they're like Into that, you know just progresses and that's what goes on with our music anyways, it's constantly progressing, you know, so It's interesting how earlier We were speaking about the underground stage and you can't book out that are too big down there. Yeah, and you can't book just ambient and IDM acts that aren't going to draw people. I'm sure Heart Plaza is this sort of equalizing factor for the festival. Does it feel limiting at times? Could you ever envision movement not actually I mean obviously there's movement for Reno but this is a different thing but could you ever imagine like a Detroit movement that didn't happen at our Plaza yeah I mean yeah I mean that's plain That's the other thing that we're always cognizant of in regards to programming is, you know, first and foremost, one of our major directives is safety. And so when we're programming the event and who's on, Chuck and I work very closely in regards to making sure that we're moving or kind of dissecting crowds around the park so that there isn't everybody trying to be. at one place at one time, although it may perceptively seem that way in some instances. But, you know, we could never book somebody where everybody in the park would want to be at that one stage, you know. So and that's one of the reasons why, you know, people are like, oh, conflicts or whatever. It's kind of done strategically on our part so that we keep people moving around, you know, so that they're not all aggregating. in one place. You know, I think that with anything, with any type of municipal facility that has not had a major overhaul within a generation, I think there's an inevitability. I mean, it's just I don't I don't think we would be responsible. if we weren't at least keeping that somewhere in our mind that there's going to be a point at some point in the future where we're either going to have to move because they're redoing the park or, you know what I'm saying? Something like that. So, I mean, we're always kind of shooting ideas here and there, you know, things that we may see or, you know, whatever. I'll keep that close to the vest for now, you know, but it's right here, right here. But it's, yeah, I mean, it's always there. You know what I mean? I wanted to ask you one more question, Sam. I remember attending the festival for the first time, and I believe it was the Made in Detroit stage in 2007. It was like... Fox 88 played there, maybe Matthew Deere. It was when it was in the round. Was it a 10? Oh, it wasn't made in Detroit. Oh, it wasn't made in Detroit? Was it the Underground? stage or was it in a long clear span? Yeah, then that was the time. And I just remember I had pretty much come out as a kid, as a music fan, but somebody who was trying to make sense of what I was into and seeing rhythm and sound and people like that. It was just totally... a formative moment for me, but I remember the sound in that tent was just crazy that year. This was like the way that this music was supposed to be absorbed. And I just, I was living in Pittsburgh at the time. I just never experienced a sound system like that. And can you talk about- It's working. Yeah. So, Sam, you speak about... That's where we came from. Yeah. As Jason and Jason said, I mean, you know, the thing that set us apart, that set Detroit apart in the 90s was where in Toronto and around the Midwest, you had lights and projections and whatever and whatever. In Detroit, it was basically who was going to have the biggest sound system, you know, because back then there wasn't... sound companies that were, you know, kind of lining up to do these parties and whatever. So when we kind of took on the event, that was like a prime operative with us in regards to what we were going to bring to the table, you know, and. 2006, we weren't really able to do it the way that we wanted to because of the time constraints and where we were budgetarily and just the fear we had in being financially irresponsible in regards to that aspect of it. It was decent. It allowed us to do our thing. Once we kind of got our relationship with Thunder Audio, the local company here, and, you know, audio companies never really get told we want... five times more than what we need for the space you know what i mean it's they don't really you know they're always told in a in a in a festival thing what we want coverage you know and and you know whatever and we're just like you need to it's just got a fucking bump you know what i mean and we're very fortunate to have a relationship with them and and when you've got A company like that that is local, that is one of the top five touring audio companies in the country, and their inventory is right here. You get, you know, you get perks like the owner of the company coming down to like tune the PAs. And, you know, because they're they get revved up because they've been in the business for years. And when they see like us, the younger guys, excuse me, compared to them, like all about like louder, louder, louder, clear, clear, clear, you know. And so that's one of the, you know, that's one of the things that we really pride ourselves on is creating that as you had a visceral experience, you know, feeling it, you know, because that that that was the thing. I mean, that is such a major aspect of it is being able to stand on that dance floor and close your eyes and just be. feeling that air pressure being moved, you know, it takes a lot of amplifier power to do that outdoor space. And, you know, a lot of people don't know the science behind it, but they can feel it, you know, and that's what we're trying to do. You know, you don't get that at a lot of other festivals. There's noise ordinances and dB levels and stuff like that and whatever. It's a huge thing for us. So I'm glad that you had that experience because that's exactly the point we're trying to get across when you step onto our footprint. Thank you. *outro music* you
