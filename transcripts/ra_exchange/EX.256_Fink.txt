Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Fink. He's been a Ninja Tune mainstay for nearly two decades, but even if you're familiar with his work, you'll likely be surprised by just how many roles this guy has assumed in the music industry over the years. This wide-ranging chat with our staff writer Carlos Hawthorne touches on the music he made with Amy Winehouse, his connection with Will Saul, and his long-running fascination with nightclubs and dance music. Intersposed with those stories, you'll find plenty of the wisdom and hard truths he's accumulated over his years in music. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. Think, up next on The Exchange. *Dramatic music* I want to start by asking you about your song yesterday was Hard on All of Us, which was recently featured in Selma, the Hollywood film about Martin Luther King Jr.'s March in 1965. Yeah, great honour. I mean, for those who haven't seen the film, it appears towards the end that it's set to real-life footage of King on the march. I mean, what was it like when you watched that scene back for the first time? Yeah, it was really epic, actually. I mean, I didn't actually see the movie when it came out because I was touring And Ava, who's the director of the movie, sent me a link, a super, do you know what I mean? It wasn't like, go to Pirate Bay. It was like, you know, here's like a triple encrypted Mission Impossible link to watch. But it, you know. disappeared after a week and I was in like you know hungry or whatever I didn't see it so I was kind of gutted about that but she told me about the scene in advance and she was just like you know it's this moment where we've we cut for the first time in the movie out of the movie into into footage and then you get that you get that little slot and I was just like dude I just can't believe that I can't believe we're getting that slot over over I mean, Aretha or, you know, or whoever. I mean, dude, really. Once you really like the song, I mean, Ava are kind of mates and I gave her this orchestra record that we did a few years ago just for listening purposes because it was unsinkable because it's all live. You know, you don't ever sync live records generally just for listening purposes. And it just happened to be, I think, at the moment she was starting to... do the screenplay for the movie or something. It was just in her car when she was thinking about it. So I think I just got under her skin and there was no way out after that. And yeah, I actually saw the movie a few months ago at home. And I really, really liked it. And, you know, it's a bit like, I don't know, industry or whatever, but my good friend John Legend, he's next on the movie. He did Glory, the end credits. He won an award. He got an Oscar for it, yeah. And I know he'll love that because he's got a lot of awards, but an Oscar is one that everybody secretly wants and is the only way to get it is an original piece for a movie. That's it, an original composition for a movie. So yesterday came out one of my albums, so it doesn't count, obviously. But he wrote Glory with Common and got the nod on the Oscar, which is great. So, yeah, it was a lovely vibe, man. You know, sometimes... With publishing in my world, the TV stuff is like business to business. Pitching companies pitch your stuff to TV shows and there's millions of TV shows and they all need the same song 40 times a year. Redemption, hope, loss. we made it, all that stuff. But the movie things, it's a totally different vibe. It's much more, who do you know? Not in a horrible way, in a nice way. And I know Ava, she's great. So when she got to direct Selma, it's really not the kind of movie I ever thought I'd get a license to, you know? Yeah, I was really, really super, super chuffed, very proud. And Ava's really cool. It honestly couldn't happen to a nicer director and she's very, very, this isn't like a bring in. This is like, this is, this is her scene, you know, for sure. He's very into that scene and pushing forward the whole kind of agenda in Hollywood, the black Hollywood agenda, in a really good way. So I was very proud of her to get a film like this, really. You're living in Berlin now? Yeah. Have you moved there permanently? I don't know. How long have you been there? I've been there for a year. Is that the first time you've lived there? First time I lived there, not the first time I've been there, obviously, over the years, but it's on everybody's wish list, isn't it? For a couple of years, moved to Berlin. I went there to work with another artist a couple of years ago, an artist called Emeka. And it was winter and she had a cool apartment in the east. And I was there for like a week, day in, day out with Em. And, you know, just... just actually thought, wow, this is actually doable to live here. I do love it here. I had an opportunity, I had to move somewhere, and I thought, why not? So I moved there with two guitars and two bags, and I really, really, really, really... love it. I think it's a bit like Los Angeles in as much as you never think you're going to live there forever. It's a city for young people. It's a city of energetic, wide awake, 24 hour city. So when you love that, you'll love it. But just like kind of other cities, you know, sometimes all of that fun and all of that awesomeness, maybe when your life needs something else, you'll probably move away, you know. I mean, are you someone who still likes to spend their Friday nights on the dance floor? No, never. Always hated that. Always hated dancing. DJs can't dance, we all know that. You know, the DJ's always working, that's what we say, right? So, you know, yeah, DJs who DJed... from birth, never learn how to dance. When did you start DJing? I DJed at college when I was 18. Was that in Leeds? Yeah, in Leeds, yeah. And coming from Bristol, club culture, loved it, big part of it. DJing was quite an avant-garde thing to do. at the time. It wasn't something that you can advertise Nestle with. It was, my parents didn't understand what I was doing, kind of. It was very avant-garde and there wasn't necessarily a career in it back then. I remember when I first saw Sasha play in this club in Leeds, I think it was up your Ronson or something. All of us who were there were like, he got paid. He got paid a thousand pounds to play. And he was like the first. superstar DJ that we'd ever heard of. So you get a thousand pounds for doing a DJ gig. That's... unheard of so that was the early 90s you're in leeds it was a bit long ago yeah it was quite long ago i mean there's a particularly um exciting time for dance music in that city at that time yeah definitely leeds has changed man i mean leeds now my mum and dad were up there a couple of months ago and they took some pictures for me they were just like wow it's all shiny it's all glass and steel now well the great thing about pre-internet dance culture is the fact that every local area had its own scene that was how you stayed connected it really was flyers in record shops kind of thing holding the scene together instead of uh resident advisor telling you what's happening in paris tonight you had to go to the record store in paris to know what was happening and get a flyer so it it meant that every scene was had its own um very unique flavor and any flavors that were brought in from other cities were because someone had gone there or a dj had gone there or played there and been like, oh, you know what's cool about the Paris scene or the Vienna scene or whatever it is? It was all the, it's because they'd been there. So Leeds had its own very distinctive flavour. It was just as confused as everybody else at that time when it came to dance music. You had lots of different clubs catering to lots of different clubbers. Some of them wanted gurney, hardcore, techno, full on, and were looking at the European dance scene for their half. fast stuff other clubs like Hard Times were trying to invent the kind of ooh sexy clubbing thing you know and other clubs like Orbit were trying to do the whole kind of like underground anything can happen thing and it's you kind of You didn't really know what you were going to get when you went clubbing. And because there wasn't such a thing as like superstar DJs at the time, yeah, it was just, it had its very, very, very, it had its own flavor. It was very hard. It was very honest, as northerners are. Very hard, very northern. And they were very proud of their own scene. And they didn't like Londoners coming up and DJing and stuff like that. Were you there for the first Back to Basics parties? Yeah, probably, yeah. I reckon I probably was around that time, 1991. Back to Basics always had these great flyers of this kind of fallen angel kind of idea. It was a really good time to be at college. I mean, it was awesome, and it wasn't a drug thing at all. It really was just a kind of every weekend you were still in the zone where a single record could change the whole scene kind of thing. I'm sure it's still the case, but I'm not so deeply in anymore. But, you know, from memory, you know, you might go to a club and hear a record that completely redefined what you thought dance music was. It could happen any moment. And people making the records. They didn't really have any idea that they were doing that. It just would spark a kind of thing, like that beat would be the thing or that snare or that reference or something like that. I remember when Sub came in, Sub Bass. And it was only really allowed to be born because the rigs were getting bigger and the clubs were getting better and the sound systems, they were thinking about it. It wasn't just like a stack of speakers at one end of the club. It was like, it was a thing. And then all of a sudden you had this sub bass, you had a whole new frequency to play with. And my read on all that was that definitely came out of Berlin and New York, but I could be wrong about that. all of a sudden there were these German records coming out of Frankfurt and Berlin and Hamburg, that if you listen to them on your... on headphones. You heard a whole other layer of sub which you didn't really know what that was for. And then you'd go to a club and you'd hear the sub and be like, there's a whole bass line I didn't even know about. So, yeah, it was good times, man. It was fun going up north and clubbing. And you were DJing in clubs? No, not at that point. It was promoting. We brought a lot of DJs over. I was part of the trip-hop and I went to a lot of clubs. Promoted some nights for students and stuff like that. Did rent parties. I was part of this Rare Groove thing. Rare Groove revival thing. I was really into that. Because you could still go charity shopping and dig. You'd go digging. Buy old funk and jazz Rare Groove records. And then DJ rent parties where you'd do a party in your kitchen and pay your rent with it. It was around that time that you first got involved with Ninja Tune? Yeah, after college, yeah. How did that come about? I sent him a demo, old school style. Sent him a tape. It's wicked. And it's so fucking ninja that they actually listen to the tapes, you know? And they did this series called the One Track Mind series. They had loads of demos coming in from people, and on the demos was one good track, you know? And they were getting really frustrated at having to pass. because they couldn't put two good tracks together. So they did this one-track Mind series, and I was lucky to get, we were lucky, I was in a band at college, we were lucky to get one track on there, a drum and bass track, so I'm playing a big Barry White track. And so we were part of the one-track Mind series, and then I managed to spin that into an album deal, which was great, which gave me a reason there. a reason to buy equipment, buy samplers and think about, I didn't want to make a drum and bass album because I just thought that kind of thing didn't exist. I still really don't think it does, but at least I haven't got one. Oh, well, maybe I have. That's an interesting question. Drum and bass album? Goldie, Timeless. Goldie, okay, there you go, Timeless. Well, absolutely. When we were at college, that came out. That's a great answer. Give me another one. You've got me. I mean, it was all about the labels rather than the album, wasn't it, really? Because Timeless, I bought two copies of Timeless because I thought this is a classic. And listen to it now. It almost isn't drum and bass. It's almost more breakbeat than drum and bass. It was more like labels, you know, labels would do label comps, like Metalheads would do a label comp or V would do a label comp. And that was the album format for Drum and Bass. At home, I got this Ram Records. drum and bass album it's like five pieces of vinyl you know and it's like a box but yeah drum and bass I didn't think was an album thing I didn't think it was a future thing either you know I kept trying to make it but I really lacked the skills to make drum and bass is about is actually a very minimal well I suppose it depends what side of the drum and bass scene you're into but the drum and bass I like is all very restrained very minimal much like minimum house much like minimal tech it's like It's what you don't do that is almost half the gig. But that's got to be deliberately not doing it, not just not doing it because you're just not very good. There is a massive difference between space left deliberately by a genius and space left by someone that hasn't really got any ideas. But yeah, I got into Ninja through that and I managed to spin it into a deal and then I made a trip-up record. After college you worked for various record labels, is that right? Yeah, I did, yeah. That must have given you good insight into the industry. That's exactly why I did it. I knew how the dance world did it. You get some guys in Croydon, smoke loads of skunk, make a record, give us the dat, we'll press the vinyl, get it in the vans, stick it in the shops. You sell 2,000 copies. You press some more. You do it again. It's so easy. It was brilliant. It was like business punk because, you know, the punks were great. Punk changed loads of rules in the business because, one, Majors didn't get it, so they missed it. And two, it was a totally DIY scene. Their own magazines, their own record labels, their own... all their own music, you know, like the Pistols famously stole all their equipment from another band one night, you know. It was real, really punk was punk. And the early dance scene, it felt the same, as in it was, labels were popping up all over the place because a whole generation realised it was, it was dead easy to start a record label. To start a record label, all you had to do was make a record. And then you're a record label. No one knew how the business worked or how to register with PPL or whatever, you know, all that stuff. Obviously, none of them had a clue. And they all learned as they went along and the survivors learned like Ninja tune, like warp. Like they, they, every time they hit a problem, they would work out the fix and be like, that's how universal do that. Or, you know, or like, we don't need a lawyer. And then eventually it's like, shit, man. Now we understand. Stanmore Universal have a whole floor of lawyers. It's like, I knew how the dance scene operated. It was all about shops, mags, you know, that cute chicken, whatever record shop recommending you buy that 12 kind of stuff. It was real basic stuff. But I really did want to know what happened on the other side, behind the doors. How did the Doors do it? How come Branson's got an airline? There must be money in there. Obviously, I know why Mariah Carey sold a lot of copies of All I Want for Christmas. I get that. But how do you actually do it? My speciality at the time was underground music. And so I learned that whole side of things. And at the end of the day, the one lesson I took out from that whole time in the underground all came from one record that I did the work on. It was this Lauryn Hill record called Miseducation. And that didn't come out of nowhere. She was already the lead singer of the biggest band on the planet with the Fugees. So that wasn't like a... oh my god who's this new chick everyone knew who Lauren Hill was but the record was so good for the moment in time that it well didn't need to be hyped I didn't need to do anything as a plugger I just had to send it I had a box of vinyl of her first single, Lost Ones, from America. 25 copies. And obviously I kept a copy because, you know, and my boy Semtex, who I was working with, obviously he grabbed a few for the street team and the pirate guys. But I sent out 10 copies of that record. And from that one 12-inch, I got... like Kiss FM A-list, Choice FM A-list, Radio 1 A-list. It was ridiculous. It was just proof, because the record was awesome. It was just total proof that the music industry is still that honest, I think. If a record is that good, then you kind of don't really need to do much. It just works itself. Much in the same way with Amy Winehouse's second album, Back to Black. You don't need to plug it. Just play it. So I learned loads of lessons, including stuff I kind of thought I already knew, which was an amazing record will sell a million copies. And I still totally believe in that. You mentioned Amy Winehouse there. When did you first meet her? A really good friend of mine, George, was an A&R intern for a record label called S2, who were famous for Terrence Trent Darby and Jamiroquai. and a few others. And George was interning for a kind of A&R genius called Lincoln, who was a real A&R legend. And George knew Amy and knew the voice and Amy needed beats. And George was like, oh, I know a guy who works at Usain to Ninjas, makes beats. And literally, that's how it started. She came over, we made some beats. We listened to a lot of D'Angelo, a lot of Lauryn Hill, a lot of that new soul scene at the time, Jaguar Wright and Jill Scott. And Amy was all about that at the time, really all about D'Angelo. And so we'd take Voodoo, we'd take tracks from Voodoo, the D record from 99. and loop the intro and she'd sing over the top of it and stuff like that to do her early demos. It was cool. We worked together all summer. It was really cool. Is that when you recorded half-time? Yep. Exactly, yep. Having that come out posthumously must have been... Well, listen, dude, the truth of the matter is, you know, I didn't give permission for it to come out. And me and Amy made a deal as friends and I promised I'd never let any of it out. And then I was on tour on the bus and I heard they were doing a posthumous Amy Winehouse record. And I thought, what a crap, what a disgusting idea that is. And I look at the track listing and there's my track on it. At which point, ring up my manager and sort of say, dude, I'm in Vienna or Frankfurt, wherever the hell I am. I've just seen this thing. Could be a thing. What's the deal? He calls them up and they didn't even check if there was a co-writer on it. In fact, I think Salam Remy said he co-wrote it. probably just because it's so old it's from like 2004 or something you know i'm not blaming salam at all but you probably just thought yeah i did loads of them did loads of them probably one of mine But I'm not the head of Ireland and I'm not the parents. So and it all goes to charity, apparently. And good for them. But I know I wasn't overjoyed at that at all. I was perfectly happy to be the guy who never worked with Amy, according to history, because nothing ever came out. I was just part of it. I was there. We made like, there's another five of those in my hard drive. They're never going anywhere. We made a deal, me and Amy, that I would never let them out. And I was determined to be one of the few friends that she had. that never used her as a cash machine, like for real. And I was just about to introduce her to D'Angelo when she passed away, which was a real shame because I know she would have loved that hookup big time and then I'd have been like, sweet golden. So you stayed in touch? A little. a little bit it was very difficult to stay in touch with Amy unless you were in her very immediate vortex of madness you know I didn't like Frank as much as she didn't like Frank but Back to Black felt like a great fit and it was really for everyone it was in her social circle at the time it was great when she put back to blackout because it was like exactly that's the kind of record you could always have made but the first one was a bit uk pop for example the cover of frank the first emmy winehouse album has got amy winehouse on the cover with a little dog wearing a pink dress you kind of go wow that so isn't amy winehouse and exactly now we know amy winehouse is the tattooed beehive train wreck and of course we all knew that in spades we knew it wasn't a good frank wasn't a good fit but it had just enough juice in it i think she got nominated for a mercury out of it as well which had just enough juice to let her do what she wanted on the second one and and ronnie did a mega job of producing that second record i mean he really nailed it like totally nailed it and again you know Salaam Remy's done some amazing records so Frank you know was a good job but Ronnie really nailed Back to Black Reggie was one of the inspirations behind you kind of making that switch over to being a singer songwriter most definitely for sure You know, you work with a singer who doesn't look like Cheryl Cole, but has a voice that compensates. And you kind of cross your fingers that it's like, if this doesn't work, out there. then maybe I'm going to lose a little bit of faith in the whole music thing if this doesn't work. At the time, it was Amy Winehouse versus Joss Stone in a celebrity soul match. And it was like, Joss Stone, I see how that works. And Amy's not that. But if Amy Winehouse didn't work, a lot of us would have felt like quitting. You know what I mean? It's just not worth playing the game anymore if it's that rigged. So it was really inspiring that she would come into my studio in London, just a bedroom studio, and record a few vocals, write a few songs, sing a few bits and pieces, we'd do some beats, and then by the end of the day, we had a song. It wasn't a mystical black science, smoke and mirrors, and only a few people have this, only Lennon and McCartney have the magic. It was as easy as what rhymes with... you know that's when all the doors opened for me because it was like songwriting is just simply about writing a damn song you know and if someone like Amy Winehouse sings it it sounds awesome and how long was the process the kind of transition it took ages man it took ages from Fresh Produce in 2000 Trip Hop Record to Biscuits for Breakfast, Singer-Songwriter record in 2006. I mean, six years between albums. That's a long time. I mean, you're learning a whole craft there. It's a whole new thing, yeah, totally. And also, I wasn't sure what I was doing. I wasn't sure if it was... the right thing but I got I dance music was beginning to really piss me off because it was just so transient and everything moved so fast and I was just getting tired of keeping up with the nowness of it all you know it's like I used to take real pride in spending 20% of my DJ fees on records to play on that night So I'd see what gigs I had in the diary and I'd spend accordingly what I had for the gigs, you know. And we all had this kind of unwritten rule at the time that, you know, we were all on the same mailing list. We were all on Zoltz and Waxworks and I don't know who they are now. But, you know, we were all on the same mailing list with all the record companies. So your set couldn't, every time you played a record that was sent to you that too so it was about giving your set 80 90 not plugged records so you had to go to black market you had to go to uptown you had to go to like well phonica when it first opened you know you'd you'd you'd be crawling around these record shops to find that 90 that the other guy didn't have and it was really cool but i was just getting exhausted from the whole the whole now thing, the whole now vibe. After 10 years of that, I was just knackered. You know, it's relentless, you know, you know that. And it's a young man's thing. It's like the whole kind of like... Thinking a track like and when I was a DJ at the very peak of what I was doing if I heard a track in my set anywhere else on radio or club I would never play it again. It was considered too commercial anything Even if I was playing at a nightclub with another super trendy DJ who was mega cool if he played a track that I had it was gone throw it away it was gone and And that's just just relentless man I used to love going to Soho on a Saturday and just digging and trawling and spending loads of money on 12s and getting them home and being like, you know, seven out of 10 of them would be like awesome. And three would be like. Yeah, it sounded way better in the store kind of stuff. I used to love that. And then one day I just kind of didn't love it anymore. I just saw it as a real pain. And also clubbing was in a really weird spot in 2002 and 2003 and 2004. No one, we couldn't tell what was going to happen next. We'd had breakbeat, we'd had drum and bass, we'd had techno and house. We'd had all the hybrids of all of those mixed in with all of the other, you know, we'd had the orgy of genres. And we were just like, I just couldn't see what was going to happen next. If I was writing a book about my view of it all, it would be like, well, minimal happened. Well, Berlin happened next. In a way, Berlin and New York kind of went, actually, we're going to go back to basics. It's all about drugs and 4- And minimal is a bit of a dirty word these days, but everything needed a reset. There were so many genres, it was just getting ridiculous. And in a way, dance music had splintered into black and white in a lot of ways, especially in London, between, like, Two Step and Garage. And what's the difference between Garage and House? I mean, and so on and so on and so on. And it was just getting a bit random and a bit rampant. I just had to move on. Were you playing quite across the board as a DJ? Well, I was representing for Ninja the dance side of things, and I was representing the urban side. of London as much as it was relevant to a Ninja Tune crowd at the time because I was working in the urban scene for the majors so I would trawl Soho every Friday afternoon for professional reasons which was awesome and I'd go to Uptown, I'd go to Black Market, I'd go to Wild West, I'd go to all the stores so I'd get that. I'd get 138 Trek by Zink the minute it hit black market shelves and I'd get the weird two-step grimy garage stuff that was relevant. It wasn't too bumpy, but this one was more grimy. That would suit the ninjas. Or I'd get that drum and bass track that's almost like stuff I would represent almost a more soulful side of ninja in the clubs without literally playing soul. so I could include a bit of trip-hop, a bit of drum and bass, all these hip-hop instrumentals I could get my hands on. I was really into two-step. I was into anything new and exciting and edgy and bassy. So, yeah, that's what I would go for. And you were booked as a ninja-tuned DJ. Yeah, a lot of pressure in those days on that. Because, like I say, man, it was a bit of a... Well, nobody was quite and two if you'd have said to me in 2012 there'll be no nightclubs left I'd have been like that's an option you know maybe this is it maybe we've all we've hit the wall now who's going to listen to the same shit in 12 years time how wrong we were but I just got the feeling that live music was next not clubbing and I think that wasn't a that isn't true Like in the big picture, that was just true for my personal microcosm. It was like, I'm getting into live music. I want to know how live music works. Now I've learned how the music industry works. So I kind of got into that and that became my journey. And surprise, surprise, I became a live musician sort of five years later. Biscuits for Breakfast was your first record as a singer or songwriter. It was also the label's first record. I mean, were they open-minded to Yeah, they wanted it. They definitely wanted to put out a singer-songwriter record. They just didn't want to sign a singer-songwriter because it was very bandwagon-y, you know, at the time. But because I was already signed, it kind of bypassed the whole, this is just a fashion exercise to sell records, which they were very grateful for. And it was their idea to make it all vocal. I wanted it to be a hybrid, like a... I was really into Zero Seven and Groove Armada and Lemon Jelly and all that stuff at the time. And they were doing production records with guest singers on it. And I thought, that's cool. I'll do that. I'll do a hybrid. But Ninja were like, no, there's no half measures. You either. all or nothing and by the way we don't want another instrumental record so so it's all basically it must have been quite a nerve-wracking time putting that out well I don't know whether it was nerve-wracking well it was anything that's new is interesting right and exciting and I mean for you to be I mean you get nervous before you do a gig in the early days But you don't get nervous whether or not you're going to sell a million records or not. Or even make a living out of it. And if you're used to the judgment of being a DJ and stepping up to a club on a Saturday night in front of 2,000 people and they're all expecting you to give them the greatest night of their life, then you're already used to pressure, judgment. Because sometimes you don't. You know what I mean? And then you've got to walk out and get the plane home. and be like, damn, that sucked, didn't it? Or you read the crowd wrong. Or in those days, you bring the wrong crate, you bring the wrong records with you. I remember I did this one gig in Tel Aviv. I wanted to create a record, so I was playing everything, and nothing was working, nothing was touching, nothing was hitting. And I was like, dude, I'm bombing, I'm bombing, this is terrible. And then I rolled out the drum and bass, which was right at the back, as a just-in-case, like Circles, Adam F., this always works. played it, place went nuts, and then I'm in the drum and bass trap. How much have I got? I had about 25 minutes of drum and bass. I reckon maybe 512s in there. Thank God. Otherwise it would have been a horror. It would have been bombage. So, yeah, I was used to the pressure and I was definitely used to the judgment, you know. And being a singer-songwriter, I was just very pleasantly surprised, to put it mildly. that we got booked, we got gigs, we got a bit of radio, we got just enough to get the ball rolling. We did the gigs, we did the sessions. You know, we wanted it. We really did. And we still want it just as bad now. It's just on a different level. But really, it was... I guess the only thing I was nervous about, I guess, would be everyone's going to say that it's totally shit and that's the end of your music career because you've tried doing the instrumental thing and you've tried doing the singer thing, so I guess you're going to be a record label owner or a marketing dude or, I don't know, find another way, you know. But you never really think like that, otherwise you wouldn't make the record in the first place, in a way. What did you take from being a DJ and producer through to being a live musician? That's a very good question. I took the hypnotic element of dance music, which is a thing. This hypnosis is part of its secret weapon. That's why we like... And that's why the beats that have become... come the beats that we know as just dance beats are the way they are it's because of this kind of linear hypnotic effect that a good 4-4 will have on you you know and and the bpms that that that we play with these days 120 to 120 30 is some there's a reason it's not 170 or 60 it's like that's perfect for this drug at this time for this thing and so yeah that linear thing the fact that the public if you like like us we're perfectly happy to listen to two minutes of one thing if it's totally awesome and It's recognising that and having the courage to do exactly that. Like Radio Slave is a great example of that. His stuff is way minimal. Like, it really is. Not much happens on a Radio Slave track, but everything that does happen, you really want it to happen. It happens at exactly the right time. That hi-hat, lush. That ride, sweet. That kick, just right. You know, all the elements, it's perfect. It's like I don't need to do more than this. It's just the right amount. And so I try and bring a lot of that to the table. I know that as a singer-songwriter, it's all about the song first, and then you can dress it up however you like. And it's the same with dance music. It's all about the rhythm first, or rather the environment within which this will be enjoyed. So first of all, if you want to write a track that's going to rock Berghain to the ground, it would help if you went to Berghain a few times. You know what I mean? You can't like sit at home with Ableton in isolation, read a couple of, read Resident Advisor for a few months and then make that track. unless you're just totally lucky. If you go to Berghain, you'll hear what they listen to. If you still want to make a track that takes Berghain out, then at least you know what you're doing. So the linearness, the hypnotic quality, but I also got that from other bands that I love, especially the Psychedelic Guys, the Floyds and the... Joni Mitchell's and the John Martins and they love setting up a vibe and they're happy to let to get the vibe in there you're in the vibe and they're not gonna they're not gonna drop the ball on you and throw any curveballs in there so a dance music and it's still what I really do love about electronic music is that it gives me something that I can only get from electronic music. It's some kind of cleanliness, some kind of purity of idea, some kind of... And I get all the references because I've been around long enough to know what they're referencing and you know what I mean? And just... So I love it when an electronica... That word's probably not very cool around here anymore, is it? An electronic track happens because when it does happen to you, you listen to it over and I listen to it over and over again. It's the purity of it all that I really, really like. I love what Tom York's done with it too. I think he's been really inspiring over the past couple of years. Did you find the two worlds very different? Yeah, they're totally different. They're completely different. They're nothing like each other. They don't mix, they don't get on, and both sides have no idea. When I tell other bands what DJs earn, they're amazed. They're dumbfounded you can earn two and a half grand for two hours. with a couple of USB sticks. I was absolutely gobsmacked when... I came out of retirement kind of last year because I moved to Berlin, obviously. So within two months, I was playing at Watergate and under a different name with one of my mates. And I said to him, I'm going to need a soundcheck, bro, because I haven't used CDJs in like, you know, dude, I haven't used CDJs since Fabric Room 3 in 2000-something or other. And he's like, dude, honestly, you don't need a soundcheck, bro. really freaking out about it and I'm like dude I definitely need a sound check man I mean dude so we went before the DJ dinner and the CDJ's worked the BPM out for you dude so I'm like Oh, right. I mean, right. I definitely don't need a soundcheck. And my dance guys, my indie guys, my indie friends, my band friends, yeah, they don't realise. But they also don't realise it's not, it never has been and it isn't now as simple as just play loads of dance tunes that you think are really great. That's not how it goes. Every scene has its own rules. regulations, and you cross the lines at your peril. Sometimes it's cool to do it and people are like, oh, that's what makes, you know, whoever better than whoever else. But, you know, you cross the line in the wrong direction and you lose them. That's bad. I mean, to lose a full club at peak time in Berlin, it's dead, dead easy. Because sometimes you might be playing there and you think no one's actually listening to any of this. it anyway well then drop that tune drop a tune that goes wrong and you you you realize people leave they're gone you know don't break it up like don't break up the 4-4. Maybe if they're not into vocals, don't drop a vocal track. But maybe they are into that one track with vocals, like that Bob Moses track. They like that. But they're going to hate that other one with vocals in it that is kind of like that one, but for some reason it hasn't got the same special sauce or whatever. it is. Are you talking from experience there? I'm talking from experience of being in the clubs and witnessing this because I love going to clubs to listen to the music I'm not the guy on the dance floor, definitely not I'm definitely the guy behind the DJ because he's probably an old mate of mine. Really enjoying the fact that I've got a Club PA and the monitors, so I've got the best sound in the house. It's like listening to an awesome record collection of modern stuff on a massive sound system. So, with free beers. So, I'm that guy. I love listening to music at that volume. And you have to listen to dance music in that context, I think, a lot of the times. I mean, you get John Hopkins albums, for example, and all of a sudden you've got a dance album you can listen to at home. That's nice. It's kind of rare that that happens. But I've only ever heard a John Hopkins track played once in a club in Berlin, even though everyone in that club's got the record. and all the DJs know who he is. But it's a club record for home use, you know? So, no, I love going to clubs and seeing which tracks work and which tracks don't, and it does tap right back into that original reason why me and all my other electronic friends started to do it, which was you'd go to a club, you'd hear loads of records. You get totally inspired. You think, oh, I could do that. And you go home and you do it. And then you realize, I can't do that. Why not? It's just... Why can't... Why is Radio Slave infinitely better than me at doing that? But it's just the thing. It's just the fact. I mean, the same year you released Biscuits for Breakfast, you also set up House Music with Will. Sure, yeah. I mean, have you and Will been friends for a long time? Yeah, we've been friends for ages. Not really friends anymore, unfortunately. We had a big fallout last year. But we met when he first came out of college in the music business, and we were mates for like, yeah, for like as soon as he hit We used to DJ together at Marketplace. He set up Simple Records. We did all the early Simple Sounds, mixed CDs. In fact, Amy Winehouse did a drop for us, actually, funnily enough. Yeah, it was really nice. It was a different vibe from the hardcore, intense Ninja Tune thing, where... especially when you DJed in Europe in the 90s, the promoters would just put Ninja Tune on the flyer. It didn't matter that no one had ever heard of you. It would guarantee the club would be full and everyone would be there. And it's up to you to be better than all the locals. And that's quite a lot of pressure sometimes. We'd go play in Budapest or something random. And it's got, think, Ninja Tune on the flyer. And you know the club's full because of Ninja Tune, not because of you. And everyone's waiting to see you do a three-deck, something, the Soleil or something. And it's like, okay. It was like A-game every night. In fact, all of us felt so, we felt the pressure of being on Ninja Tune that it meant something. The label meant something. So if your name was on a flyer, which always was in brackets after your name, you were representing all the other guys on Ninja, whether it was Bonobo or Food or Strictly or Cold Cut or whatever. It was like the label will... Ninja Tune also had one of the first ever forums on their website, which was the first website for a record company ever made. because they're really techie at Ninja. The Ninja Forum was like the healthiest music forum for a company. couple of years before everyone caught up with this so if you did a crap set in Paris that night it would be on the forum the next day it was like the first example of instant grat media and so we were all really paranoid about it because not only was it a great thing to see people's reactions or when you got home you could just go to the ninja forum and see if anyone was talking about your set But if you played a duff mix, they'd say, oh, yeah, the set was really good, but halfway through you mixed a really bad this and... of that and you'd be like oh god everybody noticed that I thought they might have got away with it oh no it was so intense so moving into moving into the game with Will it was just wonderful he he had he was he was one of the reasons I quit DJing to be perfectly honest because I played a fabric night with him and a DJ called Jesse Rose in room I think we were in room three I'm not sure but I was playing a sideshow a little alter egos to avoid all the pressure of ninja and to DJ with Will and him and Jesse just played a perfect inch perfect every hi-hat in the pocket bit of CD bit of vinyl all over the mixer you know all over the all over the faders and the squelches and the algorithms they were all over this mixing desk and I was just using the fader They wouldn't even use the fader. It was just a whole new skill set. And I'd witnessed it a few times, but I'd never actually stood behind it and just kind of gone, you know what, that's just, I can't do that. I've been DJing for years and I can't do that. There'll be a few hi-hats out in my vinyl on vinyl set. And it just made me realize, all right, now it's time to just butt out. and let the kids from Paris coming up from behind, let them just do it, let them take over. It feels like Will has always been the face of house music. Sure. This is his label, man. He's done all the work. So you're not involved with it anymore? No, he started Simple, which was like bangers, club bangers, you know, and we set up house in order to release albums and alternative projects. So Simple was the home for Will's bangers, you know, and Ouse was the home for like the Lee Jones album, his old friend of mine, his sideshow album, which was my side thing, and the weirder, weirder stuff. And just over, naturally over time, Ouse just became more interesting to be with than Simple. Eventually so much so that Ouse got a bigger reputation than Simple because originally the website was Simple Records. and there was a little Ouse logo, but it became pretty apparent that Ouse was definitely generating more interest than Simple. So Simple, I think, slowly sort of backed away from the decks and then through Will's A&R, which was relentlessly on point, he put out loads of records by loads of people that ended up being, you know, people that you'd know. you know, and he did great by that because that's the secret to a record company is putting out records. It just is. The more you put out, the more of a record company you are. And he was just, Will was just determined to release music, just keep doing it. I mean, he wanted a vehicle for his own music too, sure, but he actually loved all the whole A&R side of things and he was really natural at it. He was a natural at it. So yeah, Ouse, it started as an alternative to dance music, but then became dance music, if you know what I mean. Was Sideshow a way for you to keep playing? to kind of reconnect with dance music. Yeah, it definitely was. And a way to decompress from the whole pressure of being a live act. Because that can be quite pressurised sometimes, especially in the writing process. Because you don't release a track every two weeks. You release one album every two years or something. It's a big deal. Those ten tracks have got a lot of pressure on them. We'd often be in the studio and a nice way of releasing the pressure would be I want to make some sideshow stuff, which was this 4-4, but with a dub, Flav, but I've got a band I can play with, so all the beats are live and all the bass lines are live and I can do some guitar stuff and it gives me an excuse to muck about upstairs in my studio and put those delays on stuff. And I honestly thought nobody noticed, like really, nobody noticed. I mean, didn't sell any records, didn't get any radio, and only got press in Europe, so I really just thought it's just a vanity project. But the weirdest thing is that talking to people now... I've put out this, now we're putting out this Horizontalism record, it seems like a lot of people actually did notice it, which is a bit of a bizarre one, because nobody bought it. But then mixing dub with techno was never going to be a sales winner. We knew that, and Will knew that too, I think. I mean, he liked it, he liked everything he puts out for sure, but he wanted Ouse to be albums, he wanted albums. It's not easy to do dance albums. I'm still a very vocal opponent of a dance album. I still think it's the wrong format for dance music. I mean, even like the best dance album I've heard, apart from John Hopkins, which is really good, but that's not really, I don't know, I'd call that more, well, it's EDM, isn't it? There you go. But I mean, even Scuba, who I think has put the most coherent dance albums out in ages on Hot Flush, it's his new set, you know? Even that at times struggles for a second to be an album. It's like eight really good tracks on there, but is it like an album album? Or would you be just as happy with this music if you'd bought it as four? four 12s, or even just downloaded eight out of 30 from the scuba catalogue. I mean, I still think the album format in dance music, it's a bit like dance music or electronic, the electronic music scene is so modern, why are they beholden to a format that's 65, 70 years old? I just don't get it. It's like... Dance music's supposed to be pressed at 45 anyway. You don't have albums that are pressed at 45 unless you do double albums. You know what I mean? It's almost like, why chase the dragon like that for dance guys? Because you're not supposed to be thinking about an album. You're just supposed to be thinking about the next awesome track you make. Yeah, I suppose if the album is kind of expressly aimed at a dance floor, then it becomes a bit complicated. I mean, you can make electronic music albums. Sure. Definitely. But yeah a dance floor album. I mean if you made ten dance floor bangers then You probably wouldn't even be thinking about an album after the after the onslaught after that you only need a couple and you're and you're you know And you're on Resident Advisor and you're on number one and beat port and so on and so on and then that thing starts happening But not on albums, you know, I mean no one goes to Beatport and goes to the album section. They go to the genre and whatever. It's like, yeah, I'm convinced it's not the format for dance music. I mean, you know, dance music though. Electronic music, absolutely. Aphex Twin is an album artist. Square Push is an album artist. His new album's crazy, by the way. Really mind-blowing. Yeah, it's awesome for electronic. music and I think that's what made Immunity such a big record he really he really trod the line like perfectly you know Open Eye Signal is a really cool dance track and the video is amazing but there's loads of moments on the record which allow you to listen to it at home if they were all pumping banging tracks like that it would be a tough listen but they're not so it's It kind of works. I think a lot of artists really grind themselves on the rocks of, I need to do an album because they see themselves as musicians. But in a way, they're something else. Not less than a musician or not as good as a musician, but whatever they are. They're like, when I worked with Emeka, when I was friends with Emeka, she's like a sound architect. You know, she's like a sound designer who works in the field of dance music. I really, I definitely get that. I like that idea much more than I'm a musician. Because a musician can be like a flute player or a cellist. I mean, it'd be hard to even describe, you know, Sean Ryder as a musician. I mean, he's Sean Ryder, you know. I think it's a trap. Like, if you're living on the vanguard, on the cutting edge of technology, and on the cutting edge of what music even means, then there's no reason to say, I'm a musician. You can make up a job title, you know. It's like, because a lot of dance music isn't music. It's more like syncopated moments that you can buy on, you can buy from your music from whatever online portal you like instantaneously. It's not, it's not Mozart. It's not, you know, it's almost like dance music has invented a new genre of. what you put in your ears and you can't really call it music in a way. I mean, Acid House is just beats and good Acid House is just 909, 808 and a 303. And can you really say that that's like music? I mean, the minute you put like a... chord over the top you're like ah I see it's musical but it's like I wonder what Kraftwerk would say about their own music whether they would say we make music I don't know if they I don't know if they would I mean it's all music surely well is I mean is it though let me put it into context of something else let me put it into the context of Athletics, right? Athletics is what, that's like sport, right? So darts players are athletes, are they? You know, snooker players, are they athletes? Not really. They're sportsmen because it's a competition. But it's very difficult to compare Usain Bolt with Rocket Ronnie. They're both awesome at what they do and they're both theoretically sportsmen. But it's music because you absorb it through your ear holes. That's why it's music. Do you know what I mean? This is getting philosophical. Well, it is getting philosophical, but I think dance music could... do with a bit of fucking thought about itself because sometimes it's so brainless you mentioned horizontalism which is a new album as think it's definitely not a typical think record it's not no tell me a bit about the album and the idea behind it well i always wanted to do a remix record i loved horror i loved massive attacks no protection record with mad professor i thought that was really awesome and it gave me gave me another record that i loved protection gave me protection twice, which was, I love that. And I love records from the past, like KLF's Chill Out and Old Mixmaster Morris stuff. And I love the ambient scene from the late 80s, The Orb and people like that. big time because I was there but I also love the abstract guys of Brian Eno albums and you know all that stuff I really do and so when we did this Hard Believer album which was kind of an indie indie folk blues thing I had loads of parts left over from the session guys who sessioned all the electronica elements for me that sounded really awesome and I just Bands like M83 have also opened the gateway for me again to like massive, sprawling, epic. It's like a journey, isn't it, dance music? It's why you can't just dip in and out of it, because there's a reason why that snare sound is cool right now, and because everybody's been on this journey. You're in the scene every week in, week out, so you know all these tiny little moves. that lead to why that's cool this week. You can't just disappear for five years and come back and make dance music like you used to because you're not necessarily going to understand the journey that's gone. Will explain that to me, Will Saw. Because I was frustrated that I didn't... I didn't know why this Alce 12-inch was... He played me a new 12-inch and I was, dude, this is just bollocks. I just don't get it. And he was just like, well, that's because, you know, it's all part of this journey. There's a reason why this is cool this week. And you don't get it because you're not here. You're not part of the game. But yeah, horizontal. Continentalism is like, I always wanted to do a remix album and I had some awesome parts and I'm really getting into ambient stuff. And I started to do some remixes for Hard Blood. for this Hard Believer record. And they were just coming out super ambient, and I was cool with that. And being cool with it meant that I must be wanting to make an ambient record, so I really embraced it. I mean, I'm in Berlin as well, which kind of helps. And the view out of my studio is just desolation and abandoned old factories and graffiti, and, you know, it kind of suits. a modern, a sort of dystopian ambient thing. And there's a couple of original tracks on there, a couple of original songs that are kind of inspired by my experiences of being in Berlin. So I'd definitely say it was my Berlin record. I mean, your music, I think, is very emotional. True. Is it challenging trying to convey that same emotion through electronic music? Yeah, I think it really is. Really, I really think it is. I mean, are you trying to convey that same emotion? I'm trying to convey some. thing not the same emotion no because it comes with a whole different set of baggage music without a song on it comes with a totally different sort of end game. Like, it's got to be emotional, though. All dance music, the good stuff is, has an emotion. But you can't necessarily analyse why or what it makes you feel because there isn't a lyric going, you feel really sad now? And you go, oh, this track makes me feel really sad. But it's something, right? A beat combination with a stab combination or something. It makes you feel something. But I definitely wanted it to be an emotional journey for sure. And I've got some, there's lots of chords and lots of music on my Hard Believer album. So I was able to use the parts to get different emotions out of the same stuff. And the main thing is there's no singing on the remixes. So they're all remixes and I've muted all the vocals pretty much, give or take the odd little bit and piece. So some tracks were impossible. because they're just vocals and guitar on the album, so I can't remix that. And there's no parts, so that one didn't make it. And there are a few that didn't make it because they just weren't very good. I thought they were really good when I did them, but the next morning they turned out to be a complete waste of a weekend. But there's a couple of original songs on there that I... Fall Into The Light, the lead single. I love that song. I went to Panorama Bar for the first time, went to Berghain for the first time. A friend of mine got me in, who's DJing upstairs. Some of my local friends told me when a good time to go would be, out on the weekend, Sunday afternoon is always a good spot, late, late on Sunday for the locals. And I had an amazing time in there. No drugs, nothing. Honestly, this sounds so clichéd, but I didn't need them. Just a couple of beers and Panorama Bar was enough. I left Panorama Bar, didn't have any idea what time of day it was, what time of night, how long I'd been in there. I just had a really immersed... experience. I love the fact there's no cameras. I love the fact there's no phones, no photos. I love the fact that the door policy is extraordinarily tight. So even if you're on the guest list, there's no guarantee. If there's enough beardy dudes in there already, you're not getting in. You know, you won't find an English stag do going on in there. It's not going to happen. First time I tried to go, I couldn't get in. Because of a jumper I was wearing. It was fucking stupid. But then again, I was pissed off, but I was happy that there was still a club. that would just turn you away because they didn't like your jumper. And I just thought, man, that's kind of cool. I don't know. Berghain's one of the greatest nightclubs in the world. I think it is the greatest club in the world for dance music. And my experiences in Panorama Bar and in Berghain have been both extraordinarily challenging, like personally. but also given me loads of faith in dance music and I've seen I've seen sets upstairs in the Panorama Bar where I've just, I've gone, I feel like I used to. I really love that set. The DJ moved from this and did a little journey involved and the crowd are up for the journey. They're not up, they don't need, like, they want a really nice meal. They don't want just Mars Bar, Mars Bar, Mars Bar. You know, they want like a, they're going to be there for six hours. So you've got six hours, You know, it's not about massive dropouts and big kick-ins and everybody knows what's coming. It's, I mean, Nick Hopner's an amazing DJ and he'll give you a beautiful linear deep, but it won't just be stuff from now. It'll be stuff 10 years old, but you wouldn't know. I mean, I just love the guys who play there. So yeah, Falling to the Light is all about that experience as you just fall into the club. let yourself enjoy it. No judgment. The record's coming out on Recouped. Yeah. Which is kind of like your own subsidiary on Ninja Tune. Yeah. I think up until now, it's mostly been your own records, but the idea is to kind of cultivate different artists. Well, when I delivered the Hard Believer album, the latest one, it was just too un-Ninja tune for Ninja Tune to put it out. But we all wanted to keep rolling together, but we just couldn't. It was just, you can't put this Hard Believer record out on the same label that's going to put Actress out in the next month. It just doesn't make any sense anymore. And none of us could argue with that logic, you know what I mean? And so it was either I go sign to somebody else, which I didn't want to do, or we come up with an arrangement. And I've had loads of record labels in my past. I really didn't want another one. But then I got this nice feeling that now's a good time. I wouldn't mind having my own label again. So, yeah, me and my manager, we run it together. And right now it's a way of us keeping our relationship with a wonderful label that we love. Without going through any bullshit, which is lovely. We bypassed the A&R, which is great because we don't have to worry about whether it's Ninja Tune enough to be on. Ninja and it's not very soulful or jazzy anymore so that was the only thing they were clinging to at the previous records we were already definitely not we already stuck out pretty badly but in a way that Bonobo doesn't Bonobo's still got one foot firmly in the electronic world on the dance floor so that means it still makes sense even though he can have singers and moments and try different things things but I think just went too far so this latest record was like a rock record and Ninja were like yes we can't do it So Recouped, yeah, so far it's just me and stuff that I'm doing. But it's also an avenue for anyone in the band to do whatever they want and put it out. And we're looking and developing and looking to sign bands that we think are relevant. And we've got a war chest to do it. But it's just about finding the right people. Why do you think you've stuck with Ninja Tune for so long? Because I think you want in an industry which is just so, where the personnel turntable is so intensely. it's bewildering. It's absolutely glorious to be mates with my CEO because the same guy that I signed to in 97 is still the CEO. I mean, I can talk to Peter. He's been talking me down from throwing my toys out of the pram for like 15, I don't know, almost 20 years. I love that guy. You know, if you can't sell records and you're signed to Ninja Tune, you know, the problem isn't the record company, it's you. You know what I mean? And I like that. I like that. And if I said to Ninja, this record is the best record that you've ever heard in your life. It's going to win eight Grammys and sell a million copies. If they believed it would, they'd go for it. If they were like, you know what, dude, it totally They totally would for any of their artists. If Bonobo delivered a record tomorrow that was as good as the White album, Ninja would sell the office to make that happen. They really would. It's like there's a lot of loyalty and a lot of love. And, you know, I wish all my friends that were signed to labels had what I had. sometimes I wish I had their car or their house or their studio because their advance from that record company or the other was jaw-dropping but then I also know they'll never see another check so I hope they spent that wisely Ninja Tune is like about low advances so you make profit and you get your profit which is great but if you don't sell any records you don't get any profit but why are you in this game anyway? If you're in it for the profit, you should sign to Universal. You should make a record like Disclosure and do a label deal with Polly Warner, Uni, Sony, Dore. It doesn't matter. If you're in it for the money, you're definitely in the wrong spot. But in a really weird roundabout way. The minute you don't care about making money will be the minute you start making it. And the minute you don't care about whether or not you get a radio playlist will be the exact moment you make a record that gets it. And it's just like being, the minute when you're single. the minute when you're single, when you actually go, you know what? I'm actually cool with being single. I'm actually quite happy to be single. That night you'll meet a girl. It's mental, but it's so true. And it's definitely true with money. The minute you don't care, money can buy you loads of things, but like real happiness. I suppose if being super rich makes you really happy, then money can buy you happiness. If a yellow Ferrari makes you really happy and you buy one, lucky you. I'm glad. Lucky you that you're so simple. I wish I was that simple. I really do. I remember when I started being a singer-songwriter, I was so broke, so unfathomably broke, that I had to become at peace with the fact that I was poor, done. And I was poor because I was really into music. I got a room full of records. I bought all of these, you know what I mean? That's one of the reasons I'm poor. And I've got a room full of equipment that's all out of date now. a couple of guitars and that's another reason why I'm poor. But I was really happy, like truly really happy because I was writing songs and singing songs and doing gigs to 100 people and they were clapping and I was so happy with that. I was happy to be poor. I loved it. And actually I've been happy ever since. Something about just doing it for the sake of doing it, it was kind of the point, but deep down I guess it wasn't until the moment. that it actually was, which was the moment when it was like, there's no money in it, no one's gonna buy it, it's just about you, and if you enjoy doing it, then good for you. You're back working with Lee Jones. I am. It's quantum entanglement. I am, dude. I totally am. I love that guy. Because you guys are working together on EVA. Man, we go back to cassettes. Right. I mean, we mastered a couple of tracks on our first album off cassette. Man, we go back to the Korg M1 and the Alesis D4. I mean, we're back in the day. We did our... first tracks on an Atari 520 that's 520k ladies and gentlemen not even 520 meg I mean yeah me and Lee go back way back in fact he kind of he definitely contributed in ruining my life because he got me into making music so yeah it's all his fault and what's the what's the deal with quantum entanglement The deal is I did a track for Ouse. Will wasn't that into it, to be fair. But I thought it was really cool. But Will wasn't into it and I didn't have another track. So that's the end of that. And it was lying around for a while. And then randomly I thought, oh, you know what? I'll ask Lee to do a remake. I can't remember what it was for, but it was for something. I sort of reached out to my old mate Lee, he's in Berlin, trendy DJ, all that stuff, and said, dude, I need a remix of this track, but there's no parts. I was on tour, I didn't have any access to my hard drive at that time, I wasn't mobile. And so I just sent him the track. and said, here's a track, but I need a remix of it. And in true dance music style, within five minutes, it re-sent over the remix. And it was like, it was an awesome cover of this track, because he didn't have any parts to do it. But it's very bassline driven, so he had to redo his own bassline. And we put the two together, and if you had never heard of either one, you wouldn't know which one came first. You really wouldn't. You wouldn't know which was a remix and which was the original because there's no... It was really cool. And we're both kind of geeky into our geeky physics shit. So Quantum Entanglement just made total sense. Like two things... It's like an entanglement of styles, but you're never going to know which side came first. So with a lot of referencing to 90s 12-inches and old rave records that I've got that I really like. And nothing is sacred. Our second single was a cover of Acid Thunder by Fast Eddie, one of the holy grails of acid. house but you know I don't care well you know the number of people who actually know that track is dwindling like with age and yet when you hear that hear our version in a club in Berlin on a Saturday night everyone's loving it and no one knows it no one knows that Fast Eddie put that out and you know 1980 whatever it's only some graying old geezer would know that and I wanted to reintroduce the track to a whole other generation of clubbers we did that we did another the B-side has got a bass line from an old Beltram R&S 12 direct Technogon Mad because the bass line's wicked and no one's going to play Technogon Mad it's too ravey but the bass line's brilliant and So we did that. And it's kind of all about reinterpreting maybe classics. I mean, there are a few holy grails that we probably wouldn't touch. Like the other day I was mucking about in the studio on an electronic tip and I nicked the bass line from Babylon by... Meat Beat Manifesto, which goes... I thought, yeah, I'll nick that bass line. And I realised, actually, that's too sacred. You can't nick that bass line. But... Yeah, Quantum Entanglement. We've been talking about doing an album. He's a busy man, Lee Jones. He's got his own album. He's got another record he's working on. He's really detailed and he's like a textural tone poet. He's not just banging them out for Saturday night. And that, in some respects, makes him so interesting as an artist, but also because he doesn't release a lot of music makes it quite frustrating. because he plays you a lot of amazing music in a studio and you go, oh, dude, this is awesome. Oh, my God. And he'll play it in his sets and tear the roof off. But it'll never come out. In a couple of weeks' time, he'll go, oh, no, dude, it's not happy with it. Oh, this beat's a bit whacky. And it'll just be gone. kind of Lee Jones has a lot of people who think his music is really awesome but you've kind of got to be like next to him to hear it yeah he's a great guy he's lovely to reconnect what's it like being back in the clubs and DJing again it's cool in some respects yeah it's nice I mean DJing not so much I'm not I did it a bit last year as Quantum Entanglement And we did some peak time stuff. We played ADE in Amsterdam, Studio 80. And we did some, you know, did loads of clubs in Berlin and stuff like that. And I don't know if I'm going to do any more DJing. It's really nice to be in. It's really nice to go clubbing again. And Berlin is kind of, in a way, you're spoilt for choice because it's the best place to go and see, get to go and hear a load of techno if you want world and certainly after living all over the place living in Berlin is the only place where I've lived where I've thought I actually want to go to a club and hear a DJ which I hadn't actually even wanted not even a little bit for 10 years and then I get to Berlin and and Lee or one of my mates will say oh dude you should come down tonight I'm playing at so and so and you go down there and you kind of have a good time and you're kind of like oh yeah okay yeah okay I kind of like it some nights are better than others my favourite set Sven Veik did a great set at Watergate all vinyl really interesting clubbers packed full of beautiful people. It was brilliant. Really killer. He played Open Eye Signal. There's times I go to Burgheim to see a DJ that I really like, or, you know, you guys or someone has said, oh, this guy's amazing, you should check him out. Martin at Panorama Bar was really, really interesting. Margaret de Gas, really, really cool. And Nick Hopner and all that lot of amazing DJs. Yeah, I mean, there's a difference between the Saturday night, let's have a party stuff. And that's really interesting. Let's stroke our beards stuff. And I guess I'm definitely in the latter. I'm not that bothered about. you know, girls, girls in free, you know, kind of clubbing. I'm much more into the kind of like, I hope I'm not the. oldest guy there kind of clubbing like I'm not there for any other reason I'm there for the music you know and sometimes that makes you in the minority in a club sometimes it really does but and that's cool too you know I mean when I was 20 I didn't go to the club just for the music I went for all the other stuff now I think it's definitely like I love going clubbing finding a little dark spot preferably near the monitors of the DJ so I can hear it in decent quality and just chilling and just listening to what they're playing. *music* ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ you
