Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. In the early days of techno, Marco Carollo was among a select few in southern Italy caught by the genre. Talo Disco and House were the sound of the region, but it never really appealed to the Neapolitan DJ producer. He instead helped to create his own techno scene there by learning how to produce the music from Detroit and the UK that was so important to him. inspiring to him. Eventually Naples became too small for his ambitions and Carolla moved on to Frankfurt, one of techno's hubs in the early aughts. It was there that his aims turned international and his sound began to mature away from harder techno toward a sleeker, more minimal one. Ever since, his ascent has been steady. legendary three-deck sets throughout the aughts, a fabric mix in 2007, and a full-length on Plus 8 last year. One of the biggest reasons for his success, however, is the island of Ibiza, where he was an integral part of Sven Veith's Cocoon Knights for many years. Carolla broke off to go solo in 2012 with an event called Music On, and its enormous numbers reconfirmed his standing as one of techno's most popular names. We caught up with Carolla earlier this month in London to chat about the impact of Ibiza on his career, his Italian roots, and his non-stop touring schedule. We're in London right now with you and you moved to London at a certain point. You were living here in 2001, was it? Yeah, a few years ago. I was here for three years. And what prompted that move? You moved from France to come here. Well, because I had to leave Naples, Italy at that time and I moved to Frankfurt. I had to leave because in those days, years Italy was really like a house music country. There was not much knowledge about techno at the time. In Napoli there was a lot, but it was kind of like an island musically. And I needed more. contact with the producers and people that was more into my style of music. It was tough for me to live in Frankfurt because I'm Italian. How was your German? You know, music-wise, party, business, I understood, you know, so many things. But then we also have a life, you know, and it was really difficult. for me because first of all I didn't really learn German. I tried, I went to school but it wasn't my thing. And I mean Frankfurt is not many people actually moving to Frankfurt from around the world. So it was really like Germany, 100%. food and weather for me wasn't easy. So I decided to move to London because I could still be involved in the music industry in a way, with friends and other techno producers. But, you know, still have a little bit of international touch with, you know, my friends, Italian living there. It was like in between, you know, like music and a little bit of, you know, nice old friends. And I stayed there for three years. Frankfurt seems, you said in an interview around the time of your last album, that Frankfurt was really important for you in learning that. music can be more artful it doesn't have to be all about just selling records you can make music because it feels good yeah no no well this there was like uh uh something like i had always in my mind uh in the years i was growing and living in italy that like there was a mentality behind production that was about numbers. Always there was a number attached to what you were doing and with this kind of mentality you don't really open yourself in producing a track. You think more of the number you want to do and basically based on this number, then you produce a record. But if you think this way, then you won't make arts. You try to copy... something that's actually already working. Who was it in Frankfurt that kind of you were hanging out with, the kind of talk of these things, or have these lessons sink in? Honestly, Frankfurt, like the Neuton, the distribution. There's this record distribution called Noiton, and there were so many producers of today that were working in the warehouse. Like Ricardo Villalobos, I met him there. There was all the Robert Johnson crew, Joanna Saylor, Anthony Roth. Everybody was like a big family. everybody from Frankfurt was hanging out there or for work or for getting promos. It was a really cool experience. Also for me to go in this huge warehouse and every day trying to find special records. Of course, when my friends DJ were coming from Napoli, we were going crazy. It was like really special moments. So it was, of course, it was important. Frankfurt, I learned so many things. It was much easier to work. Also international contacts. Italy at that time was really, when all the disco in the house, Italian explosion was over, was really dark. We had a really dark period at that time. Tell me about, you said though that Naples was an island, that there was a techno scene, that obviously you had a huge part in building up. Why was this area much different to the other places in Italy? Well, I think it's for our culture. We kind of, it's a kind of city where people learn stuff from the street. We don't used to trust other people. We made our own ideas and concept. and it was also with the music like in north of italy there was a lot of money involved in the industry a lot of people advertising party dj and they were making a lot of money so they didn't even need to bring guests they they had their own circle of resident dj so it was kind of like the music was growing really really slow because they they had uh already everything they needed so and there's There was no outward looking. Exactly. Even like a record in Italy was selling so much, if it was big, they probably even tried to melt with other markets. But in Napoli, we kind of, we didn't see all this. We didn't trust magazines or believe on, you know, what they were advertising. And so we tried, you know, to import the promoters. We really bring... or American, German, English DJs. We made our own music culture. And from this, then it started to develop. But we were almost the only one at the time. Tell me about Kiss Kiss. Well, Kiss Kiss was my second home. probably the most famous club in Napoli. It's never really been an underground club, but still they were open probably seven days a week with different style of music. The son of the owner was my best friend. We were like 12. So since I was 12, I was living in a club. Evening, day and night. Well, day, don't tell my mother. Then, I mean, and today it's also like a really big radio in Italy. It was a radio. So also I was in the recording studio and already DJ at that time. They had three timetables and sampler adding stuff to mix. So I was like really technically I was. really forward and I was always impressed you know what they were doing the DJs and when I was 15 they sold the time they was there then I bought it for fun you said it was published in a bio that two names that I find interesting Robert Hood and Billy Nasty it would seem that those were two guys that made a really big impact on you, at least seeing them play. Well, no, like, let's say that Billy was one of the first to bring a young techno DJ to London playing. I was like, first time I came here was with Adam Beyer. We did The End. It was the same day I discovered Red Bull. It was like, it was, I mean, really... special moments and of course when you I was probably 20 I don't know 21 I don't know but you know and to come and you know playing at the end the age and was an amazing experience amazing party so You know, it's always musically, I cannot really say there was someone that, you know, made me change my point of view with music. It was always, you know, like gradually. It does seem like that you guys created something and that there wasn't a lot of from the outside world. Who were the people that you were hanging out with in Naples that were helping create this world back in the 90s when you were starting out? Well, there was probably, I think, ourselves. Not really, no one, to be honest. I think one of the most brave thing I did in my life is to start a career without having not just anyone helping me. but not even one example of a DJ or a techno producer living, that could live on this. So I really... you know, like was jumping, let's say, in a black hole and no, I could never, you know, think of, you know, to become a... worldwide DJ was was impossible probably my dream was become famous in in Naples like not even DJ from Naples that we were like famous in Italy because we didn't have the the media the the the the press or someone that could really push us and play outside the city. So in a way, then when I started selling records around the world, it was for me something I could never... was you know was possible at that time was it immediate that you know techno wow we've been waiting for this or did it take a long time for audiences in the clubs that you were playing that locally to understand it? - No, it was, I mean, let's say Paris in Italy is being huge. It is huge, even today. It's like a lot of people go. go to dance and listen to different kind of music. Probably today, with more international acts, like a lot of people knows about this, it's always been like this. Probably with other style of music. Even though if we were experimenting with techno, there were still people going to clubs and dancing. This has never been the problem. The problem was exporting Napolitan artists' music outside of Napoli, outside of Italy. That was never done before. And when I released my first record on my first label, Design Music, and we had Noiton distributing the record. So it was Noiton had worldwide channels. So I started selling worldwide. And this was something incredible. It was never done before for like Italian techno. You said, though, that you just, I mean, one of your early goals was to be famous in Naples. You know, what made you think? man I have to get distribution at Noitone like this has to become an international thing yeah well the story I mean I did a few productions and one of the things we were talking before was the mentality behind the Production in Italy was only about numbers. And then when I went to Frankfurt and I started to talk to producers and people selling records, it was like, Marco, you have to produce what you like. You don't have to think of selling how much you sell. Once you can... express yourself then you you can make you know like good music and uh it kind of shocked me like there's someone in in the industry could actually uh tell me something like this make what you like you know so i start don't start from other things start from your heart so when i did this my label i knew that i couldn't sell my stuff in italy i knew that italy wasn't ready so i had to find a distributor that you know was ready at the channel you know to distribute my sound So that's why I was kind of sending records all around. And I mean, they really believed in me from the beginning. And when they start to press the first probably thousand copies, and they call me after one week, say, wait, we need 5,000 more. It's like, what? And so really opened so many doors. Also with all my friends, they also find the possibility to live. with that you know making music and be dj uh so many friends of mine they really start to put everything they had in the into the production and and the dj before we leave italy uh what were the big clubs that you were playing at before you moved to frankfurt what because for someone like myself we know fab Yeah, well, we come from Naples, we come from a different concept. It's nothing to do with the club. It's everything to do with the promoter. I think it's because a club is not really well organized to have people going there just for the name of the club or the organization. So promoters, they were really the one bringing the people. liquor in the club or like the sound system because no club had like probably a proper sound system for our sound so was no club was the the promoter changing club and uh doing uh their own party so I cannot mention any club because there were many but no one of them could, you know, had the history of being... So you say promoter names rather than... Yeah, like, yeah, promoter names, yes. Like, a few of them. Interesting. So you eventually felt like you had done as much as you could do in Naples. This is like 98... or so you moved to Frankfurt you're making music you're traveling a lot more because the airport there is a huge hub yeah of course it was another reason why I moved to Frankfurt because of course living in Naples was a disaster with connection and you know all the flights and Alitalia, I'm sorry, but, you know, sucks. And all this and, of course, moving to Frankfurt was like a big help on, you know, saving a lot of time and less stress traveling. Do you feel like there was a particular release or thing around that time that really vaulted you to another level? Probably the first one, the main train, the first release on InDesign Music was the one that really opened all my doors. What doors did it open? All the people started to know me outside my city. You know, as a DJ and as a producer. And probably at that time it was much easier to get known. with few records than today. Of course, there were not so many producers like today at that time. What does that release sound like in your mind? What were you trying to do with it? Ah, like myself, really myself. But was it much harder than something you would have produced like on your last album? Was it... very melodic no no no it was still like really kind of funky tribal was you know was probably the new thing you know the new guy that you know kind of explode I don't really know why you know it's like every time you make a production for you it's like you're a new kid I love all of them but then it's the people decide which one is special or not I guess I'm just trying to get a feel for who were your contemporaries and what your sound, where it fell within the techno scene at the time. Yeah, well, for sure, Jeff Mills was one of the producers I liked the most. But again, there was not really one producer or one record that made me change my point of view or my style. It was always, you know, I was always getting input from everything I was listening and also I was traveling a lot. and buying a lot of records. I mean, my production, of course, it's a result from my DJ style. I make record to be. played and I was making records to play them. So this was my, this is my vision behind a record. Have you ever made records not to play? A few tracks. A few tracks. But not much. Are there any that you can remember? I mean, I'm not saying that they're not playable, but some of the stuff on your album in 2001 was definitely different than the things I'd heard before from you. No, I was always trying to... It's not easy for me to forget I'm a DJ when I'm in music. It's too much in my blood. And of course, what is difficult today is to find some... spare time between all these gigs and you have a few days to be in the studio and it's not easy to be clear and start doing something completely different. I mean, in a way you want to use your time. with what you can do best. I really probably need a lot of time off to start something completely different in the studio, clear my mind from everything, which I would like to do, to be honest. to make a stop and start something new. But of course, always changing is not easy. You once said that production, it's kind of like exercise. You need to flex. that muscle constantly rather than going in every three years or something and knocking out an album otherwise you might lose the plot so to speak by that point no no of course i mean uh at the beginning after a few months like now i did my season in ibiza was out you know for many months and really concentrating a lot on my DJ set. concentrating only on my DJ set. Then now, like, when I go back in the studio, I almost don't remember what to press. It's like, remember, you know, stuff where you, when you do everyday things, then it comes, like, really easy and fast, and after a few months, you kind of forget, and you need... few days at least to start you know technically do what you were doing and then you need a lot more concentration and time to start really to have your brain free for anything else and start to produce what you really like. Your first proper album, Open Systems, right? Did you record all that in Frankfurt? before you left? Because I know it got released around the time that you moved. No, it was between Frankfurt and London. Okay. Also London, yeah. Tell me about that album. It got voted, like, on the Groove magazine number one album of the year. Well, no, it was, I mean, of course... It's a lot of work to make an album and I was kind of making, like doing, I knew there was an album, I knew I was producing an album so I was kind of making all different. tracks and different style of what I was playing and listening to at home and put them together in this album and nothing, not really much to talk about, it's just after this album, so many they were playing the dance tracks. But I knew that to do something really different, you really need much more time. if you want to do something that you've never done before. You said around the time of this last album that you weren't exactly happy with how cohesive it was, the first album. Yeah, well, the concept unified. the music wasn't really there. There was music to be played, some music to listen to. The only concept was that I was doing everything I loved. But as an album that you listen to the first track to the last, it didn't really make sense at that time. So this is what I wanted to do. with my last album, it was making sense to listen to all things. You said it took you a long time to come up with that concept, to feel comfortable with something. Yeah, of course. I mean, again, to make an album and travel and DJ is probably one of the most difficult things you can do, especially now where music is going too fast. people start to appreciate less. Not because they don't like the music. I always make this example. Like when you first were going in a movie theater and you were seeing the first special effect. You were amazed. Now, today, after you've seen thousands of them, You see like an amazing movie and you're not impressed anymore because you're used to this. And also you're used to good music. So it won't impress you anymore because you're used to change and renovate and all possible sounds will probably be made and to have something that impresses you, the new, you know, it's really different from... other thing you're listening before, it's really difficult. So probably criticism on music is really hard today because the... People still... It's not easy to impress. And think of a DJ worldwide known, traveling every day and going to the studio and making an album and impress people. It's a miracle. I just want to do good music and make people happy. That's it. Another difficult thing you've said over the years is somehow translating what you do as a DJ to the mix CD format. It seemed like a long time you didn't even want to try. And like with the Fabric CD, they finally, someone convinced you or you convinced yourself that you could do it. Why at that time did you think now's the moment? Was it just that Fabric was the one that asked you? No, because honestly... When I do like, my music was really, was much harder at the beginning. And I would listen to my music in the club, but I wouldn't listen to my music at home. And I know when you make a mix CD, you listen home. And I think my music wasn't fitting in a mix CD when I started DJing. And when Fabric asked me to do my first mix CD, then... I thought that with the music I was playing at the time was actually the right time to do something that could represent me as a DJ in a club, but you could still listen to this music everywhere else. When did you make the jump from hard to not? so hard well was uh was more like uh stairs there was no like a job of course there was a like a kind of a critical jump in in in uh in choosing clubs but i was uh let's say you know like my crowd was expecting you know me to play art but already in my production and on a lot of records I was buying, my heart was like, not even split, but I was listening to a lot of different styles. And I was kind of... tired that I couldn't play everything I wanted to because a lot of the crowd wanted me to play the art stuff. So I don't want to say I changed. like in one day, I was already changed. But what I changed kind of drastically was the type of club I was choosing. You had to turn down a lot of things. Yeah, I turned down a lot of things. Like start from, you know, kind of, you know, the beginning and choose to go in really small clubs and take really small money. Because I didn't enjoy anymore playing for the people. I wanted to play also for myself. Was it tough? Was it tough to go into a club knowing you played for 20,000 people a year earlier? It was in a way tough, in a way. Because I really loved the music, you know, when I was playing, I didn't really care. It's like I'm with less people, but at least I'm with my music. So it was like a balance. I really, you know, in a way, paid back. When I look back at what I did and when I start to listen to all this criticism about minimalism, minimalism, music, or DJ, they change, they go for what is working now. Bullshit. I mean, I changed when it wasn't working. I didn't follow anything. I actually had to, you know, step back and start from the beginning to do what I really loved. I didn't follow anything, you know, actually the opposite. So in a way, you know, after years I realized that, you know, when... When the BPM went down and the sound went down, it was more accessible to much more people. At that time, it was actually much less people. So it was like a risk I took because I believed. When did it start to pick up again? When did you start getting bigger and bigger crowds and the sound? Well, after, I don't really remember the year I wanted to change. I started to change, but it probably took me one or two years, slowly, of course. Also Ibiza started to pick up with this kind of music and was a big, huge thing. I mean, I remember my first years, 2001, in Ibiza I was already playing for Cocoon, still Amnesia and still Mondays, and there was only Germans, probably 2,000 people, the biggest number. Italians didn't know what techno was. We were like a really good family of DJs. We enjoyed it. We didn't really care about many things that people care about today. We were happy we could actually play in Ibiza. I mean, stories is before, like the techno DJ were like, one time yes, one time no, they were kicked out of the DJ booth because the music... didn't work. I think people forget or they just weren't there back then to know how much it grew in the past 10 years. Techno on the island. It was like crazy. Crazy. Really crazy. Do you think... Something really important happened at Circo Loco. They really established Paris already. with a lot of Italians, they start to move the sound more, you know, Luciano and Riccardo, and they were like starting playing there, so people start to understand, they recognize this kind of music, so in a way it was also the key why Cocoon was working, because some of the people after... the C10 and say okay let's go and listen to more of this interesting sound so Cocoon started growing in the years and the terrace the first four years was empty Ricardo played for himself for like three years and then after you know few years it became probably the biggest room. Why did it change? Like it's amazing to me that it just caught on. Was it just a matter of almost education or that you know? That it took a while for people to get it? No, well, I think it took a while and probably before was not the right music. I mean, if I know it enough, Art Techno was too different from... what was happening at that time. So it was too extreme. So when the sound was going down, probably from house music to go to minimal techno, it's an easier step for the people to catch. And also, you know... play this music in the right place with the right sound system helps of course and so step by step obviously you know Cocoon was a big deal for you, but this year you decided to make the jump to doing your own night. It must have been, I mean, in your mind, you must have been nervous. It was probably the most difficult winter I had in years. Probably the most difficult winter. Of course, I... I love to play in Cocoon and I respect Sven for what he has done for the island, for the music scene. But in a way, I mean, in the last year I was exclusive for Cocoon. And I didn't have probably enough space to express myself. I had, you know, after so many years of, you know, experience of DJ, I had much more to tell myself and from my taste of music. And in Cocoon, I wasn't, I didn't have enough space to do this. That's why I decided to do my own night for myself and also for other people, new talent. I thought they should have more time on the island. So I was kind of looking around for the first time and Martindo, he was really kind of disappointed I was going to leave. amnesia because uh i had really good you know relationship with uh with the club and uh i wasn't playing only for cocoon i did you know like fridays already and the closing from from nasa since many years and every time was magical so i didn't in a way accept i was leaving the club So he offered me to do the Fridays. I know it was going to be tough for many reasons, also because Amnesia is a big club. But I knew the potential of me having a night there and me playing in the terrace there, I loved the room and I took my chance and accepted. Did it take a while to build up or was it immediate, the numbers there? No, it was really fast. I mean, I was really stressed before we started the night. This year, I mean, 2012, there's a year of change, kind of worse, a lot, because there was a retreat this night on a Thursday. the day before my event, so I wasn't sure if it was going to affect my night or not. Then there was many more nights. There was Estee Lauder's. There was a row on Saturdays. There was Pandemonium also on Friday with Tanya. Jamie Jones on Thursday. On the sit-and-hand, it was like... I'm sure there was more changing also at Pasha. So there were so many changes. that nobody could tell what was going to happen. Going in, it must have been really like... You know, we were like doing the best we could. And so the opening night, we had the opening night, and we had... People. Like the room was full. But what really made me happy that everybody left with a smile. Everybody left happy. So it was a good opening, a good start. I wasn't really thinking of the number, I was thinking of the feeling. that was during the night. So we had the second Friday and we actually had more people than the opening. So I was shocked because usually, you know, the opening is much more people than the second night. And after I finished my session on the second night, then I thought... We really started. We made it already. You said that you wanted to be able to stretch out maybe. all sorts of styles of music that you love to be able to play. And I was talking to someone last night who actually said, you'd be surprised if you went to Music On to hear what Marco Carollo was playing this year. Maybe it's not what you would expect. I don't know what to say. No, of course it was, I mean, I always kind of started around 3, 3.30 and the club was closing around 8. Sometimes we went after 8. So it was many hours. And so I kind of felt free of expand my session and play also something different. And I knew the people was going in a way, wait, listening. or don't rush the moment. Also, amnesia is a really good thing. In the last one or two hours, the sun is coming in the room, so it's like a kind of different atmosphere. So I kind of felt I could do what I want without much pressure. And this is probably the key of a DJ to play something different. One of the things I really enjoy about your sets, certainly lately, is what you just kind of touched on, which is you're really patient almost as a DJ. You said you have the room to sort of, you know... wait yeah yeah no of course it's uh it's probably one of the keys when when you have a like a festival session let's say you have two hours then you don't really it's different is different to play the best track you have at the moment or to play the best track you think is right at the moment. And to do this you need more time. You have to be more relaxed, you have to know that you have time. to create something and it's not always like this also sound system has to help many tracks like many really simple tracks you need a really good sound system in order to give the effect you want you as a professional feel and you want to give this feeling to the people, you need to have the right sound system. When you have the good tools, you can express better your art. I assume also not only is obviously Amnesia has a good sound system, but now you know the sound system so well that you can just know exactly how to play it. Yeah, of course. I would say Amnesia has a really good sound system. It doesn't have the best sound system, but it's really good. Of course, I play there many, many times. It's something I know exactly, like a record works better than another one. So probably, you know, all these things, I know the timing of the room, you know, like... I know that I have more time and I know the kind of feeling I get created at a certain time. I don't know how to say it. So all these little things can help you to do a better session or a special session. One of the things about MusicOn that I find kind of interesting is that it doesn't seem like there's a lot of to-do around other things. It seemed like the name, MusicOn. Yeah, it's all about the music. That's a conscious decision? I mean, to kind of... Yeah, I mean, yes, really. We were like, of course... We had many thoughts, you know, before we started the season. Me and my partners, Luca, Ernesto and Roberto. And Luca is my manager. And Ernesto and Roberto, they have many years of experience on the island. So we wanted to find the concept, the direction we wanted to take. And honestly, at the end of the day, we all thought the same thing. We should really focus on the music and on the new and old talents. But this is also my life. When I play, I don't express much with my dancing or my smiling or performing. People know me today because they enjoy when I play. and this is why we should focus on this and trying to don't think much on other thing that could actually distract also we have an amazing club that you know give us the possibility to do this so you say you're not flashy and yeah i'd agree with that but you know so many of the big djs in the world are i know this is kind of an impossible question for you to answer but Without that, why do you think there is such loyalty and such like fervor about you? Why do you think your fan base? loves you so much well I I don't know I mean I probably because you know when I really concentrate when I'm playing and you know I tried really to express my my feeling and also to understand the feeling I'm giving to the people and what kind of feelings I want to give to the people and this kind of connection they probably you know they feel this connection there is You know, when you have the right tool to do what you want to do with music, you don't need to do anything else. For me, then I might be wrong. What's next for you? Where do you go from here? You seemed earlier to say it would be nice to take a break for a little bit. Yeah, but it's too late. It's too late. Honestly, I've done a lot this summer playing. I really start to miss my studio time and focus more on the label. I'm going to try to do this still in between gigs because I didn't really... You know, it's difficult to plan your... feelings six months before you know so already have kind of full schedule until the end of the year but January February March I'm gonna you know taking a little bit more easy playing much less and work more in the in the studio I moved to Barcelona. Really? Yes. A few months ago, before to go to Ibiza. So I'm building the new studio and I want to... And I'm creating, let's say, my kind of perfect winter spot. to stay more in the studio and you know concentrate and relax so I know home is less of a of a thing for you somehow because you're traveling so much it's almost like well here's my base yeah I need yeah my base but Barcelona is a really good base I mean, it's perfect. It's things that, you know, doesn't really make me feel away from home because of the sea and, you know, Spanish mentality. It's kind of Latin, you know, like Italian. And the food is good. Airport, really good. Party, if I want to party, you know. If I want to sleep, I can sleep. So it's like a little bit of everything. you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
