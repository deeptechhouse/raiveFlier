you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Tidal Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. This week's Exchange is a slight change in format and the beginning of what I hope will be a regular feature of this series going forward. I'm joined today by RA Associate Editor Ryan Keeling, Stephen Titmuss, and Ben. Benji Lehman, two freelance writers for the site. We'll be spending the next hour or so talking about the London clubbing scene, edits, and your new number one DJ, Jamie Jones, and live act, Nicholas Scharr, in this very first edition of the RA Exchange's Critics' Roundtable. So sit back, relax, and get ready for some grumpiness. As you can tell by my accent, I'm completely American, but tonight we're in London together. And Stephen, you have to tell me, I live in Berlin right now. I'm looking at the listings for this weekend on Resident Advisor, and all of these parties still haven't apparently decided where they're going to happen this weekend. It's all TBA. I know it's in East London, at the very least. Well, yes, there's a lot of indecision in the London club scene at present. No, yeah, basically, it's quite interesting in the London club scene. I'd probably say for the last 10 years... ever since key clubs like The End, which was this pretty damn awesome 800 capacity venue, used to have club nights from Cocoon there and Leon Bushwacker run it. And also The Key and The Cross, another two real key clubs. Since they've shut, there's been a real move towards using warehouse spaces in London. And it seems to just be the main venue that people would use. Is it the fact that the end and whatever filled this mid-sized gap? Yeah. Is that the thing? Yeah. It's either super small or fabric? So you've got fabric, which is still really upholding quality bookings and week in, week out. And you used to have at the end the key and the cross that would kind of really hold this mid-sized gap. Now since they've gone, it's just basically moved all to warehouse-sized venues for basically anything that's 500, 800 people. And that's the big hole that things are just falling into there. Benji. All these warehouse parties, that must be amazing. There's so many different warehouses in London. Or is it like the 10 same warehouses over and over? Well, what you have in London at the moment is a situation where any space can apply for what's called a TENS or a temporary event notice. In doing so, they can hold 10 to 12 times a year parties that would go on all night under anything but the most exceptional circumstances. So that has opened up a whole business for people who own spaces. And I think that, unfortunately, it's also created a barrier because, of course, most of these spaces don't have their own sound system, they don't have a bar. So actually what's happened is that, although there is a wealth of interesting spaces... it's the same ones that tend to be used again and again because they're the ones that are covered by certain production companies who are able to put in the sound and able to put in the bar. And of course, there is also the problem of sound reinforcement because a lot of these spaces don't, unlike clubs, they don't have solid walls. They have... warehouse style ceilings and they may have a lot of windows and surfaces that will let sound through so neighbours in those areas can be disturbed by the noise which again limits the number of spaces that can be used. What do you make of the warehouse parties? Ryan, do you go to a lot? I haven't. I must add that like Todd, I was Berlin based for two and a half years and have just kind of come back into the London club scene. And this has kind of been a newer thing for me. And from my perch in Berlin, I was... Your perch. My perch in Berlin. I didn't really get it. Because to begin with, I felt like it was a move on behalf of the promoters to maybe give off this air of cool, like they were harking back to the... secret club events and um you know we're going to send you an email or a text message right before and really didn't understand the logistics and maybe maybe hadn't really got a sense of um the type of hole that steven talks about um that plays such as the key and uh the cross and the ended left um having said that um some of the places like places i'd written down like corsica studios xo yo cable east village these places weren't really kicking um when i was last in london but I mean, do you guys not feel as though those clubs that really have opened the last few years are not filling this space? Yeah, I kind of feel like my opening statement was really overly negative. I kind of want to retract it now. Yeah, so basically, I feel there's some real great parties in London that are using warehouse spaces. Love Fever, for one, is an absolutely brilliant warehouse party. Low Key is another one. And yeah, you do have some newer mid-sized clubs such as East Village, which is okay. Corsi Studios, which is actually really good. Bazing House is a new one that's just opened that I've heard good things about, but haven't actually. actually attended but but yeah but the thing that really is a problem is that the end and the cross and the key were week-in week-out venues that used to pack it in every single week out regardless in the one thing that is i find so fascinating is I was looking at the clubbing listings here during the week and I was just like when like shouldn't there be a Wednesday party shouldn't there be a Tuesday party like that's awesome yeah it doesn't seem to be happening yeah so this is a really interesting point if you compare London to what it was 10 years ago you had nights like trash you had space at Bar Roomba which is another great club that's shut down all going off during the week. You had some really great midweek parties. Even if you went back further, you had the Blue Note with Goldie and DJ Harvey. Now there is absolutely zero things going on midweek. And it's so mad for London, which has got such a wide clubbing scene. I'd probably say the widest musically clubbing scene in the world, that it has such a dearth of parties midweek. Why do we think this is? I had this discussion with somebody recently and one suggestion is that because of the recession people are trying to hold on to their jobs and they're just a lot more worried about coming into to work in a state on a Thursday or a Friday. I find these arguments so specious. The whole economy... But how do you explain the Sunday clubbing scene on London, which is the biggest day of the week for many parties? You know, you have views. You have jaded in the morning. You have wet yourself at night. You have horse meat disco. Probably the only decent clubbing nights that everyone looks weekly. Everyone looks terrible when they come in on Monday. Yeah. It's like totally fine, right? The Sunday thing started, as far as I'm aware, because... restaurants all the restaurants in london at one stage used to close on a monday so anyone who worked in a restaurant and some bars would be out on a sunday night absolutely all the wrongings that i knew that were going out into sunday were in the service industry yeah um i mean you imagine the amount of the amount of people who were you know coming from that side of things and want to really kick it on a sunday i mean that's a that's a scene in itself i'd say and i should say that like even though i i am very suspicious of the economic argument you live in berlin midweek clubbing is it's definitely there and well here's one of the most like poorest biggest cities no one has jobs in berlin no one has a job in berlin i did I did just want to pick up on something you seem to be alluding to. Do you guys feel in your experience with these parties that sound is an issue quite a lot of the time? You're both like, yes, yes, let me go. Well, I'd say it's the same three complaints every single time. Sound, number one. Number two, the bar. You can't get a drink. Number three, you know, the toilets are broken. Unless if you've got a girlfriend or you're a female, your usual first instinct at many warehouse parties is just to go home because the facilities are so bad. And these are all problems that are kind of sorted in a usually good club environment. And it's really interesting because there's a massive... demand for dance music in London you know um like how quickly did the loco dice under 300 events sell out you know maybe two hours it's like a rock concert style thing But there isn't, you know, many mid-sized venues that are kind of regularly opening week in, week out and packing them in. Do you feel then that this is just reflecting just badly on the promoters? I spoke to Dolan from Electric Minds earlier and one of his lines of argument or his way of explanation as to why the shift has occurred, among many reasons, was that... this gives promoters a blank canvas. They can control bookings, they control production, they control sound. Like every aspect, you know, down to security, every aspect of this is being taken care of by the promoter. So are we essentially saying that London promoters are just skimping on sound in a lot of cases? I don't think it's a question of skimping. I've been at quite a few events, or I can think of at least two in the last... year certainly where what's happened is a great sound system has been put in but at some point during the night the police have turned up and requested that everyone turns it down. because these venues aren't reinforced. It was what I was saying earlier. A lot of them just weren't built to be clubs, and so the sound travels for miles and miles. And a big function one system will make a lot of noise. I mean, it will keep people up. they're asked to turn the sound down. I don't think it's a question of skimping. I think promoters, Dolan certainly, and other promotions like A Night With, for example, have all come up trumps with the sound. They've all really put a lot of money and effort into it. So I think it's more a question of just the legislation and the inherent difficulties of having to deal with these. informal spaces yeah sure i mean we were talking a little bit about the economy but i can't imagine there's too many people out there in London at the moment who would want to gamble on a medium-sized club and you know get something open I mean it's not the late 90s anymore there's one thing I wanted to mention about this in relation to tickets because by far London is RA's biggest market for tickets Now, being in a slightly privileged position and not having to buy tickets a lot of the time, I wondered if people felt that promoters withholding the information and people buying tickets was somehow unfair because you don't really know what you're paying for. And I remember an example, and, you know, not to speak here of Mullet Over because they're doing a great job at what they do, but I remember at their Halloween party, it was revealed that it was Proud 2. It was the formerly Matter venue. And I remember thinking to myself, oh, gosh, if I bought a ticket for that, I'd be thoroughly disappointed and I probably wouldn't want to go. Slightly digressing for a second, Proud 2... it does have arguably the best sound system in the whole of the country. I would completely agree. Good toilets, too, I imagine. Yeah, great toilets, yeah. You should get a drink quite easily. I'm sure Stephen's girlfriend is hugely into that. It's a common complaint. It's a common complaint. No, I just very simply mean that, you know, like everyone, I have my family. favourites in London. I guess, I mean, if you're buying a ticket to something that's TVA, buyer beware. Like, I know that that's not a satisfying answer to many people, of course, but... But there's also a general concertification of club nights in London, which is almost getting to a ridiculous level. Like, if you see a line-up you enjoy... perhaps you have to buy the ticket a month before to guarantee entry. The whole idea of let's go out on a Friday and go clubbing, where will we end up? I think that's rapidly disappearing because... of these economics of people sharing stuff on social media, you've got to buy the ticket straight away, and then all my mates buy a ticket. I think it's becoming a problem. I think, yeah, I think this goes back to something you and I were talking about last night, that I do miss the, excuse me, the spontaneity of Berlin. just kind of being able to go around the corner and know that a DJ was on, but just being able to stroll up and not having those considerations. What I fear with the London model at the moment is if you do have people buying tickets a month in advance, you're almost building it up like an international headlining DJ, as though it was a concert or like a performance. So it's very often... around this one moment that doesn't allow for just a kind of like sprawling like wider expression you know like resident djs and that and there's a more like well-rounded experience but then you do have you know you do have promoters who obviously are trying to do things to combat that the a night with like can't really be like all right i'll walk up at blah blah to hear this like you almost want to walk up at the beginning because you want to hear the warm-up stuff yeah and plastic people's nailed that whole you know you have to get there early doesn't set really sell tickets you know if you want to go to plastic people you better get there when it opens really otherwise there's a good chance you're not going to see theo parish you know or floating points whoever's playing there yeah sure i just wonder if all this um pre-planning and and tickets is just sort of taking a little little bit away from it just you know everybody will say that the best nights they ever have are the kind of the spontaneous ones where things just happened and i caught someone and it was amazing you know it's very rarely the ones you look forward to for weeks and weeks and weeks and actually pays off i think that One of the missing components from that spontaneous equation is regular nights that happen on the same night every month, in the same place. Because I think for a lot of people... a lot of promoters for a start putting on a one-off with a big name. They need to have a guarantee. And let's be honest, tickets for a promoter, any size of promoter, are brilliant. It's obvious to see, but it's great for promoters to be able to sell tickets in advance. Absolutely. I think there are a number of nights that... breaking that mold and um and they're doing it quite successfully and you know as with all these things because everything swings one way it sort of starts to swing another way people do get frustrated but it's all gone one way and they start to do things differently and i think inevitably we're going to see it move back a little bit in the direction of more low-key more regular yeah Do you sense that London is on that way? Is like nearing that? Or is it at like a, is it in? the middle of this pendulum or like where Stephen's about to get negative again. No, no, I really feel that I'm being really negative, but I'm not. I would say I'm really pumped on like the London scene. I think it's got the widest breadth of music. It's got great nights, but it just takes a lot of pre-planning, which is, as you said, it can be quite an issue, but I don't see it swinging back. anytime soon to a time where we've got something like the end and it's got drum and bass on a Wednesday. and Giles Peterson coming in on one day and then, you know, House on another day. Well, this is it. You know, any precursor to change is going to be that there's, you know, something broken with it. And I think this new model, you know, has been embraced by everyone and it seems to be working for people. I can't, again, I can't see three new clubs spring up in the next 12 months. all coming away from the TBA East London model. And don't forget, if you're a promoter, moving your club around keeps it spicy for your crowd who come every single time and it's a different venue. the DJ booth's changed round, you know, maybe we've got some different decorations this time. If you're just promoting to a crowd of, say, 400 people, your regulars who come all the time, it can work really well for you. Do you think it's almost shifted the emphasis a little bit more onto the promoter? Because in order for you to buy a ticket to some way where you don't know where you're going, you have to have a certain level of trust in that promoter. I think that's absolutely right. But I'm surprised that people do always have that trust. Because as you pointed out, asking someone to put down 10, 15 or even 20 pounds of money for something where they don't even know where it's going to take place, how they're going to get there, how long it's going to take them to get there. That is quite a... That is quite a big ask of your punters. So yes, I think, you know, there is a massive level of trust involved. And I think, you know, you see... how important it is for nights to manage their brand and to manage that relationship. Yeah, sure. I think, you know, although my experience of it until now has been quite limited, using the Electric Minds example, I've, you know, looking over their semi-regular loft parties lineups. I do. I have been thinking to myself, like, there's a DJ I've seen quite a bit, but I wouldn't mind seeing him play an Electric Minds event. You know, someone like Move D I've seen quite a bit. It's definitely the same thing for me in Berlin. It's like... move deal play around town and then i'll play a panorama bar and it becomes an event right it's like well he's gonna bring his a game because he's in this venue he's you know this person once they dj rocks up to electric mines and they can sort of see the vibe or wherever in london it's really really good and they're like okay tonight's the night funny enough i think he can swing the other way as well if I feel like, you know, it's a really shabby venue and the promoter hasn't put much time in. You know, I've seen it go the other way. I won't call people out right here, but, you know, where DJ's rocked up and he's obviously expected a better mixer and like, you know, maybe some deck. that work and you know maybe a sound system that sounds okay and it's not really going to happen I wonder what this is like on the other side of things you know how enthusiastic DJs are about playing these spaces and how difficult it is for promoters to convince bookers like well, yeah, we've got this venue, it might be this one, it might be the other, not sure capacity. I mean, this is some pretty basic information. And I imagine for a first time TBA style promoter, that's got to be pretty tough. One thing I wanted to kind of ask you before I move on, which of these spaces are you, which do you like, which are you in favour of? I feel like we've kind of danced around it a little bit and we've just been quite general Stephen. Call me out. Well, funny enough, I actually used to really... quite like red gallery but it was really quite bait basically they didn't really have a proper license and they had like kind of an upstairs room that was like yeah that was totally illegal but i'd say that they they probably exceeded the 499 capacity um limit with with um with that size venue I mean, I was actually reading the temporary events notice earlier and the 499 that you're permitted includes all the door staff, all of the bar staff, like everybody, you know, down to the DJ. So in one of those slightly bigger spaces, I don't know if that became an issue. Yeah, Low Key have some really good venues where they do this thing. Same as Love Fever. But they move around and it's sometimes, and a lot of the time in my opinion, more to do with the promoter than the space. For example, Love Fever hang all these crazy big old balloons and put this mad lighting in and make the place look really exciting and work a lot on the sound. Have either of you guys been out to the Hub? I was hearing quite good things about that. aside from Hackney Wick? There are certainly some great, great spaces around Hackney Wick, there's no question. I haven't been to that particular one, but I did go to a party in the old Burberry factory on New Year's Eve, which was interesting and had all the best and all the worst things going for it about a party in a... Thank you. a warehouse space. Yeah, it's funny you say that because my experience so far has been there's been a lot of good things and lots of boxes have been ticked, but there will just be the one thing. Like on New Year's, the Electric Minds party at the Hoxton basement, like the space, like really like the feel of it. The sound was decent. The bar was running okay. It wasn't too busy, but it was just... really really hot like i told about it in the summer like okay it's almost unbearable but new year's eve you know the temperature's not up but it was stifling and then Another example, like the number one Kingsden Road venue, The Loft. Again, I can't remember what the party was, but, you know, everything was great, vibe going, but the space just couldn't accommodate that level of people. Do you think we're worrying about the medium too much, though, like the actual parties in London? Like, are they any good? And I'd say massively yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know. It's a different type. And again, I'm always going to be comparing it to Berlin where things definitely are a bit different. There's definitely, I still do get the sense that, you know, even though we're lucky in London and we can go till six, seven, eight in the morning or whatever, there still is that like, this is my night out. I'm going to... really go for it here you know just leads people to being just charged up and not really in a head space that kind of gels with me all the time berlin's a bit more like you know i'm gonna go out and i might be out for a while i don't know like you know i can kind of do what i want and i'm worried about the bar closing blah blah blah but you know i'm being incredibly uh hard Do you think that's more to do with British people in general? Oh, completely. Yeah, yeah, completely. I mean, we grow up in towns where we have to get our drinking done by 11 o'clock, and then we get thrown out onto the streets, and it certainly engenders this charged atmosphere, I think. What a strange and wondrous place. Yes, I know it fascinates you, Todd. Just recently we published an article by Will Lynch about edits, which is, of course, one of the enduring, I think, hot topics that people talk about. In the piece, Will mentions a review we ran a couple years ago now with Soul Clap that basically... probably had the most comments of any single review we've done in a long time. And I think the takeaway for the piece, for me at least, is that... everyone has their own idea of edits and how they approach it. As two guys who DJ often, I'd be really interested in your thoughts. Maybe Benji, do you have a line where you say, you know what, I'm not going to do this, but I will do that. with edits no not at all i i totally agree with soul clap on this i think there are no rules and i think that ultimately it's whatever works that's the nature of this business Now, the thing is, let's get straight to the point here. If DJs are having to buy edits of old tracks in order to move a dance floor, to me, all that suggests is that the new tracks coming out aren't working. Okay, that's interesting. Wow. Yeah. So you're essentially saying that if we as a scene are having to rely on this old music and, you know, cutting up pop records and stuff, then... creativity's run dry? I'm not sure if it's a question of creativity having run dry, but I think maybe we've lost track of the intention. It's something that actually Andrew Weatherill, a really interesting distinction that Andrew Weatherill made in a recent interview, he talked about the difference between the technique and the intention, and he talked about how people are getting much more caught up with the process. The process was the word he used. In fact, it was people are getting too caught up with the process and they're losing track of the intention, which is ultimately, if you're making a dance record, it's to make people dance, first and foremost. What I think is that the large majority of DJs buying records will get to play them in a bar, in a small club or at their mate's house party. It's a very, very small number of people who will ever play in the big rooms of clubs like Burghain or Fabric, which have the huge sound systems. And I think unfortunately what's happening is that people are making a lot of records. for those kind of environments. And there aren't quite enough records which are being made for those house party moments at two, three o'clock in the morning where you need a killer tune to play to people who aren't necessarily clued up on this music. I'd kind of counter that argument a little bit, though. It's just... I really feel that a lot of edits, a big glut of them, disco edits, are basically made with the intention because people can't mix disco. If you listen to what Daniel Wang play, he'll basically play disco and it will even... all the really cheesy parts but then that makes the break part sound amazing and then also he'll mix and it won't be that good he'll kind of mess it up a little bit but hey it will move the dance floor amazingly and i just don't think in our culture where oh my god he's train wrecking he's train wrecking that like people have the balls to really just play straight up disco even though it really moves the dance floor. But surely, I mean, beat matching is a title commodity these days, isn't it? You press sync on your software, maybe you've had to do a bit of preparation. Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. I just remember listening, just to go away from the point a little bit, I remember listening to James Murphy's Fabric. mix and just think to myself could you not have done something about this beforehand just like straight out the beats a little bit that's part of the charm it is it is yeah we should be heading towards this more streamlined situation I mean beat matching isn't the only and I'm not gonna I don't wanna go deep But beat matching is not the only way to DJ by any stretch of the imagination. I think we can all agree on that. There's a whole load of other ways you can build an interesting set without having to just stick to a... Yeah, sure. Tempo perfect for him. So taking a step back, do we even consider the argument that the anonymous label owner gives in the piece that it's straight up illegal and you're stealing? I think, yes, from a very, very, you know, straight up point, yes, it is like copyright theft. But if you think of it from a label, a major label's perspective, when they've got all these forms of digital copyright theft going across the world, you know, mega upload has just been shut down. The guy had... x amount of yachts you know i think if you're doing a run of 500 vinyl you're such small fry to a major label or a major or a major copyright owner that in all likelihood you're not going to be chased down and you're not going to make money. Like I think DJ Harvey said he ate the profits of Black Cock, which sounds awful, but he went out for a sushi dinner with Joe Rooney and that was it. And then like Dixon on the Philomena label, he was saying on Beats in Space the other week that... You know, if people want to, you know, come after me, fine, we'll sort it out. We'll do it. We'll do it in a vision style, he said, which I don't know what that means. Maybe he'll come around and do the housework or something. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. As I was saying to you guys before we started rolling, I find myself very much sitting on the fence with this piece and with this subject in general. Someone who I thought made quite an interesting point was Ryan Elliott, where he was talking about the fact that he makes these edits, but they're for him. They're for the club. And none of these guys, well, by and large, are seeking approval. They're not saying anything. Yeah, I think for me, at the end of the day, that's... My line, even though I don't DJ, is that if I were a DJ, I'd be fine playing edits, making edits, whatever. I would never at all. I'd send them to my friends or whatever, but I'd never try to make money on them, even lose money on them in many cases because I think that's, for me, that's just like, it's like, why? Yeah, I mean... What is that? What is the purpose of just putting out... To satisfy those 500 people. That argument, like the argument that Soul Clap had that was sort of like, oh, the people want it. That just doesn't wash with me in any fashion at all. No, no, you know, them saying that we're not benefiting from it. I mean, to be fair, like, one corrected the other and said, oh, you know, actually, we have done quite well off the old edit's thing. No, and they had a really interesting dynamic. They were, like, almost in, like, the piece itself, which was, like, constantly sort of, like, back and forth, like, well, it's Yeah, sure. Which is, it's kind of nice that they're thinking about it. Yeah, I mean, not to beat up on those guys too much, but I think another thing they said was that they wouldn't mind if people were sampling them. Now, I have to think that if somebody took one of their 2011 hits, put a dubstep beat under it and pressed up 500 copies, they would have a problem with that. I don't know, but I can't speak for them. They did use the caveat that it has to be good. Yeah, so... Okay, okay. Well, it's a tasteful dubstep. It's a Future Garage video. It just seems there's a bit of a Robin Hood effect going on here in that it seems to be all right if it's like P. Diddy or R. Kelly or whatever. It's fine. They're rich and they're famous. It don't matter. Whereas if you were, you know, borrowing from somewhere within the scene, you'd kind of need to seek approval or be like, you know, is this OK? Am I in the right place? I don't know. We're all making up our own rules here. And I find that the sort of semantics of it pretty fascinating. Well, I mean, Greg Wilson said, you know, it's like we're going back to the Wild West. That's great, but of course, the Wild West has its advantages and disadvantages. It's quite a violent place. If you've ever watched any Westerns, you probably... You have dysentery, cholera as well. Yeah. And... Of course, you know, historically, I mean, things have been settled by violence in the past. You rip off the wrong person. I think there's always been this unspoken thing in this game that if you rip off the wrong person, you know, you might expect a knock on the door. And I do think that, as someone in that article did point out, it is important for kids to understand that... I mean, I take A1 Baseline as a case in point because, of course, he remixed a track on Goldie's Metalheads label last year and Goldie was very unhappy about it and kind of did the Twitter equivalent of... knocking his door down and coming and having a very stern conversation with him. And, you know, that is a kind of violence. I think, you know, people need to understand that a lot of this industry was sort of built on respect and slightly on fear. And if you do, if you are going to take someone's track and... use it for your own purposes, you know, and then release it with your name on it somewhere, you are treading on their toes. And yeah, that was the, that's the thing that really just rankles me is that you, you put your name on it and like white label K, I can see that like total white label. No one knows what it is, but yeah, once you put your name on it. And again, like I see the other side of it, which is especially in the digital age. Will makes this point later on. One of the reasons that SoulCat did it is because they didn't want them to get Googled. Yeah. And caught that way. But like, think of like, this is quite an interesting point because you both said that if you'd done some edits and they were good, even if they were good, you would never put them out. But when does an edit start becoming a remix? So what are Tiger and Woods? What is Gin Nation? Is that imagination? That's illegal. That's what it is. It certainly is. God damn those Tiger and Woods. This is a black market, isn't it? To their credit, they did clear some of those samples. Okay, yeah. But maybe when they were signed to... Yeah, yeah, all right. They've done all those white labels. But no, this is the point I'm trying to make. You know, there are edits that are going around that have got like really amazing production aspects and there's been a lot of work that's gone into them. And I think you can really disassociate, you know, someone doing an edit of chic dance, dance, dance, like looping the... the first 16 bars and that's it and calling it DJ Bozo dance dance dance well then shouldn't we just say a remix is when someone else asks you to do it and maybe possibly pays you for it yeah but that's not the case though is it because you know you've got the internet now you've got Ableton you've got Sony Acid you know anyone can sit there and just do stuff. No, I'm saying anyone can do it for sure. But like... There are no rules. Why am I trying to impose anything? Yeah, I mean, I guess what we're saying, I mean, it definitely has come away from its original meaning. I mean, if in the beginning we were talking about simply extending something for club play, as was mentioned in the piece. Now, if you're just taking a small section and looping it and you're essentially writing a new drum track and adding some synths, I'd argue that you're just... you know, you're not really making an edit under those circumstances, I don't believe. No, I totally agree. people still put an edit on something that sounds a lot more like a remix it's kind of yeah yeah yeah uh i just wonder how much of this is riding trends really yeah true actually yeah well i feel like that's the perfect segue why don't we go into uh there are some new trends i guess that are exemplified by the two guys who took the mantle of number one DJ in live act this year, Jamie Jones and Nicholas Sharpe. Benji, you like Jamie Jones, as you mentioned earlier, off air, I guess. Do you think the number one is deserved? Absolutely. I mean, Jamie Jones, I remember... in as far back as 2004, seeing his name on flyers for parties in the East End and reading up a bit about him. And he has worked incredibly hard to get where he is. He spent... quite a significant amount of time in Ibiza where, from what I gather, things were fairly tough from time to time and he worked his way up in a very old school way into getting a slot in one of the main clubs and that is how he got his break. He really did it by going out there with his records, with a box of records. and um getting stuck in and i i think you know it's as far back as i mean 2006 was i suppose his first big big break with it with the amazon amazon track on freak and chic and that was a great track and i i think i think that you know um he's testament to the fact that If you work hard, you take your chances, you will get there. Do we attribute all of this to his DJing skills or do we think that his productions have played quite a large part in this? I'd say his productions and his record label as well have played a massive part in Jamie's music. You look at all the number ones though and it's like they're like... five different things going so like you kind of have to own a record label you kind of have to have productions it has to be the perfect storm you know like that you're rich yeah and definitely like it seemed quite obvious that something was going to happen this year in a way just because ricardo is kind of not had an album out that dance music people could be really that into. Not to say that they aren't great. I think he's doing some fantastic work, especially the ECM album that he put out last year. And of course, Richie Houghton minus Plastic Man. show he's constantly like giving you something new to hold on to um but at the same time the seth and jamie train you could just sort of tell that like these two guys were probably gonna It was coming. And Benji was talking about the hard work that Jamie's put into it. And something that we mentioned in the write-up for the feature was the number of gigs he was playing. And to bring it to mind off the top of my head, it was something like 145 gigs we had in the RA system, which is quite incredible. And when you look at his next nearest competitors, such as Richard Ricardo, it was 890 or something. stick on and probably another three or four for every after party and everything else he played you know like three or four a week yeah exactly i mean i think what i find most interesting about his success is that he pushes what i would consider quite a um It's a fairly subtle blend of house music. You know, we're talking about beats around 120. You know, we're talking about like, and something that's just quite surprising, I must point out, was at BPM Festival in Mexico over New Year's and hadn't really seen Jamie too much during the year. I was quite taken aback by, okay, you know, very much understanding of the pace of music they played, but this party reference, this, you know, the type of samples they were drawing upon and this kind of thing were discussed at length, but... I was kind of surprised by how low-key the music was at times and how it was very groove orientated. You know, you could go like 30, 40 minutes with no discernible hooks necessarily. Like it kind of felt like a more floor friendly, more girl friendly update to what was going on with the minimal thing a few years back. I don't know if you guys... feel like you know this this sort of party hot natured you know the artwork and everything is has been um kind of blown out of proportion a little bit and what you actually get from them is um something a little different i think perhaps they've just done so well and that their marketing image has been portrayed so much over the internet that people have ideas about them before they even get there. Yeah, as I did. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, because I've seen Jamie play disco randomly, just like, and he was great. And he played, you know, mixed up really old tracks. And I've seen him play, as you say, more kind of stripped down stuff. So I think he has a pretty far range, to be fair. And perhaps people just think one thing of him when he's actually got quite a lot in his locker. And that's... probably one of the reasons he's done so well. I think I was really fascinated by his fabric mix because I felt like in the same thing with the Vision Quest, I talked quite a bit about this with Ryan, they both had fabric mixes this year, which also definitely helped, I think, the ranking a tiny bit in the poll. I would have expected the Jamie Jones fabric mix to be like hot natured and friends all the way through. And same thing for the vision quest. And I think they just went the other way, which is to show the range, show that they're not just like, hey, here's all our friends. Here's our sound. Here's the definition. it's like we've been DJs for a long time. This is all the sorts of things we can do. Yeah, sure, sure. You know, I'm just pleased more than anything that someone such as him can rise to that position off the back of this type of music, you know, because if you look at the dominance of Ricardo and Rich over the years, you know, they... moments you know it's it's big at times you know particularly in the example of Horton you know it's big it grabs you you know Ricardo's got this thing and you know he can be pretty esoteric and key but you know he's still creating these big shows you know and he can play on festival stages and stuff but you know to have a guy come along who plays like quite nice chugging disco influence house and that can be a number one and a star thing and for him to have this star quality um yeah i think that's a that's a great thing you know and it was very please see his name at number one it has to be said it's interesting though now you say it that I mean Ricardo's style is a million miles away from the style that Jamie Jones plays today isn't it yeah yeah of course and it's interesting that there's been that switch over I'm not sure why that might be but But not to toot our own reader's horn too much. You look at the top 20, and you have Ben Clock, Cassie, Dixon, yes, of course, Digweed holding on strong. We've got a pretty varied readership, and not to bag on any other DJ Pauls, but I think it's kind of... there's quite a nice swath of different things in there. Yeah, sure, sure. And, you know, under this umbrella and, you know, you were talking about trying to bring it all together and, you know, find parallels in what these Crosstown and Hot Natured and Vision Quest were doing, you know, like Mesoplex at number five or whatever it was and Art Department number six, you know. I don't see what they're doing as being too far from the, you know, from the Jamie Jones end of things. You know, they're all going to be playing on similar bills. And again, I don't know. I'm just surprised and maybe a little bit pleased that this, you know, a sound such as this that is just going, you know, it's not trying to win huge crowds over, can be. so highly regarded by the readers. I think more than anything, I'm just glad that it's different. As someone who's just ready for something to change. And I think we're currently rich and amazing DJs, but it's nice to just have that as a writer. It's nice to have something else to write about. So I guess my next question to you all is what will be there standing this time next year? Is this sound... um you know here to stay are they going to stick with this sound because i think that the interesting thing about some of those um some of those guys who are kind of intrinsically linked with this sound at the moment is that they've been through different stages like you look at lazarus i mean it's a guy who was at the start of the decade at the start of last decade um kind of doing the electro clash thing with city rockers and then kind of went through this starting cross towns kind of aligned with the minimal thing and is just you know kind of shape-shifting as as the decade's going on so i'm wondering like Are these guys going to stick with this? Is this going to be something that they're pushing? Are these the type of artists who will be always shedding their skin, so to speak? I think today every artist needs to shed their skin quite regularly to stay current. I think the artists who are doing well in this whole thing today and who have managed to... keep themselves at the forefront of it are the ones who are able to do that. I think it takes, I think it shows a lot of versatility and I think, and foresight to be able to do that. There will always, you know, there'll always be a big fan base for, I think all these types of music because they do have a heritage now. I should qualify what I said earlier by saying that I think it's... I think in order to achieve that kind of popularity, it's very important to reinvent yourself every now and again. But that doesn't mean that there won't be people who stay very, very close to what they do who will always do well with that because by virtue of the fact that they've... kept on yeah i mean lazarus ryan's he's the perfect example of the guy who's like he's been able to shapeshift and remain completely relevant and you know you look at when i we were writing the uh blurb about crosstown being the number one label i looked back over the catalog this past year and you know everyone thinks that crosstown has a sound but you forget that they had a harvey mix and you forget they had a dixon mix and the daphne one like yeah you like like an amazing dan berkson single like and you know you wouldn't be like dan berkson is on Ross Town Rebels. It's just... Yeah, I was trying ever so hard to kind of say to myself that they had a sound, but they really don't. I mean, there's certain... borders to it certainly but um yeah they don't i mean and again going back to what you were saying at the outset um i i think that the temptation and something we were certainly talking about is to to group what the labels like vision quest and hot natured and crosstown are doing together but I think the fact is that the only thing that's really linking was they're all mates you know and you're going to find them on the same bill there's definitely some crossover going on but in terms of trying to link the sound and again I hadn't seen um you know another piece to this like the soul cap guys who were kind of in a similar position last year and going and checking in with them recently and just realizing again like you're doing something completely different from these guys and I'm trying to group you all together because that's very neat and you know you're all friends and stuff but wow this is just so far removed you know speaking of Soul Clamp obviously I guess it's a neat segue to Nicholas Scharr who's Soul Clamp, Wolf and Lamb, Nicholas Scharr more not Neat pairings. But in any case, Jarre was our number one live act of the year. And he knocked off Plastic Man from last year. Stephen, you wrote me an email before we met up tonight, and you basically said he's kind of a rock star a little bit. Yeah, well, if you compare him to everyone else in the poll, everyone else in the poll is kind of a 30- to 40-year-old dude with some machines making music. Nicolas Jarre's a young, good-looking guy who has a mic and sings. So by far, he's the most conventional-looking kind of live act out. And I would say he's a massive deserved winner. I saw him play live twice this year. And he totally... To say he takes his sound on his own terms is pretty an understatement. He plays at 110 BPM. at peak time he manages to rock out a club there's just like these ridiculously weird kind of latin ethereal vocals and gets people singing along to that it's it's really interesting to see him kind of do his thing on the scale he's doing it and doing it on his own terms it's quite a bit more muscular than the album Yeah, there's a massive difference. Like one of the biggest naysayer things you hear about Nicholas Shaw's sound is, oh, it's kind of like, you know, ballerica trip-hop from the 90s. And, you know, it'll be coffee table music, which is the most ridiculous kind of assessment of music anyway, coffee table music. And when he does it live, he really pumps up the 808s and the drums. It really feels like it goes. And it's got a real kick to it. But it's still really on his own terms, though. It's still really slow. And it still just unfolds at kind of his own pace. It doesn't feel hurried at all, which is, if you compare it to, say, Plastic Man, you know, where it's, you know, obviously on his own terms as well, but very much a club thing. Nicholas Jarre sometimes feels much more like a concert, a traditional concert. Well, yeah, I mean, it's testament really to him sticking to his guns that someone so young, you know, refuses to pander to the expectation that people might have going into these things. I'm sure there was a lot of people who on a sort of basis of some internet hype and, you know, knowing that he was quite a hot name and like seeing the friends link to event on Facebook or whatever, went along and checked out his show. You know, you've got a lot of these people. are probably coming into it as a first time thing maybe even not heard the album but um you know getting to these getting to these bigger stages i mean i haven't looked at his gigs closely but he must have you know he must have been playing to like a thousand people plus at a time the one thing i saw i saw him recently at berghain and aside from enjoying it um i was really struck in thinking about where he's still playing or where he's playing. Like, it seems like I wonder if he's, not to be negative about it, but I wonder if he's stuck or if he just wants to continue to play in clubs in these club contexts as opposed to, like, taking it on a bigger level or playing indie rock clubs, especially, like, in the States, for example, which you could say. Yeah, he could play those as opposed to... I mean, he is certainly still doing those shows, isn't he? He's about to finish up his current tour in Manchester and Leeds this weekend, I think. He's still playing, like, Sound Control is one of the venues, but we're still talking about... below thousand capacity venues um he's playing roundhouse yeah which is like out of the way but um yeah certainly on this i think the next tour is the interesting one i think i think where he goes with that but um yeah some of those festival performances he must be great for it if you're curating a lineup you know you want to give people a breather you know you want to drop the tempo without having to consider everybody um you know just going off to their tent and going to sleep or whatever that's um yeah did you see him play benji at all during the year No, I've not seen him play. I've enjoyed a lot of his music, especially his remix of Ellen Alleyne. What do you make of him being number one? I mean, was there someone who was better in your mind or more suited? I mean, I think, I suppose the only question I have, and in a way, Stephen's actually answered this point. in his description of the live show, which sounds a lot more, as you put it, muscular than the album, is whether, is this, to what extent is this dance music, to what extent is it kind of more shoegaze in the, maybe it doesn't really matter that much. I think it's, I think he's a talented songwriter. And I think it's great to have somebody who's filling venues and who's flying the flag of loosely house, techno, disco. Yeah, I agree. I mean, I like the idea that we can go as a scene as community, like, look what we can produce. We've got this. But it's interesting why we said that for Nicholas Yar, but we didn't say it for James Blake or, you know, other Jamie Woon, perhaps, you know. And he's a guy who, like, definitely, you know, pitchfork darling plays at those enormous festivals and, like, people are going in masses. to see him in those contexts. I don't know why I'm so hung up on the context thing, but I guess it, you know, he played at Fabric on the stage midweek. He played at Berghain on a stage midweek. And I just think it's so interesting that. you know, okay, now you've played in a club, but in the middle of the week on a stage, now, like, where do you go from there? What happens next? One of the most interesting things about his live performance, which I didn't actually say earlier, he does this thing with kind of the EQ, which is like kind of the most over-enthusiastic electro house DJ, where he's going from high to low. And like, in the wrong hands, it would be so terrible. it somehow makes it really a real great part of the show. Just this kind of like dance music EQing side of things, which... Adds a real element to his live show as well. I'm going to sound incredibly dumb. No, just not in the know with this. But what's he doing on stage? Is he singing and EQing or is he playing an instrument? What form does this take? He's kind of in a conductor situation when I saw him. So he's playing with a band. But he's playing some keys and he's doing a bit of singing and he's also kind of got a laptop next to him, which I don't know his exact setup, I'm guessing. But he's kind of like playing around with some beats and like EQs and like, you know, kind of controlling all the kind of the rest of everything that's playing into his control box, whatever that is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. I just think, you know, he's a performer and he's young and good looking It helps. It all helps. Okay, so I will pose a question. Is our number one live artist of the year even a dance act? Well, does that matter? But can you dance to it? Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. He's an interesting one. I just wonder where this... whole thing and where he would have been placed if his um introduction to the scene wasn't through wolf and lamb um i know his album came out in circus company but um i was reading back over a little bit of the piece philip um sherborn wrote on him for uh our breaking through series and the word techno was used and to apply the word techno to Nicholas Shaw now seems quite outrageous and maybe it was at the time, but. But, you know, the other quote from that piece is, you know, Ricardo Villobos changed my life or whatever. So, you know, that, that is there. And also like. I've actually interviewed him myself and his biggest influence is like Tricky and Portashed as well, which are very much these kind of electronic, almost dance acts. And I think that's totally where he fits in that kind of, you know, almost not too... I don't want to use the word trip-hop, but it's almost going down that kind of very slow-mo kind of road of electronic music, which doesn't really fit in anywhere. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. I mean, I'd certainly classify those, you know, the groups you mentioned as dancex. So, yeah. I mean, I think the basic takeaway here is that trip-hop is back. right yeah yeah i think that's with a vengeance
