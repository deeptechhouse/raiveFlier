Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artist labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Damien Lazarus is a name you're already likely familiar with as the head of Crosstown Rebels, but you may not be aware that he used to be an editor at Dazed and Confused, or that drum and bass changed his life. Listen deeply to the music that Crosstown Rebels has been releasing of late, though, and you'll hear the breath. and the depth of Lazarus's musical taste and his incredibly adept ear for A&Ring acts that are on the cusp of blowing up. You need only look at art department Maceo Plex and Denise Kurtel recently for proof. We started at the beginning for this lengthy exchange. with Lazarus and worked our way forward through his long and winding career that, if all goes according to plan in the next few years, should only get more so. When we did our write-up of your label becoming the number one label of last year, we made the joke about your last name because you've gone through so many near-death experiences with the label, it seems like. Why did you, in, what was it, 07, 08, decide to make, I guess, what has been the last run at it? Like, why did you say, let's come back? Well, first of all, I think we should point out that it may not be the last run. I think, you know, we hope that this is, you know, this is us. you know, now, but the way the industry still is, you never really know what's just around the corner. But why did I decide to continue with the label? Well, in truth, I've been working to a point pretty much most of my adult life to get to a situation where I had... a record label that I was in creative control of where I, I, I, I, it was my responsibility to discover the music, discover the artists and give to the world what it is I'm, you know, feeling and hearing and, you know, ultimately offering, you know. worked pretty hard to get to that point and to have it all taken away from me unjustifiably in such a nightmarish fashion just felt very unfair. Tell me about what happens when a distributor goes under. From a label's perspective, from your perspective. What essentially happens is that there's a little, you kind of get the signs. You feel the fear pretty early on because distributors tend to pay a label within a certain amount of time. And sometimes that payment is a little late, let's say. And when you're worried about a payment coming in a little late, you start to make some phone calls, and when phone calls aren't being answered straight away or emails aren't being responded to immediately, you get a little fear. And then that fear turns to major horror when you realise that actually... They didn't pay for the last quarter either, and that was supposed to come in. And then you start calling the friends who also have them as a distributor. Yeah, and I understand when a business is, any business in any field is going through financial difficulties. It's very difficult to handle your PR, you know, and to handle all your clients and all the people that you work with who are obviously concerned and worried. On that last occasion, we got an early sign, an early heads up. But it was pretty much already, it was a done deal. We'd kind of figured out what was going on before anyone else did, but it was already, the situation was already too serious. And then we looked at how much money was owed to us, and it was something in the region of £40,000. And for an independent, small electronic record label, that's pretty severe. That's, you know, £40,000 of which, you know, a very large bulk of that has to be paid out to your artists and to your graphic designers and to your website designers and a number of different people that, you know, you work with that you've... brought it in mainly for the love of it because there's not enough money in the game to be throwing lots of money at people. So the knock-on effect for us is like, well, how are we going to pay these? Okay, there's one thing that we're not going to get paid. I mean, that's my business. That's my money. I'm not going to get that money. What do I do now? So when you look around and you look at the people that you work with and the people that have put their faith and their trust in you, and you realize that you've actually built this. ship that's you know creating some amazing moments for people's lives um then did you get any indication that all of this stuff to be done had to be dealt with when you were working at London and City Rockers before you went into London? Well, I had different, I had issues and big situations that caused me to move from both of those entities, but they were different. The first one, London Records, was my exit out of that. was a result of Warner Brothers buying London FFRR, which was essentially an independent record label. So when they bought it, you left. When Warner's bought FFRR, London Records, there was a lot of hype. this phrase but there was a there was a lot of what they called dead wood you know within the building both staff and artists that that warners didn't believe in and obviously had like you know said to the powers that be we're coming in now you need to get rid of 50 percent of you know your your artists 50 percent of your your staff anything that's like you know not contributing to the big commercial picture that we now want for this company has to go. I'd been working at London for... just under two years, I think, working alongside Pete Tong and Phil House. And that was my first job in the music industry. And I was very lucky because I got a dream opportunity. I was given my own boutique record label to run. It was like, Damien, you've got no experience, but if you want to have a record label, there you go. Do it, and we'll give you the money to sign some music. The heady days of the 90s. Yeah, exactly. And I guess the powers that be saw something in me and wanted me to stay, but they gave me an option. They were like, okay, we'd like you to stay, but you have to sign us some more crossover commercial type acts and artists, music, or you can leave and take your label. And I had at the time, you know, some... One of my closest friends actually signed to my label and it wasn't an option. to stay and have them get chucked out. So that was number one. So that was when I left and that was the reason then. And with City Rockers a few years later, it was a different scenario and that was that my partner Phil, he entered into a joint venture with the Ministry of Sound. And at that point, and no disrespect to the Ministry of Sound, I just didn't feel that my musical taste fitted in with their MO. So two very different reasons for leaving. But I had, to answer your original question, that did give me some experience in dealing with the big music industry issues. that do come around for underground independent record labels. So let's back up. How does Pete Tong say, I need this guy who has no experience? How does he what? How does he say, I want this guy who has no record? label experience do you run in a record label well actually it was Phil Howes that found me I was prior to that I was assistant editor and music editor at Dazed and Confused magazine and I think I remember I think we were putting together a very big music feature it was a music special issue and We were trying to get hold of Goldie for something or other and we couldn't get hold of him and I was given this guy's number, Phil Howes, and we started chatting. He was Pete's right-hand man at London. And we started to become quite friendly, started to hang out, talk about music, go for a beer, blah, blah, blah. And he'd signed the All Seeing Eye and Armand van Helden, and he was just in the process of signing the Asian Dub Foundation. And on the night that... he actually signed that band he wanted to come out and celebrate with them and um he i was running a party at that time in london called pm scientists and um he called me and asked if he could put i know 13 people or something ridiculous on the guest list you know a small wednesday night party in a basement in shoreditch and um To which obviously I agreed because he was Phil and he's a super lovely bloke. So basically he came with the band and let's just say they all got thrown out for being a little bit naughty. And the following morning, there was a message on my answer phone from Phil apologising profusely and offering to buy me lunch. And by the way, you've got something I want to talk to you about. So we went for lunch and it was then when he said, you know, I've been thinking, you know, because we've been talking and I've been saying, you know, I had some ideas for labels. I'd like to try and create something a little bit more alternative, a little bit more experimental, forward-thinking, future electronic music. And he was like, I've been thinking, maybe we could do something. I've been talking to Pete Tong, and he's quite into the idea, and so he should come in. And basically, it was mainly just through Phil. What were you playing at the time? The PM Scientists? What was I playing? I was playing what I would consider to be what was the most future-sounding form of electronic music at the time, which was drum and bass. But the more scientific, kind of faux-text, source-direct, clue... That sound, the more kind of less heavy kind of Bristol bass lines and jump up, you know, more acute attention to production details. The scientific end. The scientific angle, hence the PM scientists thing. Because at that time, which was what, the mid-90s, for me, there was very, you know, it wasn't the best time for house and techno, or at least maybe I hadn't discovered the right level of house and techno at that point. I mean, I was more than aware of labels like Paper and... music for freaks and classic and Matthew Herbert's label and stuff like that and I was strictly rhythm and doing some really good stuff but for me in terms of where I was at musically because remember I was a music journalist so I was constantly looking and searching for the next beat what's happening next so I wanted to stay on top of the freshest sound. And for me, that was it. When I first heard Water Margin by Fotech, for example, it completely blew my mind. Or the Samurai tunes. How were these guys getting that sound of that sword sound to cut through? speakers in such a way you know and yeah it was pretty fast music but it for me it it felt right so but it it was it was I'd say short-lived you know I wasn't a DJ per se I was I was trying to be I mean I think I think at that point that was where my my my heart was at and my head was at and um But it was a little short-lived because either side of that, breakbeat had been my love, the key to my musical excitement, whether it be in Jungle Techno. So is that the stuff with the label you were going after? when you actually know that well initially when we started discussing the idea it was but because i was listening and enjoying so many other different styles of music you know for example there'd be one week in in working those confused i'd be interviewing matthew herbert you know I think I was the first person to actually interview him, actually. And the next week I could be interviewing, I don't know, Peche, but then the next week I might be interviewing Terry Callier or Chuck D or Wyclef Jean or, you know, I met all these people and I met all these people because I respected and enjoyed their music. But I just wanted to be at the forefront of a new musical movement, you know? I just wanted to be on top of the, you know, what's fresh, you know? I didn't want to be part of something that's kind of been around for a while. I just wanted to be on top of something new. With the label, though, who were some of the acts that you first signed? Who are your claims to fame? No, there's no claims to fame. There's a few actually. Max Tundra. That must have been one of his first deals. Yeah, it was one of his first records. Position Normal. Released his album. basically went to school with a friend of his, heard about his music, because he was in an outfit called Headshot before that, I think. And one of the other half of Headshot used to work in rough trade in Covent Garden. And through the process of elimination... Oh, yeah, no, hang on, I'm getting this a bit muddled. No, that's all right. But then there was this... this friend of mine Valerie Perkins who was a friend of his and she connected us and then I was like well what are you doing I went to meet this guy Chris Bailiff and went into his house and on the wall was like this kind of green parka jacket with a yellow bollard head thing on top of it with a parka I'll go over it. And I was like, what's that? And he's like, that's my stage outfit. And in the house, there was all these crazy toys and different kind of musical, crazy instruments. And I was like, can you play? It's kind of the moment you know. Hmm? It's kind of the moment you're like, well, I have to sign this guy. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I hadn't even heard a beat. And then he put on his music and it was like, sunny, sunny, sunny days with you. I was just blown away. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. He'd made this incredible music. And he was a true artist. He was probably the first true artist I worked with. Anyway, so that was him and then there was my best friend, Johnny, who was the lead singer in this band called Lisp, who I managed to get a proper record deal signed to London for and they were kind of like a radio-heady, massive attack type thing but coming more from a... Morrissey writing background as opposed to you know so that was a very interesting move who else I worked with DJ Skits I worked with Turing Breaks so yeah these were all people that kind of you know were in my world and I released a few records for them we did this crazy tour once where we It was called No Division. Actually, I believe Red Bull were really into working with me and they helped me put together this really amazing... book with a five inch CD on the front or something which didn't work in most people's Macs at the time it was a fucking cool project though it looked really good if anyone out there has got one of these things please let me know because it was called A Different Noise I did a compilation actually there's a compilation the label was called Mind Horizon by the way that was my first ever label Why Mind Horizon? It was a very spacey, drum and bass style idea. The house sleeve was the vision of the moon. It sounds very much of the time. Yeah, it very much was. So it started life in my... my mind as a forward-thinking drum and bass project then it was originally the whole idea for my label was going to be it was a let's take one of the best drum and bass producers of the moment get them to make something incredible find someone else and get them to make a more alternative thing which might be house techno hip-hop or trip-hop or whatever Then get a, for the side three, find a track, license an original track that a lot of people were using as a sampling for breaks or whatever. And what was the fourth idea? It was a remix of that. That was essentially my first vision for what my record label should be. And it became Mind Horizon and the first Mind Horizon was an EP but actually I kind of dropped the drum and bass element although I did a couple of drum and bass records and I worked... Oh, Alex Attias. Do you remember Alex Attias? Yeah. He did an amazing track called Dark Jazz on Versatile. Okay. And so, yeah, I worked with some really, really interesting people. So that was my first record label. But yeah, the... What happened with the drum and bass thing? Was it just your mind was running too fast in too many different directions? I like too many things. Or was it something else? What, that I kind of left it? Yeah, I mean like the label. Was it a drum and bass label? Well, at the time, you know, in searching for the perfect new sound and discovering drum and bass, I kind of decided, I persuaded... ultimately the editor of Days Confused that we should be the first magazine to do a proper feature on drum and bass. And I really started to get my teeth into it. How hard was that to do? Not as difficult as you'd think because... Our office at the time was in Curtin Road and Old Street and we were pretty much the only, you know, cool company in that area, in the whole of Shoreditch with the exception of the Blue Note, which I think was still called the Double Bass Club then, I think. Anyway, so there was nothing there. I mean, it was a very different place. I'd taken Jefferson to a couple of parties and played him some music and he was really getting into it. Jefferson Hacker was the editor. And then the office next door to us was Trace Magazine. Okay. And Trace Magazine was heavily into Jungle. There was this thing going on, you know, and London just felt like it was right. Metalheads was starting to really happen on a Sunday just up the road from us at the Blue Note. But I started to investigate this scene. and I came across, I started to hang out with Pesce and he started to introduce me to some interesting people and I started to go to some raves and some parties and then I met Zoe Richardson and, you know, she basically... introduced me to the whole scene. Were there certain DJs that really got you? Or was it just the music and the energy of it? Or was it both? There was moments in Drum and Bass or Jungle Parties where it was so mesmerizing and so exciting you'd almost wet yourself. I'm serious, man. I remember... Let's take Pesce, for example, okay? So here's a guy who'd been around for a while. I didn't know too much about him. He lived in the same area as me. and I interviewed him for some other magazine. So I started to get to know him. What I didn't know about him was that he'd been a DJ and a producer on the scene for a while. He did one of the very first tracks on Good Looking. But then he got sick. He had some crazy illness and he was sick and he was in hospital for a while. And it took him a while to recover and he was kind of out of the game for a bit. And this was around the time that I started to get into him. And also at the same time, Giles Peterson and James Lavelle and that crew were getting into drum and bass. The jazzier side, which Pesce, I guess, was part of. And Adam F. Circles and, you know, it was around that time. And so imagine this. At this time, I've come to get to know him. He's about to make his comeback return, right? His comeback gig at Metalheads on a Sunday night at the Blue Note. And he invites me. to go along with it. So, we got there in the car and I'm like, you know, it's going to be a cool night and I'm really looking forward to hearing him play. I hadn't expected, you know, what I saw that night. What I saw that night was pretty much the trendiest, coolest people in all of London cooing around the block, right? to hear this guy being kind of introduced by Goldie in person before he played, Cleveland Watkiss emceeing, every tune that he played, he had the freshest dub plates out of all of them. Every tune that he played was stopped twice or two or three times. With the place going ballistic. I've never seen anything like it before or since. You know, just the whole energy of when the drum and bass parties or the jungle parties were good, there was nothing quite like it. I long to see parties go off in the way that they did. Ridiculous. I know anyone who's listening to this who's into that scene. will know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact, recently someone did like a thing on Twitter called Jungle Memories. And someone told me about it and I got on board and had a look. I was reading through these things and some of the most incredible moments in time, you know, parties like Raw. the place in Tottenham Court Road. You'd go down the stairs, it had the kind of leopard print. I'm talking to an American, sorry. You know, rage. Of course. There was so many incredible, incredible parties. And yeah, the whole scene was just exciting. It was so vibrant. The fact that this was before you could play CDs in a club or MP3s or USBs. If you wanted to play a new track, which you had to if you wanted to mark yourself out differently from anyone else. You had to go to Music House in London or one of the places in Bristol basically to cut and acetate. What do you take from those days that you still feel like is actually really applicable to what you're doing? Well, actually, that is very much part of what I do now because I thrive on playing music for the first time. Not because it's like, oh, I'm the only one that's got this. More that if I feel I've discovered something that it's going to affect people in such a dramatic way, then I can take a little bit of joy out of its following success and that's good enough for me. But there's nothing like dropping a tune for the first time, knowing that no one's ever heard this before, with the exception of the person who's just made it, and watching a room light up. There's nothing like that. And that's one of the main reasons why I DJ. And so maybe that answers... No, especially these days. For a lot of people, it's not dub plates, but it is that dub plate culture idea of having tracks that no one else does or edits or whatever it is because that's, these days, it's all you've got in terms of making your sets unique and special. Yeah. It's very difficult these days. It's far more difficult than it was then. I mean, then you had to either know the producers or be in Music House at the time and to basically persuade one of the DJs who's cutting a particular track to let you have it, which was very rare nonetheless. And there was a whole scene, you know. It was something that, you know, we lack now. In the same way that people tell me about, or what I've read about, when disco tunes were being imported into London and Soho for the first time. And there was two or three... particular stores that would be buying them in and word would get out that a particular track was arriving at a certain time on a certain day and you had to be there before it arrived queuing up to get your you know one of the 20 copies that were arriving you know that afternoon and if you didn't if you weren't there you're not going to get that track for another couple of weeks so I don't know what it is about our music that makes people so intent on going full on out of their way to get hold of the freshest new thing. But for me, like I said, it's not that I want to be bigger and better or quicker or faster than other people. It's just that I thrive on... owning or possessing or having the opportunity to offer out and to play out something that other people have never heard before. or that I know or believe is going to fuck their heads up, you know, in a very positive fashion. Yeah. How do we get from Mind Horizon to City Rockers? You said, you know, you left that label because they wanted you to make a decision. Well, okay, so Phil Howes, who I mentioned earlier. We'd had a good time working together. We really had. We'd really enjoyed working together, enjoyed getting to know each other. We'd become very close friends. We were starting to share a musical connection. and we were at a time in the year 2000, I believe that was, when house music and techno and drum and bass all seemed to feel a little stale, you know. London FFRR just released the Artful Dodger, which had, like, kind of taken the... garage scene into the charts and so that was kind of dead you know it just it was a stale time for music and it was pretty much at that time that I started to I was very lucky there was one element of what I was doing at London Records that was so good for me and for my future and that was that I was lucky enough to be given free reign at all the record stores in London right so because they had money and you know there was still a lot of money being thrown around in the record industry at that point I had an open account with my favourite record stores So that was Rough Trade. Fat Cat, Atlas. There's another one, I don't remember the name of it. Basically, I would go into these record shops on a weekly basis, listen to everything. and walk out with whatever I wanted. And in some cases, some of the shops allowed me to take back anything that I didn't have time to, or took by mistake, do you know what I mean? And my receipts for my record-buying missions were ridiculous, but London were paying for it, and ultimately it led to me kind of being able to... get my head around what the world at large is releasing musically, whether it be jazz or hip-hop or minimal techno, which is what I started to discover around 1998, 1999, 2000. So suddenly I started to find myself always coming out of certain record shops with the new Perlon or the new Compact or the new... B pitch or I guess they were the key labels at the time that I was starting to discover that actually there's something else starting to happen and just at that time took over London Records and Phil Howes left the building, let's say. And along with some of the artists who we'd been getting quite close to, one of which was Felix the House Cat. And Felix had a deal with London which kind of also ended. And Phil and Felix started to have a chat and then they brought me into it and basically we... He came up with this, Phil basically came to me and told me that with his redundancy money he wanted to start a new record label and would I like to do it with him, with my official role being the head of A&R and us pretty much kind of being, you know, running this thing called City Rockers, which we... Why did he take Felix with him? Why was he one of the guys? Because Felix the house cat was one of the most visionary artists of that moment because Felix had the foresight to also see what was happening in Germany, specifically in Berlin. And also through his connections with people like Dave the Hustler and some of the guys from, I think, from Vienna and Miss Kitten. and some of his friends in New York, he realised that there was something new happening in dance music and started to create what became essentially Electro Clash. And the album that we signed as our first artist album was Felix and the... Kittens and the Glitz. And Silver Screen Shower Scene was City Rockers number one. It's interesting because I rarely... I guess looking back on it retrospectively, I don't think a lot of people would say Perlon or B-Pitch or whatever these labels would have had much to do in the genesis of it. No, they were the labels that I was discovering. Yeah, but I'm just saying that kind of was an influence perhaps on the background music because Felix Ben, Ice Kitten and all these people put... had so much personality that that kind of overwhelmed, you know. Yeah. You could hear compact. in there in a way except someone was singing over it and it was a little bit more driven by personality. Well the dance music was lacking personality and Felix was larger than life and when he introduced us to Miss Kitten we saw in her a fantastic artist and fitting into this whole kind of monotone very cool, cold as ice, stylish thing that around at the same time was connecting to things like Chicks on Speed Chicks on Speed yeah thanks yeah so what she was doing was connecting to Chicks on Speed and DJ Hell and so then I started to put all these things together and think actually I need to go to Berlin I would have thought you would have gone to Munich if it was DJ Hell. Yes, but Love Parade was just about to happen. And DJ Hell was putting on a massive gigolo party at... I don't remember the club. Felix was going to be there and I decided actually this is time for me to go to Berlin and to meet some of these people and to see what's happening there. Because I'd heard, you know, things and read a few bits and pieces. And yeah, so I came here and I met people like... Ellen Alien and Ellen invited me to her office which is the same office she has just up the road now 10-12 years on and she'd already released I think about 30 or 40 singles and which she gave me a copy of each and every one of them I remember having to buy another record case after that first trip to Berlin to bring home all the music that I was being given and then I guess I met DJ Hell and we talked about the TIGA Sunglasses at Night record and we licensed that. for the UK and put that in the charts. You did a lot of licensing. We did because, um, because I guess we were just trying to get our heads around what was happening with dance music. And, um, there was, you know, there was this scene here in Berlin and in Munich and Cologne, uh, and in Hamburg and Frankfurt that was, which, there was something happening in Germany that was very much related to the Detroit sound but was taking things in a slightly new direction and we felt, or certainly I felt, that I wanted to be part of that world because it was fresh, you know, there was something really exciting and interesting happening. It was pop music but with electronic beats and a kind of housey stroke techno-y vibe. But there was also people making songs with vocals and then on the flip side coming out of that there was some really amazing, really cool underground deep house and techno artists emerging. Swayzak for example. Pure science I remember. going to him and getting really into him. I remember talking to Swayzak and one of the guys was saying that he wasn't listening. anything that was coming out from the UK for the most part at the time. It was all prolonged records that he was kind of influenced by when he started doing stuff. And this was influencing me and I needed something. I needed to find something because there was nothing in the UK and I was living in London which is supposedly the most happening city in the world and there was no fucking decent music to listen to anywhere. Drum and bass had kind of reached that saturation point. There was just, you know, the wave scene was kind of, felt like it was like dying on its heels. And there was really nothing. The whole trip up Moet's thing was kind of like, you know, almost over. It seems like a lot of things started around that turn of the century. A lot of things what? A lot of things started around turn of the century. Like it was a kind of a point where people were like... not sure what's going on. And then you look back and I think it was Fabric starting in 2000 or 2001. Yeah. And... a couple of other things and it was just building up steam and trying to figure out what it is they were and where we were going from there. And I guess I found myself at the forefront of that because we created this new dance label that had a bit of a different mission. We were looking more to Europe. for music. And if that meant that we had to license a couple of records that had existed prior or had recently been released elsewhere but had no... You know, imagine, I was one of the very few people in London, and I'm not the only person, but there was very few people that was aware of this music, you know, aware of labels like the ones that we're talking about. So, and I felt that there was a bigger opportunity for some of this music. So yeah, so that's pretty much how City Rockers came to start life. Did you feel like when the label started that you had an idea of what that sound was going to be? That Felix was the guy and that it was all sort of coalescing? Or was it maybe even that trip to Berlin where you were like, oh, okay, this is the thing that this is going to be? I just remember there was a WMF, VMF, that particular love parade party. And I distinctly remember Felix actually introducing me to some of the leaders of the music world and other people as well that were there to check this out, like Arthur Baker, for example. And I also met Kiki and Silver Surfer that day. But we'll come to that a bit later on. But yeah, I mean, yeah, I think we have a lot to thank Felix for, really. Well, I do, because he, I mean, we were both kind of running in tandem. I was also discovering this music. But the fact that all the planets collided, I think. and out of it we found a kind of common pursuit there wasn't any point where Phil from City Rockers and I sat down and went right what is the direction of this music now what's the direction of the label it just started to happen naturally Unfortunately, we did get tainted with this Electro Clash brush, which was a bit unfortunate because... I think a lot of people get tainted with that brush. Yeah, but it wasn't our intention. And it certainly wasn't. If you go back and listen to the output of City Rockers and what I did sign, there's only like a handful of records. Just so happens that they were the big records and we made them into hit records. Like Sunglass at Night or like Silver Screen. Chelsea or Colour Sound Fly Away which was a bit less you know electroclash but but we but but but because we were quite cool you know and I'd come from days of confused background and Phil was an old punk and we were heavily into the Clash and the Clash actually gave City Rockets its name. So because we had this element of call and this credible kind of thing that we were doing, the design of our sleeves and everything was pretty out there. we kind of got the attention of like-minded people in New York by DFA when they started. This was all happening at the same time. And Larry T and what he was doing with his party in Brooklyn. And, you know, so Electro Clash was a thing that Larry T, I believe, did create. And we did go to New York and do a party with him. But that shouldn't have made us an Electro Clash label. Because in between all those big records, I was releasing... the most underground techno and house. There's a record on City Rockers by a guy called Rob Waitman, who was a guy that I'd met when I did Mind Horizon, and he'd come back into my life and played me this music. There's this track that's absolutely phenomenal that we put out from him. There's so much amazing music. Daniel Diamond, that track, so many tracks, I can't remember them all now. Did you actively at some point be like, come on, go into interviews and such and be like, it's not Electro Clash. Yeah, I did. But we didn't do ourselves any favours because we did this party called 21st Century Body Rockers. place called Cynthia's Robotic Bar in London Bridge. It already sounds like you know. Yeah, of course it does. And we had this guy called Elton who did the door and he was really well known in the kind of Soho kind of clubby fashiony scene. And the party became like the basically What's the name of that legendary club during the 80s in London that Steve Strange did? This is why I'm talking to people like you. Come back to me. Anyway, so we had this thing and we were inadvertently creating a scene. just by the nature of our look and our feeling and some of the records that we were releasing and some of the people that we were being associated with. And suddenly we had the coolest club in London with queues around the block of people with make-up and crazy clothes and people were fucking in the toilets and there was mirrors everywhere in the club. But we did some amazing things. we discovered the Scissor Sisters. And we were supposed to sign them to City Rockers, but unfortunately we brought them to the party to play. And we had someone who was really pretty rubbish at doing the sound engineering at the party. And when it came for them to come out and do their first ever live performance in... in the UK at our party, nothing worked. Consequently, the Scissor Sisters decided not to sign to us, which is a bit of a shame. But, you know, we were creating something really happening, really vibrant. But, yeah, suddenly I was getting a bit worried because I wasn't really so much about the make-up. you know, the dressing up, you know, from, from doing that PM scientist party back in the mid nineties, um, to that point in 2001, 2002, I stopped DJing. I didn't DJ at all because I couldn't find any music I wanted to play, you know? So I, After I got fed up with the drum and bass and felt that was getting a bit stale and a bit dull, I just stopped trying to be a DJ. I just kind of stopped and I just concentrated on doing these record labels. It wasn't until 21st Century Bodyrockers that I started to discover my new sound, or my sound. And it was, you know, the DJs, the resident DJs at that party were Errol Walken. He'd just started doing Trash, but on a Monday at the end. He was the resident. F.C. Kahuna, who we were working with, and we released their amazing album on City Rockers. Soul Wax. would come and play every gig, right? And me. And no one knew me. I was the warm-up DJ. And I didn't pretend to know what I was doing, but I was starting, I just had realised that actually there's some music now that I really like and I'm going to try and put some, you know... of sound together and it was actually in those parties that my closest friends came to me and said you know what you're actually pretty good and you know you should maybe think about you know getting on this because actually we're listening to what you're doing and it's really good So that was the point, really, for me, that a lot of things changed. Did City Rockers have the couple of compilations, mixed CDs from you? Yeah, we did. I guess that was after your friends had come to you. Yeah, but check this out. The first compilation, Futurism, on City Rockers, the pink one. You won't see my name on the front because I was unknown. I was no one. I was a no one. It was City Rockers that was the draw. Yeah, it was City Rockers presents Futurism, which was my idea. Basically, that was the culmination of everything that was going on. That was me going to, travelling to Germany and meeting these people. It definitely seemed like defining documents. Yeah, but you will just find my name on a small print. But that was me. I did all of that. And I, you know, that was just around that same time. And we talked about it a lot, Phil and I, and we decided, actually, no, let's leave my name off it. No one really knows who I am. Probably doesn't care. And so, yeah, so I did those two compilations, Futurism 1 and 2, the pink and the green one. Did it feel at the time like you were trying to say something about what was going on? Yeah, of course. I was really excited about it because it felt like I was onto something, you know. But I wasn't needing to shout about it. I was like, okay, let's put this out. see, you know, let's make a lot of the City Rockers material, plus a lot of the music I'm discovering from different people, and then, you know, with some of the artists I was meeting, maybe asking them to make something specifically for it, and basically everything I do now, that was my first. real opportunity to make a mix CD. And it did really well. I mean, it sold, I don't know, many thousands of copies. Was DJing like riding a bike for you? No, I used to be really shit. So when you started back up again, it was tough. for a bit well listen if you're trying to when you're trying to mix drum and bass it's not easy if you're not very good you know it's very fast and very intricate and pretty tricky I learned from the masters you know I went to I went to watch my favourite DJs and I studied what they did because I love DJing. I bought decks when I was 14. I always wanted to be a DJ, but I wasn't very good at it. When I first started buying music when I was age 12, I found out about what DJs do. I used to count the beats with my fingers and with a watch, looking at my watch, counting 15 seconds onto the beats and then timesing it by four and then figuring out what the BPM was. And then I'd write on a sticker the name of the track and whatever on the top right of the record sleeve with the BPM. And when you were a teenager? When I was 12, mate. Huh. Yeah, when I was 12. Yeah, so, and I bought Technics 1210s and a Newmark Mixer Sampler 1775A when I was 14 years old. But during that period between the drummer bass thing, starting Mind Horizon and doing the 21st Century Body Rockers parties for City Rockers, I stopped DJing entirely because, like I said, there was no music that I wanted to play. How long did it take you to get back up to speed? Oh, a little while. A little while. I guess luckily you were the opening DJ. Yeah. I remember fucking up quite badly actually one night at Body Rockers doing the most awful mix and being so devastated. And I remember DJ Hell was coming on after me and I remember being so embarrassed. I was so embarrassed. And I realized that, you know... if I am going to do this then I've got to do it right I've got to work hard at this I went back to the bedroom I went back to the bedroom I started going back to the record shops every day and I started getting into work for City Rockers late because I'd be up all night mixing and my headphones on and annoying the missus but you know I'd like to think it was worth it I think you're doing alright for yourself now now it is a little bit like riding a bike now I laugh really I laugh a lot when I fuck up because obviously I still fuck up. Everyone fucks up every now and then on the decks. But now I find it really funny, especially if it's really bad. There's nothing quite like a massive clanger. I'm very at ease with my style of DJing at the moment. So, you know, if I do fuck up, it's just essentially a fuck up. You know, if something goes wrong or, you know, whatever. And if it's really bad, it's like, you know, I do like to turn the music down straight away and apologise quite profusely. So you already touched upon it, the end of City Rockers, but walk me through that a little bit. I mean, because it was almost immediate that Crosstown started up. It wasn't a very happy period for me, to be honest. because I was starting to move in a particular direction and Phil, and I hope Phil doesn't mind me talking about this, I'm sure he doesn't, but considering I still work with him now because he's at K7. doing very well for himself because he's such a great bloke but at that point we were starting to go in slightly different musical directions I was wanting to take the city rockers proper underground I wanted to get to the heart of what I was discovering Phil Lobos, Michael Mayer some of the artists I was coming across would just blow my mind, but the music wasn't sunglasses at night. It was pretty underground, intricate, delicate, beautiful. I imagine you get to a point, especially when you have chart stuff like that, and even without thinking about it, it just happens. There's no... pressure expectations and investments made where it's like you kind of have to continue this well what happens is you come if you get used it's like anything with success you get used to a certain degree or level of of of that success and I guess for some people you can't go, right, that last single entered the UK national charts at number 19 and then have your next record sell 50 copies because it's so underground. Some people can't handle that. Personally, I wanted to do that. At that point, what we'd created had become a bit of a monster. And then along came this band called Fish Spooner. And the Ministry of Sound signed them for the most ridiculous amount of money. And then they came to us and asked us if we would help them support that signing by, I guess, giving them some of our credibility by doing a label partnership joint venture for City Rockers with Ministry of Sound. and it was just not a feasible opportunity for me. But Phil had other personal issues, and his lifestyle was different to mine at the time. So you immediately just went? off into created crosstown rebels or was there a bit of space? Well there was another few factors. Phil had asked me to start developing a more alternative angle to city rockers and he was keen for me to maybe discover some more alternative music, some signs and bands basically to the label. Yeah, you know, but I wasn't. I'm massively averse to it because my love of music is very broad. I was a big massive fan of a lot of bands at that time. The bands like The Strokes, they were actually coming to our parties. So there was a cohesion. I mean, Trash I think is the perfect example. Yes, Trash is the perfect example. And Errol's, the way that Errol kind of fused. Plus I should point out that we hired Rory Phillips to work with us as well, so that, to help us in that world. But, so I diligently, you know, went out and kind of started to divide a bit of my time from between techno and more alternative rock, shall we say. And I discovered a band called The Duke Spirit and a band called The Warlocks. And we signed both of them to the label. Unfortunately what I didn't realise was that there was a bigger picture and the bigger picture was that the bands wouldn't actually be released ultimately on City Rockers. They would be sold to another label. And I didn't want to waste my time doing that once that became clear. So the combination of not really wanting to work with ministry at that point and wanting to retain my kind of level of underground. stature I guess and the fact that I was like been working really hard with these bands that I've really started to grow to love you know I mean the Duke Spirit had just broken broke records I think Solomon actually when when I discovered them they just I found the seven inch single got in touch with them just to find that they're just split up and went to meet them and met Layla and Luke and basically persuaded them to, off the back of what they were playing me, you can't split up because you guys are amazing. became the Duke Spirit and we signed them. So yeah, so it wasn't a particularly happy time for me, in all honesty. And so then I had to make a big decision. What do I do now? And it's an interesting story what happened because with this band, the Warlocks, American band, who were 10-piece, proper psychedelic, druggy, heroin-induced, like proper Velvet Underground style kind of, you know, just smacky, you know, rock out business. And proper psychedelic, really fitted in with my, in tune with where I was at at the time as well. And I decided that, okay, for their first single, I'm going to get a really cool remix done. And I met these guys in Berlin, Kiki and Yanis, Silver Surfer. And I commissioned a remix from them for this track called Shake the Dope Out. And the remix was so good, right, for me, was just like the future of where I was going with dance music. It was so good that when I took it into the other people I worked with and they didn't really like it, I decided to, at that point, leave City Rockers. take the Warlocks vocals off of that track and ask Keek and Silver Surfer to find someone else to re-record it and they would then become the first artists on Crosstown Rebels. You had no idea what you wanted to do with it, you just knew that it had to be underground, Crosstown Rebels. Same way with City Rockers, I suppose. What, I had no idea what to do with the label? Sound-wise. Yeah, I know I had an idea. I had an idea because I thought at that point, okay, I need to have more of a vision. I need more of a vision for where this is going. First of all, the two Futurism albums have been so successful that I wanted to somehow bring that into my new organisation. so I had that firmly in my mind that I could maybe create you know the next level of because I was doing starting to do a bit better as a DJ at that point as well I had an agent you know and It's a big city. You know, I played at Sonar, you know. Yeah. And in Ibiza, you know, so, you know, things are starting to take shape for me there. But with the label, I decided that, you know, I put so much heart and soul into City Rockers that my next project had to be linked in some way. So, in a very little minor way. So I took the initials. And then I thought long and hard about what I wanted this new label to be. And I came up with Crosstown Robots. Even from an outside perspective, I always just generally, when I wasn't paying that close attention to it, I always was like, what is the connection there? So you did a good job. Thank you. It felt like there was something tying it together. couldn't quite make it out yeah well then the other thing was of course that I I then created Crosstown Rebels presents rebel futurism mixed by Damien Laszlo because I figured that the time was kind of right for me to you know try and you know something as a DJ as well at the same time as having this label. So you wanted definitely to be a DJ as much as have a label at that time? I always wanted to be. DJ I mean who doesn't want to be a DJ? A name DJ I guess not that that's necessarily a big difference you wanted the DJ to be as big as the label as opposed to before the or have the chance to I don't know I think that Listen, if I'm totally honest with you, I never really ever had aspirations to be a DJ in the Swedish house mafia level of DJing. I never foresaw playing to thousands and thousands of people. And the very first time I did, I almost shat myself. I guess I just ask it in the sense that it seemed like with City Rockers, at the very least, that the label... was much bigger than anything attached to it. And maybe with rebel futurism, it was like... I see where you're angling. I don't want you to answer. I just want to put that out there in front of you. Is this a psychiatry session? I just want to allow you to potentially dismiss it or say... No, listen, like I said, at that point I had an agent. I was starting to discover playing in Ibiza. I was starting to travel a little bit and I was starting to get a real taste of what it could be like to be a DJ, you know. But at no point did I... So it felt completely natural to put your name in. Yes. No, it did. In no sense. I'm being totally honest with you. If you don't believe this, then it's up to you. I totally do. But at no point did I think to myself, I need to start a label so I can be a big DJ. Right. That wasn't the reason. I... Yes, I always wanted to be a DJ from the age of 12, but I'm not contrived enough to do it in that way. I then spent, by the time that... came around I'd spent enough years as an A&R guy you know as the person that finds new music and works with artists to know that that was really also what I wanted to do and I wasn't there was never a case of one needs to be more more successful than the other you know this is something that still you know troubles me and I guess some other people to this day you know because I'm the guy from the label, but I'm also the DJ, you know? So, um, cause I, you know, I consider myself to be an artist, but I'm also a businessman. So it's also trying to balance, always trying to balance that, you know, that, that very, how do you balance that? Oh, You put your record out on Get Physical, for example. And I remember talking to you at the time and you were like, I thought long and hard about putting it on a different label. Yeah. It seems like that's tied up into that. Well, it is. that I think I made the right decision. I feel very good about the decision I made to do that and the reason simply is that the time that I decided to come out of my production shell and finally get into the studio properly and create a body of music, a collection of tracks that I... stand by and want you know knew that i would always stand by you know for the rest of my life as the ultimate damien lazarus you know musical creation you know um that when it came to deciding how to release it i had a number of artists signed to cross town rebels who I felt that if I was to release that album on my own label, they would feel potentially that, what's this all about? Why are we signed to this label where the guy that runs the label wants to release his own music? or his own album on that label. Now, I know a lot of people that do that successfully, but I felt that I wanted to stand by the... stand by the initial reason that those artists had signed to my label. I would look after them and have their best interests at heart and push their music and support them and not put myself over and above what they do. felt that if I released Smoke the Monster out on Crosstown Rebels, some of my artists would undoubtedly be a bit worried about it. And they would have a good reason to be, because I'm a bit of a control freak. And if I released the album on my own label, I would undoubtedly have pushed my staff to work that record as hard as they bloody could. And it could have caused some tensions and some issues if I had other artists releasing music around the same time. So I decided, right, there are... Well, there was a few labels that were interested in signing the record. And I decided, well, I have... Two very, very good friends in Germany who have pretty much started their label a little bit just before I started my label, who I met at a very early stage in the creation of Crosstown Rebels and I became very close friends with. Philip and Patrick Brandy and their label Get Physical and they they believed in my record so much and I believed in them as people so much that I was very happy to to give it to them to release album wise also at the time Get Physical still I mean they're so not dance floor in a lot of ways with a lot of different bands and I think your album which goes in a lot of different directions like fit really really well with everything that they were doing yeah because they had nose and they had they had a couple of bands I feel like too which you know I think people forget about when they think about Get Physical in a way? Because the albums seem like a very different thing than the singles that they do. Yeah. Well, I think we... Definitely Philip and I, we're very close. And we share a musical heritage. And also, we have quite a lot in common with our... you know, our working lives as well. You know, he used to be an art virgin. Sure. So, and Patrick, on the other hand, was a writer, you know, he was a journalist. So, yeah, we had a lot in common. So, yeah. That's why I made that decision, and I'm very happy that I made that decision. So let's go back to the first Cross Town phase. I mean, you, let's see, early on, first couple records, the distribution. Fucked up. Yeah. Or was it Ideal was the company? It was. I remember, yeah. It was Ideal. And the reason I went with Ideal was because they were friends of ours from London. Leon Oki was working at... uh classic as label manager and um I'd started I was very good friends with him and with Rob Mello and you know that was our crew you know our group of friends you know back in the Matthew Stiles Matthew Stiles of course um uh Ed Cartwright, you know, and our group of friends were, you know, were all working in the industry in some capacity. And our friend Nick and Neil were running Ideal. Just to throw this in now in case I forget that. I'll forget this in the future. But we still work with these guys now. Well, Leon's the label manager. Leon is now the label manager of Crosstown Rebels. And Neil and Nick... run the mastering studios that we cut all our music at. And Dan Hill, who was the assistant at Freaks and Classic, is now running Aboveboard Distribution, which we put our vinyl through. I'm a very kind of... Loyal. I don't know what the word is, but I like to work with friends. A lot of people say, oh, you shouldn't work with friends and mix business with pleasure. I like to do that because when you work with friends, you get that level of love and respect and support when you need it. And sometimes things don't work out. Sometimes they do. And unfortunately, after the second release on Costan Rebels, that company fucked up. And yeah, so that kind of gave me an early insight into the difficult days that we'd have ahead. But, you know... You soldiered on almost immediately. Yeah, it was almost immediately because it wasn't... Well, I'll tell you why. The reason was because my first single on Crosshand Rebels, Sleazer by Kiki and Silver Surfer, was something of a revelation, I think. you know people really picked up their ears when they heard it and they saw this first release on this new label and liked the look of the design and um and the feel of the sound. Let's talk about the design for the moment, by the way. How did you differentiate it from City Rockers? Because you touched on that it was... Yeah, I didn't veer away too far. I think with City Rockers, we had the thing where we'd have the label name in block. at the top of the sleeve which I've moved across to Crosstown. The first designer of Crosstown Rebels is this amazing Swedish dude who I worked with for a few years, Daniel Koch. and he was living in London and his graphic design work was blowing me away and I basically gave him the job of helping me design Crosstown Rebels. I should point out that I pretty much have a very strong hand in every element of the design and artwork that we do, even now with everything. So we work together. I would go and sit with him over the course of a month, working every other night in his house, going through ideas. strategies, you know, design strategies. How can we take, how can we take this artwork from this first single into the second and third? And then how can we take that into the first album? And then how can we take that into the first party that we throw? And it was, you know, I wanted to kind of get this right, you know? So, so yeah, so then the, Then we moved to Intergroove. We got some good press on the first couple of releases. I think the second release was the Pressler Boys, Electric Generation. And the third release was Stuart Price in Disguise. which actually almost kind of stands out as a sore thumb right now. It's a funny record, S&M. It's a great record, but it's a funny one. I don't know if I would sign it today, but I did back then. But I almost kind of slipped up a little bit because I think it kind of gave maybe a slightly wrong impression too early on. I think that's an interesting thing you say. You, of all people, as a person who's been in the media, knows that the first couple of releases for a label can have a huge impact. Yeah. And to their detriment or to their success? I think that I had to give myself the opportunity to work outside of a format with the sound for Crossrail Rebels from the very beginning. And that's why I... That's the hardest thing to create at all. It's a big risk. It's a massive risk. but I knew that if I didn't take the risk then it could be a lot harder to do what I really wanted to do later. Yeah. So I took the risk then and the fourth record or the fourth record the fifth record was you know that Wired Up also by Keegan Silver Surfer which was you know, that proper cologne, what do you call it, shuffle sound, you know? So in the first five releases alone, everything was very different from one another, but I like to think that it was being put together in a new kind of exciting kind of label way, you know? So yeah, I took a big risk in the very beginning of the label. Listen, the thing is with record labels, you either go one sound that everyone that is into that sound will always follow and always buy, and they're going to buy every release, they're going to treat the label like a monthly magazine that they... put up on their shelf they get the next one get the next one it's never going to veer too far away from the original sound that they got into it for in the first place or you try and surprise people and hope that people trust you enough to go back and listen to the next one and I never I like to think there are people that have every release on the label I know there are some because people write to me and they tell me and I've seen it with my own eyes in certain people's houses. I love that. I mean, it's amazing. But I never expect everyone to buy every release because it's impossible that there's other people out there that have exactly the same music taste as I do. And essentially, this is my project. This is my, I release music because I like it, you know, and I hope that other people will like it. Nowadays, it's just slightly more informed decisions. I know that people will like something as opposed to hope that they will. When did you feel like you got that touch? A couple of weeks ago. Finally? Well, it was last Tuesday. I was drinking a cup of tea. No, I don't know, man. That's a good question. Was it with City Rockers? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, I think so. I think probably Colour Sound. Fly With Me, that was probably one that when I thought to myself, here's a record that not many people would have looked at twice and put it into the charts. And then it got reissued and re-released and licensed and was on every compilation. I think then. But it's been a number of times. The Speechless record, for example, was almost another interesting manoeuvre for Crossland Rebels. But I knew that there was going to be people into the shuffle, the shuffley, wired-up track or the kind of electronic sounds of Frankie Flowers, The Key, that would understand and appreciate a record like that. Even if it doesn't sit particularly easily next to those tracks. I remember when we were putting the first Crosstown compilation together, I was trying to put that track... with some of the others or when I started to actually listen, you know, in chronological order of all the A-side singles that we had on Crossdown and trying to fit them together. Thank God we have this thing called a remix. Straighten things out. Straighten things out, yeah. But no, you know, I'm... I'd stand by every record I've ever signed. I'm very proud of everything I've ever signed and everyone I've worked with. Everything I've been involved with has given me some element, a lot of reasons to be very happy and honoured and humbled that I've had the opportunity to work with some of this great music and these great artists. Sometimes relationships don't always last as long as you'd hope and things happen along the way. But essentially, I can always say, hand on heart, that I signed these records for the right reasons, not because they're going to make shitloads of money or walk their way onto a Mercedes TV ad or into a chart or they're going to sit at the top of a B-Port chart. That's never a reason for me to sign a record. I have to love the record, and more than that, I have to love the people that are making it, because I know that if you don't, you're going to have problems. I remember you saying, or reading, rather, you saying that when you first met Denise, that you didn't hear any of the music, you just knew you wanted to work with her. Yeah. Why was that? Well, I don't know, sometimes... Listen, I don't profess to be a magician or... Well, sometimes I do. Alchemist. But sometimes I am overcome by a feeling that I can't really explain or describe or reason with. And sometimes I meet certain people and see something in people that... It's very overpowering. I get a strong sense of emotion and interest. There are people that I've come across along the way that I've experienced that with, and she was one of them. And just the first moment I met her, I just knew that she was going to be an artist on my label for some reason, you know. And I'm so happy that that worked out because the music could have been rubbish. And then I would have been in trouble. Maybe a couple of years will work. Actually, I did have a couple of attempts at that in the past. There was one really funny story once. I think the very first time I tried to put that whole thing into practice because it's something that I've honed in on a little bit. Because when you meet someone special... It's you either just accept that you just met someone special. You just got all you think I want to investigate that person more and and once I was in this I was sitting outside this shop waiting for a friend of mine to come out of this shop and As I was sitting there in the car, I saw this amazing looking amazing looking girl with dreads walk into the store and there was something about the way that she looked. I was just like, wow, I've never seen anyone quite look like that. The fashion sense and just the way she carried herself was just amazing. So I got out of the car and I went into the shop. I think this is one of the positive things I've took from being a journalist in the past, being able to kind of... front people up whenever I wanted to, whether that's right or wrong, I don't know. But anyway, I got out of the car and I went into the shop and I said, look, excuse me, I just saw you walk into this store and, well, I don't really know what to say, but you just have a look that just tells me that you have to be a singer. And she said, oh, it's amazing, I am. and I said okay so I'd really like to hear your voice you know how can I do that and she said well I can send you something So I gave her my address and lo and behold, a couple of weeks later, I was sitting in the City Rockers office and this demo arrived and I've opened it and there's a picture of her inside and I got really excited. This is the first time this has ever happened. I showed everyone in the office, Stacey and Shane. Phil and Rory I was like guys I've got to tell you what happened I'm telling this story and I'm like look here's the cassette it was on a cassette alright so everyone's obviously like okay phone's off pen's down phone's off computer's down cassette goes in If I tell you, it was the worst piece of music I've ever heard in my life. It was like plinky-plonky, out-of-tune piano with a voice going, happy, happy, happy, I'm very happy. It was the worst demo. I hope I've still got it somewhere. So to be honest, after that occasion, I probably shouldn't have tested my sixth sense in such a way. But no, when I met Denise, I knew that she had something really special. She had a glow. She has a glow. She's an amazing artist. Absolutely, completely amazing artist. Thank goodness her voice doesn't sound like that. Sorry? Thank goodness her voice doesn't sound like that. Thank you. Just to jump ahead a tiny bit. Amato goes under. You're wondering whether you want to continue at all. Amato goes under. We continue, yeah. One amazing thing that happened through that was that... This is 2000. 2007. That's it. Thank you. Yeah. Well, before that, Intergroove had gone on. Yeah. Intergroove went and owed me a lot of money. enough money for me to be very concerned, you know. But not enough for me to close the business. And that was an important factor because I lost all this money. I then had to go to my artist and I owed this money. explain the situation and thankfully everyone was very understanding. But, and I said listen I would get back money that you owe when and if I can, if at all possible. And everyone was very cool, very understanding. And then we moved the distribution to Amato and Matthew Styles was my label manager. And just so happened that Leon Oki was working at Amato. So that kind of started to bring our thing back together again and everything was starting to look good again. And then they went bust in a very short space. But we had some really big records in that period. You were doing like a white label thing, I feel like. time with the animals yeah um i did this um yeah sasha record was supposed to come out that's right yeah come out that was the lot that was exactly at that point wow i forgot about that yeah um rebel one is the label i should put a compilation together of the rebel one tunes at some point actually but um yeah rebel one was uh and i the crazy idea i had about starting a concept label It would be 10 releases. They'd be numbered, coloured. Each artist had to be the name of an animal. No, sorry. Each artist had to be the name of a synthetic fibre or fabric. And the name of each track had to be the name of an animal. And we would never tell anyone who the... artists were oops sorry about that you just let the cat out of the bag but it's okay because it never came out well it did but it not on rebel one um so yeah um but those records did really well and i still won't say who the artists are but there's some really top flight artists that made records for that label and they did really well But then, yeah, so then, so I'd lost, I don't know, 25 grand or something, you know, through the intergroove thing and then another 35 or 40 when Amato went down and unfortunately, that was just, it was just too much. It was just too painful. And I had to have a very good look at what I was doing at that point. I couldn't afford to find that money. I didn't have that money. I wasn't making that money. I didn't have that money. And what was I going to do? This is the third time it's happened. This is boring, isn't it? Talking about money. I don't like talking about money. You moved to Los Angeles. A year later? Not more than a year later? Were these two things related? You needed a fresh start. Yeah, I needed a fresh start. I came out of a very long-term relationship at the same time. And, yeah. It seems like Los Angeles, everything's just like, here are these droog guys who are doing something, amazing weather, like this twist on a sound that you already liked kind of things happening. It just seems like a... I don't know. It seems like it was a very fortunate time for you to go out there. Fortunate? I don't know about fortunate. Fortuitous. Fortuitous. No, I've been going to Los Angeles. for a little while and I've been having some really good gigs there and been meeting some great people and ultimately the crew that I became friendly with were Duke specifically Andre. And Andre was living in a house that we became known as the bunker. And we would be doing a lot of parties there. We would go on for days. And I felt very at home there, actually. I felt very comfortable. and these guys were very big fans of the label and of the sound that we were pushing and the artists that we were promoting and working with and they wanted to get involved with this scene and we found a way to... you know work together that was beneficial to both of us and I was able to I was very fortunate to find such great people and we I managed to save Crestown Rebels literally from it being over because I couldn't put myself and my artist through that heartache anymore. You work so hard making music from the heart for people that you... you love you essentially as a DJ if you're doing it in the right way you're playing music to people you love you're giving love to people through the energy that you emit and through the music and the power of the music that you throw out there and I looked around at the people I was working with with and the amazing artists that I had coming through the label and plans I had for the future and I thought okay well if I can find a way to prevent this from going under and being the end I'm gonna do it I'm gonna give it one last go and and yeah I mean moving to LA was a big factor for me actually because it enabled me to have a fresh start did I think the music had changed? yeah but I think it's been a gradual thing over the past few years I'm constantly looking for the new thing, the next thing. Always have been since day one, you know? So... It just seems like from an outsider perspective that at the moment that the label... started again because you're looking for new artists all the time this fresh batch of artists that's sort of the moment when this whole swelling kind of came about there was something fresh happening you know meeting Meeting Denise, hanging out with, well, I guess DJing more was helping because the more I was DJing, the more traveling I was doing. The more traveling I was doing, the more partying I was doing. The more partying I was doing, the more people I was meeting. The more people I was meeting, the more music I was hearing. The more music I was hearing, the more new developments in the sound I was starting to, you know, and I started to realize that actually. Crosstown Rebels was essentially, I started it as a company that would be a global, would be something that connects people globally through the music and the feeling and the parties and the vibe and everything else. Crosstown Rebels, you know, it's like, you know, it's exactly what it is. It's like, you know, moving from one side. town and one side of the country and one side of the earth to the other, connecting people connecting people that are going against the grain musically, not doing what's expected of them, being rebels And suddenly I realised actually that's exactly what we've got now. I've got this cross town rebels. When did you realise? I think then, at that point. At that point, when I was ready to... potentially throw the towel in because it was just too heartbreaking for me to think that because people weren't buying vinyl anymore and because the whole digital change in the music industry had killed off essentially what was our business. That happened at the same time I guess I realised that actually I've created something really quite special. And to pack it in now would be ridiculous. So find any way to keep it going. Seems like the parties have been a major driving force of like, you know. cohering everything that like you know four or five artists play here together and you can kind of well that's the thing at that point you know like I was going to say as well as Denise and you know I had Jamie Jones who I'd known for many years and was you know was slowly building a friendship and relationship with him and you know getting to a point where we would work with him as an artist and knowing Johnny White and Kenny Glasgow independently from one another, but then, you know, helping to bring them together to create Art Department. You know, this was all kind of happening around the same time, and it was, I guess, that's when the rebel rave... idea started to kind of formulate and the fact that you know that we need a flagship um idea for a party that brings these people together and takes these people around together. I mean it wasn't rocket science it's not like the first time anyone's done a tour with people from different cities but but it felt really special for me doing it. Jamie, I remember talking to Matt Stiles and he said that he knew almost immediately that there was this kid was going to be something who said that Matthew Styles right to me once yeah did you also have the same oh absolutely yeah yeah absolutely um what is it about him that kind of caught you well I remember Jamie when he was um before he was DJing I guess in in uh in Ibiza you know I met him through my friend Rosanna And he was, you know, every now and then he'd get asked to warm up at, you know, privilege in the back room, you know, her party, you know. And... There's just something about Jamie that is very special. He's so humble as a person. What an interesting early life he's had, being the only black kid in a Welsh school. being so determined. to be involved in music and in the scene. He's become now such an incredibly successful artist. It's beyond most of our understanding, not understanding, of course we understand it, but it's beyond our... wildest dreams you know how big he's become now and he's growing it And he deserves every moment of it. He really does. And I'm very happy for him. It's funny you mentioned the sort of worldwide connection because one of the defining traits of the label right now is, for me at least, is the fact that, you know, you've sort of poached people from certain things that they're like. Denise, part of the Wolf and Lamb crew, one person, you know, in art department, you know, sort of was in this Toronto thing. And then Jamie Jones has this thing elsewhere. It doesn't seem like you're that interested in keeping people exclusive or like asking them to only, you know, do things for you. Is there a thing behind that? A very funny interpretation of that scenario. Or is it just all natural and this is the way it's just happened? Well, okay, you look at a label like Minus, for example, and they're a very coherent group where it's just like they only, you know, it's the crew. Yeah. Okay, so I was very aware of that from the very beginning, starting a label, that there are crews and people that live in the same city that, you know, like Freak and Sheep, for example, was Dan and his crew from Paris, you know. Compact is essentially Michael and his crew from Cologne. turbos essentially you know tigas thing in montreal so i was very aware of like how these this thing happens but i think that because i was already traveling around so much and um i've been in in this in the music record label world for so long that i wasn't really coming up with a crew, creating a little local crew in London so much. So I think because of that, I was very happy to scour the globe for, you know, interesting artists as I still am, you know. So... in terms of the exclusive thing I think artists need to feel that they have the freedom to work with their friends and maintain the relationship that they've been building with their crews and so when it comes around to someone like me kind of stepping in inviting one an artist to to join our our camp um the you know interesting discussions have to go go on and um some people are very happy to sign exclusively to another label and some people want to you know maintain a level of freedom um and um I think that we're at a point as a label now that we kind of, we have to have a level of exclusivity because we put a lot of time, effort, energy and love. into these artists' careers. Of course. It's a careful balance. Yeah, it's a careful balance. There are some people that appreciate that and there's other people that don't get it. And it's an interesting scenario. You touched on sort of associations with City Rockers. Looking at the full breadth of City Rockers, of course, it wasn't an electroclash label. I think people would say that Crosstown Rebels is a thing. It has a sound right now. People say the Crosstown Rebels sound. They probably also add Hot Creations onto that. Are you worried about that? No, because I don't agree with it. No, I don't. In fact, someone said it to me just two days ago and I pulled him up on it and I'm like, okay, well, if we have a sound, tell me what it is. What is the sound? When I wrote the blurb at the end of the year for the label thing, you know, I looked over the past year and I was like, I was going from it from the perspective of here's the label as a sound. That's why they're number one. And I looked And I was like, crap, like, I know there isn't. It's tough to find, like, because there's all sorts of different things going on. There's the DJ Harvey remix. There's the blah, blah, blah. There's the dinky. Wait till you hear what's coming up in the future. It was ridiculous, the breadth of it and the scope of it. But I think what's happened. And I love this, and it makes me feel that I've actually achieved, really achieved something. You know, this is ultimately the point, that actually people do trust us now. They trust us enough to buy and listen, to certainly listen and be interested enough to want to hear every release that we put out, because they trust, you know, what we're doing. whether that means that they kind of, you know... It's an interesting one at the moment because there's... The sound that you're talking about or hinting at is not only... We can talk about it. The sound that you're suggesting we have that's connected to, let's say, Hot Creations and Vision Quest and LM and Number 19, my favourite robot. slightly wider net but that sound is currently becoming massive like huge to the degree that there's billionaires out there wanting to throw money at it you know major music institutions wanting to get on board and there is a future for this music but what is the sound? this is the question what is the sound? I mean you have Hot Creations have just you know just released an out and out techno record from Jesse Hartrop I guess, and you know this as well as anyone, that the worry is that the sound is the big records. the sound and the Jesse Hartra record while it's great that it's released. It does showcase that the people behind the label do know and, you know, but you get into the situation where it's the five big records and everyone thinks. That's it. Yeah. Well, yes, okay. Well, that is... If you ask me if I'm worried about it, I think before I was... I wasn't sure how to handle it when it happened with City Rockers, when we got tainted with the Electro Clash thing, right? And it really bothered me that people saw me as an Electro Clash artist, stroke DJ or, you know, label, when it clearly wasn't. So... I think what's interesting at the moment is when you talk about the sound, you can't actually pinpoint what it is. So you can't actually say, oh, that's that music or that music, right? You can't do that. So you can say it's the sound of Crosstown Rebels. but when you really investigate what Christ on Rebels is all about it's a combination of very cool forward thinking heartfelt melodic inspiring underground music with every now and then a big record will come through I think the big thing though and the positive thing about all of this is that the name for the sound right now is the record labels as opposed to this genre you know because when it's the record label and then if you have to go look at the record label then you'll see the variety there yeah so when I guess that's why a lot of the artists have decided to create their own record labels yeah you know so they can you know put their stamp on you know things which is which is cool you know When journalists like me come up with a really dumb name, that's when you know you're in trouble, I guess. Well, listen, there's not that many journalists writing about our music anymore, not many places to actually read about it at the moment. I mean, fortunately... Why is that? You're probably better positioned to tell me that, but if it wasn't for Resident Advisor and things like Pulse Radio or Mixbag... electronic beats, debug, groove, I don't really know where we'd be. There's no press companies closing down, PR companies, because it's so difficult to have your music written about. I mean, no disrespect to you, but you made us album of the year. We've released about eight records already this year, and I think you've reviewed one. Sure. you know so that's how difficult it is and I don't think it's because you don't like the records I think it's because either A you don't want to show any biasedness towards us or because there's just far too many other records coming out in any given week So whatever the reason is, it is difficult to expose this music. However, we are now in a situation where our music is the music of the day and everyone wants to know about it. So something's going to happen. There's going to be new ways to promote this music. new magazines or whether they're web or print or whatever this is going to happen right uh i think you're exactly right you know like the perception from press sometimes and i'm not saying that this is necessarily the case with crosstown but you know as you well know from your days It's all about the new, the new, the new. And these days, anything that becomes any sort of popular, it's sort of like, oh, okay, what's next? What's next? And you see readers on Resident Advisor, and I'm sure writers for Resident Advisor are like, oh, Crosstown. They're so popular now. You're in a really uncomfortable position because you're based exactly at the precipice of, you know, underground. You know why this worries me, Todd? And the reason this worries me is because I've got eight artists, let's say. What am I doing? We've probably released more. and eight or nine records this year already. But let's say hypothetically we've released nine records and you've reviewed one. What worries me is I know that those other eight artists are thinking to themselves, why did my record not get reviewed? And you know what? Each one of the records we've released is brilliant in its own right. And I can safely say that without blowing my own trumpet, right? Because... I didn't make the music. These artists made this music. I just found it, right? And I'm releasing it. For some reason, you know, the records didn't get reviewed by you guys. That's fine. I understand. You can't review everything, but... But it's a shame because we've got eight records that your readership have to go and find somewhere else to find out about it. But listen, it's a whole... It's a minefield, the whole press thing. I mean, DJ Magazine doesn't seem to like us either. I don't know why that is. I try and get my head around this whole press thing and ultimately we find our own ways to tell people that are interested about what records we've got coming out we don't need writers to tell other people but it helps Sure. And we like to have nice working relationships with writers and with magazines and websites and all the rest of it. Simply because we're all doing this for the same thing. We want to create great parties. We want to showcase great artists. Somehow we need to find ways for the world at large to find out about these things. And you provide an amazing service and you guys have been super, super successful. So I don't know whether it means that there's a way to have, you know, the Crosstown Rebels, you know, section on your site where everything we release is reviewed by a decent writer who we believe will be, you know, fair. And if they don't like it, we will judge or take their opinion on it. chin and you know fair enough maybe you do that for every label that is releasing a lot of music I don't know maybe that's one way to go about it so everyone logs into their favourite labels and all those releases get reviewed you know maybe you don't just do six a week or something I don't know We trust our writers' tastes and we trust our writers to follow their passions. And sometimes writers stop writing for us and sometimes writers' passions change. Listen, I've been a music writer, mate. I know it's a difficult job and you can never win. And listen, the way I dealt with it... How did you deal with it? I'll tell you exactly. I never did a review. But I featured music that I liked. And so I figured there's so much music being released. Why bother wasting time reviewing something that's not good enough to be reviewed? Sure. Did you ever, so you never had to write a negative review? I never what? You never had to write a negative review of anything? No, never did in my life write a negative review about anything. Do you think there's any worth in that? I had the opportunity, Dazed and Confused wanted me to have a review page and I said, no, I'm not going to do a review page. Just not going to do it. I mean, instead what I did was a thing called mixtape. And that was my way to showcase maybe 20 tracks a month that I actually made a mixtape. And for anyone that was interested, send it to them. And they still do it to this day, mixtaping days, I think. But yeah, I started that as a way to just show, present, as well as the artists we were featuring in the magazine for interviews or whatever. This was one page and showcasing our 20 great tracks. Do you think there's any worth in a negative review? You said, you know, slagging off someone you saw. No, not really. Unless... No, not really. What's the point? What is the point of, like, you know, wasting energy on writing something negative about, you know, what possible positive thing... can an artist who's laboured in the studio put their heart and soul and blood, sweat and tears into the making, in the main, right? In our world I'm talking about, I'm not talking about commercial boy bands and corporate music that's being peddled out, because that's a different thing. But I'm talking about in our world in which we... So when do you get to a point where there is a difference between... And how do you know the moment where an artist is big enough that it matters to have a negative... You'll know because... It's the moment when an artist who you've supported for a number of years goes off and signs a multi-million dollar deal with X, Y or Z and then finds him or herself thrust into the spotlight. management teams and publishers and... Especially nowadays, though. Like, it's tougher and tougher to tell, wouldn't you say? But that's the beauty of the music industry, isn't it? Like seeing, you know, taking someone from the underground, you know, from obscurity and seeing them and helping them on their rise to fame and fortune. and then the press has a really serious knack of, like, at a certain point, deciding that they're not cool enough anymore because they've got to the point, they've got to that success point, and they forget that they've actually been instrumental. The press forget they've been instrumental in helping them get to that point, and then the press feel, well, actually... let's just fuck them off now, shall we? They're not cool enough anymore. So there's a lot more people that are starting out than them. But actually, in reality, you could continue that. Listen, if someone like Philip Glass comes to me and tells me that a record on my label is not good enough to release... I'm happy to listen. There's very few, don't take this the wrong way, because I do respect you as a journalist, I really do, but there are very few writers who I think I would actually be bothered about if they'd written a negative review. And if they did write a negative review, I'd have to question their ability to stand by what they're actually saying. You know, some people do make mistakes in the studio and labels do make mistakes sometimes and release records that aren't up to par or up to scratch. But I think you can... It's easy to tell who those people are and sometimes why that's happened. And I think it's a bit unfair sometimes. to rub their noses in it because, you know, because essentially, if it's not good, sorry, if essentially, if it's not that good, why tell the world it's shit when the world will ultimately know anyway? I mean, the people that read this stuff anyway and come to our parties and buy our records and all the rest of it, on the whole, they're into their music. They know what's good and what's not. and they're not really going to be told what's good. I mean, it's a catch-22 because you then have an artist like Maceo Plex who has got to a level now where everything he releases is a hit. And the backlash will come, undoubtedly. And I hope that he and everyone else around will be ready for that. But it's a problem with press. It's a very interesting balance. But, you know, we're in a new world now and there's new ways to promote music and to maintain and sustain an artist's credibility and lifelong career. You seem to have emerged. Yeah, I've got some dodgy reviews on when my record came out actually. But actually there were some that I felt were spot on. Like I say, there are writers out there whose opinions I do value. What was the thing that was said about your record that sort of you were like, eh, okay, that's fair. I think there was a review on Pitchfork that was actually pretty good. I have to double check. I think it was a trick call. But yeah, it was a mediocre review. It was like a five and a half out of ten or something or six out of ten or something. And I think the point was they... felt that I was trying to do too much in one record. You were trying to do too much. But they didn't know me well enough to know that that's what I was doing. I found it interesting. Which is fair enough because if you release a record and I wanted my record to go outside of our... our uh insular electronic world um i wanted that because you know music is for me is like you know far bigger than than the nightclub but um um so and i guess in that respect Maybe it wasn't ready for the big wide world to appreciate a Damien Lazarus record. Maybe I need to be a bit more of a global household name in order for people to want to go back to that record. And I hope they do, because I think it's quite fresh still. Are there plans to take Crosstown in general more outside of the dance? floor and in also like live settings as well yeah well we're um we're we're about to do some amazing shows this year um we're going to be the first ever people to to create an electronic music event at the vienna opera house in a couple of months um we're going to be playing in a circus school in Paris. hopefully be doing an event by the Pyramids in Mexico in December. Yeah, I mean, I love nightclubs and I love the essence of what we do on a weekly basis, week in and week out, but I've had a taste of DJing and putting on parties in jungles and beaches and deserts. And now I want to do volcanoes and... So yeah, that's where we're going. Was Burning Man one of those places that sort of opened you up to this idea that, oh, we could be doing so much more? Burning Man, yep. Sac Bay in Mexico. Certain places in South America we've been to, yeah. Burning Man was, a few years ago, a place where there was very... very few areas of this particular festival where you could hear cool music, but there was a vibe and an energy there that was beyond most people's comprehension. so the reason why it took so long for our world to kind of you know get into Burning Man if you like was because of that I think and in a very short space of time two years we've made something of a major impact and makes so much sense when you're there. The party that we did last year was just so ridiculously off the scale and it will be again this year. Wednesday night, robot heart. It's like ridiculous level of partying. You take every party you play and you do and then this. Right, okay. Does it remind you of that same energy in a different way of the drum and bass, the blue note? Yes, it does, actually. It does, in a way, because it feels so fresh and so right to be out living in the elements for a week and expressing your true self. the real beauty of you at being allowed the freedom to come out amongst people that you know and love and people that you don't know and are growing to enjoy. and just having the freedom to I don't want to sound like a total hippie because I'm really not but this is 2012 and we are in the midst of a generational cosmic shift and things are changing that's undoubtedly what's happening things are changing musically, emotionally creatively and life is for us and our people that want to grab hold of what's happening something very interesting happening and Burning Man is just one part of an opportunity to get an early insight into how life can be I'm not saying that we're going to be living in a desert in the future but um we certainly are going to be taking our experiences from from from that and utilizing you know the the positive all the magic that happens there in our daily lives in the future um so you do sound a little bit like a hippie well so soon no everyone i talk to comes back from it and they're like you know, I'm going to sound like a hippie right now, but... There's nothing worse than trying to convert people that haven't been to Burning Man to go to Burning Man, right? I mean, I would only try and do it if it's an easy sell, because there's nothing worse than, like, coming back from Burning Man and, like, being a non-burner, right? If you've never been and you have no interest in going, there's nothing more boring than hearing someone harp on about fucking And I know people, they just don't, there's a lot of people who just can't be bothered with it. They don't want to know. Too much aggravation. Too much like, you know, a week in the desert. What are you talking about? Sandstorms and dressing up and putting makeup on. Well, is that fun really? Do we have to do that? We can do that in our own home on a Sunday morning. But, and I get it, you know, but. What was the you heard all that and you said, yeah, I'd like to do that. I made a big mistake actually. There's very few things in life that I regret, but I actually do regret the moment in 1994, whatever it was, when I was assistant editor at Days Confused. And Burning Man invited me to Burning Man with a view to writing a feature on the festival. And they sent me this amazing book. And I looked at these pictures and I was like, wow. this looks ridiculous but unfortunately at that moment in time I'd like had a few pretty dodgy moments with um various things and um realized that a week in the desert was probably the worst thing I could possibly do to myself at that time in my life given you know that I just um just been to a mutoid waste event and lost my mind so I sent somebody else and we ran I think what ended up being a measly quarter page feature on Burning Man Festival And I've regretted that for years and years. And then friends started to say to me, you know, Damien, you should really come to Burning Man. It's for you, you know. This place is for you. Lee Burridge was very instrumental in helping me get there. And, you know, Zev as well. You know, really, you know. It's really kind of helped me see the magic of the potential going there. And yeah, I knew that the moment I decided I was going to go and started to get into the whole process of what you need to be thinking about, I knew it was right. So even before, in the months and months and months prior to going for the first time, I knew that it was right because it felt like, actually, this is, the processes that I'm going through in my mind about this event, the fact that it's like, I'm kind of starting to think about this thing every day in some capacity, tells me there's something very right about this, you know? And then from the first moment that you kind of, you know, hit the dust. when you're driving in it's like right this is like something else I hope that it's going to last because you know they fucked up this year yeah they did the ticket thing yeah there's a big ticket issue and you know it's got very big last year they sold out for the first time This year is going to be ridiculous. I hope that, you know, I hope it's going to survive it. But look, if it doesn't, there will be other events that will be created, inspired by such a thing, you know, and it started to happen. I'm playing this thing in a few weeks called the Symbiosis Festival, which is a... Pyramid Lake in Nevada just a stone's throw from where they hold Burning Man and I'm going to be the first DJ that comes on straight after they have the silence during a 20 minute solar eclipse and I'm really fucking excited about it you know what is the first track in that set oh I have to come or I have to start working on it But no, I've actually set a week aside. I'm going back to LA next week and I have some downtime to start working on that one. But yeah, I'm really excited about that. And I'm excited about the prospect of what we can do as a group of like-minded people connected by this umbrella, Crosstown Rebels, in the future. I want our music and our people to experience our energy and our vibe and our feeling and our motivation and our art in the best possible settings, whether that be a new nightclub or whether that be a new... interesting creative setting for a party whether it be in a book or whether it be in another episode of the Rebel Ray films I'm really inspired by what we're doing at the moment and I think Burning Man actually has helped reignite a lot of the passion in me at the moment Thank you. After we're done After we're done After we're done After we're done After we're done I feel the feeling I feel the feeling you
