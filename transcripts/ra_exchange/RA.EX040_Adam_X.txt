Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. On this edition of The Exchange, we'll be taking you live to Montreal, where over the course of the next few days, we'll be talking to a number of artists performing live at the MUTEC Festival, calling it the RA Live Exchange Sessions, and we're hoping you'll enjoy this particular chat with New York veteran Adam X. Recently releasing a string of records under the name Traversable Wormhole, X has burst back into the consciousness of... The deep vibe of these 12 inches is indebted to visits to the famed Berghain Club in Berlin where Adam now makes his home. His allegiance to the banging industrial techno he made as Adam X, however, remains unabated. I talked with him in front of a live audience on Friday, June 3, 2011. I've seen a lot of interviews recently sort of talking quite a bit about the traversable wormhole stuff, little white earbuds, Halcyon online, a lot of great stuff. So I wanted to actually go back and talk more about some historical things. Obviously, you have a long, rich history with techno. And I was wondering, well, actually, it's funny. I was reading over an interview that RA did with you maybe a year and a half ago. And I was very surprised to remember that it was disco in your house. That was sort of the first dance music that was coming. And your parents were. quite into it. Yeah, very early on. My parents were probably going to discos by like 1974. I mean, I've had very, very early childhood memories, three, four years old, and my parents playing disco. This is more when disco was like in the coming of the soul funk era, way before like Saturday Night Fever and like before the whole commercial hype. I think I had... There was a record that I remember called "Hijack Your Love." I don't even remember the artist's name from it. And I definitely remember this being my favorite disco record when I was like four or five years old. I believe it was on Atlantic Records. I forgot the name of the artist, maybe Barbaros? I'm not really sure of the name, but very classic early on stuff. You know, as disco scene progressed, my parents were going out all through the 70s, and by like 79, when roller skating became really big, when roller skating became really big in New York, the disco roller skating thing, we were out all the time going to like Washington Square Park and like Central Park and, you know, doing all the tricks around. hands and everybody had their boom boxes out and all the disco was playing. I remember being in the Roxy like in 1980. Roxy was like one of the main clubs in New York throughout the 80s and 90s actually. And they used to do the roller skating afternoons like on the weekends there. And it was all disco, like chic, I want your love, everything you could possibly imagine. imagine. Your parents were quite hip if they were into disco before it sort of got into Saturday Night Fever. My parents were really cool. My parents were like, my dad used to actually like go to Newark to take us to roller skating because he thought like the black roller skating rinks, they played much better music in the black neighborhoods for disco and they weren't playing like the Bee Gees and stuff like that. He was more into the soul aspect of disco. Yeah, we were traveling all around. We were going to disco, roller skating rinks all over, like all over the outside, even the five boroughs, all around. So it was cool. It was always an adventure. Was the roller skating rinks sort of the only place that you could hear some of this music and take the kids, so to speak? Yeah, yeah, that's pretty much what I mean. You know, my parents, they did their Saturday night thing, dropped us off at my grandmother's house, me And then they went out and they did their thing and picked us up Sunday. It's kind of funny because I see my friends doing that now when we go out. They're chopping their kids off at the grandmother's and then they're coming out, right? So eventually, though, the disco thing... sort of came into, was it hip-hop for the most part? Yeah, I mean, well, actually the very first record I bought was King Tim III, the Fatback band. That was like in 1979. And that was even before, I think, like Sugar Hill Gang, the Rappers Delight came out. I think that was, yeah, it was before that. So there was always an interest in hip-hop. And I also grew up in a neighborhood that was mixed by like 1982, you know. There were a lot of Jamaicans and Haitians living on my block and they were into hip-hop and there was definitely that element of music started to cross over into Brooklyn more. I mean, you know, it was definitely probably much bigger in the Bronx at the time. But yeah, by 80, actually by 81, I mean, Cry For Rock Numbers was kind of out on the radio in New York. It was a really big radio record. And then obviously like, you know, African Bada Planet Rock. I mean, these were huge records on the radio. They were on rotation every three hours back in the 80s. We didn't really have a big new wave movement in New York on the radio. It was really much more. Lecture on the radio from what I remember I mean I'm sure they were playing New Wave But I didn't know anybody that was into New Wave Back then And your brother you said was buying quite a few records You weren't so much into DJing Yeah I wasn't so much into DJing But my dad used to take us to the 75 cents record store It was on like 9th street and 2nd avenue We'd be in there digging for days But I also liked rock music So I was always looking for Black Sabbath albums in there and my brother was in there doing his, looking for disco records, and that was really early on. That was like 81, and I didn't really start buying records until I really got into techno, where I was actually buying a lot of records, but I always built a little bit of music here and there through the years, in that time period. When did the graffiti... We're doing quite a bit of graffiti in the 80s. When did that sort of start? I mean, obviously, it's part of the hip-hop. I would say quite a bit. I did a lot. I was actually the most wanted graffiti artist in New York City in 1989. I got into that like around '83, '84 because my brother was also actually writing. He was like writing in the inside of the trains. He was like the tag bomber, you know, full of ink all the time and getting up on all the insides. And when I first got into it, I got into it through the photography aspect. I was taking photographs of like the pieces and the artwork on the outside of the trains. But I was traveling all over from like 12 years old. When I was 12, I was like always, you know, on a mission. I'd go from Brooklyn to the Bronx, two hours on the subway train, exploring every train line, like just looking for graffiti artwork. And then, you know, I just met a lot of people, all the writers that were doing the same thing. And I would network with them and, you know, meeting some of the actual top graffiti writers in the scene at that time. you know, then you just wind up going painting with them and it becomes more of an addiction and more of an addiction. And before you know it, I was doing like full size of subway calls by like 1986, 87. And, you know, it just, it was full on for, that was my life. I slept and breathed it for seven years. every day, the way I do with techno now. You made a distinction in the interview you did with R.A. with your brother being a tagger and you being an artist. Oh, I was a vandal, too. I definitely liked a vandal. I mean, we would get ink and just make these markers that had tips that were an inch and a half wide and go on the insides and just tag our names everywhere. But I also like to do the art aspect of it. I always called it creative vandalism. That was my concept. I don't believe that everything we were doing was art back then. Some of it was vandalism. Some of it was art. I've just always been a mischievous kid. I grew up on a dead-end street in Brooklyn. And right behind my house, we were actually literally the last house on the left. I don't know if you've ever heard of that movie. It's really crazy horror movie from the 70s. We had this freight train line and it was pretty much abandoned and it was like the neighborhood playground. I mean, people were dumping their trash down there, like automobile parts, car tires. So we're down there at 10, 11 years old making like Molotov cocktails. blowing things up. You know, it's just New York, we were very destructive kids in the 80s. New York was a very hard city. It's nothing like it is now. You know, everybody was working class families, you know. It was just really, it was an insane period in New York. You could see a band that calls everywhere. If you ever see images of the South Bronx and East New York back at that time period, there was so much burned down buildings. It looked like Berlin 1945. So at the time, there was a lot of mischievous things you could get yourself into, you know? Where were your parents? They were just working or something? Yeah, my parents were very cool. My dad actually worked for the subway system, and he was also a taxi driver part-time. He worked for the subway system that you were vandalizing. Well, no. Unfortunately, my dad was also a taxi cab driver, and he was murdered in 1985. I kind of maybe after his death I kind of took advantage of the situation and that's actually like when I really got into painting trains and I was really getting into a lot of mischief because he wasn't around and I didn't have to be worried about getting arrested and even though my mother you know she had pretty much some control on me she didn't have that much control so I kind of took advantage of the situation after that and did lots of graffiti. But I think that was good for me to deal with that situation where a lot of other people had turned to drugs and alcohol. I mean, a lot of kids in my neighborhood would smoke an angel dust and drinking 40 ounces all the time. And I was like very focused on painting and documenting graffiti. I have like one of the largest graffiti photo collections in New York City of New York City subway graffiti. dating back to the early 70s. I traded with a lot of older writers and acquired a lot of photos. Older writers would come up to me and ask me if I had photographs of their works on the train because they were maybe too lazy to go out and photograph their own stuff. And then in the process, they would give me photographs of their artwork from years before. I had amassed a huge collection. So it was kind of like a hobby in a sense, the same way where people collect baseball cards or comic books or vinyl or whatever, graffiti photos. collection, that's a hobby. Something I actually still do, I still trade photographs with people regularly. Also, it seems like a lot of the early techno people in New York were doing graffiti. I remember reading Joey Beltram. Yeah, well, Joey was the main guy that I knew, really, in the whole techno scene, it was definitely Joey, because we actually, before we even, like, before I was even into techno. we were painting trains together. I've been in places where they park trains outside with him painting in the middle of the night, you know, and we definitely have a history going back to 1988 actually. And it was funny because he used to come up to me when we'd be painting trains. He's like, yeah, your brother, you know, he's Frankie Bones. And yeah. "Do you know anything about what he's doing musically?" And I'm like, "No, not really. I'm not really following that." You know, I was kind of at that point, I was really into New York hip-hop like EPMD, KRS-One, you know, Big Daddy Kane, Cool G Rap and Polo and all this stuff. So I wasn't really paying too much attention, but I was definitely hearing a lot of house. on the radio that was catching my interest. Like Todd Terry's stuff was really massive. Or Jungle Brothers, which Todd did like Our House, You. And, you know, there was definitely catching that stuff because I really never liked the freestyle thing that was going on in New York. I don't know if you know what the freestyle music was. That was very big from like 85 to 87, and I never really could adapt to that. former dance music never liked this stuff it was all about singing about girls breaking your heart and stuff I was like meh You said that you weren't really paying attention to what your brother was doing. At what point did you sort of realize that he was doing something really fascinating? When he started to go to London and he would come back with the videos of, you know, he's playing all these raves in these aircraft hangar parties in the UK with 25,000 people. And we're just seeing like a mixture of people from all walks of life, black people, white people, everybody. in unity, no violence, no fighting. You know, going to a club in Brooklyn at that time, like, I used to go to, like, the teenager clubs in Brooklyn. Brooklyn and it was just always brawls. It was always violence when you went out to a club in New York. It didn't matter if you went out to a club in New York City. So to see that, it was just mind blowing and my brother just had this vision to bring this to America. And eventually we wound up doing it. He opened the record shop up and we formed a community. based thing around the shop because I think the shops, record shops at that time were very important for the music community to actually to build something, to build a scene and we did that and it actually took off quite quickly. You opened up the record shop in '91? It was in April of 1990, the original shop opened up. It was called Groove Records, it was on Avenue U in Brooklyn and that store was there till 1994. And then we moved in 1995 to Manhattan, and then we renamed it Sonic Groove. And you said it was quite quick. People sort of were almost waiting for a place like this to exist, to buy these records. Yeah, it was quick. There was a lot of promotion and a lot of work we put into it. My brother would make these mixtapes, right? He would make them, you know, he'd make like 500 of them. And in Brooklyn at the time, you had this cruising avenue where all the guys cruised up and down the avenue looking for the girls and hanging out. It was under the elevated subway. It was on 86th Street. It was like the same thing if you ever watched that at N.I. Fever. I think they have, if I recall, in the scene, they're driving under the elevated subway with a car with the music really loud. And it'd be hundreds and hundreds of calls and everybody had sound systems and everybody was trying to have the best sound system in the car. So my brother's concept was like, you know what, I'm going to make these tapes because he was already making mixed tapes and selling them out of a flea market. So a lot of people already knew who he was in Brooklyn. He was already playing on like... the major radio, he would get like, he'd play at a club on a Saturday night and they would broadcast it over like KISS FM in New York. This is before KISS FM was hip-hop. And so people already kind of knew who he was. But now he's... and he's really like straight techno tapes. And his plan was, I'm going to give every car that pulls up at this traffic light, we're going to give them a tape. We're just going to hand out tapes to all these kids because, I mean, that's all it was the whole night. It was on a commercial avenue. So it was just kids back and forth looking for girls, hanging outside their cars. We're going to give everybody tapes here. And then in the beginning of the tape, he would say what And it had the record shop. And if you like this music, you can come here to our shop and find it. And it just took off. And then he got a college radio station that had a really low watt, maybe 15, 20 miles. you know, out to take a get audience. But that was enough to get all of Southern and the Brooklyn to find out about the parties. And it just became, you know, it just kept growing. Word of mouth, word of mouth. When did the parties actually start? We started, the first one was in someone's house. It was in an empty house in early 91. I mean, we were doing some small... things for just us our friends like with 20 people but 91 we took our friends gutted out apartment in Brooklyn and we we had maybe about a hundred people there and That's actually the first time I met Heather Hart, who became a partner later on in Sonic Roo. She became a partner in 95 with us. And was this, were they called Storm Raves, or was that something different? The Storm, we called them Storm, we just called the party Storm in the original, yeah, Storm Rave, actually, which was... That was more in '91 when we started doing generator parties. We were doing generator parties, like we would rent a generator out and we would go up on these freight tracks in Brooklyn on the train line where we had grown up around. We weren't living in this area anymore, but we knew the area very well. And further down from where we used to live, about two miles down, there were all these junkyards and you couldn't really get up on the tracks, like the police couldn't get up there. So we started organizing events there because we knew the location was good, but the problem was how do you get a sound system there? But me, knowing the subway system really well, this freight train line another two miles down connects next to a maintenance subway yard. And in the maintenance subway yard, they have these carts. They're like these little yellow work carts. And you just need three people to pick them up. cut a hole in the fence and then you have this razor ribbon because the subway yards in New York are like penitentiaries. They have like the razor ribbon and we came up blankets and we threw it over the razor ribbon and we get into the next fence and we got the cart and we put it on the tracks and we pushed the cart down like a mile down. And our friends pulled the system up because the tracks are on like an embankment. It's not like an elevated structure where you could fall through, but it's up on a hill and on an embankment. So we got the system up the hill. We showed up with a cart, and we put the sound system on the cart and pushed it down. And we were doing these parties, and they were insane. knots. We were going to like 9, 10 in the morning behind these junkyards. There was no residential area. It was great. And even I think if I If I remember correctly, Joey Belcham brought Derek May to one of them. I definitely remember Derek May showing up at one. How many of these did you do, and how often were you doing them? We were doing them in this area. We did several of them, I think. Maybe several, probably like seven or eight, if I remember correctly. We were moving them around. There was another place where they had, like, in the same freight line, they had, like, a... masonry yard where they stored all the bricks to build houses and they would have like you know like a freight train would be stored in there and it was like a voting docks and we we had a gate that you could pull up and then we just lock ourselves in it was great like the police never showed up And at this time, New York was really like, it was a tough city anyway. They didn't have time for this stuff. They were looking for murderers and, you know, drug dealers and all this. And then we did a few, which really blows my mind to this day, on Kent Avenue in Brooklyn and Williamsburg, where all these condos are on the waterfront. I mean, that area in the early 90s was amazing to do illegal parties. It was just... warehouse after warehouse. There was this little train engine that must have been there since the 1920s. You go to Williamsburg now and it's just a totally different world. I don't even recognize this place. It's a place that I actually once lived in. An area that just doesn't look like the same city I grew up in at all. It blows my mind. What was the soundtrack? I mean, was it mostly stuff that your brother was making, buying and bringing in? Was it techno? No, it was techno, man. We were really early on, very on the Belgian techno thing. The whole, it was, Belgium was coming off New Beat and you had a lot of like R&S records like C.J. Boland and Frank D. Wolf. I mean, these guys were... they were killing it at the time in 1990 with techno and also all the early warping network records out of Sheffield like the bass and bleep sound like Forge Masters and like Nightmares on Wax and just that whole era LFO and then even playing a lot of the UK breakbeats. before it was considered hardcore, before the drum and bass thing, when it was the very early stage, like Casper Pound, like Rising High, The Hypnotist, and all this stuff. These were like the classic records of that era. Joey Belsham, of course, and, you know, it was, we were playing the music, it was mostly Belgian and British music, and Detroit stuff, the early Underground Resistance stuff, Suburban Night, Art of Stalking. Germany had that. time really didn't have much of a techno scene. There was not many techno records coming out in 1991. I would say Germany, the sound was a little bit actually more EBM based coming out of Frankfurt at that time, like Boy Records and a lot of the ZYX label. And then there was a couple rave records coming out of Berlin and maybe just a couple things. But yeah, it was very predominantly... Belgian, also Dutch, and British. That was most of the sounds out of parties. There was eventually a New York techno sound. When do you think that sort of began to take shape? Well, the New York techno sound is definitely more based off the freestyle thing. A lot of the guys like my brother and Howlin' Little, who are legendary producers, they did stuff on New Groove and R&S back in the early 90s. People like Beltram, everybody, they were all into freestyle at that time. And freestyle was cool. I didn't like the vocals in it, but they were always great dub tracks. There was just this broken beat kind of... drum programming that wasn't like breakbeats like a James Brown breakbeats but they were doing it with drum machines and it was always a very unique sound that I don't still really hear many people do to this day. There was also Mondo Musique who was a very big New York artist at that time doing techno and They were all coming off of that and that that really made the New York sound in that time period a new groove and Plus then you had a lot of the house stuff like Reggie Burrell and and that stuff coming out like this this deeper house sound that didn't sound like the Chicago stuff who was different Yeah, I mean, I think that's kind of under reported in a way that they're all listening to freestyle and sort of taking that influence and you know doing their own spin on it rather than listening to a lot of what was coming out of Detroit and trying to emulate that yeah I also got to give Todd Terry I really out of everybody I actually have to say Todd Terry I think because I think Todd Terry was the biggest influence on everybody because his records were so big at that time party people and serious intention and just all the stuff he was doing, Dreams of Santa Ana. I mean, these were all like major radar records, you know, Royal House, all this stuff. Jungle Brothers, I'll house you, all of this. In terms of the parties, was there that stuff mixing in? Like, I mean, would you, Todd Terry, would he play at something that you would go to in New York or were there scenes pretty separate? I think when we started the techno scene, we weren't playing that stuff because I think that was already like 89. We were already like in the 90 mode. I think we were really stuck on the European thing and also the Detroit thing. I mean, I remember when the first You All like Sonic came out and we thought it was actually... a British record. It was like in the end of 1990. And my brother was in England and he came back with it after playing a party. He was like, you've got to check this record out. This record's insane. And it was a white label on one side and it said Sonic and then it said You Are. It didn't say anything about Detroit on it. We're like, whoa, this is some heavy duty stuff. And, you know. Actually, I guess Pulse 8 was just coming out around the later 90s, late 90s as well, like Cybersonic and Kenny Walken, We Shall Overcome. So we were playing just this and Belgian. It was mostly Belgian techno. When did you start to DJ yourself? Because I remember reading your brother wouldn't teach you. Yeah, it all came about in a strange way. I never had any intention of DJing. Actually, you know, when I was in school, when I was younger, I would take music classes, and I don't know, you just have this instrument, the recorder, that they used to make you take in school, and I just hated this instrument. Then, you know, I went on to the cello, and I just had no year for music. I just, I felt like I would never be able to be a I just wasn't really ever thinking that as a kid, you know. And then, you know, when I got into techno, I never thought about being a DJ either. I was just always collecting. Like I said, I collected, you know, photos of graffiti. I had a comic book collection. I started liking records. I'm like, I want to own this record, you know. I want to, you know, one thing leads to another. You were a collector. You didn't want to participate necessarily. Yeah, at first I was just buying the records that I liked. The first record I think I bought, Techno, was actually a cassette. It was not really even Techno's house. It was Lil Lewis' album, Club Lonely, with Blackout on it and French Kiss. And then the first vinyl record that I bought in techno was probably Reese Rock to the beat. And then, you know, you're buying, you know, I'm hearing more records. I'm like, I want to own that. And I want to own that. And I keep amassing records. And this was in a very short period of time of when I first started working in the shop in April of 1990. By the mid-summer of 1990, I went out to L.A. and I was buying more records. street sounds that were out there at that time. I went to a couple of parties and I happened to even have the acetate of Joey Belltrum, "Energy Flash." Joey let me borrow it. I wasn't DJing, but I just wanted to borrow it. I was going to have a friend play it at a club. And I was out, you know, hearing people DJing, and no one was beat mixing. And I'm saying, wow, no one is beat mixing here. I could segue a record like that into the next record. And I said something to my friend about it. He's like, do you want to play this gig tomorrow? And it was... It was Steven Levy who owned Moonshine. It was his party and there was a thousand people and the first time I ever DJed was in front of a thousand people and I played Energy Flash which that was always my thing was like wow I just the first person ever to play Energy Flash at a party in America because Joey came back with the acetate. He used to live with my brother for a while. And I just had this amazing experience at this party and I said, this is what I want to do. I can actually play in front of people. It felt natural. The problem was that now I had to learn a beat match and my brother didn't really want to teach me. My brother never wanted to teach me how to write graffiti either. He always kind of was like, I remember when I was like 12 years old and I first got into it, he was like, you shouldn't really do this. Just take photographs of this stuff, but don't do it because you'll never get up as much as me and you'll never be as good as me. Sounds like a very supportive individual. No I think maybe he was just trying to protect me so that I didn't get as crazy as him. But then I had to outdo him with that by doing whole slots of subway calls. It took a few years to do that, but eventually I did it. And, you know, the same thing with the music. He wasn't really, you know, trying to teach me. And actually, Howlin' Little, they gave me a lot of tips and pointers on, you know, I had no idea about beat structure or any of this stuff, you know. I had worked actually in a studio with these guys. My very first record came out in 1990. It was called Plum, and it was with a guy Now I was in the studio and I was more of the guy that was like the director. They were like making the sounds. I'm like, that's okay. Make it like this. maybe you need to change the loop like that but I didn't really have an idea of the mathematical structure of laying out an arrangement so it was the same thing when I got into DJing I had to learn all the mechanics and all the terminology what's an 808, what's a 909 what is this, what's that Going back to the LA gig, were you quite nervous to get up in front of an audience for the first time? No, I was probably out of a few drinks. I probably was fine. I don't really get nervous. I'm not really a nervous type in front of people. With the music, you said you put out your first record in 1990, but you had some people sort of helping you out. put it together. You know, at what point were you starting to do things on your own and sort of taking, you know, doing it? I would say in 91 I started to go in a studio and I had a guy who was doing the production for me. Like, he was doing all the programming and stuff, but I was telling him exactly what to do. And after the second record, and it's weird, actually to this day, those are the two biggest records I ever did. They sold a lot. I just didn't want to work that way. That's the way my brother was always sampling other people's records. His career is based off of sampling and... creating the whole breakbeat scene, you know, like from drum and bass, and he has the history with the Bones Breaks records. But I didn't want to do what he was doing. I didn't want to go in that direction. I wanted to make original music. And then early 1992, I went out and I started hunting down for 303s and analog equipment. And by 92, I started making my own. my own music based on, you know, synthesizers and, and analog sounds. And what was the first piece of gear that you sort of, man, I have to have that. Well, I was in somebody's house in like early 92 when I was playing with a 303 and I'm like, I have to get one of these. And I went back to Brooklyn and I called a bunch of music shops and I was some guys like, I have one in a box brand new in the basement. And I knew that they were hard to get and I'm like how much do you want for that he's like $50 I was like I'll be there in five minutes so I went there and I got that one and then I found another one also in New York for $150 and I mean you could find gear really cheap back then it was great because people weren't looking for this stuff was it quite hard to figure out how to use I mean were you sitting there for hours trying to like coax anything interesting out of it? I'll fully admit that the first, like, we did this project X-Crush, I will fully admit that the first track was absolutely random. I had no clue what I was doing. But, you know, it was, until you got it to sound right, even if you didn't know what you were doing, it's like, I knew what it would take to make the track sound cool, but I didn't know exactly how to program this thing. I mean, the 303 is still, it's not the easiest thing to program. It's actually a very strange machine to program. I think that's part of its appeal, though. Yeah. It's unpredictability. It's very random. It's very random. Yeah. You said that the first two records that you did were kind of really, did really, really well. Were you... surprised by that? Was it kind of shocking to you how much it sold? Well, it was mind-blowing. The first one was called Listen, and it was a really big breakbeat record that came out. And I remember when it first came out, I wasn't playing out really that much. Just in New York and maybe in LA, and I went with my brother to England to go on tour with him. He was doing a bunch of shows, and I just went with him. And while I was in London, it was all over the pirate radio stations. I was hearing it all the time on the pirate radio. And all the shops were selling lots of them. And then I saw that Saunderson had charted it in Mixmag, like number two. And then in my mind, I was completely blown. Because I'm a diehard Kevin Saunderson fan. That was an amazing feeling at that time. And then several months later I did another record on a French label called Ravage called Lost in Hell. And then that was also getting a lot of play all over. For a hot minute in New York they were doing a techno radio show in New York on the main station. And it was on the top ten and I was like, whoa. With the shop, it seems like it was quite important in making connections with different scenes and finding the records that no one else had. Can you just talk a little bit about how it progressed over time? the shop's sort of influence in New York? Yeah, I mean, the shop was like the really, it was the hub, it was the epicenter for techno, it was really the epicenter for techno in America, it was the only shop that was like, that we were just pushing techno only, 100% techno, like, you know, you'd go to other shops in other cities, and yeah, they had some techno records, but they weren't extremely focused on... getting all this like rarity stuff and limited stuff and you know then we had you know Heather who came in and joined us in 91 she started to do the under one sky fanzine and that was really the voice of the techno community in the US at that point. It was the only fanzine that was like really world distributed. She was pressing up like 5,000, 10,000 and sending them to all the distributors overseas and they were getting into like hard wax in all the shops at that time. We were able to interview a lot of people early on, like Aphex, we probably did the first interview with him in America in his magazine. We had a really big review section and we were giving everybody from Germany, when the German scene really first started to hit, like in 92 with techno, like Adam Hart and all this stuff, we were doing interviews with everyone at this point. That was a very good voice for a lot of people. people in America in the scene here. Were you writing reviews yourself? Yeah, I was doing a lot of reviews. I'm never a really great reviewer. I got really bored of it because I find with reviews that after you do like 50, how much more can you say about techno? I mean, you do reviews. You know, after a while, how much can you really say about techno? Oh, that kick drum is booming. It's not really the most craziest, insane sound. I mean, after a while, I just lose descriptions. So I gave in. I let other people do that afterwards. I was doing the Around the Globe section with Adam X, so I was actually talking about different cities and the scenes. I started to do that as a section. What were some of the most surprising scenes around that time in the early 90s to you? Like, wow, this is a place where techno is taking hold. Like, I never would have expected this. Or was it just anywhere was unexpected? Well, I mean, that would be a little bit more in the mid-90s when the scene started to blow up in America and I started to wind up in Omaha, Nebraska. And I'm playing down in the northern part of Louisiana. or in Monroe, Louisiana, going into these little airports. And I'm like, wow, there's actually scenes in these places. And this was mind-blowing to have this vision that we had. We had a vision to blow up this scene in New York. We never expected it to go across the country. I mean, in the mid to late 90s, it was an... almost every state in America, there was something going on. There was a rave scene. It was only when they enacted the Rave Act law, they really came down on that. And around 99, 2000, the promoters started to get scared about doing events because they thought they might get locked up because people selling drugs in their venues and stuff. That was a really crazy time period. Do you feel like that's really what sort of stymied the growth of techno? Oh, it did, man. When they were doing all those specials on ABC News in America, those primetime specials, that did a lot of damage to the scene, and the federal government finally woke up. You have to remember in New York in the mid to late 90s, the federal government was renting out armories where the National Guard stores their supplies in case of like a crisis. They were renting it out to do raves. Some of the best raves in New York were done in the armories in New York. And they didn't, you know, once they realized that, wait a minute, this kid's on ecstasy in here and this kid's doing this and that. They pulled the plug on it, but there were some amazing parties in the armories in New York back in the mid-late 90s. In terms of New York nowadays, obviously there's not as many places doing underground parties and unexpected places. What you see is going on now in New York in general, your take on the club scene there. Well, it's definitely better than it was like five, six years ago. And I think there's a lot of good promoters doing a lot of good things for techno music actually right now. My problem is that maybe I'm just comparing it because I'm in Berlin and I'm a little bit spoiled. But I just find that there isn't a venue there that I really thoroughly enjoy as a venue where there's the atmosphere that goes with actually the music. I have an issue with that. What do you think is the correct sort of venue to hear what you do? Exactly what you see if you're in Berlin and you go to a place like Berghain or Arena Club. It's dark, there's strobes, there's smoke machine, it's gritty, you know. I feel that the clubs in New York are very stellar. I mean, I understand that the smoking ban, that's fine, but at least, okay, a little smoke machine or something, a little lighting just to let, just to darken the environment a little bit. And just the actual architecture of the venues themselves is just very bland. There's nothing cool like, you know, in Berlin, you go into Arena, that place is amazing, man. I mean, they got like this kind of boiler thing where you can sit in and it's really like industrial looking and it's techno. There were venues like that in New York in the late 80s, like the building was a mind-blowing club in New York in the late 80s. Or even, you know, the limelight. The limelight was like, it was in a church with these stained glass windows, but it was hedonistic, and it was like, you're in this church and all this hedonistic stuff is going on, and the pounding techno, and there's just nothing like that in New York. We don't have a power plant venue like Trezor or Burkine. That's lacking. You talk about limelight, and I guess from my slightly uneducated perspective, I always kind of... associated with colorful rave-type atmosphere. Was it really good for, you know, this sort of techno that you were enjoying? I mean, when you went from doing storm raves and these, like, kind of, like, disused warehouses to this clubbing environment, these, like, spaces where you go to a club and it's a... kind of a, you know, discreet place. Was that a big change for a lot of people? Well, there was always a very big war with us between them and Wymeye. In the beginning, because all the DJs that played at the Wymeye used to come into my shop to buy their records. But then as our party started to get really big, there was a lot of jealousy on their part. They had one of our parties shut down. I mean, they set my brother up. The mafia cracked my brother's head open because it was just, we did a party in a place where one of their friends did a party and it was just a lot of drama going on. Like, they didn't like what we were doing. There was a lot of animosity towards us. And the scene there, I was... really only familiar with the scene in maybe in the 91 era when it was like really new to a lot of people but by 92 93 we very rarely stepped foot in that place and there it was because it was they didn't like what we were doing and we were more into the underground thing and there were a lot more promoters now that were coming up and they were doing illegal parties or warehouse parties so There was no reason for us to go there. This was in the era when Jeff Mills was like the resident there. I mean, maybe went there once or twice, but we really kind of stayed out of there. So I'm not... So familiar what the crowd was. But we knew when we were doing parties, especially in the beginning, when we would do a party on a Saturday night, that club would be empty. And then I don't know later on what was actually going on there when we were doing events. So you never really got into the clubbing aspect? And they also had that whole club kid scene, which was like a lot of transsexuals. Transvestites dressing up. That was like Kiyoki's night on the Wednesday night, Disco 2000. So that never crossed the line. into the rave scene that really didn't have much to do with what we were doing. And then they had the Friday night, which was Future Shock, which was more techno. But then I guess they got a little bit of that crowd on that night as well. So they had a lot of a bridge and tunnel crowd, which is what we call it in New York when the people come out from like Long Island and Jersey, the Guido type crowd that you probably see on Jersey Shore or whatever. You said that your brother got his head cracked open. Was there a certain point in which you were thinking, man, this is probably not worth the trouble of throwing these underground parties to have trouble with? No, it just made us want to do them more. In New York at that time, you had to have your boys, and they had their boys, and we had our crew. After that situation, nothing was... really going down after that. We had people and they had their people and it kind of just, it was kind of left alone after that. How long were you doing these sort of parties in New York? Was there a certain point at which... They stopped. Well, my brother kind of phased out. He stopped kind of doing the Storm Raid party, and we started to do actually our own thing. It was me, Heather Hart, and Reed Truth, who's on Planety, and Denard Henry. He was working at the store as well. Yeah, another friend, Denard Henry, also makes records, and my boy Carlos Terra that used to work in the shop. We did a series of parties called Mental, and we were doing it also. So we were renting spaces out, like warehouse spots, and we were doing smaller parties. We scaled them down to like 300, 400, 500 people because we didn't want to have any problems with the police. The police started to get up on it because in 1990, there was a fire in a social club in New York called Happy Land, and 90 people died. It had nothing to do with techno. It was in an immigrant area where a lot of Honduran people lived, and a guy had a... problem with his girlfriend and he came back with a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the front door of the club and there was the only exit out and 90 people burned up in there and now it was a very famous criminal story in America in New York and the government, the state, the city actually I mean they formed a thing called the Social Club Task Force. So once they started finding out about the raves around 93, they started to come and started to really crack down on the parties a lot. And that became a problem. So we had to take it further back underground again for a while. And when Giuliani came into power, was it also affecting the sort of things that you were trying to do in New York? Yeah, by that point, we weren't really trying to do so much stuff. There were other promoters now that we were paying for. So when Giuliano came into office, I remember when he came in, I think it was probably 94. In the beginning, he wasn't so much being a pain in the ass, but then he started to be really a pain in the ass with the licensing and the cabaret laws and all that. But the guys that I knew were getting permits to do stuff, where they do the Electric Zoo Festival at Randall's Island, there were some amazing parties there, and there used to be a soccer stadium there. lineups there for these guys and we'd have like Robert Hood, Patrick Paul, Central DJ, Skull, myself, Bones, All Pian to be like 4,000 or 5,000 people. This was a good era actually. The 95, 96, 97 period in New York was quite cool. And you were also focusing quite a bit on the store as well, I assume, at that point. Yeah, I was really busy with the shop, and I was also traveling a lot overseas to play, so I wasn't really so focused on the party aspect at that point. At what point did the store close in New York? The Circo was in 2004. Okay. And what were the circumstances behind that? Was it just time to... There were so many factors to it, and the main factor was definitely 9-11. Because before 9-11, we were actually a very profitable business. And when 9-11 happened, no tourists came to America, to New York after that. We were known internationally as a record shop. People came over to World because we had this like... insane back catalog. We really took a lot of pride in the back catalog. Me and my brother were constantly out traveling all around the world, going to secondhand record shops, going to distributors and going through back stock and finding rare records that people were after. And so people would come to New York to want to go in the shop and to go through all this stuff. And a lot of people were coming from Europe. We had 50%, 60%. customer base out of Europe or Japan or wherever and after 9/11, it's just no one came to New York and then at the same time high-speed internet became very popular in New York and once the advent of high-speed internet was where people had access to it everywhere. you know, and it wasn't 56k modem where people would, you know, where they couldn't really download music at 56k modem. Then Final Scratch, all these factors, it just all happened at once. And from a profitable business, we dropped almost 70% in a matter of a year in business. Like, just, woof. So then the landlord wanted to renew our lease and we were in a pretty high profile area and he was trying to jack our lease that went up to like $6,000 a month and was like we couldn't do that. So we tried one last thing and that was to move to the Lower East Side but to Avenue B a little bit on the outskirts of the village. and 12th Street, and I tried that for a year, and there was just days where people just weren't even coming in. And there was just a point where I said, I can't deal with this. I went from having six employees working for me, where I'm working by myself, and I'm doing the mail order and locking the front door to package a box to run to the post office, you know. And I just had enough. My partners weren't really being supportive of it, and I just said, this is every door cast its day and this door case had its day. You spent a couple years after that still in New York before you moved to Berlin, correct? The Lower East Side store was just one year. It was a one year run. What caused the move to Berlin? Well, I dropped, I closed the store and I didn't move to Berlin right away. I closed the store in October 2004. I took a break for a year. and just was working on music and just doing my own thing. But then, you know, I was not getting enough gigs in the U.S. because the scene was pretty non-existent now. It was like I wasn't fitting into the rave scene aspect. The minimal scene was big, and I never was into the... I was into minimal techno in the late 90s, the Mike Inc. Studio One, Profane, that era. But I wasn't really feeling it in the 2000s, and I wasn't going played out to get gigs. What was it about the sounds? I mean, was it just too clean, too digital or something? It wasn't too clean. It's just I never found it to be prime time music, you know? Like, I remember in the late 90s getting, like, the first Pro-On records at Demi, man, because they were amazing, you know? I loved the stuff, but that was not stuff that I could play prime time. I just never, minimal never appealed to me because after all the music. I used to play a lot of sets at the parties in the early 90s at the end of the night and just play deeper stuff. But it just didn't appeal to me. And the fact that this was the biggest hype and everybody was on this, I'm like, why? This is not peak hour music. And I wasn't also really happy with the techno. The little techno that was around at that time either was just very loop-oriented bass stuff. And that was kind of dull already to me. So I was more on my industrial thing, just experimenting with industrial and techno and rhythmic noise and stuff like this. So you hadn't really found a place? where your music was really making any sense? I was connecting with a lot of people in the industrial scene, but you know it's a very small scene and it's usually playing to 100-200 people and I was traveling around with some friends that were in that scene and doing some gigs in Canada. We did a little tour, we played like Hamilton I think maybe it was or somewhere near Toronto. and then Montreal, Quebec City, and then another time I did like Providence and then we drove to Cleveland, Detroit and did a couple gigs and it was kind of fun. It was a totally different scene, but I could play my hard stuff and mix it with techno. People were appreciating it. Must have seemed like quite a change, you know, from traveling around Europe, you know, flying on planes and, you know, playing to enormous crowds and then... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I had my moments, though, where I was going back to England. Like, Andrew Weatherholt was kind of a front believer of what I was doing at that time, and he booked me. I played at a Haywire warehouse party in London in, like, 2002 or 2003 and also played a fabric... with them in 2004 so you know I'm getting hard kicks in Europe still who are some of the people I mean we were talking last night you said the jack master of all people Glasgow supporting what you were doing in 07 but also around this time you said Andrew Weatherall Well it wasn't a giant mess that was supporting it it was just that I know all those guys from Rubber Dub it was actually my friend Dan from Monix was the main supporter of what I was doing there and he had a club night in Glasgow He was running for years and he had booked me back in like 2001, 2000. I played a few times for him. And when I moved to Berlin, he offered me a residency there. And then, you know, I'd play every month. I'd play with like Jack Mass, who was also a resident there. you know, the whole crew from Rubber Dub was there. And then, you know, they would always book another act like Ox 88 or, you know, Terrence Fixum. There was always somebody, there was always a headlining act that would come to play on the night, you know. Well, we're actually running out of time, so I wanted to open it up to any questions that anyone had from the audience for Adam. I'm wondering if you can comment on tonight. Is it just Mutech that sets you up playing live where Rich is? Have you played back-to-back with him before? I don't know. Any comments on what... your feelings are about tonight or any history? Actually, my mind is blown about that. I wasn't really expecting to play after Rishi Holden or even before him. And I saw that yesterday, and I was like, whoa. I was like, this is cool. It feels good, you know. It feels good. I've worked really hard for a long time, and it feels good to be able to play these kind of gigs again. I'm really looking forward to it. And I went to the venue last night, and the visuals, I've never seen anything like that. And for my music, that's going to be amazing. I'm totally excited. I mean you're headlining. You're playing after him. Yeah, I mean, are the people gonna stay though? Yeah, and I've never seen Plastic Man live. I've actually played with Richie and Dan Bell, they had Cyber Sonic back in '92 when they played live as that project, and Moby. This is when Moby was making techno. This is 92. This is almost 20 years ago. It was funny because we just did an interview with Sutec, and he mentioned that one of the seminal events for him was seeing a show with Cybersoft. in Moby. Yeah, yeah, that was when they did the tour. I totally remember that. And yeah, so it's pretty mind-blowing to play with Plastic Man because I've never gotten to see it. And you know, Plastic Man is the shit. It's great. Amazing. You said on your tracks you like the kind of extraordinary things, if you're looking for sounds and stuff like this. I think it would be interesting for us all what makes a sound for you extraordinary. I've listened to so much electronic music over the years from, you know, from everything from EBM, Ambient, back to the 70s. So when I'm making music, I'm just trying to make stuff that I've never heard before. I think if you listen to a lot of music for a long period of time, you'll catch yourself if you make something that you've heard before. There's many times I'm making something and I'm like, I've heard this before. I think with newer generation people that are coming out that don't have the history with music, they might actually make something and think it's totally original, but it's been done. I think my ears and the knowledge that I've had on the music for all these years helps me from not sounding like other people. And I just really strive for that. I don't want to sound like anything else. I mean, it's hard to be totally original because obviously there's a beat structured out. is followed in electronic music. And even if you want to do some experimental off-beat stuff, it's kind of all been done with beat rhythms and structures. But with sound design, you can still do a lot. I think you can do a lot with sound design still. I think it's limitless. You just have to spend a lot of time processing these sounds. Maybe not, you know, I like to work with a lot of like sound effects and not necessarily like synthesizer based stuff. So Who are you checking yourself? Producers nowadays that are doing things that you've never heard before who are some of the artists that you know when you're playing in your DJ set Adam X or something like that that I've never heard before I mean I'm also doing things that you've played you're like wow this is yeah I mean I'm all about you know right at this moment I'm really loving of course ancient methods I made a record with them last year I love what these guys do perk I think perk is definitely one of the top guys out at the moment you know this whole broken beat thing he's doing it's like kind of mixed like broken beat, old school UK almost freestyle. It's a very unique sound, definitely digging that. A lot of the old school cast, like Luke Slater, man, I mean, he's just killing it. The Odd Schooled album a year ago, or two years ago, was phenomenal. The new DP, volume 2, 12-inch, I mean. There's just Obtain from Italy, you know, Giorgio Gigli, these guys, a lot of Italian guys, man, making great stuff. Some guys that are a little bit more unknown that are from Italy, Skirmat, I don't know if you know this, S-C-H-E-R-M-A-T-E, they have a series of white labels out. Milton Bradley, you know, this is... There's so many good guys coming out right now with stuff. You're clearly quite passionate. Wait, wait. Let me not forget. I'm forgetting all the artists on my label, like Orfex. I played on Mutex last year. These guys, Christy and Richard from Orfex, they've been making stuff since 93 in the industrial scene. They're incredible. Their music is mind-blowing. or realms, there's just a lot of good stuff out. Are there any other questions? I feel like I should be giving more credit to the rest of the guys. Dino Sabatini, there's so many more people. We could be here all day. Because I'm going to get yelled at by someone for not mentioning their name. Thanks. I really enjoyed your set at Movement a few days ago in Detroit. How have you found the experience of using... I couldn't see your setup. I was down in the crowd. How have you found the experience of performing off a computer? Assuming you use a computer. With all the history you have in writing music using 303s and that sort of equipment, does it still feel... pretty natural when you're up there to be performing using more digital technology? Assuming you do. Yeah, well, I still kind of play sort of like a DJ style. I use the UC33 Evolution Control, which has like eight up and downs on it, plus the master. So I use, when I'm using Ableton, I make sure that I have to use all eight channels. I'm not into this thing where people play live and they play just their pre-recorded track. and then just mixing it like a DJ thing. It's got to be improvised and loops and I use the Launchpad as well to trigger everything and I'm comfortable with it because it feels like I'm DJing to a degree but obviously you can't DJ with eight turntables at once. So I have a lot of fun. There's a lot of concentration involved with it. And yeah, at movement, it was a little bit wild because the bass on the stage was so heavy. I mean, my MIDI control, my launch pad was jumping up like this high on the table. It kept moving off. It was actually really distracting me. But at the same point, the bass was so, it felt so good on stage that I was so in the zone playing that. I really enjoyed that gig a lot, actually. It was a really great event for me. My thoughts are just kind of going back in the years, and especially when year 2000 hit and things started kind of thinning themselves out. I mean, actually, early 2000 was still some prime time, but things started thinning themselves out in North America. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on what we could have done a little bit differently, keeping the rave scene alive. and the richness of underground essence alive. I think it all comes down to, you know, the big problem with the rave scene and the whole thing with the techno scene was always the different cities and the people that were running the shops and the community base around those scenes. It was always very segregated. Like, if you went down to Atlanta, they were more into breakbeats, like Baltimore, into this breakbeat thing. And you never had, like, tech... people in these certain cities that were actually like really pushing events or having a shop to create a scene. So the scene was always very segregated. Like when I would play back in the 90s, you know, you'd play at a Raven and there'd be somebody playing like... trance music after me or drum and bass after me and it just didn't fit. There was no there was no sense of spirit in the party where everybody was locked into this one thing. It was like people would just kind of walk away if they didn't like what you were playing. It was no like full-on experience like the way the parties were in New York where There was a focus. It just seems like it's regional, though. It was very regional. Because if you went out to the Midwest, you had Drop Bass. And these guys, they were extremely into techno. And they kept the scene very pure out in the Midwest for many, many years. And that trickled over to Minneapolis and into Chicago. But if you went down south, there wasn't so many people that were pushing the techno thing. So the gigs down there were always a little strange. There was not many techno people playing them. Do you find that the internet's changing that leveling, that playing field, that people sort of know what traversable wormhole is in the South and are not kind of like, oh, I hear about this techno guy, Adam X. Yeah, we'll get him in for this rave. Yeah. I guess, you know, that's probably a little easier now if that was existent then. But I mean, again, it all comes down to when they cracked down on the raves too. I mean, that was a really big thing when the crack house law, like they arrested that guy Donnie who was doing hundreds of parties in New Orleans. Almost everybody in the rave scene had played for this promoter in New Orleans. And a lot of people got scared after he got arrested for doing a rave and people got caught selling drugs. They didn't want to do the parties anymore. So the next logical thing was to move the events into clubs. But how do you do events and clubs in America that in certain states the alcohol is over at like 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock. They can't afford to bring the talent in. So they're bringing local talent in. And that local talent is more. familiar with what's going on in their local scene so they're not pushing techno so I mean it's it was just a tough situation overall you know to to get the music out more to the people it's it's thank thankfully for events like movement that you know people hear about this all around America now and they come up to see it and actually can hear real techno music you know Or you can just move to Berlin. Or you can move to Berlin. Yeah. But, you know, this is more, you know, comes down to the younger kids, you know, because back then the raves were younger and the younger kids were getting into it. So you needed a way to latch onto the music. How do you get, even in this time and day, how do you get these new kids to find out about techno in a lot of the cities that there's no scene for it? I mean, they're not going to go looking on it for the internet. The first thing they're going to come up with is whatever commercial stuff is coming out in the clubs there, you know? So this is still a problem to this day. Well, on that happy note, thank you. Thank you very much for taking the time, Adam. I appreciate it. If anyone else has any questions. Thank you guys for coming out.
