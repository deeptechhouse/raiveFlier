Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Woody McBride is a Midwestern rave legend, and one of the chief reasons that the Minneapolis scene is regarded by certain techno heads as one of the most underrated cities in America. Huge outdoor raves in the middle of America were soundtracked by his hard, acidic take on techno, which made increasing sense with each speaker you balanced on top of one another. There's a reason why he calls his regular party bassgasm. Nowadays, McBride has fallen off the radar, but when we spoke last month, I found a DJ, producer, and promoter that was at peace with cult hero status, and one that hopes to make his way back to prominence through the very thing that got him recognized in the first place, hard work and a firm belief in the power of electronic music. I guess I read in an interview that you were talking about the Midwest, but you didn't start out in the Midwest. You grew up in North Dakota, right? Yeah, I did. I grew up in North Dakota. For those Europeans or non-Americans listening, North Dakota is pretty desolate. culturally? Well, relative to the rest of the world, I think it's pretty contemporary. But, you know, it is, in some respects, what East Germany was like. You know, there was a little bit of ill exposure to, you know, modern culture and sort of urban innovation, especially with regards to music. But we had a cool record store. I was smart enough to go find the New Order records and the Renegade Soundwave records that, you know, somebody there was just intuitive enough to order as well, you know. No one had to twist my arm, you know. We just find this music, you know, and... But North Dakota is kind of a last stand in America as far as, you know, it's not very much an industry. It's a pretty homogenous sort of northern European ancestry. And there's a lot of innocence still there. And so I was lucky to grow up there. And then I moved to Minneapolis to go to college. swiftly cashed in my student loan money and began to try to DJ and working at a record store and following. Is that where you, I mean, you were already buying records in North Dakota when you went. to Minneapolis. That was the obvious first job while you were still in college, work at a record store. Perhaps, perhaps. You know, I worked as a reporter. I went to journalism school. I worked as a reporter and was pursuing a pretty contemporary pseudo-alternative lifestyle for my upbringing. I worked for the Associated Press for a while, and then I went on to be an award-winning reporter at the University of Minnesota, which was an investigative, aggressive student newspaper. And then one day I woke up and realized that I just... hassling people for information was not in my blood. And I was lucky enough to have a couple friends back in Bismarck that were just seminal collectors and just super smart. And then, relative to the rest of the world, Bismarck did have its exposure to the coolest thing going on in the world. And one thing is late night TV. And it's almost as if I was the only guy in town watching this show. But I saw a few episodes of Snub TV. It was an early, early indie sort of post-punk, post-New Wave TV show that had things like Me Beat and New Order and some early videos that were... I got really turned on by it. Must have felt like that stuff was beamed in from another world. For sure. It was on after Night Flight and after the Midnight Special. I was just lucky enough to stumble on it and it changed everything. Was Minneapolis a huge, I mean, was it immediate, wow, I'm in the big city, basically? When my dad dropped me off, we hugged and kissed, he drove away, I sat on the steps and wept with culture shock. Wept with culture shock. I mean, it was a lot, it really was. I'm a seasoned traveler now, but it was a big adjustment. And the Minneapolis dance scene, they had a legendary disco scene in Minneapolis at several clubs, but especially at one called First Avenue, and that's the club that Prince made famous in the 80s. But it was famous before that as well. It's a rock club. Every great band that came up has played there. Motorhead, Nirvana, Jane's Addiction, Johnny Cash, everybody. I'm lucky to have a star on the wall and have been a resident there on and off for 20 years almost now. It's an awesome place, but they had a great dance scene. When I came to town, the bars closed at 1 o'clock. So I somehow discovered that they had kind of an art scene, late-night crowd that was all artists, a lot of alternative lifestyle people. And it wasn't raving by any means, but it was sophisticated dance music. And they'd rent out theaters and kind of charming places, and they'd go until like 3, you know. And it was magic. And I got introduced to a concept that I've built on, because I'm a producer, a DJ, but I'm also a promoter and organizer and kind of an artist. graphic designer and so I've really I really enjoy being part of all aspects as well as I'm a dancing DJ too you know I'm going to be out there Which came first? Was it the DJing, the producing, or the promoting? Dancing. Yeah? For sure. Dancing was first. All night. And so getting back to, there was a concept that I was introduced to that probably really pushed me into it, and it was the wall of bass. And I've since taken it to the next level, but in these theaters, they would... line the back of the theater with, you know, like 30 cab subs up over your head, you know, like stacked six wide, four tall or bigger, and high packs on top and no lighting. Just close your eyes and feel it. And it was special. In fact, I've been around the world now, and it was as good as anything ever anywhere. We've since taken that over the years to, it's now kind of my calling card is the Wallabase in the Midwest. And we've done systems with 130, 140 speakers, massive walls. Who's put it on these parties before? Pre-rave culture, pre-club, techno club culture? Sure. Well, two guys, especially. One, his name is Kevin Cole, and now he's gone on to be, he went on to be like the music director at Amazon, and then he took a job at kind of America's number one. indie alternative public radio station in Seattle. And then there was another guy, Thomas Spiegel, who was a fantastic deep house DJ that went to live in New York. He's an attorney, I think, or something. I've lost track of him, but Kevin is a very influential, interesting, nice person. They were the godfathers of Minneapolis for sure. Kevin was nice enough to take me on as kind of his first protege. Did you ever talk to him about how he sort of came up with the concept that, you know, an entire wall of speakers, that's the way forward? Gosh, you know, I think just some... Some of us are just possessed by ideas and I think it was pretty harmless, eccentricity. But it was really amazing. And we took it to the next level for sure. And it's been a lot of fun. I've since kind of tamed. into, you know, raving and underground warehouse stuff is high risks, high risk activity in America. And I, you know, I have a family now, and I try to keep my risk management at low. And so it's kind of a pass the torch kind of thing. So there's still people doing underground and stuff, but I'm pretty comfortable creating solid environments inside different club venues across the Midwest. I've seen you mention Kevin. before another guy that seems to come up in your biographies, Freddie. Oh, yeah, Freddie Fresh. When did you meet him? Freddie Fresh, again, I was blessed to have, there's been several people early on that kind of singled me out and befriended me and probably at the time had exponentially more know-how. and skills than I did, but ended up showing me a few things. You know, Freddie helped get my start as a producer. You know, the other guy's kind of his event organizer and giving me a shot at DJing before I knew how to mix or anything. Freddie showed me the art of buying analog gear, cheap, how to dig around and find synths and 303s for $40 back in the early days. Pawn shops, right? Yeah, pawn shops. And he was the king and the master, and still is. But he's gone on to just have a really great career. And Freddie Fresh showed me how to produce. He showed me how to hook gear up. He showed me how MIDI worked. And I made my first songs with him. And with his know-how and my sort of spirit, we had a couple of early releases on just a groundbreaking German, like techno, adventurous techno label called Adam and Eve. And then... Well, my reputation as kind of a promoter DJ organizer kind of leaned eastward into Wisconsin where America's most rugged and ballsy promoter lived. And it was the Drop Bass Network. And they did the, they did the, like you had. Before we started the interview, you kind of had asked about the lore of the Midwest, you know, and Curdex and Drop Base Network, which went on to be a highly respected hard techno and hard acid label, really respected in Europe and Eastern Europe. They did some of the best underground campout events ever. Do you remember the first one you went to? Oh, man. Well, the first underground thing I went to was in Chicago. It kind of blew my mind to see. all these kids with serious dance moves and style and sort of just a complete flow that was unique and magical and looked like they were floating. It was the first time I saw fat pants, and I couldn't really see their feet moving. And then drop bass guys booked me to play at one of their parties, and we just hit it off. Then we got together and we wanted to do, we had gotten a whiff of some of the bigger things that were happening in California and in Europe, and we thought, gosh, we should try to pull something special off. And so it was Kurt's idea to have an event called Further, which was kind of a throwback to kind of some of the 60s sort of alternative events. And so with my help and another guy's help, David Prince. David Prince, thank you. Big time journalist, sort of. He wrote all of the record reviews in the Spin Alternative Record Guide. remember, you know, that I was like, oh, who's this guy who's writing about the orb, you know, the spin? Well, together, by hook or by crook, we had Apex Twin come to play in America for the first time. We had Hoshi from Germany, Thomas Heckman, and Roland Kasper, and... the Hardkiss brothers, and it was just amazing, like the best of the best at the time, you know. And then a few years later, after I played in Paris and these two kids opened up for me, Thomas Bangalter and his buddy. Could sort of see that coming. Yeah. And I was like, whoa, these guys are really good. So in further 96. I brought Daft Punk to America for the first time, played live in a tent for about a thousand kids, you know, and you could imagine, you know, the hair is standing up on my arms right now. It's amazing how big it was. You know, I don't think people really understand or can fathom how, you know, big of a rave scene there was, especially in the Midwest back then. People would travel for these events, obviously. Yeah, you've got to realize no one had cell phones. It was pre-CDs, pre-internet, pre-any dance music on the radio, except maybe some commercial stuff in the big cities like New York, L.A. How would you go about promoting something further then? Just by going to, you know, we'd take... We identify all the other events going on for months and we go hand out flyers. Kurt was smart enough to have a mailing list. Like I said, this was pre-internet, pre-cell phone, pre-mix CD. A few DJs. were doing cassettes back then, you know. And so the only, especially in the Midwest, it was so exotic. I mean, this was exotic. I mean, the only place you could hear this magical stuff that moved you, like, in a way that nothing else has ever, is to go to the event. It was, the music was produced to be played at an event. Whereas now we've got music that's kind of produced to sound good on your laptop speakers. So the application was so different. It was so immediate and tangible. And so the people that were smart enough to have the keyboards and hunt around for the records or order records at great expense directly from Hard Wax here in Berlin, you know, like, you know, I remember just like gulping and just like, you know, $300 plus shipping, you know, for records just direct from Berlin. I'd show up and the kids would just be drooling. I'd play all these records for the first time, not even pre-listening. It was just so fun and exciting. But that's the only place you could get it, you know, and you couldn't take it home with you. You had to, like, suck it up and save it right there. Talk about your productions early on. What did those sound like? What was, were you, were there certain people that you were looking up to as producers and wanted to kind of try to capture that feel or that sound? Sure. Well, I always had my own sound. You know, a lot of it was my teen spirit that was blowing up. You know, I just wanted... I think I had a knack for just making things that were both like a bomb going off as well as extremely spiritual and psychedelic at the same time. And I think I got that from being a promoter. I always looked at the front end of the party to be like, we're just going to take a wire brush and we're going to scour off your past conceived. notions of what is and we'll scrub that off and then we'll heal you back up with some great house music in the morning and hopefully you'll be a better person because that's what happened to me a few times I tried to have a balance of aggression and love. And I think that's an important thing. I've got two kids now, so it's important, I think, philosophy for life. My boys, for a while, I had every handmade gender-neutral. Scandinavian wood toy in the world, you know, and the second they saw a plastic gun, that's what they wanted, you know, and so there's something in us that's, that is aggressive, and then there's something that comes pretty easy too, which is love and compassion. I think it's important to have time for both of those things, and with the shows and with the music that I made, you know, I really made a lot of hard music early on and it was really you know an outlet for me for a lot of things probably with my personal life my upbringing and and just growing up you know with a heavy metal you know childhood Once I kissed when I was in fourth grade and that really shaped things. It's funny, I've seen you name some of your influences and I guess I wasn't that surprised when I thought about it for a moment, but you mentioned Metallica and then on the other hand, Ravi Shankar. I was like, this is two very fascinating... It goes back to what you were saying about the... aggression and then healing later on. Well, I think anybody's line, if they would deny that we're not complex beings that have, there's time for every kind of feeling. So production-wise, I really looked up to Jeff Mills, Aphex. and some of the people that were really pushing the dynamism of what music is and going beyond just a dance beat. There was an expansion to it that stimulated your mind as well as your body, and there was no cheesiness stuff, no sort of like... I want to get to know you, girl, kind of stuff. Because we got enough of that. What was the first record that you produced that you felt like, okay, I feel like I have my own voice here? Interesting. Because I think for a lot of producers, certainly in the early years of their production, it's a lot of sort of finding their way, a little bit of emulation. Well, that's nice of you to ask. Or maybe you came out fully formed immediately. There's that too. Much to the dismay and disgust of a lot of my fans, I've evolved ever since and continue to. Now I'm into just really deep, spacey house and techno and stuff. warms the space around me. It's probably a reflection of that I've just gotten older and gotten into different things. But once upon a time, you know, I... I made a record called Basketball Heroes, and that's probably my most famous record. And we went on to have Basketball Heroes 2 and Basketball Heroes 3 in the works right now. And that was all, you know, that was kind of known as being an acid DJ, or acid producer. Not acid house, but acid. And I gave a wonk to it that no one had ever done before. It was always a lot of emulation of the early sort of Chicago, future acid music, which was acid house, very danceable. very just club friendly and Basketball Heroes was a real outcry. I was an All-State basketball player. I wanted to ask you where all this sort of came from. I had a pretty I grew up in sports, but my dad is a great artist. My dad is one of the greatest artists I've never known. My mom is just a beautiful poet. Just a cool lady. So I had a lot of interests. A lot of music people sometimes say, oh, he's a jock or whatever. But I was into everything, art and writing. music and sports and the outdoors and my parents were smart enough to raise us kind of out in the outskirts of town and a little fresh air to breathe and I was very lucky and very cool. Sorry, with the basketball heroes, Dr. J, why was he the one? He was the one for me. He's the Michelangelo of basketball. He took it to a ballet level. If you ever watched a Dr. J highlight film, it's just poetry in motion. Just a beautiful, soaring acrobat. Transcended the game. Just putting the ball in the hoop. grace to it that uh you know some say jordan you know maybe rekindled a little bit but dr j was the guy you know and then i really really worked hard at playing basketball and being you know grace and expressive like him and I had a real gift for it and when I was in junior high even I got to practice and play with all the guys up at the junior college you know a lot of they recruit a lot of black players from like Chicago and Detroit Milwaukee and You know, really, really, you know, they were considerably better than anybody in town. And they took me under their wing again. You know, I was lucky to be a protege to them as well. And I got a lot better. Were you a forward? You know, I was one of the tallest kids in town, 6'6", but I could handle the ball. I played all positions. It was not uncommon to get a rebound at one end and take it all the way to the other end. And so... And I was a rebel, too, in my own town. So I think titling Basketball Heroes as I did also was a little bit of a dig against the conventions of electronic music, which were, you know. Always trying to be kind of street. It was very funny. I was looking at your Discogs page today, and that was immediately, even though I knew the record, it immediately jumped out among all the titles, even, of the records. I was just sort of like, that's such a strange... Yeah, so I named these songs after my heroes. and there was one guy up at the junior college, Darren Houston. It was funny because I was trying to look up him, and I couldn't find him. Your record was the only thing that came up in Google, and I was like, who is Darren Houston? That's cool that you tried to look him up. He was very Dr. J-esque, and he's this amazing player from Chicago. exposed me to some Chicago acid house early on. Really? Okay. but he had these cassette tapes, you know, and he's this basketball player, he's kind of a suave, kind of Billy Dee Williams kind of guy, and just amazing at a 40-inch vertical, just a cool, amazing player, and just a neat guy. But he brought some of these mixtapes off the radio in Chicago, and I heard, like, some early B-52s dance stuff, and just New Wave, and some Acid House. And so I didn't realize until you brought this up that he was probably my first. first introduction to, you know, a music that I would pursue, you know. Who's the Birdman? And the Birdman is Larry Bird. Okay. Yeah. Right. So, you know, and he was... I don't know if grace is exactly the word I'd use, but of course, amazing, amazing player. He could hold his own against anybody, you know, especially for a big, clumsy white guy, you know. And so I... And if you've ever played against a whole bunch of athletically superior black guys that really can play and jump and have grown up with the ball, you see Larry Bird being able to hold his own and do magic. It's jaw-dropping. I couldn't jump that high, and I just had a lot of determination, and he really inspired me. When did you give up basketball? Was it college then? Well, I went on to playing college. We went to the national tournament. I got to play with some great players. You played at University of Minnesota? No, no. I just played at Bismarck State College. We went on to the national junior college tournament. I had ahead of me a possible college scholarship, full ride thing, but I broke a vertebrae in my back when I was a junior. I didn't even get to play my... So I was All-State for two years, getting recruited like mad, broke a vertebrae on the court, and I didn't get to play my senior year. And I rehabilitated. I played one year in college and redeemed myself to the community. And I went to drug and alcohol treatment too my senior year, and it was a shocker. Because it's a small town. Like I said, I kind of came back, redeemed myself. I grew up a lot. Was that a lot to do with the fact that you're this sports star and then you broke your vertebrae? Oh, no. It was in my lineage. It had to come out. And, you know, just my family has a history of that. And, you know, it was going to show its head at some point. And, you know, it was kind of short and intense. I was really lucky that my parents had money to send me to treatment because treatment, you know, you learn a lot about yourself and just about being a person. And it, you know, identified some stuff that helped me turn into a better person. And so, yeah, I played one year in college, and I redeemed myself, and we went to the national tournament. I had a great time. I was lucky to play some great players, and I did a great job. And then I just said, that's enough. I don't want to have a broken back for life. Fortunately, because in North Dakota they looked at chiropractors as witchcraft, I probably had one trip to the chiropractor that really helped me out back then. And I didn't discover that for another 10 years. So I limped around with a bad back all through the first part of my techno career. So you're dancing with a broken vertebrae. Yeah, all messed up, misaligned, a little bit of torn ligaments down there. And then leaning over to DJ in the early days, you know, on those cafeteria tables was probably not too good for it. So Basketball Heroes and My Childhood were close. So do you feel like that's sort of the first record also? I mean, you probably had a couple records before then that you felt very strong about. Well, a lot of them were just kind of winging it and just doing my best with limited knowledge or producing with other people. That was the first time I kind of had my own studio and I worked hard to kind of give it my own sound. I bought a particular mixer. and I ran my gear through a particular DJ mixer as kind of a preamp and gave it a little bit of distortion and color. And, you know, I can say thanks to you bringing it up. You know, that was probably the first time I really crafted my own thing, you know. And it was, I remember making those songs. They were titled for those basketball people, but they were representative of some things that were going on in my life with just some relationships or just becoming a more contemporary person in the world. So it was a big release. Was that release on Communiqué? So this was, I guess, one of the first releases on that label. So Communiqué, a day came when I was no longer interested and able to produce hard music. I kind of helped make Drop Bass Network Records. He was a huge fan of mine. I produced some of the most insane, crazy, cool. early sort of punk American techno. Did you always in your mind sort of identify electronic music with punk? Sort of at least this attitude of it? No, because there was always sort of a... I mean, there was kind of maybe a little bit of a punk rock spirit to it, but there was just a... intelligence. Just the spirit, of course. Yeah, and the do-it-yourself. There was an anti-establishment spirit to it, but there was also, you know, it wasn't just about tearing down. It was about building something new as well, you know, replacing. And to me it was. So, you know, some of the post-new wave and early people, they were creating some kind of... art and some mind candy as well as just some rah, rah, rah, you know. But I broke away from drop bass. It was tough, but I wanted to do my own thing, you know. I just couldn't make all these crazy records. Probably, you know, I had... I haven't done it since, but I probably had a psychedelic awakening that just said, I want something different. And that was a long time ago, goodness sakes. But yeah, Communique was born, and I had enough steam behind me to kind of get a label off the ground. And back then, it's... So the idea was definitely to make a break in sound as well with what you'd been doing. More than anything. It ended up being good business. a lot of my success and blessings and was able to give a lot of artists an opportunity to get their start, especially a lot of local artists. So it was really a big time. the Midwest to be putting out records and Minneapolis kind of had its own sound. You know, we had a little bit, just a different sound. It wasn't housey, it wasn't techno, it wasn't industrial, just had its own sort of finish to it that was really cool to be part of. But you couldn't necessarily put your finger on it. Do you think that's why sometimes people remember Chicago House, obviously, New York House, Detroit Techno? Well, it's a boutique. Minneapolis is kind of a boutique city. You know, it's not the most popular sound, but there's enough people around the world. You know, it's kind of the law of averages. There's only one person in a hundred that's into this. And so if you add it all up. Yeah. But, you know, it was a very boutique sound. And looking back, perhaps we were. kind of the underdogs of the Midwest. We never got any props, and we were always overshadowed by Detroit and Chicago. So I think there was a lot of just trying to be different to it. Chris Attinger, he lives in Berlin, went on to be just a really amazing producer, DJ. He was next level and lucky to work with him and Freddie and then I'd travel around and get to be buddies with a few bigger DJs and I'd ask them to do releases. It was very peer-oriented and very personal to me. I'd travel around or I'd do an event with some certain DJs that I really was digging. We'd do some releases. But it was very peer-oriented, very simple. I had a good relationship with the distributor. If we could sell 500 copies and move on and pay them. pay for the pressing, and do something unique with the artwork. I don't know if you know any about the artwork. That was kind of our signatures. Well, I was lucky to get in touch with the guy that did all the mastering and cutting for Underground Resistance and Jeff Mills out of Detroit. He was actually... Ron Murphy? Yeah, an older guy who did all the Michael Jackson stuff. all the Detroit stuff and he could make your records play backwards and we'd etch information into the wax and so we had just a really neat personality to communicate. I think that's where the artist in me got to have a little bit of an outlet. It was just a fun time. And then that darn Richie Hotton's digital music came along and screwed everything up, you know. You had some strong words in the long interview I read. I think it was with Just Quality Music about digital music and how it seems to you like the power has been handed in to you. fewer and fewer hands over time. Well, I think it's been kind of, it's gone that way. I think there's pretty good people behind it. I don't think they necessarily grabbed that power. It's put a lot of people out of business. Just think all the record store owners around the world that gave their heart and soul and slept in the back room just because they love vinyl and they love records. Those guys are all gone. All those records have just been sent to secondhand stores. Here and there, it's still being kept alive in some cool cities, probably like Berlin. But all in all, it really hurt the industry. It hurt a lot of creativity because a lot of people just don't have the ability to get music out and make a little money on it, even if you make a couple hundred bucks. Even for bigger, second-tier DJs like me, selling digital music, you don't sell much. A lot of just the commercial stuff or the bigger names are the people that are selling it. So it's definitely changed the dynamic. Personal computing is kind of maybe... There's so much personal power to produce now, you know, where before you had to maybe go into a studio or go over to a friend's house who had a studio and produce. Now you can do it all yourself. In that respect, it's pretty awesome. Just awesome, awesome, awesome. There's people all over the world producing. You know, early on, you know, I could maybe I'll change the way I feel even during this interview, but early on I kind of felt it was like Einstein, you know, like he had all this smarts and he knew how to, he figured out how to split the atom and I don't think he ever intended all this smarts to be used to make the bomb. Sure. You know, and I can see that digital of music, there was no stopping it. It would have came to that anyway. It's much more environmentally friendly. It's much more efficient. And it was going to go that way anyway. But similar to that metaphor of Einstein, it really had a hurtful impact on, I think, a lot of people. the in crowd and the big name DJs really survived and made out pretty well. Not being able to put out records and go record shopping anymore. It was really fun for a lot of people. There's not that artwork anymore. It was fun just to dig. Now everyone's got access to the same music. It was before you had to hustle. It was kind of fun. It was part of the fun. And that's changed. It is what it is, but I kind of miss that part of it. What sort of music were you making around the time that digital music started to take hold? I mean, obviously, I think minimal techno is largely identified with that era. And maybe it's just that the records you were, the stuff that you were into at that time wasn't. the chic sound. I definitely was stubborn through it and I was just an idiot from a business perspective thinking that somehow vinyl was going to survive and I just... had my head in the sand for way too long and just would not surrender. And I just did not invest early on in the digital world, even after multiple invitations to kind of come along. Just the sort of recalibration of the whole industry just was so upsetting to me that I just... I'm stubborn. There's no... I don't think that you can... There are a lot of people who are stubborn. Yeah, well, I was playing records a lot longer than most people, and I've yet to ever play on a tractor. But similar to my, you know, my reluctance to change the music I was making. Still had kind of that old spirit being produced kind of rawly and unprofessionally, but being produced just raw, raw expression that was, I think it lost a lot of popularity because it wasn't translating to the laptop speakers. It didn't have that sort of... in-home application like a lot of the music that was coming out did. Minimal music just started to have so much depth and texture and detail. It was so advanced and well beyond me and I'm just starting to catch up now. Do you feel like you're catching on? Yeah, yeah. Especially as a DJ. I've kind of returned a little bit of my DJing. you know, be able to really capture a wavelength and sustain that, you know. And as a producer, I'm just, a lot of swallowing, hard to evolve, you know, like, you know. I get so many emails. I got emailed the other day after one of my releases. I am one of your biggest fans in the world, and I have been since day one. And this is the fucking worst song I've ever heard in my life. You know, and I was just like, wow, am I doing something right? Am I doing something wrong? And I just said, well, you know, I've just changed. But during that transition period, I just, I wasn't getting it. And I was still making a roll. out there music that wasn't turning people on in the home listening environment. I kind of got left behind and I've been scrambling to catch up ever since. Lucky enough, I did enough damage early on to where people respect what I do and I've always thought that I have a good ear. And in combination with leading a humble, simple life in the Midwest and being a producer, DJ, promoter, organizer, artist, community organizer, little by little I can still lead the life I want to live. And more than anything, I've got a couple of kids, a five-year-old and a three-year-old, that are ready to start programming. Already. For sure. Ocean, my five-year-old, he's getting a computer for Christmas, and I can guarantee it. Let's not post this before Christmas. Oh, hey, buddy. Yeah, well, he has asked Santa for a computer. Well, he wants my iPhone, but he's going to probably get that one. a computer and because I know that he's ready to start programming and creating and he and so being able to involve a new generation with my life is pretty exciting. And there's certain buffering that I've had to do to have a family and a wife and a conventional life and still be a DJ ESP. that theme of balance is ever present. But it's real fun to... kind of feel at ease to introduce my kids to creativity and an alternative form of expression with this music and prepare them for all the things that come along with being alternative and teach them about that balance. You said that a fan emailed you and said that a recent track of yours was... worst thing that they'd ever heard. Where do you think you are right now with your music? What are you creating? What are you inspired by? Well, that song in particular was, you know, rather kind of, it was kind of a Kevin Saunderson-y, kind of organ-y house, just real spacey, beautiful house song that I thought was like, geez, I think this is like one of my best songs ever. And, you know, it was this vast departure from... It's taken a lot of courage for me to, like, feel a different kind of music, you know, and put it out there. Because it's kind of like Metallica, you know, like going back, you know, they've released some just albums that I think just suck. It'll last, too, but... You can tell that they're growing up. They're not quite as interested in writing about, you know, death worshiping, and either am I. And so I think it's just one of those things. I always told myself, just do what you do, however you feel like doing it, until no one's listening, and then do something else. So I'm still doing it, and there's enough people that are digging it, and I'm digging it. So as long as that keeps going, it's me. And stay true to myself. I've never really jumped on any bandwagons. great for you know great sacrifice I've never followed any of the trends and you know and there's some good trend followers out there let me tell you and but you know you look around and what would you do What is next? If there is... Sure. Well, I have kind of started up some other businesses. I work as a community organizer in the area that I live in, producing a lot of summer concerts and events and festivals. And kind of my motif is hip family fun. It's usually one or the other. It's usually hip or family fun. So the real art. promoting, organizing events. It's both of those things. I think we're seeing with a lot of artists and people now are maybe delaying those child raising years. Whereas our parents had kids in their 18, 19, 20, 21. and we're looking into the 30s now. And you take a little extra time to grow up and arguably, you know, maybe be a little bit, you know, different experience as a parent. And so you have all these hip tastes, but you also have some kids. I really am digging that. So I'm in the sideline business doing that and in a few different areas where I live. It must be very similar promoting in a way like that and promoting a party, right? Well, yeah. I mean, it's different. I mean, you shift some of that stress of an underground thing that has a lot of unpredictable variables. You shift. A lot of the energy that you spend on that into just some of the minutia of creating a good all-day event for a whole bunch of people. You're booking some cool indie rock bands. You're booking some cool folk music. You might get a really great jazz band. You might get a kid's magician. You might get some stilt walkers. It's kind of like something I always wanted to do anyway, just a real interesting variety show. I've been doing this for a while now, and I really dig it. I'm getting good at it. I've had a couple cities hire me to produce their public events. So that's kind of what I'll probably continue to do as life goes on. I don't know, do you have any kids? No. So the first few years of kids are so exhausting and time-consuming that I really haven't had time to work in the studio like I had wanted to, but now my kids are getting a little older. Actually, the night before I came to Europe on this trip, everybody was sleeping. A light bulb went on in my head, and I said, I'm going to go down and set the studio up again, because it's all restored right now. My laptop is everything that I've been needing and using for a few years now. I'm kind of coming up for air with being a dad, and I'm going to set the studio up again. Probably good timing, you know, with Oisin getting his computer, and we'll start programming this winter and kind of cozy up. And so I'm really looking forward to this next year. Could be pretty interesting. Yeah, I really think that I'm going to really get back to my old self in the studio and hopefully I've still got enough momentum. stay relevant I'm quite confident that I will and my DJing has improved so much over the past few years that I think I find you said that you know earlier I find that so fascinating I mean you've been doing it for years and you still feel like wow I'm really improving oh gosh it's well I had such eclectic tastes in my, you know, back, you know, I came from a generation of DJs that it was just pretty much good enough to have great taste and be able to beat match. And you kind of strung songs together and you tried to EQ enough to where the energy stayed consistent. But now... It's changed. Now it's about a deep, deep finesse where you're really riding a wave for a sustained period of time, especially in Europe. I mean, four, five, six, seven, eight-hour sets are not uncommon, whereas in America, you're lucky to get an hour and a half. I remember Claude Young. played this year at Movement. So many people said, oh, wow, such an amazing set. I listened to some of it, and he's cutting. between genres and styles, very much like you were saying. And it was great, but I also think it was just, no one had heard someone DJ like that for a while in that style where it was just like... beat matching all over the place with all these great, great tunes. Not to say that they aren't great, but I do think it's just so rare now that people are doing so that it comes as such a nice surprise somehow to hear a DJ play like that. Well, you know, it could be a little bit of a novelty. There's an art to it, of course. Well, you know, I think music has gotten to be, I mean, the DJing style, especially for some of the really good DJs, like one guy, a German guy, Nick Curley, he came to Minneapolis last year and really changed my life, like, profoundly. Like, never really heard... someone play with such consistency before. I had a lot of unanswered questions and feelings about what I liked and what I wanted to do. I saw something that I was really influenced by and I put a little, just put a little steam in where I wanted to go. And so, like I said, I really focused a lot on my DJing just because it's what I've had time to do and really realized that. being able to sustain a particular wavelength and let people really ride on that. Because with the production quality nowadays of some of this music, the vibes can be so thick, and you can really just work it. That was the neat thing about early raving is that it could go all night. It was sustained. certain place that was sustained. There's something that happens to your experience as a person. There's a concentrated, accelerated evolution that can happen when you sustain a feeling. It's kind of like you're holding a yoga pose for a lot longer than you ever did. Three seconds as opposed to three hours. and there's just accelerated evolution that happens and there's a lot of people that are getting really good at it and it's exciting to see that sort of maturity to electronic music. It really has become spiritual and meditative and a soundtrack for... a group of people that want to live peacefully and get a little exercise and have a good time. So it's exciting that it's really come of age. Maybe that's what I'm trying to say is that I witnessed it really come of age. And it was completely free of all those taboos and all the societal... Static that you mentioned and it's just a happy night for me and I think it pushed me a little bit to kind of slay DJ ESP a little bit you know like the hard ass DJ you know I could finally kind of let it go I just didn't have the fear of losing my whole career if I let go of that kind of expression and I could do something that I feel. And so some of the internal conflict was gone. It's a good place to be in. Thank you.
