Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. It seems like we say it every week, but Joseph is a producer we've had our eye on from the beginning of the exchange to participate. Not because of the music he makes, although EPs for labels like Wolf and Lamb and Finne and Culprit will quickly make you realize how wonderful it is, but more because of his personality, quick with a laugh. self-deprecating comment or a compelling anecdote, Joseph is the type of guy that begs to be heard. It's no wonder that he's convinced almost everyone along the way, whether it be Fabric's Craig Richards, with whom he shares a label, Space Ibiza, where he has a residency at We Love, or John Digweed, the man who asked him to be a resident at Bedrock's recent series of dates in London at XOYO. We need to briefly mention that Joseph once worked for Resident Advisor, yet I think that you'll agree at the end of this hour that his path to his current position as a DJ producer on the rise was born of a whole lot of elbow grease. So sit back, relax, and enjoy one of the most entertaining men in dance music. Your dad is a musician. So take me back to your childhood. Take me back in time. Is this an interview or is this like a psychology visit while I'm sat on the couch? Take me back to your childhood. My father was a professional musician. He's not anymore because he's retired. Do you ever really retire? Yeah, he did, definitely. He was like, "I'm fucking sick of this, let's finish it." Yeah, he was a professional drummer for the majority of his life. I mean, he turned probably when he was like 14 or something silly. Back in the olden days, it was crazy. Really super, super young. What did he play? Drums. Drum kit. Cymbals, snare drums, floor toms. Do you want to give me a genre? I think when you're that age, he started off playing loads of different stuff. He played a lot of the cabaret stuff because it was obviously that's what was, you know, playing in working men's club and doing that stuff. But he obviously loved his jazz. And then obviously when the blue beat thing started to kick off. and he ended up sort of doing all that stuff which sort of got him into the more the poppy stuff but the biggest thing I think which really got him into the more the rock and roll stuff was the skiffle like anybody in that time to get into playing rock and roll, you know, it was all about playing skiffle. So, because it was almost like... So he was there right at the beginning. Yeah, for sure. I mean, my dad's 73, you know, he's not a young... Well, yeah, he behaves like he's five years old, but he's actually not. Me and my dad and I, it's ridiculous when we're together because we're like a pair of kids. But yeah, he was there right at the beginning. So I think with the skiffle thing, it was almost like, I don't know, like punk was for those kind of, for the 70s kids where it was really... do-it-yourself thing because you remember after you remember it was like after the second world war so no one had nothing no one had any money or i mean he certainly didn't have any money he came from a really large i mean he's an only child but his his parents had loads and loads of loads in the war No, he was born just after 47 or something. Okay, baby boomer. Yeah, right. So, yeah, he didn't come from a particularly, you know, wealthy family. They're all working class or worked down the docks and that. But, yeah. That Skiffle thing was very, very do-it-yourself ethos. You know, the bass, you had to have like a bit of string and a tea chest, you know. It comes from this family, though. I mean, it must have been a big thing for him to go and do the music. Yeah, for sure. It was really strange, though, because my dad, my father, I don't mind telling you this, but my father was amazingly talented as a drummer. He was amazing. I And, you know, he used to run home from school at lunchtime to practice and then go back to school. and then carry on going to school and then come home and just practice all night. He just absolutely adored it. But no one in his family was really musical. Do you have that worth? Yeah, totally. I do. That's why probably every relationship I've ever had is disintegrated into nothing. And my mum and I probably do the same. Because, yeah, it's almost like I've seen this as someone actually fairly recently. It's not like... some it's not you have a choice about it really i just i just i wake up in the morning and that's just all i want to do is either go and sit in the studio well actually that's all i actually want to do is go and sit in the studio and then obviously it comes to the weekend and you go and play and then you come home and then you think oh but while you're away you know you're on an airplane or a train or whatever and you're faffing about on laptops because it's just it is People around you find it a bit tricky. Because you're like, yeah, babe, I'll do the dinner in a minute. I'll do it in a minute. I'll do it in a minute. I'll do it in a minute. Yeah, I know I haven't put the washing on. I know, I know, I know. I've just got to literally just do this one loop and then I've just got to literally do this chord structure and I'll be with you. You do realise how long that's going I mean, I've now, they've now just stopped asking me because once the studio door shuts, then it kind of, that's kind of the end of it really. So now you have a door. I mean, that's the most important thing, right? People have been known to lock the door on the other side. I've been locked in my studio in the past because people have been quite angry with me. So they've sort of like, do you know what, you want to stay in there? Then bugger you which I have done, which suit me fine. Yeah, and you didn't realise until the next morning. I didn't actually realise until five o'clock in the morning, which by that time was too late. But yeah, my dad, he got into all that Skiffle stuff. And then, I mean, he was like a real big fan of the king of Skiffle, a guy called Lonnie Donegan, who really kind of... um he was like the forefront of that whole skiffle movement basically so um yeah he just adored him and followed him all around and when he then he started to what he was born in wales my dad's in in south wales so he ended up just working in all the men's the you know the the working men's clubs and all that type of jazz was he ever like Ugh, rock and roll. I don't know about that. It sounds like, you know, he moved from jazz to skitball. It sounds like he's quite open-minded. Yeah, but to be fair, though, I mean, it's funny you say that because it got to a point, I think, where, you know, my dad was listening to, later on down the line, was listening to rock and roll because he ended up then getting in a trio. They were called the Ricky Allen combo, the Ricky And, you know, they moved to London and signed the record deal with Parlophone and that. And I think, you know, he wouldn't mind me saying that it got to a point where it's just like boom, chika, boom, chika. It's just nothing really happens in it. You know, it is fairly simple. It was quite strange because he then kind of evolved when he'd moved to London when he was very, very young and turned pro and then sort of went out on the road with the band. He ended up then in a roundabout way working for Lonnie Donegan, which I think for him was just the most bonkers thing in the world because my dad always tells me these really great stories about people throughout his life that were really influential to him when he was very... very young people like Kenny Clare or Lonnie Donegan or those kind of guys or Buddy Rich and he ends up throughout the course of time either working with these guys or playing with these guys. And nine times out of ten, those people saying, fucking hell, you're amazing. You know, which to me is, it sounds a bit, it sounds a bit much, you know, it sounds a bit kind of, you know, sort of gushy about my dad. But my dad always says to me, you have to celebrate your successes, you know, and it's like when those things happen, you're like bleeding out, you know. But that's what going on. Come on, you and Greg Richards. I was trying. Yeah. I was trying. I'll have to try a bit harder, I think. But, yeah, but again, that's just testament to how hard he worked because it didn't, it's one of those things where I think. both my father and my mother, my mother was in the Royal Ballet, you know, and she was someone that was naturally talented and she was just built to be in the ballet. Ended up not really liking it that much by the end of it. It was just, I don't really want to, I don't think I really like this very much anymore. And I think my dad got a little bit like that. towards the end of his career as well. He stayed in Vegas and played with Tom Jones and had done all that malarkey. And I think he got to a point when, particularly when he married my mother, that they were just a bit like, oh God. Because show business can be very, very tough on, not on your personal life, but just be on yourself. You know, you could actually be shooken after a while. you know, it's quite strange that both of them were really talented and really very successful at what they did, but then just got to a point where it was just like, well, you know, maybe we'll meet. They met on the road, surprisingly enough. Yeah, that's a story for another time. Yeah, no, my dad was doing some shows, I think somewhere really glamorous like Blackpool or Scunthorpe or somewhere was on the road. And I think when my mum had finished the ballet, she then had just been one of the show dancers. So I had then gone on the road and then I think she's doing a show with my dad and my dad went, oh, actually cool. and then the rest is kind of history. Yeah. And then I popped up. Even though you shy away from comparisons, do you see some of yourself in your father to get psycho analysis? Yeah, I should be lying on the couch, I think. Yeah, I think so. I think, I mean, I've got two brothers and an older sister and I think that... It's one of those things, you know, families always say this thing about, oh, you're that guy and you're that guy. You're the clever one and you're the sporty one and you're like the Spice Girls, you know. But in my family, it's like both my brothers are very, very similar to my mother and I'm kind of like very, very similar to my dad. So I think not only in appearances or in behavior and attitude, I think that my dad and I like. a lot of the same things. There's a lot of, I mean, it's a really simple thing, just like the music, for example, like, you know, I sit and I've got all my dad's records now because he hasn't got a record player anymore because I broke it. I got it off on purpose. Oh, it's broken. I better take all these vinyl off your hand then, dad. But yeah, so I mean, he gives me loads of records and we'll sit and listen to records together would feel the same way about that music as what I do. But, you know, both my brothers have probably more musical talent than what I do when it comes to like the rudiments of it. Because my older brother is an amazing drummer. Like he's one of these really annoying people that can play piano and play the guitar and play the drums. And it's like... I mean, he's into more sort of the heavier side of music. He produces like heavy rock and roll bands or heavy metal bands. He's in a band himself, you know. he's into that more that kind of side and from a technician standpoint he's more like my father because i can't even you know i can't even play cluedo let alone play the drums you know but i try at least the sounds are in my head i've just got to try and get them out um and my little baby brother is more musical than i am he's much he can play the piano nicely you know he's the first guy that actually got me into the technical side of electronic music because he had a version of Cubase thousands and thousands of years ago when I was out DJing. He and I used to sit down and do edits together, you know, 10, 15 years ago. So he was into it way before that technical side. So from that standpoint... both of them are actually probably more like him than I am. It's just I make more noise than them, basically. I just sit there shouting, Motherfucker! Shit-bitten bastard! It's just spacking away at my keyboard. You can hear the hard work. that goes into your music? Well, the first time I remember, the first time that I seriously sat down and said to myself, right, I really, really want to write music and I've got to find a way of doing it was probably about, I don't know, five or six years ago. And I sat down and I was like, right, put some money aside, went and bought a Mac. It was only a little laptop at the time and I'd started to learn how to use Ableton. I started to faff around with a little bit of logic and couldn't really get it going. But I was really into it and was really loving it. So the laptop started to slowly but surely die. So I thought, right, I'm going to have to put my neck on it and buy a proper one. computer and I swear to god that those first two years you could hear the hard work because I almost threw that computer out the bedroom about 10 times I used to live in this house in Bethnal Green in East London and in the bedroom there was because that's where the setup was because we shared a house with everybody else my little setup was in the bedroom and there was a big wall of mirrors to my right hand side and I shit you not Those mirrors must have got broken about three times because I've got a very, very short temper. And when things don't work, and because I learned myself, I didn't ever take any lessons or I didn't read the books I can't actually read. It's like, I thought, no, no, I can do this myself. And just, yeah, the world was falling apart on a daily basis. My landlord wasn't that impressed with me. Why did you make the decision? have to produce because it was just something that because I always because I've always grown up with it whether it be through my my father and having music in the house when I was a kid or particularly my older brother he was always in bands and I always used to hang out with him and then he he's when he then sort of went from band music and flirted with electronic music I hung out with him and all his friends were sort of they're much much older than me you know they were all into this I always really wanted to do it and I always had it in me but it was very very difficult to get it out on my head and onto the page so I had to it got just got to a point where because I'd been DJ for so long and I've been faff around doing these little edits which my brother would help my baby brother would help me do I just got to a stage where I was like, I have to do this because it's driving me. It's mental because I'm one of these people that walks around and has like riffs and things in their head. And it's nothing. It's like purgatory, you know, walking around with this, what you think is a really good idea. And then there's no way of getting it out of you. So I just, I had to, well, I have to do it because even if it was just something you know, great plan or anything, which still isn't actually a great plan. It probably should be. Yeah, I'll do that tomorrow. I'll work out a plan tomorrow. Let's go back a little bit. Edits. Obviously, you were DJing, so it made sense for you to have stuff that no one else had. Yeah, for sure. It was just one of those things where, like I say, because my younger brother... had a copy of Cubase and he was already putting music together. He knew how to work the interface and he had a keyboard and everything. What was the first thing you edited that worked? It was Nailing and Cane, I think Beach Ball. I did it for New Year's Eve. God, however old that record is, 1998, maybe 99, something like that. It was a long time ago. And we just put, it might have been Sound of the Cosmos bleep. whenever that record came, it might have been that. I can't remember. There's a whole bunch of them actually that I've got, I found when I moved house recently. I try and keep as many of the CDs that I have, even though they're meaningless, horrible pieces of death. I don't mind carting my records around from house to house, even though it does call me like basic paraplegia, but CDs, they mean nothing to me. But I do try and keep some of them. I've moved house recently and I found all these old CDs that my brother and I had cobbled together, these edits, and I decided to listen to them. Some of them were like, wow, that was horrendous. How did I even think that was going to fucking work, man? But some of them were actually quite good. But it was really funny because even in them days, I mean, I was just playing records because there was way before there was CDJ 1000s or anything like that. And I bought, I remember when we started doing these edits, I remember I bought this. Actually, I didn't buy it. My friend gave it to me. My friend from Birmingham gave it to me. This old Gemini front-loading CD player. And I used to schlep it round to these gigs in places like Worcester and Hereford with me in Bristol. I used to plug in this 1940s flunk just so I could play this one edit that I'd done the week before, you know, which nine times out of ten probably didn't work. Great days. Things haven't changed that much, to be honest. So, yeah, what was the question? What do you look for in a song? What do I look for in a song? That you edit. I don't really know actually. It doesn't quite work yet. Yeah. No, that's the thing. It's really strange. I don't, I, I've, there's obviously this debate, or at least there has been, maybe it's not that topical anymore, but there was the debate a few years ago when the Tiger in Woods and Wolf and Lambs and everyone started doing edits properly that, you know, it was almost like. And when days gone by, I think when Frankie Knuckles first started chopping all that tape up and doing those edits, his idea was that this record needs to work in a different way. I think for me, when I was doing those edits, particularly the ones I did for the RA podcast, was just records I loved. And those records are amazing on their own. I think it would be a little bit arrogant to say, you know, this record don't work, so I'm going to make it well better. I spit like, no, that's not really, that's not really the case with the Rigby though, is it? Let's be honest. I mean, get a phone out my cart and go, look mate, you tried, but have you listened to this? Cause yours was shit. Seven people have downloaded this record, you know what I mean? I think, yeah, nine times out of ten, it's just records that I adore. You know, like, I love Bat for Lashes, which is why I did two of hers. I did an edit of hers, the Daniel record, which I did a few seasons ago, which I did for my, I think it was my first or my second gig at We Love. I did like a, I think the first time I played there, they asked me to do a mix afterwards. So I basically just, well, before MGMT girls I think it was but you seem to go pretty pop yeah but I love pop music that's the thing is I love going back to like I was saying it's about my father and I you know and I love Neil Diamond. I mean, it's crackers because to me, it's just one of those things where a good record is a good record is a good record is a good record. And I don't really give two thumbs if someone says, I can't believe that you love the Saturdays. The thing is that Paul Ekworth that writes those records, he writes some fucking good records, man. It's not very cool to say it, but to me. I think it's just those things where it's just music and it doesn't really... When you're DJing it's very, very different. You have to try and you'd have to tread a thin line between, you know, you're there to entertain someone and you can't sort of go off and go, "Look, I've got to play this amazing Barbra Streisand record for you." You're playing before Sasha, not quite sure that's a really good idea. But when it comes to writing my music or particularly be you know Neil Young or Manor Robin soundtrack 1989 I haven't actually listened to that I just pulled that one out Prince did the first Batman soundtrack so there you go case in point you're in good So is there anything to talk about with your early DJing days? Did you play at some sort of legendary club? Well, when I started playing, because like I said before, my older brother got me into electronic music because before that I was into hip-hop and I was into Rage Against the Machine and Metallica and Guns N' Roses and Pearl Jam. you know, those kind of guys. And I never really understood electronic music, particularly, I think, because a lot of it, my parents had brought me up not to. Not to listen to it as such, but even like in those, because I grew up in the 80s, it was even then that really electronic stage that we went through with the pop music, with, you know, with all those guys. My parents kind of stayed away from that, particularly because my dad used to hate, he hated the sound of like a 909, so he just would drive him mad. So I was always brought up bandy kind of stuff, even with the pop stuff, whatever. So I was never exposed got me into it and he just because of the way he migrated into electronic music he got into like the most gnarly acid techno craziness in the world and being 14 15 years old i was like this looks like a really good idea yeah so i ended up just going out with him and listening to the music and was exposed to a quite a frightening array of techno i didn't realize there were that many but he started to he started to put on a party you know, with a friend of his in the back of his pub, which was a really crusty techno party. And I got into, so I, my introduction to electronic music was through things like Prodigy and it was things like that, that kind of more and the Chemical Brothers. And then obviously this acid, Dave, the drummer, Stay Up Forever, tech record stuff. So my early forays into DJing were very, very, I've still got a lot of the records now because I put them on. Every so often, just listen to the records. Is there anything you can, you know, put on 33? It's funny you said that. There was a Black Tripoli Tracks record that Tony DeVe used to play years and years ago. it's basically just a groover. And the problem is it's 177,000 miles an hour. But I was talking to someone recently about trying, I was going to burn it and try and get it into the laptop because even on minus eight, unfortunately, it's still a little bit quick, but it's a really groovy tune. So I was thinking about dumping it into Ableton just to try and get it down to a fairly reasonable speed because the groove's there. It's just the speed. Yeah, I started off playing a lot harder. So after I went from this techno thing, and it was probably, you know, frightening techno, I kind of thought, oh, I'm going to play a little bit softer now and go into hard house. As you do. So my early stages were all about that. So when did you get into... Respectable. I don't know what it was. That's not the word. When I was playing that music, you know, Hardhouse was pretty respectable then because in them days it was like, you have to remember the real big DJs at that time and John Pleas Women and Judge Jules and, you know, all those type of guys. Which I really considered. Yeah, much later, I think. Yeah. It was only last week, actually. I suddenly... Congratulations. You're welcome. supporting me towards Hanukkah and my world changed. I can't really remember. I used to play a lot when I was younger because I was just one of these ballsy, gutsy kids that all I actually, as soon as I got turntables, all I actually wanted to do was just play in front of people. I didn't, I wasn't really comfortable. I wasn't happy at least just sort of going home and playing at home and being like, oh yeah, wicked, I got decks, yeah. I was just like, because my first ever gig was like playing while everybody was setting up, I sort of said to him, look, you know, while you're setting the lights up and you're doing the noise, can I just play on the sound set just to get used to it? And plus I didn't have techniques at home. I had sound lab DLP1s, belt drives. So he was like, yeah, okay. So my first, that whole thing was actually playing on a stage in a nightclub. I mean, it wasn't open. There was no one there. But that's all I actually ever wanted to do. I wanted to play music to people rather than just physically DJ. Obviously, your sound has matured. Yeah, as I have. This was a long time ago. But I used to send a lot of texts out. And because I was playing, obviously, this pretty hard music after, it became apparent after a while. I mean, I played in a club called Trade in London, in Turnmills. And that was the only place that realistically I could... get a gig because they didn't really mind that I played a thousand miles an hour peak time because everybody did that and I got to play in room two which was the lighter of the two rooms and still got to play a thousand miles an hour and you know the hardest music known to man so but it came apparent after a while that if I really wanted to do some work I really wanted to do something then I needed to broaden my horizons a little bit Because I remember speaking to this promoter, it was years and years ago, in Bristol. He said, look, man, you're really good. He said, I like your music. He said, and technically, you're lovely. He said, but then they, how am I going to book you? Because you're playing the music that the Peak Time guy's playing. So because I didn't know anything about the DJing industry, I knew nothing about it. I just go, I just want to be a DJ. That's then slowly started to teach me that, oh, actually, yeah, why would they put me if they're booking the main guy? So that kind of sent me on this. trail of exploring different pieces of house music because before even though I'd explored loads of different types of music other music like loads of jazz and there's a rock and roll or blue bit or whatever it was I'd never done that electronic music I'd always just been like oh this is electronic music bang bang bang bang I've been going out to the clubs and go bang bang bang bang and I'm you know I never ever heard of god have you heard this trip-hop record like oh wow what's this you know so that was my first you know beginnings into moving away from you know you went to Bristol and this guy gave you some advice yeah he slipped you a tricky record yeah that was it that was thanks to that guy on Jamaica Street He used to run a record shop. I can't remember what it was called now. I should really remember, but yeah. In fact, let's just call him Leon. Thanks, Leon, if you're out there in radio land. So you slowed down. Yeah. Was this before or after you started producing? No, this was way before. Yeah, I only really started. I've been properly producing six years, maybe. But I mean, I was, like I said before, I was always faffing around with my younger brother doing the edits and stuff. But I mean, I started, I kind of, when I sort of went off that, the harder stuff when I was a kid, I guess I must have been 18, maybe 1998, 99, I think something like that. I then sort of went and I managed to go and sort of hang around with a bunch of people that were playing proper US Garage. And I thought, oh, actually, this is quite good because the breakdowns are still quite big in it. It was still full of energy. So I went from sort of, you know, really hard music to something of really really gay soft music but still had the same to me anyway where the way i heard it still had the same amount of energy in it right so i started to hang around with those people and i think well when i got into electronic music it was also like it had to have the same you know you listen to rage against the machine yeah well for sure you listen to yeah there's like you can draw the distinction yeah for sure i mean i mean there's loads of i mean i Again, like I said, when I moved house recently, I started to think, because I've never got rid of any of my records, I've never sold them, and I kind of got to a point where I thought I might have to get rid of some of these tunes. So I started to go through a lot of the old Eric Marrillo stuff, like the really early Subliminal stuff and the Jose Nunez stuff. And some of it's pretty hard listening back to it, but there is still that thing where And that would be a combo there. No, I listened to records I have from 10 years ago and I hear that one. Yeah. I'm like, oh, that's why I bought that. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, for sure. I'm not mental. I did buy it for a reason after all. So what about garage? That is a left turn. yeah but it is it is left but again i i felt it and then i got so deep into that that i then went super super deep and went sort of you know great nights yeah i'm in london i well the thing is i wasn't really going out that much because i was still djing quite a lot and i was spending obviously all my money on records and then you know i spent a lot of time living in bristol with um with this girl and there was there was a there was a kind of nice little house you're seeing there. I started to do some work with Galaxy Radio there. There was a guy called Paul Conroy who had a really wicked house show there. And I then started to do some work with actually the guys now who are getting quite big now, the guys at Waves and Strays and Dan Pearce, who eats everything. I played with them in a nightclub, which was originally called The Rock, which then turned into a club called Scream. And it was a great big nightclub. And those guys used to play downstairs in the main room, playing sort of the more harder music. And I'd be upstairs playing this fluffy US garage. But I got so into it by to get super, super deep. getting into like Henry Street and Soul Fluid Records and the Subliminal Soul stuff and all that distance. Oh, that really, it got, I went from one extreme to the other. So, and plus at that time, it was the same time when I just started doing this, I just started running this pre-bar. There was a club down the road and the guy that was running this bar said, look, you know, you want to come and do some warmups from seven till midnight. So that kind of, kind of taught me how to really properly warm up because you're sort of playing in a bar. You can't bang the shit out of it. You know, you're looking at people around you trying to get their attention without trying to piss them off because they're having a drink before they go to the club. So it was, that was, and I did that for years and that was a really good learning experience. In fact, the guy ended up saying to me, look. you know, just take over it. He said, because you're here every week, you know all the punters anyway, you seem to be doing a fairly good job. Why don't you just run it and then I'll just bugger off and run the club. So that was, but yeah, that was really cool because again, I got to start very, very early, seven o'clock in the evening. I'll just be playing like broken beat, like playing Mr. Scruff stuff and stuff like that was just really good DJs. I hear that tell stories like that. Yeah. They had this night where they had to play for sure. And it was just such a learning experience. Oh, it's amazing. It's really dead simple things. I mean, it sounds, it might sound a little bit silly to people, but it's like really simple things like. when you were playing, it was like you're trying to, you're always trying to think three or four records ahead because you're trying to think of what you're going to do to A, keep these people entertained, but more importantly, to keep them in the bar. So it's like really simple things. Like if you could see someone that would be talking and they'd be stood there and you could probably, the monitors weren't even that loud in there. So you could hear their conversation. And as they're talking, you would think he's Dave. He said, I got a flat tire. And if you suddenly see his head starts to nod or his foot starts to tap, then for me, you're like, oh, that's wicked. I'm going in the right direction. It sounds really changes of body language which you know it's obviously slightly different now you're playing in great big clubs with no one able to eat out their head and it's pitch black but yeah that was how do you you're trying to look for the thing I played it I think I see it yeah I played I did this show with Sasha last weekend actually in uh in Birmingham in the new Gibbs Street warehouse which is behind the old custard factory and it was funny because I walked in there it's the biggest place I've ever played in my life there was like 1700 people in this one room and it was it was amazing it was colossal but you were you were so far away that I couldn't really actually see anybody let alone a finger tap or a head nod and if I did I think it was kind of someone probably falling over or beggaring for a drink it was mad ridiculous so things have obviously changed ever so bristol is kind of uh it was trip-hop it was dub and all this stuff but you were playing yeah house but things yeah i spent a lot of time there my parents ended up moving just across the bridge into South Wales. So I spent a lot of time there. And the girl that I lived with in Bristol, she'd gone to university in Swansea. So stupid Joseph thought it'd be a really good idea to go down there with her, which was interesting. Needless to say, it only lasted a year because I'm obviously not a very schooled person. So, yeah, Wales and Bristol have played and probably will continue to play a massive part in my DJing upbringing anyway because I played a lot there and made a lot of friends there. Yeah, it was a lot of time that I spent there's people my older friends that were friends with my brother You know, I spent a lot of time in there smoking a shitload of weed, you know Listen things like cool keys and if that's the first time I ever heard massive attack was in my friend's barn or my brother's friends barn Listen, I thought what the hell because I was then still playing this garage I was just getting into Derek Carter, all the bump-de-bump type stuff. And then they were playing me this stuff. And it was just like, well, Dr. Octagon. I was like, what the? hell is this you know just oh come on man I can't I can't fit any more music in my head you know so um I kind of got exposed a little bit I didn't get heavy into it because I was just so into my DJing you know um would obviously be having it in the car on my what was then a Walkman when did you when did you move to London I moved back I was born in London I was born just outside London I think I moved back I moved back after my my last relationship, but one relationship fell down again over probably over DJing. So I can't remember, maybe 2000, maybe something like that. I can't remember, 2002 something. It's all a bit of a haze, really. But it was one of those things where it was strange because even though I spent a lot of time in Bristol and I spent a lot of time in Wales, it was almost like I didn't really feel like I was meant to be there, really. You know, when we'd come back to London and we were visiting. Yeah, I genuinely felt like it was really strange. And I don't know why that is. And sometimes I wish I didn't feel like that, if I'm honest, because I. I know that my, particularly my parents moved there for a reason and I never really felt like, yeah, like I said, I never really felt like I was at home there at all. And any time that we'd go back to London and like meet our like our old family friends and stuff, it would be murders to get me on because I just didn't want to go there. I didn't, I just didn't feel like, I don't know how my brothers felt about it. My older brother still lives there now with his Excuse me. Yeah, I just never felt like that was somewhere where, you know, I actually wanted to be. No, it's typical of such a personal thing, nothing to do with the area or the people that I was with because, you know, Bristol's a great city, as is Cardiff. My first proper paid gig was in Cardiff, you know, it was in a club called... What do you like so much about London? I don't know, I just, it's just, I feel like it's It's really weird. There are bits of it which I absolutely despise, but I kind of love it because of that, you know? It's really weird, like, the... I think that's when you know you love a place. Yeah, it's just... Even the stuff that you hate, you're like, what the... I just like, it's like a bitch girlfriend, you know? Yeah. Subway and being mad. Well, the thing is, it's like the anonymity of it. It's amazing. I love the idea that, I mean, where I live in East London, it's kind of like all of us kind of hang out together. You know, you walk down the street and it's kind of like all the museo and the arty type people. You know, there's a real sense of community there. But you literally just go down the street, you know, 10 minutes down the street, and you could be anybody. No one talks to you. You can be invisible. And there are elements of that that I really, really like that you don't have to. I get really frightened. I remember the first time I ever went to Leeds, and I sat on a bus, and this old woman sat down and she went, I love you, all right. And I thought you doing talking to me you're going she's like oh it's terrible today and it okay i hate the rain i was like because you know you're just so not too used to it being in london so that there is that element that i actually really really and i love the idea of you know i don't spend a lot of time on public transport to be brutally honest with you because i hate it but standing at the tube and you know, you'll say three minutes on the thing and it's like the world's coming to an end. You're like, fucking three minutes? Three minutes? What a tube now! It becomes so ridiculous. You know, you're like going, if you take a step back and look at it, you know, and really wealthy city businessmen with, you know, thousand pound shoes on behaving like nine-year-old children on the train. It just, I used to work in a city when I first moved back to London And I was living in Elephant and Castle. And I used to walk to work. It was great. It was only an hour. So it basically gave me time to listen to my music, smoke a few ciggies. Hour there, hour back. No problem. But as the time went on, I started DJing more and more and going out more. I just used to get so hammered. It was impossible for me to walk to work because I was just going to be late. So I used to get on a tube And the tube from Elephant and Castle to Bank is the Northern line, which is the most hideous, if anyone from London knows it, it is just a cataclysmic error of transportation. And I used to just laugh because I'd have my iPod on and I'd look at these. people these grown adults who you know were probably deciding the financial state of the whole country behaving like five-year-olds you know pushing each other and shoving it and giving it all the big and you're like oh mate there's gonna be a training over two minutes don't worry you know it's frightening so that's another element which i love and hate you know it's a paradox so you're djing in london for a couple of years before you start producing. I imagine you found a club called Fabric at some point? Yeah, but it took me a while actually. I mean, when I first moved back to London, I did very much the same thing as what I did when I was a kid. I just set my turntables up in my ex-council flat in the rather delightful Elephant and Castle. set my turntables up and then just started making tapes and the first thing I did was I walked down Old Street and just went into every single bar and every single place I could find said give me a gig please and it took me a while and I ended up then just doing a little just little random parties and I'd end up doing like a set up my little Sunday afternoon party on Hoxton Street in a pub called the Macbeth which we obviously renamed the Macdeath because it was just one of those places where everybody that had been to the Egg or had been to the Cross would schlep up to us and we'd play from Sunday lunchtime till Sunday night. It was great because we'd have people like Matthew Bushrucker B would come in, you know, Bat had loved him and come in and play and all those guys. So I started doing that. And then my friends then, I mean, I actually went to Fabric not long after it opened. I was living in Bristol at the time and pardon yeah really really early doors just before i moved back to london i i dragged my then girlfriend um and my younger brother with me because we used to come down and i used to go down and see steve lawler at the end because i just loved that club and i used to love harlem nights it was amazing so i used to drive down from bristol um home was opening up around the same time yeah it was i mean i've always heard that They were sort of in competition. Yeah, they were to begin with. So why do you choose to go to Fabric instead of... Well, home was never really... something that was kind of up my street only because I mean the only thing I would have possibly have gone to home for would be to to see Steve Lawler play downstairs because he had his his deep south night yeah but I never I would never go but only because it was it seemed very glitzing quite shiny and Paul Okaford was an okie I was past my Okaford I was never into Paul Okaford anyway I met him once in Southampton years and years ago and it didn't really work out so It was never something that I was interested in. But then obviously I heard Craig Richards play on the radio. I think it was World DJ Day just after Fabric had opened. I think it was World DJ Day anyway. And I heard him play then. I was like, this is unbelievable. So because I was fairly used to driving for three or four hours down the motorway and going clubbing and then driving home. I dragged my baby brother and my girlfriend at the time down to Fabric. And it sounds really strange, but it is just one of those things where it just changes you completely because I'd never heard music like that before. even though I was into my house music and I was into DJ Sneak and Doc Martin and Kenny Hawks and, you know, Stacey Pull and all those guys. I'd listen to things, but I'd never gone to a nightclub that was like that. So I dragged those two down and went, and like I say, it totally just bamboozled me because A, I'd never heard music like that. I'd never heard it presented in that way before. On a sound system like that. Yeah, and I I'm real so it was really funny actually because the first time I went there it made such an impact on me that I went home I went back to Bristol and I went into the record shop that I was in and it's one of those classic things people say can you sell me some records that they play at Fabric please you know and I then started this is how like house music yeah this is you know this thing is and I was standing at the warehouse yeah for sure exactly and then it's one of those things where you sort of go I suddenly found H Foundation and Halo and Hippie and I suddenly found, you know, Siesta Records and I was like, fucking this is unbelievable. And it was actually funny because I then started to get into that more. what I would probably consider the deeper, more intelligent side of it, where nothing really happens, but it still changes your life over nine minutes. So the first thing I did to call Joseph was I phoned Fabric up and I went, hello, I was in your nightclub last week. Tell me, who does the bookings there? And the guy was like, there's a girl called Judy, but I mean, what? I was like, well, just... I don't know. I'll be sending her a demo. All right. And I made this like a schlub. I made this fucking tape and I sent it to Judy. And it is really strange because the in January, two years ago, maybe a bit longer, Craig and I played all night in room one together. And I played three of these records, which I had actually sent her on this original demo tape back in 2001, because they were these timeless kind of housey. you know, numbers. So, yeah. It wasn't, I'll show her. Yeah, it was. But it was funny because Craig and I were playing together. It was January. You know, everyone was a bit sort of lackluster after the new year. He and I just played back-to-back all night and I must have said to him seven times, hey man, look, this is me when he's... was like yeah i mean i really don't care i seriously don't give two thumbs but that was the first time i went and then when i moved back to london i started to obviously play a lot and one of my friends then said to me look he knew the plump djs and he said look do you want to go down to Fabric and I was like oh yeah I can't remember I haven't actually been yet since I'd been in 2001 2002 so we went down the first thing I remember that struck me was we walked in the door at 6 o'clock in the morning and I loved that you know it was just like this is bonkers because this club's just open all the time it's open until As an American, I went to Fabric for the first time to see Ricardo Villalobos, and we were just sitting in these people's apartment. I hadn't been to Berlin or anything. Sitting. Yeah, waiting. Sitting. And you're tapping your watch going, hey, I don't want to be a putty pooper, but... 7am they're like yeah just wait for it yeah no it's amazing so yeah it blew me away when I went I fell asleep you get there just times like can i have a coffee um yeah so uh and again it was almost like a oh fucking hell yeah i remember this club now i remember why and that was it then you know it was just every gig that i was then playing was was was me just thinking about you know playing in fabric but The way that the whole Fabric thing actually came around, it wasn't like, even though I'd sent that tape way back when, 10 years before, it wasn't, after I'd gone there and partied, I then realised this was somewhere where I was never ever going to be able to play because then you sort of realise, oh right, yeah, okay. And I played at Ministry a few times, like real random nights upstairs and then I played in the main room once years and years ago. I did a warm-up you know even though as a kid you know I bought all the ministry CDs you know I had Dance Nation 1, 2, 3, 4 and you know all that stuff but that nightclub never ever made an impact on me as much as what Faber just like I say just to sound very cliche just changed my fucking life man when did you meet Craig? I met him Three, four years ago, maybe something like that. I met it's a weird story, really, because I'm sure you're instant friends because your personalities are exactly. Yeah, right. Yeah. The first time I met him, actually, he was he was less than forthcoming, to say the least. But I had I kind of had an in with him. It was a bit cheeky because I'd I'd played I'd done a warm up for Andrew Weatherill because the end was still open. I played I warmed up And my last two records were two records which I'd just finished. And one of them was all right, but one of them was actually quite good. So I played these last tunes and Andrew said to me, what were those last two records you played? And I said, oh, they're just some things that I've been messing around with. He said, can I have the CD? I went, yeah, all right. So I gave him the CD and then, you know, that was that. And a few weeks later, and it was one of those really weird situations i was in my flat in bethnal green the phone rang looked at didn't recognize no oh fucking sorry hello like a creditor yeah exactly i just thought he's like student loans again so i went hello and he went uh joseph but yeah he said andrew went hello like what what are you trying to sell me no and he obviously judged by the tone of my voice he didn't i didn't know who was he made sancho everall and i went oh And he was really cool, man. He's like, look, I've been listening to your tunes. I've been playing them quite a bit over the last few weeks. Look, do you want to come over to the studio, man? We should have a cup of tea and have a chat. So I went down and we started talking and started hanging out and I started to then give him records and he was amazing with me. He was like, look, this tune's good, but maybe you need to do that with it. because I'd only really just started producing. I didn't really know what the fuck I was doing. I was just making it up pretty much like now, actually. I was just kind of doing what I thought was right. And I was giving records to some people, but no. Do you remember some of the advice he gave you? His production advice that really stuck with you? Yeah, well, not necessarily stuck with me as such, but it was really simple things like, A, they need to be shorter because my records are 15 minutes long and they weren't epic by any stretch of the imagination. He did say to me the thing about... He needed to tell you, like, this means to be at eight minutes. He's like, come on, man. No one's going to play this, you know. Only I can get away with it. Yeah. It's like the Goldie story when he goes into Pete Tong's office, isn't it? And that was like 15 minutes long. But he was quite good when it came to the sound quality because I didn't know anything about production techniques. So he's like, look, the ideas are there, but the production isn't. So you need to learn how to produce the record. So you need to learn about production as in, analysis you need to learn how to equalize and compress and just simple processing basically but because he was so into my music the only person I held in this the same esteem if you like or the person in my mind was Craig so I kind of well if Andrew likes him you know, maybe Craig like him as well. So at the time I'd written this record, Andrew's studio was on a street called Scrutton Street in East London, which is just sort of like Shoreditch way. And I'd written this record that I called Scrutton Street because Andrew, he and I had been hanging out together and he sort of gave me loads of ideas and it inspired me to do this tune and it was a bit of a banger. So I went down and I burnt this CD and I wrote Craig's name on it. I put all my details on it. I went down to Fabric. Unfortunately for me, one of my friends was warming up in room one in Fabric. James, who's Priestley, does Secret Sundays. And I very nonchalantly walked into Fabric on my own, walked into the DJ booth at room one. So, hello, James, how you doing, mate? He went, hello, mate. you doing and Craig was the next I went Craig and he looked at me and went yeah I went hi mate I said I know you never met me and I just I know this happens to you all the time really quickly look my name's Joseph I said Andrew Weatherworth's been playing some of my records I said I thought it'd be a good idea to give you some tunes these are them if you never speak to me ever again no problem but I just thought you might want to listen to him shook his hand and walked away and he sort of looked at me and went oh I don't know and chucked it in his bag and then I walked away and I left the club I didn't even stay I went home and left it because I didn't want to sort of stay there and look him in the eye so and then You know, about three weeks later, I went back to Wales to visit my parents. And on Sunday morning or Sunday afternoon time, I was having a shower. My mobile phone rang on my mum's kitchen table. The number didn't show up. You thought it was a creditor. But the best thing was, the best thing was, is that my girlfriend at the time picked the phone up. And she said, hello. I don't know why, because she never used to answer my mobile. I don't know what happened on this day, but she just looked at it, picked the phone up, and Craig said, hello, is Joseph there? Now he's in the shower. Who's this? And he said, it's Craig. And my girlfriend, being my girlfriend, said, Craig who? And he went, Craig Richards. And she still didn't, where are you calling from? And he went, the pavement I'm outside fabric. Cause Craig's obviously a very gentle human being. He's not like, Oh fuck you. Put the phone down. He's just like, I'm just trying to speak to Joseph. So she then went shit. Right. Sorry. Um, I'll get him to call you back. So she came running upstairs. So Craig Richards has been on the phone for you. I went, Oh, tell him I'll fucking call him back. You know, I did it really. So I ran downstairs and called him I've been listening to those records that you gave me a few weeks ago. Some of them are good, some of them aren't. But I think you should come down to the club and we should have a chat. So, yeah, next week I went down, met him. I went down to the club to meet him the first time. And he said, look, I'll put you on the guest list. They'll give you a little wristband and things so you can come. I said, I'll be in the VIP room. So I went out and met him. And it was really strange because, as you can probably tell, I'm not a very shy person. And I don't sort of, I'm quite happy just to go up and talk to anybody. But the thing which I realized going through my life is not everybody's like that. So when I yeah, just chat away to him. But I thought maybe he might not be like that. But it turns out that we were, we got on straight away. And, you know, we didn't even, we, from, from that moment on, we just kind of hung out, you know, I was writing music and I was giving it to him. And he, again, like I said, did, helped me a lot. Like what Andrew did, you know, he was like, well, this is quite good, but you know, this could be a bit weirder and maybe you could do this with this. And every week, you know, I'd be writing records and go down and he'd play some of them. Was he constantly telling you to make things weird? Oh, totally. Yeah. He'd always say to me, this is way too straight. But he's still like that now, you know, now we do our music together. He's like, can we, can we just get the weird button on this one? And I he gets to have his way yeah he gets to have his way yeah so he's got his grubby little fingers on my side you couldn't get further could you I mean you can listen to that anybody listen to the first you know couple fist of fingers I mean they're just a million miles away from and those early ones as well we sat down and did it because Craig was still learning technically how to sort of get the sounds out because he's amazing at that sound design and has these amazing ideas and is has this innate talent to be able to step away from something like that's it it's done whereas for me i'm kind of like what we need to make sure this is this and this this and i've now gone from having no idea about production to now being so heavy on my production i'm like hey look you know we really need to process this he's like fuck it it's filthy i love it let's just leave So he's taught me a lot in that respect and made me able to look, don't overproduce shit, you know, and if it sounds good, you know, leave it. You don't have to, everything doesn't have to be all in line and it all doesn't have to be too perfect. So, yeah, he was really great with me there. And there was, like I say, there was never any... certainly not from my side anyway there was never any plan to either write any music together or certainly even play at Fabric or do any of that type of stuff it was just we just started to hang out and we really got on and yeah like you say the rest is kind of history but they were all really good to me down there I remember played there yeah I did I did my I did my one and only live show sorry I ever don't because Craig said you look I really like your music and I started to after they'd sort of welcomed me into the family you know Craig and Judy and even Keith as well the gaffer there all of them down there and Julianne who used to work there and all those guys and Scott they were all really really good to me so I used to then when I was writing my music I wouldn't then just give it to Craig because we were all kind of they were all kind of supporting me we were all in it together so every week I'd go down and have five CDs you know one for everybody and then um you know after a while Craig was like look you should probably think about you know presenting this music somehow you know because he at the time he i'm not sure he really even thought that i was a dj or where i could because we never really talked about where i come from we just talked about life and about skateboards and about trees you know we never really sort of talked about so why did you start dj you know it was none of that business so he he said to me that you should think about trying to present this music to people so i said all right I would do it. So we'll just look, just knock a live show together. I mean, I've only just really learned how to, you know, make music, let them do a live show. So yeah, the one and only live show I've ever done in my entire life was, was at Fabric, which was, it was, do you know what? It was amazing. It was, it was a complete fluke. I've got to be honest, Todd. It was a complete fluke. It was another one of those really frightening kind of moments, not doing the show because I'm a bit of a show-off and that kind of stuff. And also, I think for me, because I've been to that club every single week for the preceding year and a half, it was almost like doing a live show in your living room. I think it's probably difficult for people, bigger artists that have never played there before, they think, shit, I'm playing at Fabric. Whereas for me, it's because I knew everybody there and I'd been there every week. I was kind of quite spoiled already. So I kind of, oh yeah, I get to be at Fabby. It was more of like an excitement thing. Yeah. So yeah, I went down. It was quite weird because I went down to do it and I obviously did the sound check at eight o'clock and then, you know, went home and had a bike to eat and stuff. and then came back and Keith, who's the boss, was actually away skiing on holiday and just before I was about to go on, it was a tyrant night, so Matt Toffrey had done the warm-up. I was then doing my little hour live show and then Craig and Lee were going to play the rest of the night. So I was stuck by the side of the DJ with listening to Toffoli's amazing warm-up and Keith comes and stands next to me and went, oh, hello, mate. I thought you was on holiday. He went, yeah, yeah, yeah, I was. He said, I'll come back. He said, I'm on my way home, but the cab's outside. So I was like, oh, okay. So I've just got to pop in. I just wanted to see your show. And I was fine with it and I thought fucking hell the boss has come back early on holiday and his cabs on the meteor outside waiting so yeah I did it and I loved it and Keith there are cabs you know you own this nightclub right There is more than one taxi in London, you know. So, yeah, I did it. I had an amazing time doing it. And it was, again, it was really good when it came to the advice, because as soon as I came off, you know, Craig had obviously started playing with me and Judy was there. He said, oh man, that was really cool. Like the intro was great. You know, middle bit was cool because I'd written some sort of, I guess they're kind of dubsteppy or trippy records because it was my live show. I just thought I could just play all the records that I really love. So I banged it for the first three and then slowed it down and went, played all this weird stuff for like two tunes and people kind of looked at me and were like, and then I went, and And again, Judy was great at me because she's like, look, the show was good. Intro was really positive. You know, I really liked the broken, he beat weird bit in the middle because shit, that takes balls to do that rather than just bang it for the whole way through. She said, but your outro could have been strong. You could have ended on a bigger, on a bigger tune, which again is something which someone doesn't, they don't have to say that to you. And I was like, fucking that's why I'll never have anything but love and respect for those people because they did so much for me. You know, it's amazing. When they didn't really have to because, you know. Another place that seems to have been big for you is space. Not space as such. We love, definitely. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. they were another group of people that were really supportive of me early on. I went to just do one show with them, excuse me, in the now defunct bread box. And I think it's just that thing about making an effort. I think when I went to... when I went to Fabric and I sort of got friendly with all those guys I made an effort because I wanted to because it just became it became very natural to make sure that they had everyone had new music every week and every CD had their name on it you know because and I used to print my CDs in them days you know making an effort so when I first went to do We Love I did a similar thing I was like it's important to me to I'm writing like I said I did these edits for them well for me to play there um and I did it for that thing I called him like my we love season one edits and I put everyone's name when I get because it was it was special you know and I think that's just something that people kind of pick up on they're like actually you're not just burning 7 000 cds walking around and just giving everybody a demo because I was never like that anyway I was always like I was just kind of hung around with one group of people I was all right with that I didn't want everybody sort of mad desperate or mad keen, really. I just kind of, oh, well, I quite like this. Do you want to listen to it? Rather than going, everybody must hear this record, you know? So, yeah, we love it. We're great with me. And I guess, again, it's just that family thing, talking to people outside of the nightclub. You know, the guys at Febber, we still do now, like speak. I mean, I'm very ready to get a chance You know, we're always talking outside of the nightclub on a Wednesday afternoon. And that was the same thing with We Love with Mark and Sarah and Darren and all those guys there. You know, we'd be swapping Harry Nilsson records in the week, you know, because it's just it sounds very cliche and a bit girly, but it is just about the music. It's not just about the nightclub or about DJing. It's just about the music as a whole. So, yeah, I have a great time there. I love it. They have been amazingly inspiring. Now they've got me on the main terrace, so it's crazy. But again, yeah. The thing is, I think one of my biggest downfalls, one of my biggest faults is I don't feel pressure. I think that's a problem because you think, mate, you should be concentrating on this. You're like, I'll be fine. Don't worry about it. But again, you know, going back to people giving you advice and helping you, it's like last year, last season was my first season on the main turf just warming up. And I was warming up for Lawler or Laurent Garnier or Dan Kanashia or those guys, which was an amazing experience. because that main terrace kind of belongs to Darren Hughes because he kind of, he's the guy that kind of books that room and Mark and Sarah book everywhere else. You know, I had three really good shows there. And then I warmed up for Lawler because obviously I got so much respect for Steve Lawler because I used to go and see him when I was a kid. And I kind of wanted to make sure I didn't go too far. And Darren was stood behind me and he was like, Joseph, get the fuck on with him. Which I thought was great because I kind of really went, come on, man, let's go. let's go, let's go, you know, because it's, because I play nine till midnight and it's all right for the first hour. But, you know, once people are in there, they go, right, we want to, you know, because I'm so used to warming up and warming up for me is telling a story. Ibiza isn't really like that and particularly isn't that, that terrorist because people have been out. outside in the sunshine, they come in and go, right, let's go. And, you know, I tend to forget that some of my hardest records are not even Lawler's warm-up records, you know. So, again, that was really good advice, which is going to help me for this year. Are you playing on the terrace again? Yeah, I'm doing it again. I'm doing the main terrace again this year. I think I got four this year. Yeah. Do you like that room? I love that room. Yeah, that's definitely my favourite room. I've been fortunate enough to play probably in almost all of the rooms there. The discotheque is, I mean, James Abili always calls it the room of doom and it quite literally is. I mean, it's just... Why so? Because A, it's just colossal. You can barely see the back of the room. I mean, it's just so huge. And because you're on that great big stage You can play an Indivision's record and it'll sound like Aphex 2 and it's bloody mental. But yeah, the terrace is lovely for me. Also because when I first went to Ibiza, I went on that terrace and it scared the shit out of me because this is just unbelievable. But they put a roof on it. Put a roof on it. Yeah, and glass and lots of pink lights. But I think the feeling is still kind of there because I think the feeling of that room will always be because it's always going to be the terrace. I mean, it hasn't really changed that much in the sense of the way it's laid out. But I think what they've done with the sunset terrace is try to keep some of the ethos of the old terrace. At the end of the day, I think what people tend to forget is that old terrace, it didn't actually sound that great. The sound wasn't amazing out there, but because you're out in the sunshine, you know, and Lawler was kicking the shit out of it or Smoking Joe was changing your life, then you tend to sort of forget that. But I think everybody, I think there'd be very few people that would say that they'd much rather it sound shit and be outside because... The way that room sounds now is unbelievable. Yeah, it's crackers. I love it. You recently, a couple years, a year ago, left a job. Yeah. To do music full time. Was it a scary moment? Or was it, I got to do this if I want to do this? Well, it's my third time of doing it. So yeah, I did it. I did it when I was a kid a few times and it never really worked out. This feels serious though. Yeah, I mean, I was deadly serious the last two times, but I just don't think I was ready. That was the time I actually needed someone's advice to go, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, But this time, I have to be honest, the decision was a lot easier because, you know, I'd obviously had music out and I'd already started to tour. So it wasn't so much of a big deal. I think before I really, really wasn't ready. I was doing probably one or two gigs a month maximum and not actually getting paid that much money. In saying that, the second time that I gave up work to go and just DJ was at the same time where I just bought my first laptop and bought Ableton. So that time I look back on it from a positive standpoint because it was very constructive for me because I had all this free time where, yeah, I wasn't necessarily going to work in a day, but I was working on. learning how to you know get get my head around the computer so this time yeah i have to say it was a whole lot easier because it just became it just to be honest with you i mean the people that i used to work for would agree with this you know it became a point where it was physically impossible to to uphold both those things at the same time because you know you go to work every day you do monday to friday nine to five ish um you know you go for your tour on the weekend um and bearing in mind that from monday to friday you're coming home every day and i'm just writing music you know and you're staying up till three or four three or four o'clock in the morning because like i said at the beginning is i have no choice the only i'm sat in work and the only thing I'm thinking about so I could just do that so yeah it just became unsustainable in the end you said earlier that you don't have a plan no I should probably have one I do find it interesting looking at the releases that you've had and the parties that you play that Maybe it is that you don't have a plan, but I do think that there is a thing that you're doing that I find very interesting, which is you're not really tying yourself to anything. No. Exactly. You've had a record here. You've had a record there. You'll play with this guy. You'll play with that guy. I can't be like, oh, he's part of that crew. Yeah, crew. Is that a distinct thing or is that an accident? It's funny you should say that because someone said this to me recently. You know, when I first started doing my residency with Digweed at Bedrock, someone said to me, but you're a Crosstown Rebel DJ. And I was like, well, yeah, they're my agent. Yeah, for sure. And I'm part of the Rebels. I mean, I've got a record coming out on Crosstown Rebels. But that, I think that's just a part. See, I never would have called you a Crosstown Rebels DJ. So it's interesting that everyone probably. Yeah, because I'm part of that crew. That's there, my agent. I'm putting a record out on them. And, To me, I just love my music and I just love DJing and that's kind of it. And whether it's to my detriment or not, I don't know. I can't see myself putting my foot in one camp or not. I mean, I don't know whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. I just kind of end up doing things that I like. That is obviously playing with Damien and Jamie and Seth and all those guys because they're, you know, they've been a massive inspiration to me over the last few years as well. But then also I really love playing that we love. And I love, like I say, I was fortunate enough to play with Sasha. I did two shows with Sasha on Sunday and it was like. I can imagine some people will look at that and kind of think, yeah, maybe that isn't the coolest thing in the world because it's maybe not Dyed Sounder or it's not Seth Troxler or it's not that. But to me, it's kind of, I grew up listening to that man. He changed my life. Do you know what I mean? It's like. And you watch the way he played on Sunday was fucking frightening. So for me, I just kind of do what I, what I think is right. And what I like to do, you know, and it's like, if that, if that means that I'm higgledy piggledy and all over the place, then so be it. But I don't. I don't know what that works. I'm always very conscious of people when they're kind of a bit like you have to have an identity, do you know what I mean? And you have to be part of this crew and you have to kind of, kind of be like, oh, can't I just do a bit of everything? You know, because if you listen to the music that I write, you mean that isn't, that's neither here nor there, you know, I mean. It doesn't fit in a team cross my fingers if you have a sound signature that's that's a good thing yeah and i think you do i remember when we were coming up with the questions for the podcast i think uh colleague of mine sent them to you perhaps or maybe i did but i remember thinking to myself every time i hear a track of yours the drums sound very distinct and when you answered the question you're like i don't what i don't hear that i was like how could you not hear that you fucking deaf man Yeah, I mean, again, that's probably obviously my father coming through me for sure. I mean, like I said at the beginning is I wasn't brought up like listening to, I was never really exposed to the electronic-y type of stuff until my older brother like pushed me towards it really. But, you know, I always grew up listening to bands. So I guess when it sort of comes through to me doing, you know, electronic music. I just ended up just navigating naturally towards that life. So, I mean, it's really strange when I go there and do stuff with Craig in his studio. He's got this amazing, he's got this beautiful plethora of analog gear. And as much as I love things like the Roland Juno or the SH-101 or any of that stuff, things like the Roland 909 for me sound alien because it sounds like... you know, I don't, I guess being an electronic artist, it's almost like heresy me saying that I don't like the sound of it, but I don't because it just sounds, it just sounds so pretend. So I think that's where, you know, my drums end up coming in that, you know, using a lot of live sounds and why I record so many really weird live snaps and claps and shit like that, because I just, just the sound that I like. What are you coming up? What do we have to look forward to? Oh, God, yeah. Well, I've just done a record for Crosstown Rebels, which will be quite cool, which is a bit of a weird one, really, because it's just a record that I, again, recorded all the percussion for, but I recorded it all live in my studio. So it sounds really muddy and really weird, but it all just sounds out of my kitchen. So, like, it's an ashtray, there's a plastic glass and there's teacups and there's chopsticks and it's all very muddled and it's really strange. So that's, I'm not quite sure when that's going to be out, but the guys Ali Love and Lucas C, who are Infinity Inc, they're going to be doing a remix for that. So that'll be out fairly soon. And then I've got another EP for Culprit, which is just a banger. You know, the last one I've just done, which is recently came out, which is stringy girly type number whereas my neck Next one for Colport is just the most obvious straight up bangers. I wrote them a while ago. Maybe I think it was last year for Sonar. I think I wrote one of them's called The Guitar Player. And it's just so simple. Like nothing happens. It's just like a beat, a bass drum, a bass line and a guitar. And that's all that happens. And a Ella Fitzgerald vocal sample over the top. It's so, so simple. but it works it's just danceful music so there's like a total paradox between the two eps i hope no one goes and buys that second one thinking i bought that last time be wicked it's not going to be the same thing so um do you worry about sampling at all pardon do you worry about sampling I don't really do that much sampling, really. Someone asked me this recently in an interview, and I said, I've actually got this little whiteboard in my studio that I write little notes on and stuff and remind us to do stuff. And one of the things which is written in big, bold letters is sample. Because I never really do. I tend to write something. I think you're quite possibly the only... music shit of all time who has that written on their whiteboard I think the the most sampling that I do is things like things off documentaries and stuff because I'm addicted to like music documentaries um I've just got a pile of DVDs and I'm addicted to the BBC iPlayer as soon as there's another Dawes documentary or or you know anything on Steely Dan I'm straight on the iPlayer and you know and I think the most sample thing I do is like vocal bits you know bits of documentary snippets of speech which I love but I don't really sample that much stuff off records which I really should do because I know it's the music that we're involved in from an electronic standpoint is so steeped in the sampling thing I mean it basically started with that whole business you know so And I know when you listen to records that people have used a great big fat sample and it sounds fucking ace because they've sampled this beautiful piece of music that's already sorted. Whereas you sit down and try and rewrite something, it can kind of go, it sounds a bit thin and a bit shy, you know. But again, I was the way I was brought up was always to write music rather than, as my dad would probably call it, steal it. Because I think that's very much like what I did with the Lady EP recently. I did one of the tracks on this called Lady B's Lullaby. And it's basically, it's just a cover of the Cures record. But instead of sampling it, I just basically found the notes and stuff and just replayed everything. because I really felt like I had to play it. It's one of these really strange, I feel very strange about it. I kind of feel like I have to play it, whereas this is why I give my edits away for free, is because they don't really belong to me. So if I'm going to do an edit, which is basically just a great big sample of me rewriting the music around it, I feel like I have to give that away, because it doesn't really belong to me. I've kind of just for sure. Destroy. Mr. McCartney, I know you've heard this song. It's a thin line between adding and destroying. Twilight Show me where the sun shines. We may.
