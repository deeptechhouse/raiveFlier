Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artist labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Dixon is a name that will be familiar to most Resident Advisor readers. As one of the heads of Intervisions, his rise as a DJ in demand has coincided with the recent resurgence of house music in the... post-minimal world. The Berlin resident will release his final, officially released mixed CD this week, so we decided to quiz the DJ about what Berlin was like in the 90s and what comes next for his venerated label. silence feels like no one can see me cuts me off from the rest of the world You were almost born in Berlin. You were very close to being born in Berlin. Yes, I am actually from East Germany and my parents visited their parents on Christmas. I was born on the 21st of December. So I stayed with my parents in north of Berlin in a little village for about the first six days of my life. And then we came back to Berlin. So I usually said that I'm the, you know, the typical question somewhere in the world, the DJ arrives and the driver or the promoter, whoever talks to you is like, okay, so where are you from? And you're saying like Berlin. And then I always feel the pressure to say like, yeah, but I'm actually really from Berlin, which is 90% through then because I'm not really born here. You grew up in the East. Yes. Tell me, you were 14 when the wall came down. I think it is, right? Yes. What... Tell me what you remember about East Berlin. Was it as grey as we all imagine it to be? Funny thing is I was just in the car with Kristin and Frank from Arm, who were actually both from Kars. were and they moved to Berlin they're living here for like a year now and they gave me the question yesterday like so how was it actually what kind of building is the building that's still here that you would say is looking like 20 years ago And now we were passing by in the car a building where I said like, okay, look at the left, this gray building there where half of the balconies are looking like they're nearly coming down. This is my definition of it now. 20 years ago, they looked the same and I would have said like, so what's the problem with the building? Isn't it okay like this? So you didn't know anything else? No, it's just like, actually, I have to say that whenever there was like people from West Germany coming over, which is twice a year or something from our family, even if it's like far away family members. that I didn't know really we have them. But yeah, at a certain date, they was like, yeah, there's like family members coming from the West now. I was like, who is it? Blah, blah, blah. Okay, I didn't know we actually have them. So whenever they come over, they were like, the first thing they said, like, it's all so gray here. And me as a kid, obviously, I was like... never really understanding it and then let's say 96 97 or something i had the first time i kick in poland so i took a train from berlin berlin is like quite close to the to or like very far east so entering poland from here is like one hour with a train So I took the train and we crossed the border. And the first thing I realized is how gray everything looks there. And it was like five, six years after Roel came down. And I was like, all right, this is what they were always talking about when they came to East Germany. So now I somehow understand it. But back then I had no clue what they were talking about. For me it was a shiny place because I had actually enjoyed my childhood and I think this is what sets the standard for you like if you enjoying the time then it's all fine I mean It's not defined by the quality of the buildings. It's defined by what you do, what kind of friends you have, how your family is treating you, how the school teacher is treating you. And I was quite happy with all that things. So I was good. What were you doing? You were playing football. quite a bit as a kid yeah I started very early to play like six or seven to play football on a daily basis on a special no it wasn't a special school there I played in a good club that had daily training but I was traveling every day for like an hour to go to the training which because I'm live I was living in the north of Berlin and training was in the center and then I had problem with my knees so I had to stop playing football and I was on the same time we had this like in East Germany quite good scouting system in every school so if there was a talent, they would have found you. And I was good in a couple of things, including running, as boring as it sounds. And so while I was having daily football training, I was also participating in a lot of cross-country running and stuff. And I was always winning, actually. So once I stopped football, they immediately took me to a special sports school then. There was like 11. And from then on, my reality of East Germany was being in this special secluded school and maybe having better treatments than a lot of other... kids around me, meaning like very good teachers, good food in the school, high quality food, a lot of doping in the food. No, I mean, I was doing athletics, so... In reality, there was a lot of doping going on in my school, but we had different types of sport there. You were a long-distance runner. Yes, I was a long-distance runner. And usually the time where you start to become really, really good is when you are 30 to 35. So it wouldn't make no sense to dope someone. when you were like 16. If you had been a sprinter, maybe. Or if you had been a swimmer. But if you're a swimmer, for instance, you become really good when you're 20, 24. And even like... Gymnastics is where it really starts early. So I was until like 17 in a sports school. And I wouldn't say I had a special doping there. But I had friends in my class that were gymnastics, mostly girls, because this is what they had in our school there. And they were definitely doped at that time. And also some swimmers that disappeared for like three months. They went to special training camps and came back and they spoke like a man. Well, it was never that extreme. But everyone knew about it without knowing exactly what it really is that they are. doing to you. Right. Did you get a sense that the wall, I mean, you were young, but not too young. Did you get a sense that the wall, something was happening, that the wall was going to come down at some point, or did it come as a complete surprise? I don't know how it is with other people, but I would think that for me, starting to think like in politic terms or really making, thinking about stuff like this was when I was like 13 and 14. It was just exactly that time. So when it really happened, I actually kind of felt like. Of course it's coming down. It needs to. It's just logical. But saying that to my parents, they were like, yeah, you don't understand how impossible it looked for us like a year ago that the wall would come down. And I was like, yeah, but why? I mean, you are like secluded here, you know, like you could not travel, you could not do blah, blah, blah, blah. Of course, over the long term, you would not accept that. So this was like speaking maybe still with a child mind and starting to come into politics and sometimes you might say the truth because you don't know all the interns. the truth. And so that was one thing. The other thing is that just because I started to think a little bit about politics and about maybe something like Stasi, you speak to other children about it, with classmates. And all of a sudden you say something while you're on a trip. And two weeks later, your teacher is calling you in and asking you why you think that you cannot really speak open to your classmate anymore. Why you said that you don't want to speak open in front of him anymore. just because you have the feeling his father is from the Stasi. Why you actually would come up with this? The Stasi doesn't exist. Don't you know? It's just a rumor. So it was just before the wall came down. I had the first time a contact with something that I heard from my parents it would exist, but I always thought like, no, no, no, no, never. And then I was, again, I was 14. And even with 14, they were having actually... other 14 years old kids in your class that were actually spies, you know. And this is something I realized the first time just before the war came down and then the war came down. And for me, actually, the actual weekend where it happened was just something very normal because I was in East German Championships. that I was participating in and I was fully concentrated on that. And then I think it happened on the wall in Berlin or in Germany, came down on a Friday, but everyone was looking at Berlin at that time. And I was having these championships on the next day and I was the one that was still trying to... be champion, but half of my opponents were not there. Because they came from Magdeburg or Dresden or Rostock and they were in Berlin and the wall came down and it was like in such an easy step to go to the West for the first time in your life and they did. And I was planning this for Monday, you know. And I actually, I won that race. But again, it was just half, because half of the opponents weren't there. What was the first thing that you did? I remember talking to Paul Kalkbrenner and he said that he went to McDonald's. I bought a Mars and I actually, my raving career started very shortly after this, half a year or a year. And I remember that I bought a smiley T-shirt for eight German marks in a... super cheap store and this was like the first real clothing that I bought in the West and was already connected to raving society. You knew what it meant. I knew what it meant. I mean, I didn't really know what it meant but the parties that I was going to, a lot of people had that so I saw it and I was like, I'm going to get this too. What were the parties that you were going to? Were you going to certain places in particular, or was it just abandoned warehouses? Had clubs that were of interest popped up by then? Planet, Trezor, Tubina. Maybe this was the three big things I did on a regular basis. I think I was following more party concepts like Dub Mission, for instance, with Kid Paul and Paul van Dyck. And I remember listening to Moni D, Monica Dietl, and she had the... best radio show and then I was still doing sports at that time I wasn't really sure if I want to follow it I was injured and I had to stay in I had a special training which was extremely boring and You know, being an athlete and doing long running is not the biggest fun to do the daily routine training. But you accept it if you participate on championships and stuff and then you might win and then you're like, yeah, okay, of course, I did all this hard work and I know now why. But if you're not participating anymore like I did... because I was injured, I was still doing hard training, but special training, and I couldn't really run anymore. All the medals did not show up anymore, and you actually didn't really know anymore why you're actually doing it. So I questioned it, and it took me like half a year or a year where I decided, I decided, okay, it's over, I'm into music now. And it was like this. Was it a certain type of electronic music that got you first? Or was it just the whole thing, the idea of going to these parties, hearing something new? I think this is sometimes... from someone that is involved in music, might be a producer, DJ, journalist, songwriter, whatever. Sometimes when you look back, I think you make the mistake to think that you did it because of the music. But reality is you did it because it was such a secret society at that time that being young, you're like totally attracted by. There's all this 20, 22, 25 year old people that look totally different. And it was like this. I think when you go out today, people look in a way normal. you would not really define a raver by its clothes anymore, at least not in Berlin. Back then you definitely knew that he's going to rave. Aside from a smiley t-shirt, what was that uniform? Colorful clothes that like being, especially being a man or a boy, you know, wearing colorful clothes was special. It was oversized very often. And I'm not speaking even about gas masks or sirens or whatsoever, you know, or red hair or green hair or whatsoever. Because it was still, at least in Berlin, kind of stylish, you know. I would say I was attracted by that secret society that you could not read about anywhere. You could tune into one radio channel at that time. once a week, where there was played music that you could hear on the weekend. And coming in the school on Monday and knowing that no one else had a clue about what you were doing is something that was attractive. And after a couple of times I did this, I realized It might not just be the people, it could also be the music that is played that made it special. Obviously, from day one, I knew the music is different, but I would not say that I felt like it's hitting me hard and it's the thing for my life. This came a lot later than that. What was the first music? hit you hard? It was more actually breakbeats. I would say that the styles of music were much closer back then by in different terms like tempo wise it was much closer together. Everyone used the same machines. Everyone used the same mixing technology. Even the people were closer together. Someone that heard breakbeats would also go to a techno party. It might even be two DJs playing on the same floor. that would not ever play together today anymore. And therefore it was the first time that I realized that one of the styles I liked more was when I heard breakbeats. And I actually also not really realized that it was more like that other people told me that the records I bought are hard to mix. And I didn't really understand what they were saying. They were like, yeah, because it's not a bass drum on every one, two, three, four. And then I realized, all right, okay, that's right, actually. So it's a different beat. Yes, that's what it is. It's a different beat. And it was a break beat. You said that people said that the records that you were buying were hard to mix. When did you first start buying records? when was that something that 92 maybe 91 92 around that time I also realized that I'm really bad in times I I think like 10 years ago when I did an interview like this I always said like yeah 93 94 I really started for to me for me And then we did this night here called Washing Machine that we did for like five, six, no, three years or something. And there was once, and it was maybe 2005 to 2008 or something, where I was still involved in that party concept. And it was all about playing music from 1985 to 1993 or something. There was some fan coming by and he handed me a tape from me that I sold on the streets. I remember it was sold in a fashion store here and it was from 1992. And in 1992, I already had the confidence to sell stuff. That means I at least had like one year of experience already of mixing and trying around. Once you bought the records, you immediately, I want to become a DJ. There's no, I'm listening to this at home type of thing. When I was in sport, I never really thought that I once wanted to be a... champion I always wanted to beat the other guy I wanted to be a best the best in my surrounding and when I started with music I think it was never really that I wanted to be a DJ I just wanted to to yeah compete maybe man I know compete is the wrong word and that but I wanted to do what my friends did by going to my parties also did. And it was fun to do it. We were actually a group of people. We had two turntables. We were like four, actually. And it was step by step. And I would have never dreamed to one day sitting with Todd Burns here and doing an interview for Resident Advisor. What were some of those first parties that you were doing? I mean, was there a concept that immediately came about that you guys felt like you came together around? I played for a couple of parties that were very much from the breakbeat, noise, hardcore scene. Very often... done by the crew around Alec Empire and I was always the extreme softy in that surrounding. So if there was a vocal, it was me playing. And after a couple of months or maybe a year or something, I started to more and more listen to house music. which was even cheesier or or yeah it was just not and around 94 or something I played one of these parties and I played a full on house set which was a clear statement of like okay I'm done with this this is now what I wanted to do and from that on also there was the decision that I want to do it on a regular basis somewhere and not just one of parties wherever I want to establish myself as a DJ in a club that plays obviously in the beginning every tuesday but one day maybe every friday or saturday on a regular basis for like three four hundred people that come to the club and um yeah you present them whatever is new and you make hits there and you yeah you teach them music Because in the beginning of my career, I was considering myself in that question, are you an entertainer or are you a teacher? I always said, obviously, I'm a teacher. More and more, you do this, you realize you need to be a good entertainer in this business to be able to teach something. And so I don't know. today is not so clear anymore but back then i was like okay every saturday in this club for 400 people and i'm teaching them music was there a big house scene in uh berlin you know the cliche is that techno city berlin you know and obviously the breakbeat scene seemed to be pretty big with alec empire and all of these people I would not say there was a big house scene. It was definitely more techno. But I was in that house scene. So for me, the scene was there. I think this is also the reason why I'm sitting here because I was following my path and that made me somehow outstanding. It's like people asking me, how is Trouw Club in Amsterdam? And I'm telling them, yeah, it's amazing. Because whenever I play there, it's really great. And we had this amazing night at Robert Johnson last Saturday. But this is my view on looking at it. But did you go out to other house clubs? in Berlin or was that you know the place that you were playing at the only house club? No there was other clubs I was very often going to DJ Klee whoever he wherever he played and also back then it was very all the great things came from the gay scene. which is or not the gay scene did not disappear 10 years ago but the quality in the gay clapping scene disappeared 10-12 years ago or something and now it's back so going out to house music means going out to the gay scene, listening to DJ Klee, and little other things. - You mentioned Klee, and I've heard stories, and I keep seeing his name as someone who was right there along with you, basically, is like one of the name house DJs in Berlin. What was it about him? How did he play? What was he playing that was so appealing? What made him a big name? Besides the obvious things, which is he had great music, he worked actually in a record store, so he had access to new stuff. which was important back then. Nowadays, whatever is new, everyone can get their hands on. Back then, there was a filter for a lot of DJs. But besides that, which maybe other people would say is the key thing, I would say his main thing was his charisma. As a DJ... as a person that works in a shop and sells you a record. Because you can sell records like an asshole and you can sell records with little stories that explain the records to you and maybe make them better for you than they actually maybe are. Because you know this record is made in this city and it's from that guy that also did the other thing and it was played on that party. Blah, blah, blah, blah. And you're buying it. You're buying a story, a little piece of history. You're buying a story around it and it will stay with you. Also an important thing, actually. that maybe is missing today. So what I wanted to say is that I think, and this is also one of the key things today that makes DJs better or not, because... it's not great science to be technically okay and even now with certain techniques we have you don't even need to be able to beat match anymore some would say this is super important i would say this is basics that you know you even you don't but for me much more important is selection and charisma as I maybe said before I always said I wanted to be a teacher and Maybe, you know, looking back at the school, which teacher do you remember? The one that were like ultra hardcore and the one that are like super friendly and maybe explained your stuff and gave you stories. And therefore, I'm looking at this on the DJ job. in the same way. And he had that. He could stand there and he could play a record that is maybe a difficult record, but the way he presents it with his body language, with his face expressions, with his storytelling, made the record click. And a lot of people, DJs don't have that. And I don't mean do you need to be a clown to present a difficult record. There's other DJs that don't move their body and their face at all, but they have charisma. And so there's different ways of having this, but it is important. And yeah, he had that. And that's why he always spoke to me when I was on the dance floor. Because I think there's people on the dance floor that don't care at all about the DJs. They're just going out. And there's people like me back in the day that was like, yeah, going out. was trying to understand and trying to remember records and writing down records and all that stuff. And these people, they look at the DJ and they try to understand. And obviously for a long time they don't understand. But maybe one day it makes click. At a certain point you hooked up with Sonar Collective. that might be a little bit way too further down the road. But what year were you guys sort of hooked together? You were doing sort of A&R type things for them? Yes, it was a very loose collective around Jasanova. And I think one of the key goals of them were actually to establish producers seen here that was active in their field. We obviously had a lot of techno producers here but whatever just know we were interested in was not really techno at least not at that time and so they were already from the first production they did they were internationally known and they started a label with compost together, just an over compost record, JCR that was based in Munich. So they had the feeling of like, okay, whatever we do now, it's not really established in Berlin. We really don't have like a big night here. Uh, or we have our label here. Um, and, um, let's use our, success to establish something here and that's why they basically also stepped up to me and said like okay we heard you dj quite a while we like what you're doing why don't you come join us and be like the house A&R here? Which doesn't mean that I had like full control, but I had my voice and my voice counted. And that was like a good feeling because I had it for the first time actually. Plus, I learned a lot from them how the business works actually by all the mistakes they did because they did exactly what we are doing, learning by doing. But sometimes the mistakes you do is something that sticks with you for your whole life and you don't do them again, but at least you learn something out of it. What were some of the artists that you kind of brought to their attention or that you were involved in sort of bringing to the light? Markus Wargul, Arm, Anthony Nicholson back then, Tokio Blackstar and myself. Yeah, I would say this is obviously the first thing that comes to my mind. And a lot of them I still work with. Yeah. What were some of the mistakes that you saw them making in those years? You know, they were six people and I think four of them were actually involved in the label, maybe three. And even if they're not from East Berlin or East Germany and had no socialism background. The word collective in their name actually was what they wanted to be. They wanted to make all the decisions. with everyone. It was like full democracy. And I realized that it makes everything much longer. Plus, no one felt responsible for anything. If something goes wrong, you could always point on the others too. And this was one of the key things that I learned, that if you do a label, you need people that are responsible for something. it's for the good bad things but also for the good things and we are also like three people now Christian, Frank, my mom and me and we are It's hard to have your special department and just do it because obviously we are all friends and you speak about stuff. And so we still influence everyone. But still there's people that are doing this and people are doing that. And yeah, like for instance, with the new Envision record that we just released. we did not press enough and the repress we want to do now because of the extremely expensive cover we have is like just too expensive in the small amount that I want to press and I was the one that said let's not do too much. So I definitely know I did the mistake of ordering not enough and this I know and for the next time I will think about that more hopefully better Around when did inner city the party? Start this was did it start at weekend. It started weekend. Yeah, and I did it with Daniel best the promoter here from Berlin and Pierre Becker, which is a good friend of mine and graphic designer and it's again I'm bad in years 2004 2005 started it around let's just like a half year before I started inner visions at sonar collective Yeah, and it started that weekend. What was it like and why did you feel like you wanted to start a party weekend and a party in general in Berlin at that time? What was the scene missing, so to speak? I... felt at that time that for the first two years before I felt for the first time that something that I highly value was missing in the clubs and that was residencies in the way that a DJ that is from that city is playing not just the warm-up or the closing set. Because at that time, a lot of the even also cool venues, they basically always had a guest DJ at the prime time. It was starting to become annoying, in my opinion, that no one trusted in the concept of a resident DJ anymore. There was like, I think, in Berlin at that time, a lot of successful clubs, you know, in Berlin there is this history of like moving locations. And I think none of the clubs that I know and respect ever moved to another location and was the same size. It was always bigger. Always. And this is like very often, in 90% of the cases, it's the business decision that I think is the worst business decision they could do. You always think number-wise, of course, if you put in like 400 more people, you can make more money. And you usually, as a club, what is it? Three, two years you're hip? Like everyone is coming, but then there's the first and the fifth years. And the lifespan... of a club should be reflected in size and in the DJ. And usually the clubs are successful for like two or three years and then they move to a new location, they make it bigger. People are complaining already that it's like not so great. The other location was better, typical. and now it's bigger and they make more promotion and therefore other people come that are not so cool anymore and the reaction of the club is that he books bigger DJs and is not trusting in the concept anymore that actually made the club big. And that was happening quite a lot to a lot of the clubs that I liked, WMF, Cookies, a lot of places at that time just became always bigger and worse in my opinion. So actually, starting with Inner City, I had to... feeling I wanted to bring back somehow a residency of someone that plays all night and maybe not like in the 90s where I really played every Saturday there I played every three or two weeks and then at a certain point once a month But that's what I had in intention. It was my intention actually to do a resident night and to play 10 hours. And if I have a guest DJ, he maybe plays two hours, but there's still eight hours for me. And it was also about house. Because at that time, it was maybe the hardest time for house in Berlin. because all this minimal stuff that was going on plus the whole electro thing like today everyone is saying that you know all the minimal DJs now playing house but people always forget that at that time when minimal was back big it was also this whole DJ Hell, New York influenced sound was maybe even bigger here. And so the enemies came from left and right. And yeah, so there was also my statement of, okay, house is my choice of music. This is what I'm 100% believe in, in a club. and I want to present it all night long. Was it an immediate success, or did it take a while to take off? The weekend at that time was a hip location without any content, in my opinion. It was about the people that went there. It was about the view. And it didn't really matter who was playing there. It was always like 700 people or whatsoever. I think I was the first DJ that took it seriously and not just came to the club, played a set and took the money. We actually gave it our own name, we had our own promoters, we had our own ways of promoting it. we attracted other people too so from the first night on it was a success in the way that it brought people together. Because what makes a good club is actually today that it's, even if the door might be hard, still you have a selector that knows how to select the crowd. And that selection should be a good mixture of different kind of people. following the music maybe not as their main thing but something that comes from the back or some and So we had all the hipsters there that went there anyway, and we brought all the nerds and all the music lovers, and that mixture was quite good. And therefore it was from the first night on, it was the biggest night at weekend. And we always had like between 1,000 and 1,500 people. So I had all freedom there. You had the music nerds that understand. You had the good-looking people that makes everyone else look. And we had the dancers. We had a good mixture. Would you say that you found... a certain sound while you were playing there or that just the scene came to a certain sound while you were playing there? It seems like things came together in a way that... I think so too because, you know, it was like... five years ago or something, especially when I look at what was released in 2005 and 2006 in-house. And also on our label, it's the same that I look at our labels the same way. I think the standards were set pretty high there. And then there was like three years of like, yeah, it's okay, house music the last three years, but a lot of times I was missing something and I now know that the reason was that in the beginning of that time period, you know, shot to fly were at their best. And what Arm released in that moment, not just on InnoVisions, all the records, when I put them out, take them out again, and you can play them still. They still sound like from the future. that all came together at that time. So while I was frustrated with the club situation, I think musically I had in my hands, without knowing it, jewels. And so it was a lucky moment that came together. How has the sound of Intervisions changed over the years then? What was it before and what is it now? Funny thing is we never knew what it is. We always said, yeah, yeah, we're going to be a house label. And we're always going to be a house label. We're going to be the label that is producing the records that we want to play. I think everyone is saying that. So that is not a definition, actually. But we realized that we don't really know what it is when we got sent all these demos saying like, this is a typical InnerVisions record. And we realized that, well, we don't even know what a typical InnerVisions record is. We sometimes have as the main goal to not do a typical InnerVisions record. So I still don't have any explanation of what makes an innervisions record to an innervisions record. All I can say is I want to surprise myself. And I also want to somehow push myself as a DJ to maybe release a record that I know it's not really what exactly everybody wants to hear right now, but I kind of like it and I want to make it work. And selfish way of thinking. But this is what actually pushes things forward or in the wrong direction. But at least it pushes things. You don't stand still and just repeat yourself, which would be horrible. Was there a certain moment at which you felt like you became... I guess for lack of a better phrase, an international DJ, known as an international DJ? Was it after the Get Physical compilation? Was it before that? I consider myself as a very good DJ. And I think as a producer, I'm not anyhow good. Usually the DJs that play international are great producers. So the strange thing with my career was always that I played already around the world and never really made an album. I never made a... big hit or whatsoever. Yeah, okay. There were some records that were kind of okay, but I never did a ray like Arm did, you know, or a sleepy hollow like Stefan Goldman did. So in the beginning of my international career, I was never defined by a record. that was big and the people came to hear that record or they knew me from that record. That's why very often when I played, like the first time in Portugal, the first time in France, I was like the favorite of the promoter who heard me in Berlin and was like totally amazed by what I did. And then I came to his club and no one was there. So it happened very often to me in my first international years that I played somewhere where I thought I always want to play there or not maybe not always but I read about that place and it must be amazing and I played there and it wasn't really a great night. The feedback afterwards from the promoter was always like, you know, it wasn't so full and financial, it was so, so, but I really liked the way you played. So this was my first three years, actually, traveling the first time to America, to Japan, to Portugal, to London, you know, so. I still didn't make that album or that hit record. But I think I always left an impression at least at the promoter or... at the few people that were there to make that night stand out for them. So I got invited back. Compared to maybe other DJs that play somewhere and it's quite busy, it's all fine, but they never leave a mark. I think this is what I did in that years and therefore I got invited back and back again and then I think at a certain point you come into a certain circles. that constantly book you. I think when I'm going to America now, I'm playing for the same promoters that I played eight years ago. It's the same. There might be two or three changed, but let's say there's eight promoters that I regularly play for and five of them I know for a long time already. And this is the same in Japan or in England. I'm going this week to Glasgow sub club and I'm playing there twice a year and I'm doing this for five, six years. And it didn't matter if last year in a vision was maybe not so cool or I never did the big record in that year, but the year before I did, that never really was anyhow important in my career. Luckily enough. You've talked about this a little bit in an interview on RA about the mix CD, but I guess I wonder what's next in your mind for, is the commercially released mix CDs? The mix CD at 74 to 80 minutes, do you think that exists in five years? Yes, it will. Okay, it will exist, but not for me. If I look at mix CDs, 95% of them are done because a DJ wants to show what he's playing in the club and how great he is with that. So in other words, it's a promotion tool. This is why we all do it. The question is obviously how you promote yourself or in other words what kind of music you put onto it. Very often the answer is you do whatever you think is the tracks of the moment. And this will survive. There were always been labeled things that putting successful music together in one mix that has a constant flow by DJ XY or as a side product of a time warp of a big festival or whatsoever. this concept will still exist. I never actually think I did a... I'm thinking now, but no, I really actually, I never did a... mixed CD that was about representing what I'm playing in the club. That doesn't mean that I never put records on it that I was playing in the club. But it was always more about producing something or mixing something that I don't want to hear in the club. So I think I gave the mix to the label in May. So now it's like, what is it, four months ago or something, or five months after I gave it to them, it's out. So I had the chance to listen to it quite some time already. And the last two tracks I put on are Envision. Arjen Lade, Arm Remix and it's Todd Terger. Obviously two big tracks and I'm pissed I did put it on. Because now when I'm listening to the CD I'm thinking they ruin the vibe totally because I think all the other tracks are tracks that people not really have heard or that I would love to listen to while I'm playing to a sport while I'm driving to a sport or while I'm going to Croatia and I'm sitting on the seaside And now this mix is a little bit in... What is the word in English? The concept is not fulfilled. I don't see any reason why I should not do a two-hour mix that I like, licensed tracks, and release them as a download and pay the artist for it. Yes, I know everyone will say now, yeah, but it's going to be copied and it's going to be like millions of times, but copied and you will not make money with this and blah, blah, blah. Trust me, you don't make money with Mixed City anyway. And not as an artist. and I don't see... I never... with Innervisions or with anything we release, we never looked at it like this. We looked at what we actually using. This is for me always the key things. As a DJ, I'm releasing a 12-inch. Am I playing it in the club? As a CD, will I listen to it somehow? Now, how do I use a CD? I put it in a computer, I copy it in a computer and I play it somewhere else. And the CD, it will be just somewhere there. I will actually, the product itself, I will never use again. So why should I produce that product that I once put in my computer, copied, and then I copied from there to whatever device I use? Why not... producing the file straight away. It's for me not logical anymore. Where records, on the other hand, are logical because the people that are buying the records, they really use it. this tool they use to record they play that record whenever they play in the club is it a DJ or whenever they listen to it but the CD for me the format itself I don't use in a way that it makes sense for me so that's why I decided I don't want to produce a CD anymore where do you see yourself in five years from now where do you want to be in five years? When I was 28 I said I'm hopefully not playing with 35 anymore and I'm 35 now. So making predictions about me playing DJing anymore are I think useless now. You know there's I just love it. That's the way it is. I hope that I have the chance to test myself in one more field. I don't know what field it is now. You mentioned in an interview maybe a year and a half ago, two years, that you're getting into art. a little bit. Yeah, but this is, I'm into it, but it's nothing that I'm... I'm not even a good music producer, so I cannot be a painter. There's people that love music, and it's good that they love music without producing music, and this is the same with art for me. I kind of like it, but it's nothing that I'm tending to go into a direction now. It's why should everyone do something that he likes for himself? Question. Just enjoy what you like without trying to do the same. But I think you're a very competitive guy. Yeah, but I know my limits. No, I don't know my limits. Well, with 35, you somehow know your limits. I hope... Okay. I think I still will DJ. We still will have Muting the Noise, our website. maybe InnerVisions, to maybe make this once clear for everyone. For us, when we started our website, InnerCityVisions, from the moment we started it, it was always clear that this is our company. And InnerVisions is just part of it. But no one got that concept actually. Everyone always said like, yeah, they're doing this laptop bags. So this is InnerVisions laptop bags. But we thought like, yeah, but it's not. No, no, InnerVisions is the music side of it. The other things is just stuff we also like. And because we wanted to make that clear, we actually started this new website called Muting the Noise. where we're testing, we're doing whatever, and you can find our music there. But now it has two different names, so to make clear, it goes in two different directions. So... What I'm saying is we have this playground called muting the noise and I think this is definitely going to be there and we will play around with whatever we feel is interesting in five years. Like for instance we did this movie soundtrack for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. It was one and a half years ago. performing it in London on Thursday. I would have never thought I'm doing this like three years ago. But in a way it is logical that we ended up there. But I would never have thought about it. So in five years it will be something that is somehow connected to it. But I don't know what it is yet. But it will be presented on Muting the Noise. Thank you.
