Thank you very much. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein. and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Though music is its chief export, Ghostly International has always been more than just a record label. Formed in 1999 in a University of Michigan dorm, It began as a platform for the Midwest's vibrant but occasionally overlooked music scene. As its musical remit grew to incorporate more geographically and stylistically diverse acts, it also became a hub for visual art and design, and its forged collaborations with everyone from LA's beat scene to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. With projects like Drip FM, Ghostly has further challenged what it means to be a label. in the internet age. Through it all, founder Sam Valenti IV has been steering the boat through each twist and turn. I caught up with him at his home in Brooklyn recently to discuss the state of the label as it marks its 15th year. ♪ ♪ So Ghostly International started 15 years ago this year, and it started in your dorm room at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. What was going on in that dorm room? I think the idea, I think maybe was even in high school a little bit earlier than that. I have like CDRs that say like Ghostly Records and whatnot on it from friends. I think the concept was that may have been right when electronic music was going through another marketing push in the States, and I think that was like the avenue. Daft Punk's first album and Chemical Brothers and Prodigy and that I don't know if it was top up top down or bottom up but also going to raves in Detroit and seeing how electronic music seemed like a very exciting and plausible reality at that time I was inspired by I was more of a hip hop kid like i grew up on you know playing hip-hop records when i started at 15 uh started djing like high school dance i was like my dad drove me to my first gig and dropped me off and i played my first high school dance so like dj culture was already exciting to me and then slowly because of detroit radio and detroit record stores the idea of genrefication sort of went away where DJs on Saturday night on JLB or whatever would play ghetto tech into hip hop, into jungle, into electro, into Cybertron. And it seemed like a really connected lineage of music, right? Like the regionalism of Detroit from mojo and radio. shows you had prints and craft work and car you know car um sorry gary newman's cars and that was like i don't know it just seemed like plausible i think right now we don't live in a time when genre really matters but i think even look 10 years back and it was like you had to be you were like a drum and bass person or a hip-hop person or a techno person and Once those barriers fell away, I felt like music was really exciting. I felt like liberated to try everything because hip hop always had the sample culture where you could look up, okay, Tripod Quest, Electric Relaxation is really, you know, a sample from these four songs. And then that would take you into jazz. That would take you into psych. That was always like an okay transition, but once electronic music became part of the mix and I realized that like, oh, Carl Craig is an extension of jazz and, you know, we're, the lineage is all kind of connected. The idea of a record label seemed exciting because you could contextualize your interests in a way that it was compelling. And I was. buying records from Detroit labels and UK labels like Moax were really influential. And looking back and starting to discover Factory and things like that. And you realize a record label is a very, it's a philosophical stance on music that was widely democratic. You didn't have to be somebody or know anybody. You could just put a record out. And if it was good, people would play it. So was that like kind of the initial pitch, the initial concept was to have a record label that was kind of an extension of all of that? where genre didn't really make so much of a difference in what was going to be coming out on the label? I think so. It started really as more of a dance, like a house techno label, although I was interested in other kinds of music. I mean, I met Matthew Deere my first week of school, and we kind of hit it off, and he was making tracks, and I was DJing, and we kind of wanted to hang out. and do something together. And then we put his record out. It was him and Disco D, who I consider like a spiritual co-founder as well. and made a record hands up for Detroit there's Dave right there he passed away in seven years ago last month which is it's very sad and still kind of sticks with me a lot but um yeah I think the idea was once I started here we started getting demos once we put out Matt's record Locally, Todd Osborne, who we still work with, had a record store and sold a copy to a guy named Tad Mullenix, who was just a local guy making really cool music and had released a drum and bass record with Todd. But Tad had made like hip-hop stuff and house stuff and experimental stuff and gave me a tape Thinking that we want to sign the dance records on it the James T cotton stuff the early James cotton stuff Which we did but we also I flipped the the tape like reversed itself. This is dating me a little bit but Auto reverse went off and then the flip side was all his experimental stuff and then I it was so compelling and so essential that I felt like, well, the label needs to be expanded. It can't just be a fixed thing. And that's where the division of Ghostly and Spectral was. One's going to be a label that's open form, free form, and one's going to be a label that's 12-inch focused, dance focused. And it seemed like they were kind of natural yin and yang. Yeah, it seems like more than having a specific stylistic remit, at least in the very beginning of the label, kind of the first... First few years of the label, it was more of a regional remit. I mean, most of these artists were people who were from in and around Detroit or the Midwest more generally. Was that something that you wanted to do, to focus on this part of the country and the music of this part of the country? For sure. Absolutely. I think there's always that sense that if you're missing out, if you don't live on the coast or in Europe, and I felt like obviously Midwest being sort of a birthplace. place for electronic music and dance music uh i like the idea and even the name is kind of a pun like international is is sort of like uh everywhere nowhere like it could be any town ann arbor it could be any city and the idea of like utilizing you know the the creative talent of whoever you know and it was all our friends the designers the photographers the musicians the engineers it was a very local thing intentionally not because and because there's so much talent under every around every corner that is yet to be discovered So I liked it as a model for a, like the Midwest as sort of a cultural center and re-invigorating that. Not that we were that, but being part of the continuum of Midwestern dance labels. Also, I think the idea that anybody could do it, you know, but like if you lived in any city, there's your friends is enough to make something happen. You know, that we didn't have to sign a big artist to become. that was already big to become recognized. I like where international came from as sort of being a, being kind of a pun or kind of an ironic thing to tack onto the name of this label that started out as being very regional. What does ghostly mean? It was kind of a feeling. I think ghostly, I kept seeing it. I was a, I was DJ space ghost in high school, which is so such a daft name. But I like the idea of something being described as you could describe it. Like, oh, that sounds really ghostly or that's ghostly. Also, it has a different meaning for whoever is saying or thinking about it. It can kind of be either scary or moody or spiritual. I don't know. I mean, it has a lot of open-endedness to it that felt right. And then the international. kind of like let ins it a little bit like a, like it's a company. Like I always wanted to look like it was bigger than it was. And even last night I was at a dinner and someone's like, how many people work at ghostly? Is it like 40 or 50? I was like, no, it's like 10, you know, it's like, it's not, it's supposed to look bigger than it is, which is not, which is kind of in the inverse of what most. electronic music outfits want to perceive as being very DIY and hand stamped. It's a little bit contrarian. I wanted to keep sense of mystery or confusion around it, I guess. What were some of the labels that kind of inspired you when you were getting Ghostly International going? Like who were you looking to as the, if not as the template, like who sort of created the space in which Ghostly could spring up? Great call. Yeah, I think obviously a lot of the Detroit labels were hugely inspiring. I remember also seeing on the back of an Interdimensional Transmissions record, which was from Ann Arbor, now it's in Detroit. in realizing how close that was and that like oh you could make a record here you know and then seeing going to the record store and seeing Planet E and Transmat and Metroplex and UR and Direct Beat and record time melodies and memories street corner usually there's a record store culture that was so powerful and so local and you'd see people bring their records in like consignment and i just like the idea that was like a local industry that it was like uh made it very plausible that you could make a record as well as these these cosmic imports with the little orange sticker and the the 2x price tag basically um seeing what at the time i feel like what James Lavelle did which is contextualizing art and design and music and he was way really ahead of his time by making product out of his music historically obviously like things like Blue Note which had like an aesthetic things like Factory which saw the whole of what they did as the label that were really inspiring like Anthony Wilson's casket has a catalog number which is both really morbid but also really humorous and really playful and like the sense that this your life is this whole thing right we're all the record isn't necessarily the finished object it's how you see the world and i think that a mix of those things i mean so many labels obviously but um the idea that it was local in detroit was inspiring and also the idea that um you could do a lot with a 12-inch record And Carlos Souffrant, one of my favorite DJs from Ann Arbor and San Francisco, talked about records as this sort of dialogue between each other, that a record begets another record. They're almost like this call and response. And I like that idea of this sort of floating dialogue. It's almost like literature where the record is the answer to the question. That's a really cool concept. Do you think that that's something that's played out on Ghostly International, that the records really have been in dialogue with one another over the years? I think unintentionally, sure. And I like the fact that we try to continue to throw curveballs, not without... satisfaction because that's what ultimately we're slaves to our our own enjoyment of the music it's not an academic enterprise it's an enjoyment based enterprise um but i think yeah i think it's cool i think when records you know i remember when audion's mouth the mouth came out and you started seeing he was part of a movement towards this sort of 10 plus minute techno song right and then things kind of contract and things get spare and then they get full and listening to records from like 2000 even our own old Spectra records are faster so I like how like there's this sort of grading I'm sure if someone did do the math you could watch the sort of BPMs rise and fall I'm sure you could throw an economic indicator on it you could throw whatever I don't know like geography but yeah I mean they're telling stories and we don't really know where it's gonna go like dance music culture is still in its infancy. So I'm fascinated by what we're building as a community, including every label, every artist. We don't know the effects yet. It seems like there's always been a lot more at work with the label than just the music itself. There's been a big design influence on the label. You definitely see a lot of influences that are like extra musical coming into Ghostly International. I see where the, just given the fact that you grew up. in the suburbs of Detroit and kind of all of the music that you would have had access to because of that. Like I sort of see where that came from. I mean, did you always have an interest in design and the visual element that could play into the label? I'm not a designer, so I can't say that wasn't my trade, although I did want to make an impact with the design of what we do and work with artists, designers who are as talented as the musicians. I feel like it's a fair exchange, you know, because obviously the music is the most important thing, but I think... increasingly how we especially with the digitization of music even though vinyl is having its its day again um how we remember songs is still very visual and as a quote about like you can't hear what you can't see because there has to be a sense of it's like watching a film score without the film sometimes um it's evocative but it's they're meant to be paired, you know, and I think my visceral memories of discovering like a 4AD record and even New Order was such a big influence, you know, Peter Saville and his minimalism, that formed what the music was. I never, I didn't, I never, there was no videos playing at the time. Maybe there was videos, but they weren't in them. that I saw but I just my sister's tape collection was like okay like New Order is this really important band because substance looks important and cool and like I want to know what that is you know Joy Division Unknown Pleasure still speaks to people Disney appropriates their graphics like what is that i don't know it's just it's just it's just it's like a fair it's a fair exchange you want to give music the best chance to be perceived and so i'm all for mystery i'm all for like opaque you know um the classic detroit berlin continuum of like fuck the rest like music is the signal but i always felt like we could um bring another sense into it as well with working with really good designers as well. And so that's been a lot of the joy for me has been pairing designers with artists and, um, finding that connection. Like when Mike Chena works with Shigeto, I know they're going to make something cool and they're going to. you know, to have a dialogue about it and there's some tension there, but that's also like, I think it reveals another layer to the music as well. And I just think design is, everything is designed, you know, so to pretend like it's not important isn't reality, you know, so it isn't about marketing, it's about... sat like you know synesthetic satisfaction that you're like okay i'm i'm buying into this for myriad reasons and i want to live in a world that is informed by the music that i love and i think that that's our inspiration for working with designers or doing collaborations and they're not defensive strategies they're not revenue generating i mean really they're not um they're not, the business isn't going to be fueled by whatever cool collaboration is going on. It's, but it is, I think, extended. And a lot of people get excited when we did a coffee with our local roaster in Ypsilanti last holiday, it got more. Likes than any record we put out, you know, I mean so I think people do want to be surprised they do want to be Stimulated but as long as it doesn't outshine the music, you know, it has to there has to be that balance, you know You had mentioned that the label kind of began as a way of showcasing this kind of non coastal cultural center At some point, though, the label did start to bring in people from the coasts, from outside of America, from all over the world. Tell me a little bit about that shift in the label. Yeah, I think around 2003 or 2004, we started getting demos that were really interesting. A lot of American artists, artists that I felt like maybe were overlooked or had been kind of label hopping or self-published. I think Solvent comes in around there, North American, if you include Toronto. Twine. luzine christopher willits uh jeff white so people who had been on great labels like meal plateau and hyman and a lot of really awesome experimental labels but i felt like could make amazing albums and could and wanted them as part of the crew you know so and i still work with most of those artists you know and i like there's like this i think the american electronic scene in the early 2000s is really fertile. I mean, you include the South was really is overlooked as far as people don't think about it as much, but Miami and Atlanta between schematic and chocolate industries and pre-fuse telephone, Tel Aviv, Richard Devine, you know, this, they, Miami and the South were actually the first, I think, to pick up a lot of the waves, maybe the post warp, the American version of warp starts in the South. And I think. what Hefti did with discovering a lot of talent and bringing it into like a almost like a post-rock audience and sort of I don't know, it was a cool time to be part of electronic music in the States. That's really interesting because it's so easy to think about that era in the States. There's an argument that could be made for that era in the States, that it wasn't so fertile. But that's really only maybe if you're looking at pure techno or pure house or something like that. If you're thinking more broadly about electronic music, it does make sense that that was an exciting time to be around. You look at, obviously people thought that club culture maybe died in the era of 9-11, just that it was not a time to celebrate. It was a dark time. And obviously, you know, I think the economy leading up to that and the sort of first tech bubble created a lot of interest in club. aspects around the country with DC with buzz and Detroit with motor. And that was a club culture seemed very like alive. And I think it's sort of Twilo in New York, right? These things kind of ground out, but I think what it did went back underground as it always does. And out of that came a lot of experimental music. And I even consider like tortoise and a lot of the post-rock electron, that part of the electronic continuum in America. And it was just exciting. I feel like Ghostly comes from that time, the sort of schism between dance music and instrumental and experimental music and performance. I always saw us as like a... group of bands so we did a lot of like road tours in the early 2000s where we'd just have a van and Matthew Deere, Dyke House, Midwest Product, Dabry and we'd just do like rock clubs which was kind of an untraditional I remember being at South By and we were like one of the only electronic showcases you could find and like laptops were kind of seen as like oh it's not cool to have a laptop on stage it's not music it's not performance like It was a real derision against electronic music in that raucous context, you know? And now it's funny because the laptop's like de rigueur. Electronic music is like the music. But it's neat to see. I'm super surprised. I would not have expected Daft Punk to be winning album of the year. I would not have expected vinyl to be sold at, you know, chain stores. I would not have. I mean, so just even though I was on the beat, I'm really surprised about what's going on. I think it's really wild, you know? Well, the other thing about kind of when Ghostly International began is those really formative years. for the label were at a time when like the kind of the line on the music industry was that you're, you're in a, an absolutely impossible place. You're starting a label that, that is pretty ambitious with, with what you're doing. And you're starting it at like an incredibly difficult time, maybe to start a label with music that has gone pretty underground. I mean, that's got to be a challenge, but does that maybe make it more exciting? Absolutely. I joked that like we ran kind of back into the burning building, you know, like I was using Napster in my dorm room, like the real original Napster and file sharing. And it was clear that like, it wasn't going to be the same. It was also exciting though. Right. So yeah, it was kind of naive or dumb or contrarian. I don't know, but it wasn't the best time to probably endeavor to have a record label but at the same time i think that is the impulse is that you should look at things that are being left for dead and along for maybe like half of our lifespan music has been seen as sort of like a dead or a dying uh in this quote-unquote industry But out of that has come a lot of interesting renaissances. I work now in a neighborhood with maybe 10 independent labels, opening record stores, opening venues, building their own realities. We're building a software company in our office. too you know so i think without that sort of that life support hadn't been that dream of like the big the major swooping in and signing you or whatever that was dying every day and we dealt with all the distribution issues i got laughed at getting distribution trying to get distribution in the early days i got told to you know basically off in nicer terms We've gotten dropped by major distributors. But I think there's an impulse because it feels like it's personal and this music is so important to people that it just feels like it's worth doing. And there was always a little glimmer of, okay, we keep going, we can survive. We'd be down to whatever in our bank account and then something good would happen. just enough belief to say, let's keep going. The sub pop joke is like going out of business since 1988 or whatever. And I always think about, I always relate to that, that like, I always feel like, oh, this is like our last year. Like we can't possibly do another year, but like, you know, more great music comes out and we discover another way to keep ourselves excited about messing with formats. You know, like we'll design, we'll Calcutt design that totem for Matthew Deere, which opened up the dialogue of what is a non-format. what does post-format music look like? And while that's happening, vinyl is quote-unquote resurging. I mean, we never stopped selling vinyl, but it's cool to be able to sell it in places that no one else had ever, we'd never sold it before, you know? So it is like a belief, you're throwing belief ahead of yourself. And I think artists have to do this all the time and say like, someone will be at the show that I book. Someone will be there. And I that's what has made this music and this experience so special is that sense of like a resolute but like arguably crazy hope that like I'm just gonna make it work and for a lot of people people are finding their audience which is who I never would have you know I think a lot of people have gotten their due a lot of DJs from Detroit even that you know sold me records when I was 15 or 16 are traveling the world and They were like the last guys that were trying to market themselves or whatever. And I think that that's really cool that the work that you guys have done with RA and exposing underground music. that network always was needed. So it's very cool. You mentioned the Matthew Deere, like the Totem Project. Are there some other projects from over the years that really did require kind of a massive leap of faith that you're really glad that the label took, that ended up paying off maybe when nobody, not even yourself necessarily, thought they would? I think just being open to trusting the artists to follow their muse. You know, Matthew Deere with becoming a vocal artist. I mean, he always, in my mind, was a vocal artist. We just hadn't put the records out yet. But, you know, he was derided for... Matthew was made fun of for performing with a mic. people have their favorites and and he's still making um audion techno and uh doing every dj and fulfilling all of his creative interests but i think you just have to kind of trust the people you work with and um let them continue to evolve as creatives and vice versa people have been like why are you doing this product or this collaboration as if it's like gonna dilute the music but i think you have to um you have to follow those those whims because otherwise it's too safe you know i think the danger of of the success of electronic music right now is that will become safe right and that's kind of not safe as a weird word because it implies a lot of things but I think it the tension of dance music being this underground overground thing is what has inspired its greatness and I saw Thomas Bangalter I saw him in public and I remembered you know how he looked from my old mix magazines It was about a year ago, and I walked up to him. I was at an event. I didn't want to be a creepy lurker dude, but I was just like, hey, I just wanted to say I'm a big fan. I grew up on your music, essentially. And he was really gracious and kind of explained to me that they've always been against... Whatever they do is always contrarian to what they did last. Even Tron was different, having an orchestra. in this album being the deluxe analog luxurious bubble bath is counter to everything that's digital right now. And I think that that is what makes the music exciting is there's an impulse to rip it up and keep going and try a new thing. And that's, I try to honor that with what we do while also just letting the, whether it be a free current, free flowing current of what the artist's intentions are. In that sense, it almost seems like you mentioned Matthew Deere, that he's kind of been he's been involved with the label since the beginning, but he's such an artist that's like an embodiment of the spirit of the label. You know, he he has all of the success making minimal techno, but at the same time really wants to pursue this career as a as a as a pop star. I mean, or if not a pop star, then, you know, a musician, someone who makes music, a musician. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, um, I would imagine he's been a, been a big inspiration for the label and that it's been kind of a, kind of a nice feedback loop. Absolutely. Yeah. Matthew. Continues and challenges me, inspires me with what he does. And it's just a relentless drive and creation and always is tweaked, you know, tweaking. honing his skills and trying ideas. And like, it's just a real creative guy. And a lot of artists we work with Osborne in all aspects of his life is tweaking Tad with JTC and Dabry and other aliases. You know, it's. they're real like curious people, you know? And I think that that's, I want, I wanted to be around artists because the way they look at the world is. inspires me working with Michael Chena and Andy Gilmore and Sue Gwen and the visual designers as well. They're constantly evolving. And so it forces you to do the same. You know, you can't really rest on the template. And I think that that's the greatest gift of working in music is that you're around. real people who are really alive and are not just about music, but like coffee and cooking and whatever they're obsessed with, like you're going to hear about it. There've been so many interesting projects over the years that have kind of expanded the definition of what, like what a record label could be to the point where it's like, is ghostly international, even record labels, that the best way. to describe it. One project that I think is especially interesting that's maybe partially related to Ghostly and it's kind of outside of Ghostly as well is Drip. That kind of seems like a way of leveling the playing field in a way, like kind of changing a fan's relationship with a label. Tell me a little bit about the project. Sure, yeah. Drip is an idea that we've discussed since, like, 06. There's notes and conversations about subscription and about membership, you know. And we even had, like, a ghostly card for a while. Like, that was just people who bought it at the store. The idea of... deeper connection because ultimately place and being part of a club is kind of what we seek right and and culture music is is church to people right it's a it's communion it's um identity it it fills a real deep need so i think even though we have all these tools to connect often they're not optimal um They're also, we looked at social media and how fantastic it's been for labels. Even piracy has been a huge benefit to labels in a lot of ways. But they haven't connected the dots between support and exchange and like dialogue. And we really feel like there is a leveling. The democratic nature of dance music, electronic music, deserves another platform. And so I think with Drip, we really want to create a place where any creator can have a self-sustaining relationship with their fans. Fans can dialogue with each other and create their own culture and content. And also allow people who do want to pay the artist or support the artist to do that in an elegant way that doesn't feel unfair or misaligned with the realities of the economy. You know, so, yeah, great businesses do kind of maybe try to put themselves out of business. Like, I like the idea that, you know, that drip is like a post. record label reality. At the same time, I think it reinforces the idea that labels are important for their curation, right? That the idea of a label is just to cut through the noise. Okay, this is on Pan or Hyperdub or DFA and I can jump at it at the store and I want to know what that's about and it's part of a continuum and it's like the culture. So labels have more importance than ever. At the same time, the old, the needs of the label are not production distribution manufacturing as much as more like services and team. You know, it's like being a part of a skate team where you get, you know, a free deck if you break yours and you have buddies you can go skate with and people can associate you. I always think about Powell Peralta and like. chocolate and the old skate brands and how like cool they seem because they were like you know you want to be in that club you want to learn from these guys and i think that those are the impulses that a label really should have whereas technology music's been kind of dragged by its heels that the traditional music industry has been let like put its arms in the air and be like well what should we do you know and and it's changing you know i think there's a lot of cool companies out right now with music technology but i like the idea that drip is built by people who love music a but b um understand the financial needs of artists and that the idea of a creative middle class is a really inspiring thing for me um my friend barra tunday brought this idea up with me and if you can have more artists making money and starting families and creating their own enterprises. That's like good for culture in general. It's good for the world. And I want to be part of that revolution. And my co-founder and I'm a gal and, and everybody at ghostly, we all believe that that's a plausible. Yeah, so it seems like Drip in a way, I mean, if independent labels and independent musicians are getting squeezed by the way the industry is working now, on the one side by like fans who can theoretically get everything for free. And on the other, by the distribution model is, you know, kind of based on hardware and based on like these files and stuff like this. And a company like Apple might have the whole catalog and like you can, you buy your music from them. There aren't really these record stores. It seems like this is a way of kind of making that relationship a little bit healthier, kind of giving independent labels and independent artists a little bit more of a shot. Yeah. And I think allowing people to get in at the level they want to get in, you know, I think all this stuff is great. I'm not anti, I think you need all these services, like a health, theme music ecosystem needs the local record store and the mass celestial jukebox streaming service they all work together however the missing my greatest enjoyment with music has been communal has been going to record stores and talking like i learned about lou reed's death at capture tracks and greenpoint and people were talking about it and Just people someone pulling a record me like check this out and labels do that I think labels are like in a lot of ways the good ones are the record store clerk who's like, you know, you may didn't know that, you know light in the attic releases a new-age comp which I had no knowledge of the traditional like the true new-age sound and then they released a curated set that explains to me like how to They just frame it up nicely. And they say, this is why you should listen to this. And so Drip allows, it's another vessel for labels to connect. And I think going forward, it'll be another vessel for artists to be discovered, to have a dialogue with each other, to earn money from people who want to support them. It just seems like that's another reality. And if that hurts the label business, I don't think it will. I think labels will form around drips that people will have their own. crews on drip and create their own communities on drip, you know? Do you have a sense of how it's going? I mean, do you think that this model so far is fulfilling the purpose that, that, that you guys had, had hoped it would fulfill? Yeah, I'd love it to go further. Um, we're only a few people, so it's obviously, you know, you're trying to put out fires and build at the same time. Um, I think we have seen a a lot of success with labels that really want to communicate. It's not necessarily the biggest labels that are the biggest drips. It's the ones that make it the centerpiece of their relationships. And so I think it's a healthy part of a balanced breakfast, to use the slogan, alongside streaming. a la carte downloads and vinyl. if you want to go deeper, we want Drip to be an option. And I think that this is a good, as good a start as any. Now that Ghostly has been around for like 15 years, I mean, you're at a point where probably a lot of the newer artists that you're signing to the label might be part of kind of the next generation of producers. Tell me a little bit about like... what you're seeing in new artists that are coming up in the scene. I mean, do you see a lot of connections with kind of the people you were signing 15 years ago? Or is it like, is the producer like kind of a vastly different sort of artist? Music is, electronic music is such a, it's so ingrained now. We basically get the software upon, you know, maybe Matthew would like have cracked. Fruity Loops copies, but now it's like stuff is pretty baked in, you know, in a digital native culture is like electronic music is as facile as anything. I just think it's cool because it's also opening up like modular synthesis and people want to learn about the guts and the how, the making of what actually is electronic music and with photography. Like once you learn how to take a cool digital photo, you want to learn how to take a quote unquote real photo. So then that's healthy to the impulse to go back. But also, yeah, I just find, I think the volume is amazing. I think like the, the fluency and like the ability to sort of not think about where stuff fits and just to make stuff is cool. You're doing sort of non genres, right? Where you're just like, this is just electronic music or this is just music. And so I think it's less fixated on. um what came before it which is cool um yeah i i in a weird way i think that this the next this generation of producers it's inheriting a lot but it's also like i like that it's not too precious that it's kind of like to see what works. You know, it's not so canonical or so rigid about what's real and what's not real. It's like, let's just go and have a go at it. And what's going to come out of that is going to be a lot of interesting stuff, you know? But yeah, it's definitely, it's fun to work with artists of different spectrums in their career. and see what their interests and needs are. Traditionally, we worked with a lot of artists who do incorporate live instruments as well. And performance is interesting to me as well. How are we going to evolve performance? Not just with lights and video, but also the actual playing. Someone like Shigeto is interesting. because he is kind of blending these worlds. But there's a lot of room. People are interested in experiences. I think that's why electronic music has kind of found a bigger voice. The show is an experience, a communal thing. I think vinyl, even though it's a product, is an experience. You feel like you're even shopping for records is an experience. The Brian Eno idea of art as a trigger for experiences as opposed to an end result is going to drive where this is going. And I think we don't know what it's going to be, whether it's another video game or it's the idea of nonlinear music or site-specific music or self-generated music. I'm still waiting for Instagram for music to happen. happen in a lot of ways. But I like that the sort of shackles have been taking off of music in a way that it's not bound to the object, that it's kind of free. But yet, if you want a canonical music experience, you can. very much have them. It's kind of like whatever version of music you want to get involved in is happening. I wonder what sort of a factor like geography would still be for people who are coming up as producers today. I mean, Ghostly International kind of... began with this as kind of as a part of this particular geographic situation. I wonder, do you feel like that still exists with the artists that you're coming across? I think Daniel Wang put it to me once. He's like, I think the best music comes from like small cottage industries and groups of friends. And I think that hasn't changed. I think geography is less, is less, uh, uh, less of a thing than it was. Right. Because the nature of music was that it was local. It was events, DJs and radio, local radio. Um, and the advent of streaming and boiler room culture is that everyone's getting the same message. And I think that that's okay. I think region is interesting to me in what it brings in its challenges. And I think you look at a place like Detroit or Baltimore or... I was just in, I was in Norway last year and kind of spent a weekend in Bergen, which is, you know, where Rijksop and Kings of Convenience, a lot of groups came from. And just thinking about that communities of people building musical identities, like that won't change, you know, maybe some of it's done digitally. or online, but it's still going to be like you, you and your mates. And, and, uh, I like the fact that gender maybe is less of a thing. I think that's actually the biggest, uh, shift in a lot of ways, maybe more than region is that it's not a voice. It's probably still very male, but that, that is. leveling that I think the digital that people growing up on electronic music making it it isn't much of just about guys you know and and there's a lot of crazy intelligent and wonderful music being made by people of both genders. So I think that with the dissemination of digital tools, geography is less centric. Friendship is still like what drives this stuff, I think. And barrier to entry, which I think is what the great thing about digital music is, is digitally created music has gone away. The label now is based in New York. Label is based between New York, Ann Arbor, Los Angeles, and Berlin. And we have people, we have our label manager, Jeff Owens, who, who really deserves, uh, you know, the lion's share of credit as far as steering. The label Enterprise, since he started in 2004, is Los Angeles now. A third of our team is in Ann Arbor still, and I want to try to keep that. And a third of our team is here. so I the name actually kind of suits us now finally it actually is that international enterprise yeah but I feel like New York is New York is a a great place to rub ideas together and also put it on the street and take it to the show and see what how it reacts but I still like the idea of it being a regional, Midwestern-born product, so to speak. What's going on in the music scene in the Midwest nowadays? I mean, you hear a lot about the situation in Detroit now being a very difficult one with the economy. How is it as a place for music? My experience has been really positive. People like Ektomorph are throwing amazing shows. The party culture is really fresh. Shigeto. relocated to Detroit a few years ago. And, uh, whenever I visit him in the studio, his brother has a great band as well. And, uh, I don't know, it just feels like it will never not be a place to make art. That's one of the great parts about it is that it is truly a creative place. It's a very modernist place. People dream of the future, even though it's a trope at this point, a journalistic trope. It is a place to imagine big, and it is a place with adversity. But out of that comes a lot of beauty. I think we'll see another wave, another wave. of artists that come from Detroit and places that we didn't expect, not just the obvious centers, but I would love Toledo or Cleveland or, you know, a lot of cities that Detroit's a good model. Detroit quote unquote can work in the next 10, 15 years if people see it as. and pulling itself up, a lot of cities will model itself after it. So not just creatively, but economically, et cetera. Like it's an exciting time and friends of mine are opening bars and coffee shops and stores and there's a lot of hope, you know, but it's not, it's not a blank slate. People want to say that like, and you can buy a house for $5 and all this crap. And I'm just really frustrated. People see it as this sort of. canvas to be painted on as if it's not happening. And it's like, no, Detroit's always been happening. It's not a blank slate. It's a place that needs ingenuity and talent and experience. But it's like already has all the DNA, you know? And so I hope it does continue to inspire generations into the future. So it's 15 years of Ghostly this year. Does the label have anything special planned for the anniversary? I think we're going to, yeah, we'll do some shows, do some events. A lot of our artists, old and new have releases coming up um taiko fort ramo uh shigeto dabri audion uh we signed a guy named tobacco who was the group in a group called black moth super rainbow um alexi delano just did over 12 inch for spectra a lot of spectral stuff mark e is a new album uh a couple of new signings on spectral. I'm really excited about Osborne. Um, yeah, it's a good blip mix of, uh, Christopher Willits. A lot of, a lot of artists we've worked with for over 10 years and artists like Raja and, uh, matrix man and new artists that we're excited about. So I think it's a healthy blend of the. past and the future and try not to be too nostalgic about it. I think being more about what's next is more important. Like I just, times and times I don't get me wrong. I love to look back and I love to look at what we've done. and learn from it. Cause I always forget sometimes, Oh yeah, that was like what spawned, you know, drip came from this and this and this. But I think it's more about like, where can, what's the value of what we do for the community this year? I'm thinking a lot about. education not in a traditional sense but um sharing not whatever knowledge we've acquired or mistakes we've made um having more value than just the the output that we create so yeah i like to continue the art initiative i think visual culture and music has become so much a thing together and i'm really proud of the artists we work with and uh with drip just It's also given me the ability to reach out to a lot of my friends who have labels and artists and talk to them about their challenges and what their experience has been. I feel a real connection to where we are in 2014, like what is this little moment, which is exciting. because there's a lot of headroom to grow, but also, you know, it's not going to be, it's never going to be a cakewalk. You know, I think everyone's is braced for, you don't do this without realizing the sort of difficulty inherent. So I think. If we can help create tools that enable more creatives to do a better job, then that would be success in itself. I wonder if Ghostly even kind of has created a space where there could be more labels like Ghostly. I mean, do you think it's possible that someone sitting in a dorm room in 2014 could put something together that sort of resembles Ghostly? ghostly is it a model that's still replicable i wouldn't advise uh all of our decision making i mean a lot of it's sort of um numbskulled you know i think i think yeah i think the continuum of like creation is is so fertile and the the union of physical and digital too has a lot of of room the the experience of that um i mean i was inspired by rick rubin having a dorm room label and you know stone's throw and a lot of these sort of bedroom ideas and it's it's the digital it's a technical one of the garage right of the the the dream of uh building a startup in your garage and doing things the long way or the hard way or stamping records and selling them out of your car. Like these are, these aren't going away. You know, um, the, the modern equivalent maybe is the sort of direct to fan, uh, drip model, but I think you're never gonna, you're never gonna beat personal intimacy, whether it's playing a show or meeting people for experience. So I think the people who are going to be able to blend a real sense of community around their work. are great. That said, Burial and a lot of artists are totally fine not existing. And that's the cool thing. I like that Deaf Punk got their Grammys with their masks. They sort of made their vision all the way to this the stage right that and and Kraftwerk got their thing I don't think the Grammys necessarily are an indicator of success I just like the fact that people are gonna be like okay this music was not considered important and now It wasn't considered real music, even as soon, the reason is like five or 10 years ago in this country. And I think it's cool that a generation is going to grow up and see that and go, Oh, this is just as plausible as playing guitar is making interesting electronic music is, uh, as a thing that said, I don't think the, the dreams of the past, the, the, um, the, uh, star rocket or the rocket ship success of the record industry really is. I think that may be, that may be over in some ways. I think, um, Brian, you know, another one, you know, ism is that like, maybe like whale, whale blubber was a business until it wasn't a business and then oil and, and, and other heat sources that you can contain and create were more important. And I think... maybe the record industry is traditional record industry is a sort of dream of the past, but like what we're creating in our own ways with the industry, the music heads and the fans right now is way more exciting, way more sustainable. So I liked that. We're actually kind of got beaten. It's got, it had its ass kicked. The dream got its ass kicked, but another dream came out of it. And I think that that's what I want. Our brand. to be pushing is for like a self-sustaining individualistic community, which I realize is a contradiction, but having your own ideas and having the strength and conviction to assemble and disseminate them on your own terms. is what techno is inherent fundamentally. So if that can become more achievable by more people internationally, that in itself is a success. And so I hope that we can be part of or continue to be part of that continuum. Bye.
