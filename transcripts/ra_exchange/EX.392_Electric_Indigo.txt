Thank you. One, two, three, four. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Alisa Stolman, and this week's exchange is with Electric Indigo. an Austrian DJ whose work spans and surpasses the limits of techno. She worked at Berlin's Hardwax record store in the 1990s, started her own label and toured for decades, but she's only recently announced the release of her first full-length album, which is coming out on Monolake's Imbalance Computer Music label in March. However, she's probably best known as the founder of Female Pressure, an international network of female, non-binary, and trans professionals in electronic music and digital arts. It has been a driving force in dance music's movement for gender equality since 1998, in which time much has changed for feminist activists. She recently came to the RA office in Berlin to discuss her perspective on the changing landscape of social justice in electronic music and the evolution of her own career. You can find the full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at RA-Exchange. The exchange with Electric Indigo is up next. Bye. Bye. We're recording in Berlin today as you're in town because you played at Berghain this past weekend. So looking at your schedule, it seems like you play here in Berlin more often even than in your hometown, which is Vienna, right? Absolutely, yeah. It has been like that for many years and Berlin actually is kind of my second home for sure, yeah. Yes, I do think of you as someone who helped to create the techno or dance music industry in Berlin, or at least played a significant role in that. Thank you for saying that. Is it because of the time you spent here in the 90s? that you think you still have a lot of connections here in Berlin, even over Vienna? Absolutely. I'm totally sure that this is the case. My time in Berlin when I lived here and particularly working for Hardweg's record store from 93 to 96. totally coined me and really coined like my socialization in the techno scene or in the electronic music scene. In that time, I learned a lot and also my attitude got solid then and was very much influenced by the viewpoints that I learned from my colleagues at Hardwax. I'm very sure about that, that this was extremely important for me this time. And I don't know if I was able to somehow influence the scene here. In Berlin, maybe not that much, but it's more the other way around, I think. In what ways did it influence your attitudes or viewpoints? Well, in the way, for example, like what a good club should feel like. The PA, the sound, is the most important thing in the club and not the fancy... furniture, for example, or that it is, for me, it is just like I feel at home in adapted industrial places or adapted rough places, for example. Or like how important it is to try things out, to experiment with venues, actually. That there are possibilities, even if maybe limited to a certain period of time, but that it is important for young or creative people. people to have space where they can experiment and try out things, stuff like this. Were there particular clubs in Berlin or even in Germany in general that were particularly influential for you in that way? For sure. There was, for example, this small club called Elektro. in Berlin and certainly also places like Tresor or even Bunker. I don't know if you're aware of that. Well, now it is. It's now Samlong Boros, an art space. I don't even know. But is it that like private? millionaires art space? So it's owned by the Boros family who built their own apartment on the top of the bunker and then now that you can do a two hour walking tour through their art collection which is a privately owned collection that they rotate out, I think it's every two years, but it's actually, it's pretty amazing. Yeah, what a history of that place, right? Other places in Germany that were very influential, certainly Ultraschall in Munich and its predecessor, the... ultra world parties at Kulturstation which is was actually these people like Upstart and the Disco B crew and DJ Hell they were the first ones who ever booked me as a techno DJ so I'm still very thankful for that and so the the guys in Munich were also very important to me So then moving to Berlin and to work at Hardwax gives you sort of a built-in network when you get here. Yeah. So what kind of people were in that network at the time and what doors did that open for you? The people were activists, artists. from the scene. So a lot of the DJs, not only from Berlin, but also internationally, because everybody like came to Hardwax to buy records. It was like the best source of records. And you must imagine that 25 or 30 years ago, the distribution of records worked. very differently from how it does nowadays. In my case, I could notice that a lot of the records that were really hot, they didn't ever come to Vienna. And if they did, maybe one or two copies one year later, then they were available at Hardwax record store. And this was the case for many people. So everyone who traveled through, who came to Berlin, who was a DJ, kind of had to come to Hard Rakes too, because otherwise it... would be like a big chance missed out, you know. What was it like to come to Hardwax between 1993 and 1996? And what was it like to work there? I actually wrote an article for Groove. some years ago about that, like a description how it was to work at Hardwix. It was quite intense, especially on Fridays and Saturdays, because particularly on Fridays, it was fun because Friday was the day a lot of deliveries came into the store. The new stuff that everybody was really keen to have arrived. And the store was totally packed. It was at a different location at that time, also in Kreuzberg, but a much smaller store. It was completely packed. And behind the counter, there was usually DJ Rock unpacking the parcels. Everyone watched, tried to see what he is like taking out of the parcel. And then he would put on the records and on the open speakers in the store and he would skip through the records and he would say like his verdict pretty much within, I don't know, at least maximum 30 seconds. he would say words like brett, which means board, wooden board. And that was like slang used for really heavy, hot tunes that are a total burner on the floor. And as soon as he said something like brett, All the hands would rise, would go up in the air like everybody wanted to have the record. And usually these records first came only into like one to three copies, because a lot of times these were sort of like tests whether, you know, we could sell it in the store or not. So when it was a very good one, there were not many copies available and only like the privileged. Very important customers would get them. And very regular customers, important DJs, had their little slot in the backside of the desk. It was super hard to get one of these like bread records. And then, for example, me as a customer, when I didn't work there yet, I developed like a quite useful strategy. I was not concentrating on rock. trying to make eye contact with like the main buyer seller there, but with another one who other people did not pay potentially so much attention to, James. So I tried to establish a good relationship with James through eye contact. And then I got really lucky. a lot of times that a very popular record where very few copies were available this like unknown DJ from Vienna could buy. That was really fun, you know. So it was like maybe one can imagine, I don't know, a thrilling auction or something, except that, you know, you would not bid. But everything else, it was really like exciting to be there. And you had no other chance to listen to the... to the newest stuff then there after the unpacking and later when I worked there of course I had there were some there was another possibility to listen very early to some records not to every but to to some key records over the phone Of course, that's a very limited quality and it's very hard to judge a record after listening for a few seconds over the phone speaker. But there was no other way. So either like shipping the actual physical record or the distribution company would play something on the turntable there and you would listen to it on the phone and then say, okay, buy 20 or no, I'll try three copies at first only. see and maybe we order later more. So was your primary position there as a buyer or did you also work behind the counter? What were your duties? The first duty, as I said, was this holiday replacement. I was just packing parcels and I'm really good at packing parcels. They become very neat and I have a real talent for that. I can do very pretty birthday presents, for example. Anyhow, so I proved myself doing these mail order packages. And then I started to work behind the counter and sold records. After a while, I proceeded and I became responsible. I was buying all the European distributors and labels. So I was lucky. I could, for example, buy the whole backstock. from Seco Records, stuff like that. So that was great. And Hardwax is a big store, a very highly specialized store with the means to create or also the aim to create a great backstock of great records. This position was somehow grand. I didn't have to think of every single penny, but I could say, "Okay, if we don't sell it now, this record is good. We will sell it in five years." And that's some sort of extreme luxury for a record store, I think. So not many stores were able to work in this kind of way, foreseeing into the future. I do have one other, I would like to introduce a theme here that we'll come back to, but maybe other listeners are wondering too. if you were the first woman to work at Hardwax? No, I wasn't. Because Hardwax existed... Since 89. And I started to work there in 93. So there are at least like two years that I didn't know Hardwax. So I don't know. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that Mark Ernesto's wife, Etsko, she worked there probably from the beginning. And she was not very often seen from a customer's point of view. But she did all the US house labels buying. So she is a total expert in US house and garage and disco. During my time, there was always at school and then either almost at the same time or a little bit later only. came Mo, who is now my booking agent, Mo Loschelder, who also runs Ren Electro. Really? Yeah. So she was my colleague there. And then came Cora S., who also was a DJ. I think she might still be a DJ. She worked there. Maybe she started when I stopped working there. So I was not the only woman. No. I did want to get a little of your background before Berlin as well. So you were living in Vienna before you moved to Berlin to work at Hard Rock. And if you had already at that time been asked to host DJ Hell at your apartment, I'm gathering that you were already involved in the music scene in Vienna. So can you tell me a little about your involvement pre-Berlin in the Austrian music scene? I started to DJ in 89 and I started as a funk, soul, jazz, hip-hop DJ. So I was... kind of rooted in the so-called black music scene in Vienna. There was also a record store, Black Market, where I bought a lot of my records. There was a club, a Monday evening club called Soul Seduction, where I liked to go to... And when I started as a DJ, I started in a small bar that had like two turntables, belt-driven turntables, so no proper mixing DJ equipment. And this bar was frequented. mostly by artists or art students and that was pretty much my background, my social background. I also did not really study but I was at the Academy of Applied Arts. for maybe half a year or so, and then I decided it was not the right thing for me. But most of my friends were actually art students, so the whole art scene in Vienna, or fine art scene, was somehow my background there. Then I started to slowly incorporate more electronic tracks and... Nobody of the people who were hosting me before, like that small bar or some occasional other parties, none of them liked it. I was also working for the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation. I did radio features, actually also about fine art. But then I started to also do something about electronic music. I think I was a legendary interview of 91 of Underground Resistance with three original members with Mike Banks and Jeff Mills and Robert Hood. And that was for the program D-Music Box? Yes. Music Box was absolutely legendary. And pretty much anyone who is somehow doing something in culture or media and maybe of the age of 40 plus has worked. The music box is quite funny. It's a long running program as well, right? It was a long running program, right. Since the 60s or so. I think so, yes. So did you also consider yourself through your work for the radio show somewhat of a journalist as well at that time? No, I was just trying things. I was never like imagining, sorry for weird English here or weird pronunciation, that I would become a journalist or a proper journalist. I was just, you know, trying this a little bit and that a little bit, study here a bit and there a bit. I have a quite wide range of. I started studies that I never finished with quite a wide range of interests that I pursued a little bit but never got really like totally deep into. And the radio work was amongst it. But I can vividly remember, for example. cutting interviews on real-to-real tape. And that is some kind of occupation that, you know, rings a bell when I do, for example, granular synthesis now. I know that sounds a bit like far off, but for me it isn't. So there is some sort of like threat or... The theme that goes through a lot of seemingly extremely diverse occupations that I had. Anyhow, nobody in Vienna liked my new passion for electronic music. And that was another reason why I knew it was time to go somewhere else or see some other like... look for some other possibilities where... people share my interest. In Vienna at that time a lot of people thought techno was German fascist music for example even though you know they were like the the first DJ who was also working at that already mentioned black market record store in Vienna DJ Gebel he was the first one to introduce me to DJ Rush and Underground Resistance. So there were some people in Vienna who knew exactly what was coming, but a lot of other people had really, like, they kind of hated that sound. It was too machine-like or something for them. So it sounds like 1993 then was a breakthrough year for you, not only in following your fate and moving to Berlin or going with the flow and moving to Berlin. It was also the year you started to release your own music. Right. So in 1993, Skyway, No Headroom came out on Experimental. So by that point, how long had you been making music? How did you start making your own music? Was it always techno? Yes, definitely. It was always techno. And I did make some earlier attempts. I think I can't even remember properly, but I... In Vienna, and for a very long time, I didn't have my own equipment. So I was for quite many years always working with other producers in their studios. And I did have some experiences comparable to this with other people in Vienna before that, but that didn't lead to... anything and yeah that experimental record I made with Patrick Pulsinger and Adam Tunakan and They had the 909 and the 303 that I used on this record. And the whole thing came about because I DJed at Limelight. In New York? In New York, yeah. And I stayed there for a couple of weeks. And at the same time... Patrick Pulsinger and another Viennese techno producer from back in the days, Helmut Wolfgruber, they were staying, I think, for several months, maybe three months or so in New York. So I was staying with them. For a week or two and we were, they already got friends with Ape2Key and so we were just hanging around Limelight and the... I don't know. Are you familiar with Brand X? No. No. Brand X was a techno facts magazine by DJ Moneypenny, who is another woman in the scene from very early times. And Moneypenny was not only a DJ, but she was kind of a journalist and she ran this weird format of a fax magazine. In the early 90s, we used fax machines. Not very popular anymore, unfortunately, because I kind of like it. I sometimes think it's a safe form of communication compared to email or phone calls. So you mean that by fax magazine, she would send, you would have it printed out and faxed wherever you are? Yeah. Okay. So she sat in her office and she compiled articles. She wrote articles about, also a lot about Chicago and Detroit and New York techno and house scene. Also in her office, you would meet people like that's where I met Josh Wink, for example. They would just like sit there or Damon Wilde. And Damon Wilde, I also met him there in this like limelight palladium cloud because the office. I think both of Moneypenny and Limelight was in the basement below Palladium Club. So I went there with Patrick Pulsinger and Abe Duque and we met Moneypenny and we met Damon Wilde and Josh Wink and you would just run into them there in this like really small basement office and so she was compiling her articles. And then she would fax it to a fax list. And everybody who subscribed the magazine would get it regularly as a fax. Well, I did want to talk about the years after you first were in Berlin, because there were some particularly interesting developments in your life and career at that time. I'm referring, of course, to founding the network Female Pressure in 1998. Can you tell me what Female Pressure is or what it was at the time? In 1998, it has been already like nine years that I was a DJ back then. And I already had been touring a lot since 93. So there are like five years of touring as a DJ. And during all these years, I experienced just too many times that people were surprised or astonished. Or they didn't, they were ignorant about the fact that there are female DJs or female artists. So I had a lot of comments and some were like, maybe even meant in a nice way, but still really annoying. Like for a woman, you're very good. And, you know, we all... You all know this stuff. But it was not only these comments and the ignorance, but it was also that my reaction usually was in the middle of the night, either before a DJ set or after a DJ set, to name a few of my female colleagues. Because a lot of times... People said, oh, there are so few and there is only you. And then they would come up with the most popular name at a specific time. So back in the days, that was maybe Marusha or a little bit later, it might have been Miss Kitten or Ellen Alien. Depending where you go, different name nowadays, maybe it's Nina Kravitz or, yeah, that changes over time and it changes depending on the geographic location you're at. but usually like forgot about so many others. And so I started to list names and then they were like, oh yeah, I didn't think of her. And oh yes, you're right. And ah, really? Of course, this list, this oral list was always like completely insufficient. First of all, because at 100 or 110 dB. It's like not the ideal opportunity to think and discuss. Second, late at night at 3 a.m., neither. Third, like trying to concentrate on the set or having like just played. Neither. So at some point I said, OK, I need to write this down and I need to collect names. And it was also becoming like since, I don't know, 95, it was becoming so clear that Internet is a media of the future. So I thought, okay, I need some reference. I need something I can refer these people to that they can access independently. from time and location. It became really clear that what is needed is a database with all these names and the database. because it needs to be searched. A list is insufficient somehow, because a list is extremely clumsy. But if you're looking for something specific, you need to be able to search for some criteria. Yeah, so that was the idea for an online database. And it started with, you know, collecting names and contact addresses. And in the first template I made for a new set of data, there is also still a fax number. In the template. That changed, of course. So at first you were manually collecting this all yourself or did you also work with other people? Of course I worked with other people. I was asking my friends like Esed Maria was in there from the beginning and some other people like Eva Casal, for example, from Berlin. I think Jennifer Cattini was also extremely early involved in female pressure. I was asking them, do you think it's a good idea to create this? And everyone said yes, because every single DJ I ever spoke to about this. made the same experiences with the comments and with the questions and with the ignorance. And maybe this has changed a little bit now. And so it's not so unusual anymore, but it certainly still was 20 years ago. And they helped me and they sent me some information. Yeah, I put everything together. And then it was the next difficulty was not only to collect data, but to create an online database. And that actually took some while until there was a first version. And that was just some guy from the IT community that I was somehow connected with at that time. But he was not so much into open source, so I did not have any access to any of the source code. And it was extremely clumsy. There was no way for me to administrate it directly. And there was no interface. So every time I wanted to... add like new data. I had to ask him if he could do this in his spare time. And he was, of course, not really like super into the project itself. So it was totally clear, okay, I need to collaborate with a woman. I want to have it open source. And yeah, I need an administrative interface, of course, so I can manage the content of the database. And that only was realized, I think, we were able to realize it in maybe 2000 or so, or maybe even a bit later. And my partner, the one who programmed the... The MySQL database is Andrea Meyer, and I was really happy that I met her and we were put in touch by some people from my Internet service provider at that time. So Andrea, she is an artist herself, not music making, but more like media art artist and open source expert. So she was really ideal in collaborating with me on the database itself. It sounds like at the beginning, female... pressure was founded as a response to questions from men to women. And that maybe at first there was then a narrow definition of who would be involved, who would be part of that response. So if they say, why aren't there more female techno DJs, then it would be female techno DJs involved in female pressure. It was not limited. to techno but electronic music and it was not only djs uh but also producers of course djs and producers and visual artists from the beginning okay because like the the whole visual part for me is has been like absolutely important from the beginning of electronic music and club culture as I know it and as you know I saw it or learned it in Berlin for example so not only like the VJ thing in the club but also the flyers and the graphic design and the cover artwork etc so Visual artists have been part from day zero of female pressure. Okay, yes. I ask because I know that now female pressure is not limited to DJs and producers or even just dance music. But I guess electronic music is a more general term anyway. And that was also from the beginning because I was, for example, really eager to include Olga Neuwirth just to make this very clear that it's not only about dance music, but electronic music in general. And Olga Neuwirth is the female Austrian composer of... contemporary, not classical, but neue Musik, new music. So the composer thing also was a very early part of female pressure. What is female pressure today? How has it developed? How many women are involved or listed? Listed at the moment, I think it's 2,150 approximately. from 74 countries so it's quite widespread geographically but three quarters of the listed artists live in Europe so it's very European centered. Then the next biggest part, if I remember correctly, maybe about almost 20% is North America. So you see the Northern Hemisphere is totally overrepresented, or let's say the Western world as well. And I guess that comes from the history of the whole thing being connected. to me or to me and a few founding members. It's like a slow but steady growth. And I think that has to do that there is individual contact with every member listed. or every artist listed in the database. And as the usual procedure is like that somebody has to send like a short email saying like, I want to become a member. or I want to be listed in the database. And I answered this email with like a relatively long explanation of what female pressure is, because a lot of times there have been misunderstandings. For example, artists think or expect... that female pressure is a booking agency. And once they are a member, they will get regular bookings. That's what they expect. And of course, it isn't. That's not my job. I'm not finding gigs for 2,200 artists all over the place. So I explain what female pressure is and what it is not. And then I ask a set of questions. So it's like question, what is your artist name? I don't know what name do you want to be listed? Or do you want to have your email address accessible through the entry or WhatsApp? So I set up the entry in the database and then I send login information. So there needs to be initial communication. And that's very different to social media, for example, where you can create your own login and you're responsible for... your profile alone and you never like communicate with a real person and I think this like individual communication or personal communication is is one of the reasons why the growth is not as fast as it maybe could be I don't know There are actually a lot of people who never answered this long email that I first sent. Yeah. Female pressure was founded with a specific purpose in 1998. I'm wondering how that may have changed. that purpose probably remains the same, but that there are more purposes to female pressure now and more functions to it. So what do you see now as the overarching goals or purposes of the network? I think the... female pressure is first and foremost a tool that can be used in quite a lot of different ways. So it's a tool for representation in the sense or for raising visibility in the sense to fight the ignorance that I mentioned before. But it is also a tool to realize special projects, special projects that emerge usually through discussions on our mailing list where only members are subscribed. Good examples are... The fact survey that we realized three times already, where we analyze gender quota on festival lineups. Another example would be the compilation we did for the women of Rojava in Syria. Another example would be the Tumblr from that anti- made in 2015, where she collected photos of women in their, female identifying people in their studios, because apparently there is, people are having a hard time imagining women with electronic equipment. So yeah, there are several special projects that we were able to realize. And all these special projects are represented on the website by these little round logos that you can find. activities became more frequent or have become more frequent since 2013 when we did the first fact survey that had quite a big media impact and actually still has some. resonance. Yeah. The first facts survey seemed to me like a clear moment when female pressure started to engage in activism. When I would consider what it was before, its use as a database was in organizing. Can you first just describe what the FACS survey is, how it started, and what the results have been? In 2013, there was a similar debate to the MeToo hashtag in the German-speaking countries. My memory fails at the moment. So I can't remember the hashtag, but it was a German journalist who really got fed up with sexual assault. And there was also like a politician who was molested by another politician in Germany. So this huge wave, very similar to Me Too, emerged in 2013 in Germany and Austria and I think also Switzerland. So women kind of publicly confessed or reported that they were victims of... sexual assault. And in the course of this huge debate in the beginning of 2013, I think it was Gudrun Gut who first... asked, should we as female pressure react to that? Or she was asking about, you know, we had a mailing list discussion about sexism in the industry, basically. And so it moved a bit away from that theme of sexual harassment to a more general sexism debate. We repeatedly had discussions like on the mailing list, which you can... which is like a closed circle, even though there are like 1,000, almost 1,000 subscribers, but it's still, it's like only the female pressure members are subscribed. There was repeatedly a discussion like, oh, again, at this festival, there's only two female artists booked or so. So this kind of, these kind of... topics merged here in the beginning of 2013. And then if I remember correctly, I was the one who said, well, how many... many are there really like when when someone complained oh again and they never book enough females etc and I was like what are the actual numbers and nobody knew and I said okay I think it will be interesting to really have some concrete numbers and to know what we are talking about and to know what we are complaining about. and emails flooded in, and then we needed to think of a way how to process them. And so we created, like a colleague of ours created the WordPress that we are still using. So the first one, the first factory was just, you know, listing. the data, unverified data that was sent in, like festival name. number of female acts, number of male acts, number of mixed acts, and the link to the festival, I think. So this can still be found online. And then for International Women's Day 2013, we added up all the numbers and figured out the percentages and the averages. made some graphic design for it and presented it, released it together with this press release that has been written in, I think, nine different languages, which also represents the many voices of female pressure. So we released this press release and the numbers on 8th of March 2013. What were the results? I think the results were in general that 10% is already above average. If you also count the all-female festivals in. If you leave them out to just, you know, to only count normal festivals under parentheses, it was like 9% or something. And this has definitely changed. But you must see it's not like a scientific. but it was rather like a very chaotic grassroots activism. And the latest survey that we did in 2017 is definitely the most reliable and the most professional and also the most comprehensive. one. We counted, I think, almost 220 festival editions of two and a half years. And we found out that the percentages changed. And we could also, since we've been doing it since 2013, we could also have a look over the years and compare. We have some festivals, I think five festivals, where we counted the lineups from five consecutive years and we could see how the... percentage, the quota evolved or percentages of female acts. So you noticed with particular festivals that after the FACTS survey started to be published in 2013, that specific festival started to book more female and female identified acts? Yes, we could notice that. In particular, and with certainty, we know that this was the case for CTM Festival. With other festivals, we don't have internal confirmation, so to say. You mean that CTM told you, because of your survey, we made this a priority? Yes. Okay. I have definitely... I've noticed over the past few years that this has become a bigger topic of conversation in general. I would like to present you with some of the backlash arguments or criticisms that I've heard of this, but not before I ask when you started to notice that these questions of sexism in electronic music started to become more frequent, happen among more people and so on, became more of a mainstream topic. Well, from my perspective, which is not objective, that was in 2013 with our first fact survey. But on the other hand, you know, it's interesting that... But during the discussion, also people were posting covers from not DJ Mag, but another like Accelerate magazine. Accelerator. Yeah, or something from the 90s. Accelerator would have been in the 90s. Saying like portraying, for example, Heather Hart. She was a DJ from New York that you might not know anymore nowadays. She was like the cover of that very popular magazine in the 1990s. The line said something like the future is female or something, you know. So there are always these, it's like there are these phases of when the topic becomes a bit more popular and then it disappears again. talk about other things and then it reappears with the same arguments with the same discussions but I think this time it seems to stay more and to be a bit more general and a bit more accepted in a way Or maybe simply more hip, so people can give themselves a progressive image or something. Right. So that's one of the backlash criticisms. People criticize DJs and producers who vocally support social justice or progressive politics. That they're using activism to give themselves an extra hook or a marketing edge over other DJs, which allows them, them being women and female identified people and people of color, to excel beyond what's justified for their skill, talent and experience. That's a quite unfair assumption. I wonder how that can be proved. A recurring statement that not only I made over the years, also like more than 20 years ago, was that every newcomer DJ needs to profile her or himself. So to somehow stand out of the gray mess. of newcomer artists in electronic music or newcomer DJs. And of course that I had, and I always said this clearly and without any like bad feelings. can also be an advantage to be female in a male-dominated field, of course, just because it's easier to remember that one female DJ when everybody else is male. So there always have been some advantages of having some. trait that others don't have you know but this assumption that people speak out for social justice just to become more famous or more popular I think it's just unfair and it's not right because At the same time, like a lot of other unpleasant effects exist, for example, in the realms of new music, of classical music, there is this famous international summer courses of new music you might have heard of in Darmstadt. And they were founded after World War II by composers like Pierre Boulez and John Cage and Karl-Heinz Stockhausen. So the really big names of serious contemporary music. The summer courses have an excellent archive, and this archive is, since two years ago, in the process of being digitized. And there is a relatively young female composer involved in this archival work. She's a great composer. Her name is Ashley Feuer. And Ashley Fuhrer initiated a movement, one can almost say, called Gender Relations in New Music. Ashley Fuhrer presented her findings from going through the archive. from analyzing the archive that contains like photographies, scores, little notes from what has been worked there in Darmstadt over 70 years. And she presented numbers. She did something similar like FEMA Pressure did with the festival lineups. And Nan was also confronted with the troubles she was afraid to get into by doing this, by doing something that is not her actual work, which is composing music, but by going on this kind of meta level and analyzing the conditions under which she... And all the other composers work. And she was actually warned, she said, by her colleagues. And they said, like, you don't want to be that girl. And that is like the typical role of the feminist. That is not. usually, or many times, or has been at least in the past, many times, not the role of the most popular girl. You know, the most popular woman is the woman who is, of course, very talented, but also good looking. sexy and attractive and plays along the usual lines. So to nowadays claim that being openly feminist is certainly only an asset is simply wrong. It's not true. I think, you know, we are still not in a world of equal rights. We have not arrived there. And I think it can be maybe in certain circles you will have a good image if you out yourself as a feminist. But on a general level, I think it's hard to tell if it's an advantage or maybe rather a disadvantage. I know a lot of artists, for example, or not a lot, but I know some artists who don't want to be affiliated with female pressure. And I have the feeling that it is. Also because they don't want to be associated with feminism. Or they, you know, they're saying like, I have my own connections and I do it, I'd rather do it my own way. So to show solidarity and to openly state. or call for social justice is certainly hip with some people, but it's definitely, especially in our political climate of repression or... backlash to right-wing conservative values, it's certainly not a general advantage. And I think it's quite short-sighted or dumb to state this or to say it. A lot of these criticisms that I hear do seem to set up a quote-unquote right way for someone to promote themselves, which is something that the speaker made up that no one really agreed on. There's not an official right way to promote yourself and make it as a DJ. And so then this standard that the speaker made up is then used against specific people, which are invariably women, female-identified people, and people of color. to show why they are doing it the wrong way and why they do not deserve what they're asking for, which is a seat at the table. the opportunity to play whatever festival, just like everyone else, or depending on your outlook, equal opportunity or equal outcome, depending on your view. I do wonder, though, when you told me about the composer who was told not to be that girl, if you perceived in your own career... that your association with female pressure ever overshadowed? Like, were you known more as the woman who founded female pressure than Electric Indigo DJ and producer? To a certain extent, certainly yes. And there were like several times during my career when I thought, oh no, not again, a female pressure interview. I also want some interviews that are about my work as a musician. I'm never, you know, if I were afraid of like a backlash that could occur to me because of feminist work. I wouldn't do what I've been doing for so long. You know, I don't care. I only know of one concrete case where someone involved into the organization told me it's kind of impossible to get your booking there because they say... There's feminist female pressure. So there's only one where I know it has been a disadvantage for me. Only one case. And this has been resolved. But I suspect or I think that could be, yes, of course, you know, I'm more sympathetic to some people than I am to other people. But in general, I think this goes for every kind of profile that you have. You know, you're more, you're rather, you cannot be friends with everyone in the scene. It doesn't make sense either. So I'm rather surrounded by people who share similar values than by people who oppose them and think they're pure sexists. Of course not. I don't want to be booked at the sexist festival. I'd like to talk a little about your new album, which is also perhaps the occasion of this interview, why we're doing it now and not three years ago or whenever at any other time. So can you tell me about the album? When it's coming out, how you worked on it, what was your process or concepts that informed it and so on. Yeah, the album has actually a very long story. And it's my first solo album. And that comes at an extremely late point in my career. I'm aware of that. We finally have a release date. The official release date is 16th of March 2018. And it's coming out on Imbalance Computer Music. And I'm quite happy about this label because I think it really fits the music itself. The material I used for this album has been... evolved or has been evolving or I developed the material over I would say the past six years or so. So a lot of past projects went into into the album and even though I'm not releasing a lot I make a lot of music that usually does not come out that is performed as concerts and I started with this concert thing in the avant-garde new music scene about 15 years ago already and slowly like step by step got more active in this scene as well and so some of these concert projects particular one from 2012 called Schiffre and another one called Barry Duffman that was presented at Wien Modern, a festival for new music in Vienna and some other past projects also like Morpheme. parts of these sounds and in some cases even like two tracks or one track are now part of the album so it's like a view on my preferred technique of processing specific samples and that's the kind of work that I started to create for that Schifr project in 2012 when I had a very conceptual approach to the piece and I used the basic raw material for it where numbers, the recordings of people counting. from 0 to 20 and I use then from 0 to 15 only and I made a call on my on Facebook and on the mailing list please send me recordings of you counting from 0 to 20 in your mother tongue or in a dialect that you're very familiar with. And I got a lot of different recordings in very different qualities. And that was the basic, only basic raw material for that piece. And this is when I started with... granular synthesis and the processing of material that is not musical in a narrow sense and make music out of that. Can you describe the process of granular synthesis and how you used it? Yeah, that could take another like five hours if we go into depth. But basically granular synthesis, well, I recommend looking it up. There are very good Wikipedia articles about it as well. But you take like very short samples of audio material. which are called grains. Typically, well, there is a quite relatively large range, but let's say typically they're about like... 50 milliseconds or 150 milliseconds. So you can't really recognize the one grain. But granular synthesis divides audio samples in very small parts called grains. rearranges them to create some other musical content or sound. So it's a sort of sound synthesis that has been developed. predominantly during the 1980s and refined since then. And it's very much bound to the digital domain. It has been done before or comparable things in the analog domain using tapes and splicing tapes into super short bits. pasting them together to create some completely different sound. But nowadays and the important developments have all been connected with computers and computer's capacities. So I use my favorite synthesizer for granular synthesis. It's actually a free Max for Life device called Granulator created by Robert Henke, who is also the owner of the label where the album comes out. So I think that, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And there is like a circle closed. Yes, full circle. So as a final question, then, the album title is 5-1-1-5-9-3. Is that related to the process of granular synthesis and the raw material of the people counting? Not at all. But of course, well, not really. Let's say not really. The title, I had difficulties with the title because there is, you know, I don't want to convey messages. That's not my thing. There is a lot of attitude in my music and there is a lot of attitude in my artistic. work or identity but it's not it cannot be boiled down to a simple short message and album title I thought actually I really don't care what the album title is because there is no like message I want to tell. But on the other side, I always like numbers. That's also why I start to create databases and long lists because I'm into systematic things and I can also remember numbers very easily. So I like numbers. And Robert and I were thinking about what could be a title and I made some lame suggestions. And then we thought maybe it should just be a random number. And we went to this random number generator. And actually the first results, the first result was 911963. Am I correct? Yeah. 563. That's the story behind it. It's a random title and that is because I don't think album titles... Well, it's important that the album has a title, but what it says is not important, in particular in my case. It's not important. you
