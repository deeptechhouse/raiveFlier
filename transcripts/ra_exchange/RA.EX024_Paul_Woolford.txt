you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Ryan Keeling and I'm an editor at Resident Advisor. Paul Wolford's been at the forefront of the UK's house and techno scene for a decade. Growing up, Pirate Radio was massively influential in his listening habits. Before he got his break around the turn of the century as a resident DJ at legendary club night... basics in his hometown of Leeds. Walford went on to establish a lasting relationship with Ralph Lawson's 2020 Vision label, an imprint that first released his hit Erotic Discourse. But it's perhaps a beater, and more specifically his residency at We Love Sundays at Space, that Walford is most readily associated. And as we sat down in Berlin before his gig at Berghain that evening, Walford enthused about being part of Planet E's 20th anniversary tour, we discussed what this latest affiliation would mean for Walford, who has often wrestled with the at times negative way in which the scene is perceived in. I think one of the first things I wanted to ask you, I've read that radio was quite a big thing for you growing up. for sure. I just wondered if you could tell us about that a little bit. The radio has probably been the most influential thing in a lot of ways. Certainly my first contact with music was hearing the radio in the kitchen, in my parents' kitchen. Were there any particular stations that we're talking about here? Radio Air in Leeds. Oh really? Yeah. And in a lot of ways, Radio Air was my first part of call with dance music because there was a guy that had a show on Saturday evenings between 6 and 8. and he was playing it was called the soul show but soul music it was at that time it was kind of what what you would regard as soul music but it was also the very early bits of house music that was starting to hit the radio okay and when you say at that time what sort of uh year are we talking about i mean to name the year i can probably name some of the records from about that time and we're talking about Things like 'Jack Your Body' were starting to happen and at the same time we did mix that up with like Donna Allen records and records produced by like Jammin' Lewis. You know, this kind of really smooth type of idea, 80s idea, late 80s idea of soul music. And then he'd have this section called the Soul Muse, which was a 15-minute section read out by a guy called Sheldon Lazarus. And this guy... I have to name him because he really helped me out. What I found out later was that he was reading out the news from Record Mirror at the time. He'd talk about, you know, like a new artist that... that had a record coming out on Cold Chilling or something like that, you know, Marley Marles label. And then he'd go on to something that was coming out on A&M. He'd talk about Janet Jackson remixes. He'd talk about, you know, S-Express being in the charts, what they might be remixing next. But it was on top of a record I didn't know. Where did you get that version from? What is this? And that was what the idea of the Megamix was really the reason why I became a DJ in a lot of ways because it blew me away to hear these mixes. And slowly I found out they were being put together by people at DMC. I found out what Mixmag was and found out... Before I bought an issue of Mixmag, there was something called Mixmag Update, which was in the record stores in Leeds. It was 30 pence. I still have a binder full of these things. folded it out into this big chart, you know, it's got the main dance chart in the middle with a load of adverts and then the rest of it was just like absolute train spotter heaven, it's just you know, I can't tell you how influential that was and it was every week and every week I just couldn't wait to get it and pour over the listings and the reviews and reading this is another thing that's the combination of reading reviews of records that I didn't know and the description of the records was absolutely just blew my mind because I'm thinking what does that sound like and there's a handful of journalists from that time that really really really opened my mind up James Hamilton was one from Record Mirror and the other guy is Chris Needs who Chris Needs is I bow down to Chris Needs as a music journalist because he was the first person I read talking about records on D-Jaxx upbeats, records by people like Steve Poindexter. He uses really colourful language. He's renowned for it as well. And it's, you know, it's quite humorous as well. Here's a good example. He'd say something like, yeah, deep as a bison's stiffy and things like this. And you think, what is this guy on? And you hear the record and you know it'd be this really, really grinding kind of semi-industrial record on brown vinyl that's come out of the Netherlands and you think, alright, I know what... I don't know what it means. I mean, could you actually attach yourself to any certain style at that time? Or was it very much like... Well, it was, as it still is now, I mean, my radar is vast, really. I'm kind of open to a lot. Basically, it's anything that really is of high quality. I'm kind of out of an interest in, but that's... that's subjective but yeah I guess it went from you know the commercial you know obviously and things like inner city that when the inner city records came out and became hits that was that was a that was a huge thing because I could hear that you know that's That's definitely one of the biggest seeds for what I do now is those inner city records because they're the background of techno and the aggression in there and the bite of techno but yet the soulfulness. as well from house music and from soul music as well and um so it would be from you know and also the um jam and lewis um massively the production of jam and lewis kind of shaped shaped a lot of my teenage years because it was almost like the default soundtrack in the background so many of their records were on the radio you know and Janet Jackson especially like their work with Janet Jackson and then it would go through to you know as I was buying obscure records from from reviews that I've read that I've read in Mixmag update I'd go and buy new groove records But you know, at that point it was like, well this record costs double the price. of a UK 12-inch, which at that age, you know, it's like, this is six pounds, five, six pounds for one record is a lot of money, you know, and that was, so I'd take a gamble based on reading a review, and then, you know, sometimes you don't quite get it right, but when you, you know, I remember the first few imports I bought, in fact, the first import, I'll tell you what it was. It was a Frankie Bones thing. It was Bones Breaks 7 or 8. And it was as much for the quantity because he had eight different tracks and they were all, it was made up of sections of other people's records. Like there was one of them sampled Landlord, I Like It, the old Rave track. And, you know, there was one of them sampled Mr. Fingers. But I felt like I was getting like... the best of all of it and condensed you know because I was like wow so I've only I've spent this much money but look how many tracks I've got but look what they are but then you delve deeper and you think but I've heard I've heard that riff on the radio I've heard it and then you find out what the original track is sampled are and then you go to the original tracks and the original tracks blow you away So that was it. And I started to buy, I mean, I'd started to buy records when I was eight, when my auntie gave me a record token. It was a Wham album. How embarrassing is that? That could be worse, I think. I mean, you read so many interviews with DJs and they're like, yeah, the first thing I bought was a toilet for hands. That's fucking bullshit. Come on. I can't make, it was wow. Was there any representation of these sounds in the clubs in Leeds at that time? Well, if there was, I didn't know about it. The only thing that they used to speak about on Radio Air was Thursday night in a club called Mr Craig's and I know that there was... bits of bits of it creeping in there but then as I was buying more records I was buying them from Jumbo Records which is where I still buy records from to this day and you know respect to them for staying afloat but also Crash Records and Crash was the shot that just, I mean, it became my religion. And that was where I got the Bones Breaks thing from. And then a few, I think it was around that time. Warp opened up and on the same day I bought Forge Masters track with their name and Nightmares and Wax Dextrous which were the first two and those Purple Sleeves and the way the records sounded, the way in the bass and the way the sleeves are, getting those home is game over. Absolutely game over. It was just like, what the fuck is this? This is it. This is what I want to do. What was that point? What was like, you know, I can't just listen to this music anymore, you know, I need to participate in this somehow? Well, I mean, you know, simultaneously, I'd been kind of playing keyboards and my dad had been playing like this, not a church organ, but an organ with two keyboards. and a set of pedals and so I'd been kind of like delving into that and then I had like a home keyboard and this keyboard that I had basically I'd play you know like when the Saints go marching in and all of that and then once I'd done all of that there'd be like these drum sounds at the end of the keyboard and I'd try and recreate you know the rhythms on the records that I had. using these like, you know, it's really basic home keyboards, like drum sounds and what I didn't realise I was doing at the time, I was actually teaching myself how to replicate and teaching myself how to program in a really raw, basic way. But I didn't know, I was just, all I was doing was emulating the things that were blowing me away. And then so gradually as I changed it. modeler keyboard and I got this Casio keyboard and it had a sampler on it unbelievably so Casio SK5 did you buy it for that specific reason or was it yeah okay yeah and it had these pads on it and and And then, you know, and it was crazy how it was set up because I'd have like this microphone plugged into it and then I'd have it like sellotape to my speaker and then I'd try it. So I'd be playing like, so many times the Forge Masters, the little staff from Forge Masters, I'd have the stereo on full and I'd press sample and then turn, slam the volume up. for one little sort of get the one riff on its own and then slam the volume down and then I play the little riff back on the keyboard and I'll be like oh wow and then I feel I'm like fucking hell I'm doing it this is it and you know And to this day, I actually think it's the same amount of, the same reward center in my brain, being able to do that, to actually replicate the sound you hear. trigger it I think it's the same I get the same pleasure from doing that as I make music now to replicate that just replicating the sound to trigger that sound is at the heart of it all and was that certainly what came first for you? yeah because you know I've never I couldn't go to nightclubs I was like 16 at that point 15? 16 you know and And also, I didn't, you know, I couldn't, it was, the whole idea of going to a nightclub was, God, that's the whole intimidating of the world. You know, I was slowly kind of buying more records, but I didn't really know, I didn't. The only context I had was that I love music and I was playing these keyboards. But still I didn't see a career. I couldn't see... There wasn't the age of... If you're a 16-year-old now, you open up a magazine or whatever, or you go on the web and you see that there's a career as a DJ. There wasn't that at that time. It wasn't, you know, you couldn't see anything like that. It was... Was that because these people just seemed so far off and, you know, so up on this cloud to you? Well, partly that, but also because the scene hadn't developed to, you know, the way it was beginning to develop. And then, you know, acid... You know, we'd all seen footage. on world in action of acid house i remember watching that world in action documentary with my parents and that you know i had like compilations with some of the records on there so i'm watching it with my dad and they go no my dad's going you can't be bloody going to all of that carry on son And I'm looking at it thinking, God, that looks really scary. But I didn't know the whole context of... all of the records that I owned and you know everything I'd kind of like heard on the radio from Radio Air from the Soul show and I have to say about Radio Air as well the guy that the guy whose show it was as well Carl Kingston I'll go back to this Megamix thing around that time when all the mega mixes were really, you know, it was blowing me away. I had like this stereo system, it was a double cassette, like a, you know, a tape to tape system. And Carl King. This is crazy. He did this competition on his show and it was a mega mix competition and the competition was to cram as many tracks into five minutes as you could. I entered this competition, it was crazy. Just to backtrack slightly, these things, they're layering up tracks in the beat matching sense that we know now with DJing. Was there much of a mix? Well, the mega mixes, God knows how they must have done it. All I knew was what I'd heard. Here's how crazy this was. All I understood was what I heard from the ones that were broadcast on the radio. And also, Jeff Young was the guy who had the equivalent of Pete Tong's show on Radio 1 at that time. Jeff Young would broadcast DMCs, Megamixes as well. So I was always scouring radio listings to see when Jeff Young's show was on. It was the Friday. and then I'd listen to Geoff Young on Friday, Carl Kingston on Radio Air on the Saturday, and I'd be pause button at the ready waiting for if they'd broadcast a megamix, and I'd record the thing every time. And Carl Kingston announced his competition. And I, madly, I put together this crazy mix. But it was sections of all the mega mixes that I had. And where, where, but, I didn't even, tons of the records, I didn't know what they were. And anyway, I mean, I got something crazy that I got about 50 odd tracks because they're all sections. Like literally it was like four bars here and eight there. But each time I'd use a section of another Megamix, I sent off this cassette. And so how did you put this together? On a tape to tape. Oh, okay. So using all the cassettes, recordings of other mecha mixes. Just compiling onto the second tape. Yeah, just doing it. you know and I sent off this mix and then I listed I didn't even know what half the records were but I just gave them titles the ones that I didn't know the ones that I did I wrote down what they were and a month later they announced it and I won And it was bonkers, it was crazy. And I still have the... They sent me some promo records. They sent me five records and they sent me this envelope that was done in like... It was like a baseball jacket with a little message from Carl on it. which blew me away. I was like, wow, Carl Kingston's wrote me a note. I've still got it. And it said, I'll tell you what it said. It said, Paul, and then inverted commas, my main man, said, keep up the great work and need any advice, drop us a line. Oh, you must have been set for that point then. Oh, completely. I mean, it sounds cheesy, but was that like a definite turning point for you? Oh, completely, yeah. Yeah, because, and as well for mum and dad, because they were like, they were like, wow, this is so good. You know, they were obviously, they were really pleased for me. There's so many of these points, there's so many things that I'll say that was it at, because there have been so many things that point you in different directions or, you know, that steer you off. But yeah, that was definitely a real key point, you know. But yeah, it was almost like, if you think about it, it was almost a cheat because I was actually using, now I realise it was actually stapling together other people's mixes, I mean, which is... I mean, that's classic collage, you know. You didn't know any better at the time, though, I guess. Completely, yeah. So when did it start to form into something like, you know, we might recognise now, you know, like turntables and clubs and production and that kind of thing? What was like... Well, after that, I think it was... the following Christmas that my dad got me some belt dryer, Kenwood belt dryer, turntables. But even then, I still kind of didn't really know what you could and couldn't do with them because I was trying to understand how people made records. And, you know, you'd see, like... you know, little snippets on telly of people in big studios with these big mixers. And I remember thinking in my mind, so when I'm playing a record or I'm playing it through a mixer, will I turn the fader down and the bass will come off? I was trying to understand. You couldn't go and just get the information like you can now. It was all trial and error. So eventually I got the turntables and started to get my head around it and understand what it was. But still I hadn't been to a club and I still you know, I didn't do it. There was no that's I had slowly building up, you know a record collection of really across the board and I met I met a guy from hanging around in this group of lads, he was buying a lot of records and he had a stereo, he worked in a garage actually and he had a stereo, like a mixtape that he'd done and I remember going in there to talk to him and he had this record came on and I said to him, what is that? What is that noise? It's making me just... What is that? And he had menthasm. I enjoyed that one. And it just sounds... so fucking otherworldly, absolutely mind-blowing record pieces. And so this guy called Richard Barber, he would lend me his records and he had loads of imports. He had things on Transmat and he had things on, he had like Dan Curtin records and all of these kind of things and very early, you know, basic channel stuff. And it was really quite extreme and to go from still being so into the commercial side as well. I'd always keep an eye on dance records that were in the charts, always, always. And at the same time, there's this underbelly of things. And wherever I remember going on, like, during the school holidays, we'd go as a family, we'd go on these, like, days out to Scarborough and Filey and places like that, and I'd always sneak off and find a record shop. And our price in Scarborough, remember buying Fod. tracks from Baby 4, the double pack on Rhythm King and getting that home and playing that because I knew Baby 4's name from Uchikuchi which had become a bit of a hit and I'd seen, you know, I'd read about that but then hearing the other tracks on there like crashing. and crashing in particular is a key record because that was a proper i mean you could play it now in a deep house so i'd sometimes play it from if i'm only not there's so many key records that kind of opened you know i would hear things in a certain way and and also as well at that time the majors were still kind of um they were still trusting it so they were investing in it so every now and and then you'd see Derek May would remix things from Majors. The Delight record that he mixed, wild times, and it was hearing his dub in Back to Basics when I was 17. It was like, fucking hell, this is, now I understand. the context of everything I've been doing, everything, everything's crystallised. We're going into that club and we're looking around and there's people there and there's this, I remember looking at the speakers hanging from the ceiling and thinking, alright, so people have come in and put those speakers there so we can dance to this and I'd have half the records but I was 17 years old. We had Ralph Lawson playing Merck records that I had, you know, about I was 17 and I was still intimidated and still, you know, just walking around on my own, you know, this kid on his own. And then going down, this is when Basics was a music factory, and then going into the basement. And hearing Huggy and Andy Weatherall was on, and Weatherall was playing, he was playing a Luke Slater track that came out of D-Jacks under the name Clementine. He was mixing it in, he mixed it out of Future, Future Will Survive, and then this Luke Slater track, and it was like... Badoom! Yeah. ♪ That was another moment but it was really like, you know, if I was going to play a record in here... could play my music in here this is this is the room I'd want to be in and what was basics like in those early days I mean was it well attended going off like yeah I mean the first night I went which was that night we queued up for an hour and a half um and there was still there was there must have been four or five hundred people behind us up the road the road it was it was People say, oh yeah, the club was roadblocked, but it fucking was. It was... I mean, it's certainly to, like, UK listeners, I think Basics is something that, yeah, sure, they'd be familiar with, but for people, like, maybe outside of the UK, like, how would you describe what Basics is about, like, certainly in those early days? It was... Well, you've got... At the same time, in the UK, there was the raves. thing was really happening which I was also into a lot of the music, I was also kind of into bits of hardcore as well but Basics was a real kind of a reaction against that so it was about dressing up but you know there was a load of clubs that were about dressing up that I nonsense music at that time in the UK I mean really bad really bad handbag you know and but what what happened was Basics came in with it and they were like right we want it we want everyone to be really smart but we want the music to be fucking mind-blowing you if you look at the people who played over the years you can't harvey was a resident um you know whether or was there and still to this day is there often slam was there um they gave doc martin his first uk gig uh you know murk i mean you name it you know and and in in the mid 90s I think in '96 they had one night when it was in a different venue, they had Goldie in the basement. Daft Punk in the main room doing this crazy live thing and I forget who else but I could just go on naming these amazing lineups for an hour, two hours. It was amazing and for that club to be on my doorstep I was like wow, wow, so this is how it can be. I remember leaving it that first night. I remember leaving it 2 in the morning because I had to get the night bus. But then thinking to myself, well, if I've been here, you know, because of course I was queuing up at 10 o'clock, so I was wet behind the ears. But I remember thinking, if I've been here till two, this is four hours in, the club goes till six, there's another four fucking hours. What the hell does it get like at five? What's it like at 5.45? So when was it starting to get more serious for you in terms of what you were doing? Surely this was the catalyst for that. Yeah. Well, and then basically I threw listening to, you know, all the time. This is, I mean, Pirate Radio and Leeds really started to thrive around that time. I mean, massively. Three stations that I listened to all the time was Dream FM, which was for anyone in the Yorkshire area, Dream FM from that time is a key, key part of Pirate Radio. And then there was another one that was, I probably... to a bit more that was coming from Bradford and it was called PCR. I put PCR on on a Saturday lunchtime and you would hear mentos of next to like Patty Derry rag. before my eyes next to like a like a soul to soul record you know and there were no rules at all and by that point it was every night I had the radio on pirate radio every night no matter what headphones on yeah that was it locked you know and And then through that I met a couple of people from Dream FM and there was a girl who had a show, a techno DJ called Tantra. And she became a really good friend. And she kind of, I was sending her like these little compositions. And she got in touch, she got back to me. And we became, you know, we started to hang out. And then she, you know, I didn't know at the time, she was going off and playing at European Rave with Jeff Mills. And she set up a label, a techno label called Blue Bay Seek. with a guy called Chris Gans. And it was, I think it was Chris was, Chris owned the label and Tantra was... kind of A&R in it and I so I'd sent I mean this is when I think I was 18, 19 at the time and I sent her these really they were really musical and layered but unfinished because I didn't have enough technology I had like a Korg M1 like workstation and I had like a couple of other bits of kit but not I didn't know anything about sync or MIDI. I just didn't know what I was doing but trying to find my way and trying to squeeze the most out of it in the way that, you know, misusing technology to make something. But she heard something in it that she... that she heard something in it. And she put me in touch with a guy called Jamie who had a studio, like a really basic studio, and he lived in Headingley near where she was. So I started to go and make some productions with Jamie. And the first track I did with him was... I mean it was banging, it was absolutely banging but I was like wow this guy's got a sampler and we can use this punchy 909 sound which that was like, I remember when I was talking about the Casio samplers always trying to sample a 909 snare And that was the sound I was always trying to capture. And then suddenly, a few years later, I was 19 years old and I was making a track with those sounds and it was like, right, let's bang it. And she got impressed. She got it cut and pressed and she was playing it. And then she put together this little roster of people on the label and it's mad. She got this card done and the other people on the label, Vince Watson was... another person who was on this label and I was like wow I'm on a label with this dominant techno and he's I mean Vince Watson to this day he blows me away his work just blows me away but what was happening the material that I'd recorded on my own it wasn't dance floor because I didn't have the wherewithal at home. So Tantor introduced me to this guy, a Swedish guy called Tony Senghor and at the time Tony was employed by a software company in Osset just outside Leeds and he was doing really well. He'd programmed a really successful computer game for them and they'd let him have the run of the building so he had 24 hour access and he was, I think Tony was younger than me, you know, so what happened was Sarah, that's Tantra's real name, she put me in touch with Tony and me and Tony just went. We were inseparable for two or three years and that was it. Basically the first night I met him, I went to meet him in Osset. My dad drove me over there and dropped me off outside this pub. And then six hours later we came out of the Team 17 building, the software company, six in the morning, we'd made a drum and bass. track and that was it and and basically and then we started going to basics together We started to party really hard and then all we were doing was we were partying and then I was turning him on to all his records which you hadn't heard and he was showing me how to make records. He's an incredible producer, he's so talented. The first record I had released was with Tony, it was on his label, it's called Anonym and it was just like the first track on the B-side and we'd sampled. this really strange, like, easy listening thing, but it was a really deep house track. And then we got signed to, there was a label called Glasgow Underground, deep house label, and they had an offshoot called Under the Counter, which was a bit more kind of, a bit more ballsy, really. And we did an album for Under the Counter. And this all went out as the whack daddy. That's right. Bye. That comes from, because we were sampling so much hip-hop, because, I mean, you know, I've always, always loved hip-hop, always been into it, and we were sampling. I mean, I think a lot of it was because we were partying so hard, we were just taking the piss. Yeah, I know. A lot of it. So, you know, it's not like now, you know, there's people who put out their first record and they're so considerate and they're still we were just like fuck that just get it out yeah yeah you know we kind of like we did some white what happened was we did these white labels and we were like well we should set up a label so we were like we didn't want to come up with all this clever label identity so we're using the the um the the language of hip-hop we could we were like taking the biscuit well let's just call it rubbish but effectively so let's call it whack so so that and then the second ep was called whack them out it was ridiculous you know but crazily i mean in in in basics that time we had uh i remember I think it was one of the first times I saw Derek Carter play and he played one of the Wack tracks and it smashed the club to bits. I remember looking at Tony and we're both pie-eyed and we're like... How are you describing the sound of the Wack Daddies? Well, not unlike a lot of the things that Derek might play now. You know, Derek, a sneak, it's Chicago house. heavily swung drums, samples, just raw, bassline driven. I would still play that track. It was called Satisfaction. I play it out now in the right environment. We cut up parts of Trial Call Quest. and a few other things. And then later on, Sneak did a track called I Dropped My Glow Stick on Magnetic and he sampled a little part of the beats on there, which was like, we were blown away. We were like, wow, that's really cool. Full respect to Sneak and Derek. And that was, from that moment, that was my fixation. you kind of Chicago thing. And I was still into techno and then we were having nights out at the Orbit in Morley, just outside the Leeds. But the harder, more abrasive I got, I was kind of cherry picking the records instead of buying a lot of it. So there's parts of Jeff Mills' things that I would buy, like Step to Enchantment, which blows me away and things like that. But there was... was a lot of when it got too hard I would kind of step away from it and so for the next few years the context of most of what I was, what drove me was a combination of the Chicago sound, bits of techno, and a little bit of what was going on in New York with Body and Soul. Okay. Which, and then that bit kind of took on, for home listening, I got so into that stuff, Joe Clossel and Ibbadan's Spiritual Life and some of the stuff on Wave, you know. That was like a whole other thing and in the background as well still into hardcore, you know, and then that was mutating, you know, Doc Scott Records like here comes the drums and that NHS EP which sampled Mentasm going back to there. Crazy being able to appreciate a record like Mentasm and then Joe Clore's Sales Mixer all loved out by Ten City which is with a piano solo and it's... So it's about 118 beats per minute. But, you know, to me, it all has the right place and the right context. There's no boundaries between it. I don't kind of, I don't have any inbuilt prejudices of like, I'm not going to do like that because it's too fucking aggressive or, you know, that's too, you know. And what was going on at Basics at that time? I mean, you mentioned like Derek Harter and Steve Weisberg. quintessentially Basics DJs. Completely. I mean, I think I've had the most amazing nights at Basics here in Derrick and Sneak and like I mentioned before, Weatherall and Dot Mar... as well I remember one night I had Alton Miller I think the booking policy at Basics kept kept me on my toes and kept kept me kept my mind opening because you'd hear you'd hear another DJ one week and you'd hear how they did it but I'd never be I think I think sometimes these days people people are so like to tie themselves into to the mass and go this is what this is what I'm into and and they kind they define themselves by that but I've never done that I'll hear someone whose music I'm not really into but I might hear something of the technique that I like and that may get sponged in and come later on there's no walls really I try not to be too I try to be open all the time that just comes you know if if music drives you to the core I think you can't can't not be influenced and you can't not you know be intrigued and inquisitive about what other people are doing I'm so nosy yeah So kind of leading on, what was the basics break for you then? Yeah, well I'd written a letter to Ralph Lawson with a mixtape in the late 90s. I know that he's still got the letter to this day but I'd like to read it. I imagine it's so very naive. It went from... kind of like you know I think I put some whale song or something on it at the start right through to Jeff Mills it was this mad cross-section of music eventually um this is in it when Basics was at the Mint Club Ralph called me up and he said look you know what do you want to do the first hour of my warm-up one night and um so yeah so I did that and and gradually slowly uh did that kind of more often, maybe once a month. And then I'd been doing that for, was it a couple of years? Yeah, it was 2001. But after, you know, gradually getting to know everyone and kind of, you know, becoming more familiar with everyone there, they put me on the flyer. And, yeah, you know, it was amazing getting to know everyone involved in the club, Dave, Ralph and Boggy and all of their extended crew and all these mad guys from Wakefield. And, you know, I was so naive and wet behind the ears and it was just good fun hanging out with this group of people that, you know, it didn't really give a... The Falcon just really had a great time and just went for it. And it was freeing for me to be around people like that because, you know, I'd spent my teenage years just living inside my head with music, you know, being really quite introverted and to suddenly be around people and it was just... fun it was a lot of fun it's quite a hedonistic place oh completely and that side of it as well you know hard partying you know um uh yeah which is it's kind of uh i think i think that's that's one of the things that over the years that that that's that opens you up and then and then it's depending on how much that becomes a figment of everything that can that can cause you problems or be to your benefit, depending on how much you're around it. Do you think it ever has caused you problems? Oh, it has, yeah, definitely, yeah. It happened with me and Tony, really, because we were, you know, we were just stuck in the love it all. I think we'd exhausted ourselves, we were tired, and we just parted ourselves out, and then Tony ended up, he moved back to... Sweden which kind of closed the chapter on that part of it but I mean we've been talking lately online on Twitter and all Facebook and stuff so it's going to be I'm looking forward to seeing him again hopefully at DMF in a couple of months but yeah you know we kind of we exhausted ourselves there and I also as well I mean I but I didn't I didn't see that for what it was and go alright look you know learn from I was just still immersed in being out every Saturday night and the carry-on and all the rest of it. It's part of the culture, but it can't be. that's not the aim of everything. The party isn't the aim. You know, for certainly, for my involvement, it's the music and the party is secondary to that if it's the right circumstance. And so, but I, you know, I was so caught up in it and admittedly, you know, I had an amazing time, but it was kind of like, you know, you can only... kind of take so much and also as well if you're quite a sensitive character anyway, if you're quite contemplative it's you know it's no way to be if you spend a lot of time thinking in your own head and introverted time and if you're trying to then extract something created from that then it doesn't help that you know you're tired all the time as things start to happen on the wider scale as I made more records and started to tour properly and professionally I started to get some distance from the club and from what were at the time my circle of friends and then I started to realise that And this isn't right. I'm not right. This isn't right. And it's, you know, it kind of, so things change, you know, relationships change and time changes. And, you know, it's always difficult when relationships kind of run the course. It's always difficult. But I also think that... it's important that you don't view that as a bad thing. Time changes for everybody and things change every day all over the world and sometimes things do run the course and what happened with Basics is I became so kind of, I was kind of out of the loop with it a lot because I was touring so much. and away from it, eventually it was a situation that had to change. But I have so much love for the club still. Me and Dave are friends again. So it's kind of come back round to a harmonious situation, but for some time. you know, that was difficult and, yeah, and it was for, I think, you know, the best thing, you know, I don't have, all my memories of the club are great memories, you know, and, you know, I'll always say that. I have so much fondness and love for it. It was the place that contextualised everything for me in a lot of ways in the club context. How long were you resident there for? Eight years, I think. Seven or eight years. Ending when exactly? It was, was it three years ago? God. About three, three and a half years ago. Okay. Maybe four. I mean, you were talking about relationships ending there. What was it like for you as a producer when Tony moved back to Sweden? Yeah, it was, well, obviously it was really, really difficult because, you know, I'd kind of like started to make waves and we got some great press as well, we got some really good press. But in a lot of ways it helped me as well because then I was on my own and I had to do it on my own and then what happened was I... I put some of my equipment together with a friend of mine, Matt Playford, and he opened up a record store in Leeds called Play Music, and I was doing a lot of the buying there, and there was this nucleus of people that were there, including some of the other guys from Basics, Tristan from Basics. and it was like the hub of dance music in Leeds for some time really. It was where everyone would go to buy records and so me and Matt made the studio and then I'd I'd be, you know, there'd be times he was actually living in there as well at the time. So he'd spend a lot of time in there and then we'd swap and I'd spend a load of time. And then we'd do a few things together. But there was, I started to make some demos and I gave a couple of them to Ralph. And he signed them on the spot. The office was literally down the road at the time. It was down the road from the studio. It was a two-minute walk. And I went in there, played them. to a guy called Barry Singleton that was running the office. He's an absolute diamond, lovely guy. And then Barry played them to Ralph and we kind of hastily put together a contract and there it was. And that track was the first Bobby Peru record. It was called War Games. Okay, and that was something I mean to ask you actually because I was like looking at your early Bobby Peru records and it kind of seemed like the first, or maybe I'm thinking Paul Wolfe, but the first release under your own name was the Subliminal thing. Yeah, it was, well it was actually, was it the, there was one for Underwater and then, oh no, no, you're right, it was Subliminal, yeah. And how did that happen? Yeah, well, you know, when Eric had come to play at Basics a few times and, you know, those, you've got to think through the context of, I know Sneak was originally involved in Subliminal, although I don't know what happened there. first few records, they put out records. I mean, I still play that, the first release of Luminor, Constipated Monkeys, Crow and Mad Moms. fucking mind blowing as is you know some of Harry's early records and like his beats thing Maspito by Mongabonics these were massive records at basics they were huge and across the scene they were huge as well and things like the beats volume one that Harry did you know techno DJs were playing that as well. So, you know, there was this mad cross-section, but then they'd put out some really, like, New Jersey-style garage, really kind of, like, full-on vocal kind of business as well. And so there were bits that kind of, like, didn't chime with you at all, but there were these records every now and then that'd be something that would just absolutely hit me in the face and I'd be like, wow. and it was also you know I guess that was my moment of being like this is a hot label you know I want to put a record out I'm subliminal you know And what happened was, I did these two tracks, and they're both, I mean, you listen to them now, they're both, they're not commercial records at all. They're like, have you heard them? Yeah. They're like, yeah, they're proper just drum tracks. Pretty techno-y, really, in some ways. Especially the first track, Without You, and I sampled an old classic Masters at Work remix. They did Urbanized, Helpless by Urbanized. It was a Ken and Lou remix. And the little vocal sample at the start. And it was, I mean, God, that was a really old, you know, it was old when I sampled it. It was a few years old. but I took the little hook from that, this little two-part harmony, and then made this kind of drum track around it, really. And then I sent it to Eric, but not... I just sent it off and he rung me, I remember... It's funny how everything links together. I was watching Crash, I was watching the David Cronenberg movie and it was a Monday night, it was like half ten and the phone rang and I picked up the phone and it was Eric Murillo ringing me up on a Monday night and I was like, whoa, it's fucking Eric Murillo. You know? Yeah. And it blew me away. So there was all these little endeavours going on. But the Bobby Prune material for 2020, that was building steam. That was where there was no boundaries. And that was the most... It was almost like the most... you know it wasn't like with with the tracks that sent to eric you know i knew they were pretty they were pretty you know they weren't proper probably what it would put out but i knew he'd be into them you know whereas the stuff for for 2020 i was just like look this is these are the tracks i don't know if you're into them but be great if you are and it they they kind of went with it and and and ralph's always had a stringent a r policy and there were things that i I'd give them that he'd be just like, that's too mad. It's too much. It's too mad. And that was always, that was almost always my thing when I was recording for 2020. It was almost like the punk out of a lot of them. I've always, I'd always give them the things that. You want to be the punk guy though, don't you? I think, you know, I think a lot of it was just that like, you know, I think I liked, I liked to push them to see what the limits of it were and that's to this day that's still how I am with a lot of things even the single that's forthcoming on Planet E I'm wondering because there'll be some people that probably think it's like a big room techno record and it's just not one side kind of sounds like Larry Heard and the others like this really off-the-wall jazz record. Essentially, it's kind of a, yeah, it's kind of jazz techno really, but it's not, there's nothing that's banging. So still, in all directions, I kind of prefer to make things that are interesting rather than, you know, fodder to drive. bookings and that's you know I've always been the sort of people that really the producers that blow me away on every side of it are always people that are kind of mavericks in some respect whether it manifests itself in a small way or whether it be just who they are and what it is they do but those sorts of figures are polarising in some ways and the sort of people that blow me away every now and then you may not like everything they do but every now and then there'll be one record that gets you and I'm talking about people like Maurice Fulton, some of the records that Pepe Braddock does, they blow you away and you're not going to be into everything but every now and then something grabs you and you're like, wow. It just sounds other. And I guess that's always been something that throughout everything, I've always liked those curveball records. I mean, what about with your own sound? Because to me, there seems to be a definite point where you're kind of going on the Chicago house. like US House Direction and then the more electronic kind of like electro influencing to creep in I mean was that a left turn that you'd you know well it's mad because the first Bobby Peru album came out in 2004 and you know there's a as it gets later on in the album there's a record on there that's completely you know really aggressive very dark kind of, it's called Duel. And making that was a bit of a turning point and I realised that, and also at the same time, what happened in Chicago House, it started to go down this, you know, people were sampling like, you know, Charleston records and things like that. And bits, every now and then there was a record with that kind of vibe that worked, but once it started to get too like that, I, then. rapidly I was I started to feel like it was going down a stylistic cul-de-sac and everything sounded so derivative and at those points I was like right I'm ready to jump off this I can't really you know there's only bits of it that I'm into and then and then I remember Tiga the Tiga record Pleasure from the Base and that straight away I was like fucking hell I'm back into that shit and only son you are someone to call my own i see the people that you find wherever you may be i live filling up my soul curiosity pleasure from the base you need a place to call your own i am the one and only son you are someone to call my own people that you find where you may be filling up my soul my curiosity That had all the funk of house music and the shuffle, but it had that bite and it had the aggression, a little bit of the aggression of techno and acid house. Was this song. And that whole wave of... electronic music, focus on electronics came and I dived into a lot of that and it was so polarising at the time. I remember Ralph at the time when I was playing at the club, Ralph had said, somebody said, oh, Willie's playing too hard, man. But like I say, that was always, I didn't mind causing a fuss anyway. It was a bit like that. I wanted to... I wanted to kind of shake it up a little bit. I don't like things to be too linear or too flat. And the best moments for me in clubs for DJs have been when they've gone out on a limb. And even if you're not feeling it, but if it happens, there's been moments like years ago being at the drum club in London at the Sound Shaft. And this is after I'd been to Fat Cat Records in the day. and going in there and hearing, and it was Weatherall again, but he played Substance Abuse by Fuse, he enriched you, amazing, I said, I come out at first, I was like, God, that's a bit fucking crazy, isn't it? But then, like, ten minutes later, it's like, whoa, two copies of it. And the whole room's just like worker ants just moving in unison, you know, and... And so those kind of records, you know, those moments. I was going to say you definitely had your own what the fuck moment with the rock discourse, didn't you? Well, I know, I think that's why it happened, because of that kind of, probably because of that sensibility, you know, trying to... pluck something and the mad thing was was about it i didn't even it wasn't a track it wasn't made as a piece of music it was it was the whole thing was done what i always do i record sections of sound and then i and then i put them down and then a few weeks later i'll sample chunks of compositions that i do and whether they be ambient things or little rhythmical sketches they're not then not tracks to be developed I don't pull up a track from but I'll put something on like a little experiment and take it once sample it again and take one section and then use that and manipulate that but with with that track what happened was justin long was coming over from chicago and playing at basics all the time amazing dj and an amazing guy lovely lovely guy and justin was at my house because we were doing some collaboration at the time and he i gave him a cd and he was listening to it downstairs and i was i'm messing about the studio and this in this house at the time out in jewsbury it was and he was listening to this thing and then he came running upstairs he's going woolly woolly woolly like this so i'm going what calm down he's going what the is this man what the is this i'm like what what do you mean and he said this this track and i was like what playing downstairs now. It's not a track. And he said to me, "You've got to let me burn this track. You've got to let me burn this track." It's not a track, you can burn it. I was like, "F***ing hell, alright, mate." You can burn it, but it's not a track, you know. He burned it and then the next few weeks and months he was just saying, "Look, this record's driving people f***ing crazy." And I was still like, "Nah." It's not even a track. And then one day, Ralph called me into the 2020 for a meeting and he said to me, you know that thing, you know that bit of music, do you fancy the idea of us doing some white labels? And we'll just, you know, we're not under your name. And I was like... all right, we'll give it a go, but I think you're nuts. And he's like, no, I've got a good feeling about it. So he's like, well, think of a name. And I always, from years ago, from all of the magazines I've read, I remember reading this name of this group called the Erotic Dissidents. I don't know, I don't think I ever even heard the music. I just thought it sounded like a cool name. It sounded fucking cool. You To me, it did. But then I thought, well, I can't steal the name. So I was playing on words. I thought, erotic discourse. It's talking about sex. Yeah, I'm down with that. Great. So that's what they put. They just put erotic discourse on. And it just went bananas. The emails from... the emails that we were getting and Ralph was saying something, saying this record's going nuts. What was it like at that time for you? It was crazy. Crazy because it wasn't... I also felt that a lot of the attention, I was kind of like... I felt that the reason why a lot of it was happening was because people didn't know who it was. and that is a key point and that's a key point and it's a touchstone of techno music now everybody's doing it's always been done over the years white label, you stamp it there's just something that you can't as a DJ if you don't really know who's behind it or you're the limited info and you just want it more and that's just happened recently with the Sicko Cell track on Swap 81 of course you know that's just blown up to crazy levels of hysteria but yeah I mean you know the defining moment of that was playing on New Year's Eve at Basics on 2005 and whether or not I'd never spoken to him you know in my life I'd heard him play so many times and never spoken to him and he came over from across the room and he said He says, are you Paul Wolford? He says, I've got to give you respect for heroic discourse. And shook my hand. I was like, what? You've got to give me respect. I was like, what the fuck? And that was just unreal. I was like, well, I know something's going on here. And then, of course, the mad thing was that having a... emails from people who ran these super underground labels saying oh you've got to do another track just like it i mean it's crazy some of the people that you know that you would think that would never say something like that would so many people saying you just do another just like it and to this day i'm like no don't want to name names no i'm not naming any names but to this day like no and I toyed with it and I wrestled with it and I did with it but I never wanted to be I never wanted to do that right do it again and it's the next track from the same producer sounds exactly the same it's like never I'm like fuck that let's try and try and do something else different and I kind of I I gave into it with some of the remixes, but the best, probably my favourite remix from that time that I did was for Trevor Jackson, was for Output and it was on DK7 and the DK7 stuff I always loved but I gave the mix in and then Trevor came back to me and said, you know what though, you know for the dub, why don't you just really do something fucking mental, why don't you just make something so spanner, the more spanner. the better and I was like, alright, cool. So the track was called Life Is Everywhere but I called it the dub of death and it's bonkers. Was it in any way tough having such a bright flash of omnipresence and having this hit? Did it in any way disrupt the steady trajectory you built for yourself? You know what? In one way it made me, in another way it fucked everything up. I thought you were going to say that. Yeah, which sounds crazy because suddenly you're exposed to this audience of people. who have a perception of what it is you do and who you are. And of course, at the same time, there's all this hype on electro house, which, you know, I was playing bits of that, but not loads of it, but bits of it. But there was loads of people who thought the record was an electro house record. Loads of people who thought it was a minimal record. You know, Matt Tolfritz was telling me about it. He was in Fabric and Richie Horton borrowed his copy of it to play in the other room later on that night. So, you know, there's all these mad experiences. And then Errol was playing at Lowe's, Errol Alcon. really nice chats with him on email. So the record spoke to so many people and it took on a life of its own. I ended up kind of on this treadmill of gigs, but so many of them now, there were so many of them that I shouldn't have taken because they weren't appropriate, but what was great and what was brilliant was that I'd never changed the amount of experience that it gave me because I've played in most environments now. I feel as comfortable on the terrace at space as I do on the stage. do in Panorama Bar or any of these places, there's a level of comfort there. But so many people have this perception of what you are from where you play. They don't listen to what it is you do. They look at it, then they judge you from your name on flyers and things like this. And then it's like, oh, well, he does that. And that's kind of that. I'm still kind of having to fight to kind of work my way out of that, out of some of those negative perceptions now. But now we've turned the corner and that's really changing rapidly. I mean, you said negative perceptions there and obviously you've been very closely associated with We Love On Sunday. I mean, has that kind of been difficult for you in a way, having such a long-term residency? Well, yeah. I mean, you know, it's been amazing in that, I mean, the experience of it and, you know, when you crack it playing in those rooms, it is, I don't know how it feels for a footballer to score a goal at, you know, Wembley or whatever, but, you know, when you crack it in a room like that, it's amazing when it's all working and it's the flashpoint. It's an incredible feeling and it's an amazing club working with We Love... But equally, because the club landscape in Ibiza has changed as well. you know, there's other places that are deemed cooler or whatever, that suddenly there's people who are like, oh, well, you play in that commercial place. Which, even though, you know, I mean, I play at Wheel of Life, even on the terrace, I play records by Frozen Border and Horizontal Ground and stuff like that in the last year. But it's kind of like, you know, people, they would never think that. They just think, oh, well, it's this. And so over years I've had to kind of, well my way through kind of soundtrack in that room was to re-edit records that are key records for that room that I've always loved anyway but then put my own kind of take on them and then mix them up with the records I play in different environments so every now and then you will build up to you know like some of the early mixes by Alan Van Helden which I love most of those early mixes like his mix of New Year Econ and the Tori Amos mix. Incredible dance records. loved and played across the board by different people. So what I would do is to re-edit those records. I still have a brace of edits like that of certain records. Each year I do about between 12 and 20. So when you're in that kind of environment or you're at a festival and you need that moment, you can bring that moment but in your own way. way and that's a really important part of I think for these days for any DJ really to put your own take on records like that if you want to kind of connect with those kind of audiences and you know when you stood there and there's two three thousand people you can't you know much as you might want to you can't just play on that kind of linear way you need to give them the moment and as long as you're playing records that you love no one can take that away from you no one can say that you're selling yourself short you love that record and I only and I only ever have played records I loved but I always thought that people would take it on what you played and not where you are so I guess that's the I've kind of in a lot of ways I've actually made it more difficult for myself so now there's some clubs that you know we're in we're kind of Some clubs that I've always wanted to play, they're kind of a little bit like, well, I'm not so sure, because they have this perception of you. I guess now everyone's so brand aware and so like, oh God, I don't want to be associated with that, that it's almost like the prejudicial lines are drawn. but it's tough to kind of shave through all of that and play everywhere across the board but do it in your own way. I guess that's, in many ways, that's kind of what it is that I'm trying to do is to break down a lot of that prejudice and still, you know... and still rock it in each environment that you want to be in. So will you be playing for We Love next year? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking forward to the opening. I'm playing inside with Carl Craig and Derek May. Okay. And I've been doing some tour dates with them recently with Planet E. We did New York and Detroit a couple of weeks ago. which was incredible. Yeah, I mean, I guess the pertinent question is how did that come about with Carl? Yeah, well, I mean, I have been, you know, been into his music since Elements, you know, his first record on the Virgin Techno 2 compilation. I mean, this is years and years ago, 19 years ago. And what happened was when I was in New York about five years ago and I met a guy called Gamal Awad and Gamal runs Backspin PR and I got to know him on email and then we met, we hung out, we had a conversation. an amazing time and he's from Sheffield, I didn't realise but he's from Sheffield, 30 miles away from me in Leeds and he does the PR for Planet E and at the time I was with Dubfire and I opened for him, we did this big crowbar gig. But then I spent a couple of days with Gamal and really got to know each other, had a real good time. And yeah, you know, we swapped a lot of music and we kept in touch and then I'd send him loads and loads of demos. And I never used his relationship with Carl. I never was like, oh, can you pass it on to Carl? Until I had something and I was like, oh, maybe you could. And he was like, yeah. maybe so, but I never really put it on him. And I sent him a record by another guy actually, another producer that Carl nearly signed. And the mad thing was, when it nearly came about, I was like, blimey, I've nearly got someone else signed to Planet E, but without giving him something of my own. And it didn't happen in the end but I always thought if I'm going to send Carl a track myself I'm going to wait until I have the right feeling about it. I'm not just going to go start sending him tons and tons of tracks and then I waited and then late 2009 it was Sunday night. It's always the way with your best tracks you walk in the studio. Three hours later, or the shortest amount of time, it just comes out of you. And it's a Sunday night, I sent him a track at two in the morning, I woke up at eight in the morning and Carl got straight back to me and said, I love this track, have you got any more like it? And I want to send him the things that are different than the next stuff, the most futuristic stuff, or the records that I think really are right for Planet E. And I sent him... Even with that mindset, I sent him another 12 tracks. And I was starting to think, am I not good enough? What if I'm not good enough to make the B-side? I can't let this go. opportunity to go and then the 12th track I sent him and it was I totally wiped the slate clean it wasn't even you know it was like a three minute beatless intro and I've used John Cage's prepared piano where he's put he's put these like blocks in the piano strings so that the percussion sounds and sampled it and written recreated a keyboard set where whereby if I go and play a keyboard I have certain ways of playing the keyboard and it will always set out to my opinion it will always do the things that I do by default but to break out of that so sample this piano this John Cage prepared piano and then reprogram the notes so they don't actually correspond to the right notes so and then in recording the track found this riff that I just wouldn't have played normally and it's a way of a way of writing but without bringing yourself out of the comfort zone and doing things in a different way so trying to extract something different from, you know, from your creative process. And then it's more like, like I mentioned before, it's got more in common with jazz, really. But then there's this crazy sub-bass on it, and it's, yeah, and he, Carl, got back to me the next day with that, and he said, he emailed, he said, all right, very innovative. And I was like, what, you're telling me that? that, he must be fucking crazy. So from that point on, and I just said to him, I said, look, you know, there's no one else that I want to put this track out with, you know. you know, this is really what I want to do. And Carl was really open. He said, right, cool, I really look forward to it. And then we slowly spoke more. And then I changed agents last year to Paramount in the UK, which is James Mack and Tom Nettleton. And James has looked after Carl for many, many years. And so... So, you know, we kind of started to hang out a bit more and then ADE in October, I went over to the D25 party and... And then got to meet Hardy, Carl's wife, who runs Detroit Premiere. And then the next day had a meeting after this amazing gig, you know, with Kenny Larkin, Stacey was there, and Kyle Hall, Juan Atkins, Derek May at the end of the night, just killing it. This is in Mel Craig, like 2,000 people. It was amazing. It was magical. And so the next day I had a meeting with Harjit, and Harjit said, you know, we'd love to look after you for North America, which just blew me away. And then basically in Carl's plans for his anniversary of the label, the 20 Years of Planet E, they've kind of brought me in and, you know, it's been really, really, really, really good for me. you know that what you're doing has not gone unnoticed. Because before that, I was starting to think, are the moments when I'm kind of, is this being noted what I'm doing? Because it's hard to tell. When you're the artist, it's hard to tell. It's kind of an abstract thing. People say, oh, you're doing well, but you can only tell in certain moments. You can't quantify it really. You can quantify it when you're stood in front of thousands of people and all that, stood like that, but you can't tell when you're sitting at home looking at it. Resident Advisor or whatever, you can't, it's hard for you to tell and they've really kind of brought me into the fold. Well, I mean, it's something that you've not actually put a record out with them yet. And they're celebrating 20 years and you're going on tour to celebrate those 20 years. That's right, yeah. I mean, you know, the amount of faith that they've put in. to me has been really galvanizing, you know? And yeah, so the time that I spent in Detroit a couple of weeks ago, I mean... Like we were talking earlier, the New York gig was good because they got to open up for Carl and Derek and then in Detroit, I mean, Carl opened up with Nico Marx from You Are On Keyboards and then I played in the middle and then Derek closed. To play that set on that night in Detroit, my first time in Detroit, was just mind-blowing. A mind-blowing gig. Do you kind of feel in some ways that this is now you aligned with another brand? Yeah, yeah, but it's in many ways, I guess it is, and it's instantly kind of starting to have repercussions. We touched on it earlier, you know, it's already starting to have repercussions, which are things that really, really, you know, that benefit you, but equally. I'm not doing anything different to what I've done for years and years really. So you could be, a cynical man would be like, oh well, you could think, oh fucking hell, you know. But on the other side of it, it's great. What's mind-blowing is to the people whose records I bought, those virgin techno compilations. I was buying them when I was like 15, 16 years old and then now I'm kind of going and playing in Detroit with those guys. There's a lot of people who say, oh, you take it too, you know, dance music, you know, you take it too seriously. But it's like, well, someone has to take it seriously, you know, and I really do. And it's kind of, it's nice to be, to get some recognition and to be working alongside people that, you know, you've looked up to for years, you know. ♪ ♪ you
