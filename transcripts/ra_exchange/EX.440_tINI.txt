Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Elisa Stolman, and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Tini. In the years since she started DJing in her hometown of Munich in the early 2000s, Tini has witnessed many changes in electronic music. Although she had no plans of becoming a DJ, throughout her career, Tini's skills have consistently drawn the attention of top promoters and labels. She made her debut in Ibiza around 2007 and in 2010 launched her own Teenie and the Gang residency. At the time, commercialization was transforming the island's club scene, which ultimately elicited a crackdown against her free party from local authorities. In conversation, we covered highlights from her career as a producer and DJ, the recent birth of her own record label, and the effects of corporate pinkwashing of LGBTQ plus culture in the dance music industry. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The Exchange with Teenie is up next. Hi, hi Tini. We're here at the RA office in Berlin. Hello. Thanks for having me. Thanks for coming. We'd like to start by just talking about an overview of your career. Well, I started DJing quite early without ever knowing that this could turn out as my job later in the days. around 16 years old I would say with hip-hop music at home I bought records and all my friends were hip-hop DJs back then and participating also the ITF and stuff so scratching at home and hanging out was a big thing. I was not so good in it though. Where's home, by the way? Home is in Munich. I'm born and raised in Munich. So how old were you when you started scratching? Well, yeah, I would say 16, 17 years old, something like that. But it was really just a hobby and just love for music. Did that ever change to an intention to make it more than a hobby or is that something that developed? It's absolutely something that developed. I had no idea that all this could happen and I never even dreamt of a career as a DJ and especially not in the size of how it is today and the music that I play today. So yeah, it completely started off very different. So then what was perhaps the first step in making this a career rather than a hobby? Well, it was just really the love for the music and going out and discovering electronic music. Back in the days, I used to snowboard a lot every weekend almost. And then I broke my spine. So that lead to less time in the mountains, more time in the clubs, which now turns out quite well for me. So I always collected music and well, in the beginning it was hip hop, then later on a bit more electronic music. And I just played for myself or at home mixing, mixing, matching music. And it was actually in an afterparty of friends where no one wanted to play. And I said I could play. And they were looking at me like, okay. And it wasn't even my records because I had like maybe 30 records, electronic music by the time, and not with me. So I just started playing with my friends' records and turned out to a five-hour set. And everyone was like, okay. okay, what is this? Who is she? And then I happened that I right away after got offered to play warm-up in a club back then in Munich, The Garden, who was run or one night was run by the friends that I was playing the after party at. Let's say for the underground scene was a bit more in the techie. open direction but there was really cool artists playing back in the days as well I remember playing with Dinky and Tobin Neumann, Karotte had his 24 hour parties there and but I think the main club for the music that I would play now was definitely Flucati back then and Harry Klein But it was for me a very important club. It was all about fun. It wasn't taking itself too serious. And they offered me very, very soon my own party called Teeny All Night Long. And for the first one, I had to go. to the record shop because I didn't know how to manage to play a whole night because for the first seven years I didn't play any CDs or anything because I didn't know how it works and yeah they just literally threw me into my career more or less but I never thought this would take off as it did and yeah one gig lead to the other one show to the other and yeah the people were talking about it the DJs were talking about it and then yeah slowly I started moving around away from Munich and playing gigs outside Munich, Rosenheim, Ulm, fancy places like that. It was really cool, really, really fun times. And then my first booking outside of Germany was then in Bilbao. I don't remember exactly the year. But yeah, so it was very natural. because I had a normal job back then. What was that? What's considered a normal job? You had a day job. Let's say a day job, an office job. I used to work for Disney Channel. I did, before that, my apprenticeship at ProSieben, quite big TV stations in Germany and partly Europe. I learned audio, media designer for audio and video technique. So basically everything you need to learn to produce TV, audio lightning and production, directing, there was production, like there was all parts. And my love was definitely the editing, the montage. How long did you work there? I think for Disney Channel. Well, it was not Disney itself. We did a product for a show. We produced a show for Disney Channel called Bini Kwebit Children's. TV. So I worked like four years for them, I think. Yeah. And so when did you transition from having a day job to working purely as a DJ? That was way longer, way further in because I wanted to make sure that I can sustain myself. Do you say that? Support. Yeah, let's say, yeah. Live off of it. Because when I saw that all is going quite well with the music and... I'm earning money with something that I love. It felt too good to be true. So I stretched out working normal jobs as long as possible because I didn't want to rely on bookings and then in the end perhaps have to take bookings that I don't want to or that I don't feel just to pay my rent. So I worked as long as possible, actually, Monday to Friday editing and the weekends DJing. And that was a couple of years, I would say, because I started freelancing then. So I'm very vague with dates and stuff. I'm always interested in this moment, though, when people who now support themselves as career DJs saw that as a possibility. And so was there a moment or a period in time where you were like, this might be possible and it started to seem more real? And what did that feel like? It felt absolutely amazing because that's a total dream that you do something that you love so much. It's my passion. I just love music more than anything. And to see that I possibly could cut off my job. So I did it like step by step, I would say. And then I took the freelance jobs. from five days per week, then slowly I cut down and then I saw how it goes. But I was super worried for a long time because you never really know how is this going. I didn't know that my career would last that long and go off as it does, more than I ever dreamed of. So I try to save as much money as possible to also survive if I don't have bookings for a month or two. But somehow that never happened. So ultra lucky, I would say. When you quit then, were you already playing every weekend? Yeah, pretty much. And around Europe, had you been overseas? Yeah, around Europe and well, let's say in Munich back then. I played also for a club called Prinzip and I was already traveling to Ibiza back then, discovered the island and was listening to Dice and Tanya Vulcano and Sven and everyone. And then it happened that they asked me if I want to do the warm-up for Loco Dice back then. How did you meet him? That was there, actually. As a clubber or as an artist? Well, I saw him as clubber in Ibiza and my friend Tessa she introduced me to him briefly it was super short like hey yeah nice to meet you oh yeah I play music to her and you know now I know how it is when someone is nice but you're like okay so but he was super sweet and then later yeah I got this request to to open for him and I was of course super nervous and yeah I played my set And then he started and he was like, you know what, we're going to play back to back later. And I was like, oh my God, okay. So yeah, he said it and we did it and we finished the night playing back to back together. Back then he had his manager also with him and they approached me after, reached out to me and later asked me to join the agency, which then lead to more international gigs together with Dice. So I was touring quite a while with him. And would this have been like late 2000s or early 2010s? Yeah, it was around 2007-ish, I'd say. Okay, and what year did you put out your first record? My first record was in 2009. It was That's Right on a sampler for Desolade back then. When did you start making music? It was around the time, actually, 2007, 2008-ish. Also just playing around. I mean, I had the... computer program when I was a kid but it doesn't really count it was called drums and you could set ones and zeros and it would hit a note or not and yeah several instruments and could create some rhythms but you could never save them so technically I started when I was very young but to really get into the material my first program was Fruity Loops and then I had Reason and I was just playing around fooling around and later I moved on to Ableton I don't know if there's too much name dropping here but it made the entrance in the production quite easy and then I got some gear and all this and then realized I really like it but it's something I really love and do on the side but there's probably better producers than me I have gotten the sense that I think of you as more of a DJ than a producer, which isn't to say that I don't like your productions or you're not good at it, but just that I primarily think of you as an artist, as a DJ, and it seems like you DJ more than you produce anyway. Absolutely. It's also more my personality, I'd say, so I have a hard time sitting still. Yeah, and forcing creativity is also not so easy and having little time in the studio then to have a great outcome is not always possible. But yeah, I definitely live for being on the road and being a DJ way more than the studio. Do you find that those are two very different parts of your brain? can be hard to mash sometimes too or can you mix them pretty easily I don't find it super hard let's say I get inspired by so much music and then there's stuff that I hear that might influence the way that I produce also or that I I don't know influences of styles and sounds that I pick up but then again I also have a complete different style of producing than how I play and not so I can't really say it's somehow merging and somehow not at all I don't know how to put this that makes sense as an answer But it's not that it's completely separate for me. Because oftentimes I sit in my studio and I make some beats and then as a stop I just start listening to records again. So it's more, yeah. Is it important to you to make music that you would also want to DJ? Well, it comes in handy if you do so. But no, I do a lot of down-tempo stuff as well. And there's even some cheesy tracks as well, I would say, with vocals, singing and more almost romantic probably that I might never release. But my friends like them. But I do also try to make tracks that I play in the club. So lately it's a bit more. So I have a good two handful of tracks that I actually play out a lot in my sets. And three of them are coming out on my label now. Your label is something you started recently, right? Yeah, it's in the absolute making. I've been talking about it forever. So people were already like, oh yeah, okay. That label. So it's happening. It has everything ready and the test pressing arrived. I pick it up today, actually. I'm really excited. So will it be your record that's the inaugural release on it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's three tracks of mine and my friend Mr. G offered a remix. And how could I say no? I'm a super fan of his for years. And yeah, also, he's a really, really amazing person and artist. So I'm very excited to have him for my first release as a remixer. And moving forward, will this label mostly be used for your own productions or are you releasing other people as well? No, so the name of the label is part of the gang records, which says it quite clear already. It's supposed to be for the gang. And of course, I will release on it, but it's not. meant to be my label and I'm going to release so for me it's very much more interesting to give a platform to the other artists that also play for me or don't even play for me but that I like or that they're going to play for me or that they're friends and to have a non-conform label because usually it's important to have a certain style and I guess we will have somewhat of a style but I could imagine also to release an absolutely non-club EP or whatever. So now the first few... releases that are planned, they're going to be more clubby and from artists all around the world. People I met during the years, artists I met and yeah, just music that I personally like. And people who you have also at your Teenie and the Gang parties and that sort of thing as well? Yes, exactly. Okay. Just to quickly get back into the bio a little bit. So let's talk about then your first album. When did you start working on that album and why? When did it come out? What's the story with that album? The funny thing is... never was planned to be an album. I never thought this was going to happen because as you said, my first release was in 2009. It was one track and then, well, I just made music. I went to Ibiza for a season in 2010. and I brought some equipment and I just started sitting there with shitty small computer desk speakers and not really adjustable bass and was mostly sitting there with my headphones and just making music but without any idea back then where it's gonna go so there was no special influence or no style that I wanted to I was, I think, way more free from the head and the way I produce than I am now that I know more about genres. And I was, yeah, I was very, I don't know the word in English, but yeah, well, free from any prejudice or ideas. Expectations. Yeah, expectations, exactly. So, yeah, I just made all this music. And then at some point, Dias was like, so? do you have anything to release maybe? Do you want to participate on a sampler? And I'm like, yeah, I have a few tracks. So I sent him a package of 16 tracks and didn't hear back for quite a while. And then at some point he called me. He's like, I'm with Martin, Martin Buttrich, in the studio and we're listening to your album for the second time. And I almost dropped the phone. I was like, what are you talking about? Well, yeah. I'm like, okay. Yeah, funny joke. He's like, no, no, no. This is real. We would love to make an album with you. We love the tracks. They fit together. It tells a story. This is you and you have a very own sound. And yeah, let's do this. This was then 2011. The album came out called Tessa, dedicated to my friend who introduced me to Dice and the Island back then. And was also with me in all my first gigs everywhere, always coming with me. Biggest support and love of life. Best friend. So clearly Ibiza has been a... big part of your career and your story and a big influence for you? Absolutely, because later in 2010, no, that was the summer actually, where I said I had my own event. set up with the Teenie and the Gang parties. So Ibiza always played a big role and still plays a big role for my career, I would say. So when you threw the first Teenie and the Gang party, first of all, why did you decide to do your own party there? And what was the idea behind it at the time? Well, it's not exactly that I decided so. It was more... got offered to me and it was an absolute dream because well I know the island and back then it was all a bit more free and easy, daytime parties, fun, after hours, all the stuff and yeah there was this little beach check and I actually played in that venue where I later had the party for a fuse event, my friend Ansel Ciro Guse, he was inviting me. So I played a party there and the owner heard me. And he loved it. So he got in touch with my other friend, Paula Poletto, who also helped me back then to set up the party then. Yeah, they were coming up with the idea of hosting my own party. The very first name was Tini and Friends, but it was too close to Luciano and Friends. So then I later... I had the idea with, I don't know, we had a brainstorm and somehow it was Tini and the gang coming up and we started it. And I had a quite huge lineup back then, also with the help, yeah, all the contacts I had through DICE. And so it was just wing playing for me and to be Neumann and Magda. And yeah, it was... It was crazy for me as such a newcomer in the scene still to host my own event and having such a lineup in a free beach party. This was quite a new thing to happen on the island as well. A free beach party. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was absolutely free. So even at the time, was Ibiza considered a commercial or expensive place to club? So let's say it was never cheap. I know people now complain a lot more, but it did definitely get more expensive than it used to be and more restricted and everything. But it was never a super cheap. I mean, I never got the super hippie times. I came too late for that. Let's say it was a bit more chill than it is now. Okay. Yeah. So even at the time, now we're sitting in Berlin and we're talking about Ibiza, which I think represent two different worlds or approaches, crudely put. And now we're at this point in Ibiza. Ibiza really represents like commercial clubbing and also EDM. But at the time, I'm getting the sense that there was the dominant. culture wasn't necessarily like EDM on billboards and it was still Luciano and sounds that are more associated with the quote-unquote underground? Yes and no because there was always the big EDM artists also hosting their parties as far as I can remember of course it was I don't know how long David Guetta is now on the island and all this, but I mean, of course, probably it was George Morella and all them before, but I don't remember vividly because I literally didn't care that much about that. It was just going there, enjoying myself. And also, yeah, the more you get into the business, the more people ask questions and then you think about stuff differently and you get to see the political background behind the party scene. So back then, I think I literally was absolutely carefree. So I can tell you if it was so. So it was a bit different. But I think it was always a mixture of both. It was never just underground. But did it feel like two separate worlds even when you were on the island? Like it sounds like you didn't interface, EDM didn't approach your experience of Ibiza very much. No, but it still really doesn't. If I don't want to hear EDM, I don't have to hear it. Sure. So you can still find your way through. It's not completely merged, I would say. So there's separation still happening. Although some of the... artists out of our scene now move into clubs and share the clubs with other big EDM artists. So this is where the merch happens, but I usually don't attend these events. We're approaching the singularity, folks. So I guess what I'm sort of getting at is a context for how, what your party, the space that it occupied on Ibiza, and then we can get into other points. Your party seems to represent a different kind of mindset than what is associated with Ibiza at this time. So you mentioned that it was a free beach party. So having a free party is sort of anti-commercial. And was it important to you then to represent and to embody and practice? anti-commercial and therefore somewhat quote-unquote underground values. Yes and no, because all I was interested in or all I am interested in is having a good party with the right people and the right music in the right setting. So I wouldn't consider myself as the one starting to fight for the underground on the island, but I was happy that I was or am a part of that. I would say movement, I don't know. For me it was really great because since it was a free party there was not so much pressure. So I was more free in the programming which enabled me to invite artists who usually would never get to play on the island. I mean we started with quite a big lineup and then... started becoming more and more really a platform for newcomers or unheard people on the island or just friends that I would love to have around me when I host my party or the music I love. This was really amazing to have zero pressure on our shoulders and just have this kind of party. But I never saw it as... as an anti-movement. I did realize that it was because people were more and more talking about it and appreciating it so much because it is indeed uncommon that you offer something back. But to me, this should be natural because we're taking so much out of the scene. So in that moment where you can give something back and I saw it. a bit in the same way career-wise because I got offered all these amazing opportunities back then. So in the second where I had the position that I could build a platform for other people, then I saw this as a nice opportunity to give something back. Right. That's the overall idea of the gang thing, I would say. Even if you don't consciously want to confront or go against the grain of the tide of culture. it seems that when you aren't responding to it or going along with that tide, then you're going to come against some pushback from the dominant culture. And I guess I'm referring now to the police shutting down Teenie and the gang as a free beach party, right? Yeah. Isn't that what happened? Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, there is a change. It's difficult to say from where exactly it came from. I mean, definitely, you know, there were some rumors that other big clubs wanted to shut us down because we had too many people at the beach. But our crowd was a complete different than the one that would... go into these big clubs, you know? So there was a lot of rumors about it and I'm careful with saying anything why this happened. But yeah, in general, it feels like they're cleaning up the island a little bit. And yeah, it's, in my opinion, a bit more of a fun, free place because they've taken away what it was all about, like this partying under the sky, like in daytime party. Also, when I came for CBC, DC-10 had no roof, so you partied open and planes would fly over your head and everyone's screaming. It was very free and now it's pretty controlled and trying to bring the island into a different direction in a certain way. But it's not that they try to get rid of the underground or something. It's just it's hard to sustain. Right. Do you say sustain? I always use that word. Or maintain. Maintain, yeah. It also seems like representing... I'm going to use underground, even though it's not like my favorite word. We have to just do this, right? Underground and mainstream or EDM or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That being a part of and representing this quote-unquote underground culture in an otherwise pretty mainstream and hostile environment sort of seems to me to have placed you in an interesting place now in the context of dance music. So I don't know if you'll agree, and I'll be interested for your thoughts on this read, but it seems to me like for my peers here in Berlin who are very concerned with the least known artists in the most underground clubs that they barely even know who you are, and then people that I know who are actually into EDM. also still don't really know maybe some of them but not really like you exist in this middle ground for me sort of no totally I'm in a in a gray area and um which is somehow amazing because um I've been told that I'm one of the few artists that can combine the underground. I mean, I'm not the super underground, as you say, like the super mega unknown. But I play with all the big guys and they all were very supportive throughout my career. So I'm playing big stages with Sven Veed or Karl or whoever. And in the same time, I play really cool underground parties. in Ukraine or whatever or underground festivals and so it is funny because I love to have that position because it lets me move very free also I can't really do anything wrong I can just do me so and with this I would say I got quite far So I never wanted to be either this way or that way. So I'm not ranting or shouting against the commercial or the underground because my heart beats somewhere in the middle. I just love music and somewhat my personality allows me to participate in more. commercial events. Sensitive word also, but yeah, as we put it like this. But in the same time, I'm also, I have my place with the cool kids. I don't know. Well, I think, no, I mean, I would put cool kids. It's difficult to say because it makes it sound as if the underground is cool and the commercial is not cool. But there's definitely cool people in there. In both ways, or shitty people in the underground, too. Well, I think it also speaks to the position of the style of music that you play. Like, do you mind if I call you a tech house DJ? Do you like minimal better? Do you not like that? I'm not a minimal DJ. I'm probably more a tech house DJ. I would say I play between house and techno, if that makes me a tech house DJ. I don't know. But Tech House for me has a not amazing label, to be honest. Right, so that's exactly what I'm talking about. My perception is that Tech House is sort of the first style from the quote-unquote underground that was distinctly not EDM, that is sort of being, let's call it, appropriated or accepted into, like you say, there are... big room DJs who are unequivocally, we can call them tech house DJs, playing at the same clubs or at the same parties with the David Guettos and so on. And that has made tech house a dirty word in like underground circles. Yeah, which is weird because there is a genre such as tech house and there is amazing tech house music, but I think it came a lot with the... easy way of production and digital labels that then just stamped very loopy, basic produced tracks as tech house. So there's good tech house and bad tech house. There absolutely is. Yeah, and that's why it's one of these words that could mean a lot. But I don't know, for me, it also has a bit of a negative taste, although... Yeah, the tech house in its origin, there's really, really amazing music. But when I hear them rolling, I don't even know how to put it. But, yeah, I don't know where or how I would call myself. So, yeah, but probably for the super underground people, I'm an absolute tech house DJ. So that's the thing. Everyone always thinks differently about themselves. I don't know. And generally, I don't like this labeling. I just play music that I love. And there can be an absolute 80s tracks in there. And there can be house. I play a lot of dub techno too and dubby stuff. I play ambient. So am I a tech house DJ if I play all these styles? I don't know. I play a lot of house from the 90s. And does this make me a tech house DJ? because there wasn't Tech House back then. So I don't know. Tech House had this period where it was getting, like, it was too close to this commercial style of music and EDM, and then people who considered themselves not EDM and defined themselves against that created a stigma around that term. And now I think we should reclaim that, and I have a sense that there is a bit of a... I don't know, let's call it a comeback. I don't know, all this labeling is quite difficult for me. And yeah, I'm really in a gray zone. But yeah, I get to host my party at the Club Divisionaire. For me, it's one of the coolest clubs where I know that people who really care about music always want to play. It's one of these places where you really aim to have the possibility to play as an artist. So I get to play there. What was going on with your career at the time that the teeny and the gang parties were developing in Ibiza? And they were getting shut down specifically. Well, let's say... For the longest time we were, because we started in 2010. I had no event in 2011 and then they shut it down later in 2015. Wow, I don't even know the dates right now. That's okay. The year of the closure. So let's say it had a huge impact. The Teeny and the Gang events had a huge impact on my career, I must say. More and more people got aware of me having this party or me as a DJ. So it was really picking up after this. And yeah, we had moments where we had up to 2,000 people. I think almost at the beach. So that was amazing. And unfortunately then, yeah, we had to leave the beach. Authorities said no, no more outdoor events and no more daytime parties or especially also no free daytime parties outdoor. So the whole combination was not amazing. But back in the days, we had carry-on parties after the... beach events at underground the club in ibiza my favorite club in ibiza to be honest and yeah we we started hosting our parties then now so somehow we really made the transition from free beach events to to to a club show and i'm really happy so yeah upcoming month i host one weekly or september gonna be a teeny and the gang there 10 in total this summer and they've been all amazing. Really good vibe. The people really know what they're going for. We have a lot of competition going on and you can clearly see that the gang as a brand has a following now. People come for the music, people come for the special vibe we create. It's very like it's a family vibe. There's no ego, there's no... bullshit. It's just hanging out with friends. It's a gathering, hanging out. And I'm super happy that we managed this transition because it was tough. in the beginning. Right. Because like I mentioned earlier, perhaps because you were going, you represented an ethos that had less and less place on the island or created more and more tension with the dominant cultural forces and the way that things were going. And I was wondering if you also felt that tension in your career, if you felt pushed. to be more commercial or to acquiesce to commercial demands in ways that ever made you feel uncomfortable? Well, not really, because I always try to really, really be myself. It's not that I try, I act. out as I am as a person or as I want to be so I don't want to be pushed into a certain direction and if the business would have requested this I would have probably stepped back from from that career because for me it's super important to to be real and authentic as as the person that I am I always said that if there's anything that doesn't feel right or makes me become the person that I don't want to be, then I go back to my old job. So it's not that I would sacrifice everything in order to be a DJ. Was there ever a moment where you had to make a call like that, that you feel... comfortable talking about perhaps yes um probably um i don't remember exactly the year but yeah there was a time um when uh it was about my my press pictures back then and um yeah there were I should have been a bit more feminine from my management side and I did not really agree because if you know me as a person, I'm rather boyish. I don't know how to put it out. Not really. I mean, I was a bit against that and I did my own photo shooting with a friend of mine and I had this... mustache tattoo well I still have it on my finger from long time ago before it was a hype and so I just took a picture with my mustache finger in front of my face and yeah I knew that my agency or management back then was pretty much against it they said I could not or I shouldn't present myself like that in the internet with like that they probably meant gay I don't know and I saw absolutely not no point of not doing it and posted it sort of against their will and it took off somehow people were like okay who is she that curly girl with a mustache tattoo on her finger And, yeah, I just didn't want to be pushed into something that I'm not or become an artist or seen as an artist that I'm not. So, yeah. Did that moment with the press photo feel like a coming out moment for you? Not really, because I think I was always quite openly out, but I didn't talk about it that much or say like, hey, look, everybody, I'm gay. That's not really my style, but I never made a big secret out of that. But it was, of course, making the possibility for the outside world a bit more. obvious or public so and I saw back then it was MySpace still which was big people were like commenting like oh do you think she's gay I saw also question you think teeny is a man and stuff like that I find it very amusing and yeah but I I never wanted to make it a big topic So neither hiding from the topic nor putting it out there as a big thing. Like, hey, look, because I define myself through way more than just my sexuality. So this is one big part, though. And yeah, but I wouldn't consider this as a coming out, you know? Right. It's funny to hear a story where someone is pressuring you to present more femme, let's call it, for the sake of promoting your DJ career, given that... Now it's my perception that there's a lot to gain in a personal, in a social, and certainly in a professional sense in this particular industry to present as gay. or to incorporate a gay aesthetic, even if that's not a part of your lifestyle privately. And I was wondering if you had also noticed this kind of, it seems like now you're indicating there was a paradigm shift that happened in a way that now things are different in that sense. A little bit. I mean, what's good about the movement, I would say, is everything becomes a bit more of a safe space for the gay community. But somehow, maybe some people, I don't know how to put it. Well, perhaps not to say that there necessarily are people who are acting gay when they're not or something. But certainly that that's an opportunity. There are things to be gained. I think it is given in light of the commercialization of gay culture at large. that it's clear and indisputable that there are commercial gains to be made and money to be made off of incorporating a gay aesthetic, whether you're a corporation that's going to sponsor or like put slap a rainbow flag on your bottle of vodka, or maybe if... You're an underground DJ. I just don't think that a young woman, a young gay woman coming up today in underground DJing would be encouraged to present femme in the same way. Yeah, I agree. I absolutely agree on that. And, well, there's this great term also with pink washing for it. And you could see it. Christopher Street Day probably as well and yeah it's a topic among my friends as well but in the same time you must see the positive side of it as well that now these days everyone really everyone is welcome and has the possibility to become a big artist or start off a career without any restrictions. And I think I would love to talk about this, but I just really don't know how to put it. you know? Yeah, totally. I find that the queer scenes, loosely speaking, again, these terms like underground and EDM and mainstream, it's hard, but let's just go along with it for the sake of, we all know what I'm talking about, that there are more gay parties in techno, at least in Berlin. Those parties tend to be more techno-oriented or experimental club music-oriented. And what I'm getting at is actually that, like, on the one hand, tech house or minimal or whatever you call it does not seem to have a place at those parties. So queer parties don't seem to book. tech house DJs. And then also it is my perception that there is not as much of a gay or lesbian scene in Ibiza or in tech house parties like CDB doesn't have a queer night, an explicitly queer night. And I was wondering if... what your experience with the interaction between those two cultures are and if there is a lesbian or a gay scene in Tech House, in Ibiza, and so on. Well, there is not really. Well, Ibiza, you have La Troya and the stuff, but with our kind of music or the music, the tech house music that I play, there's actually not. So I'm... bringing a concept now to Ibiza that is originally has started in Barcelona it's called Maricas it's the party of my friends it's queer open everything tell me about Maricas then what's the vibe at Maricas so Maricas party has been started from my friends in Barcelona because they were also seeing the lack of, let's say, quality electronic music, rather put it like that, in the gay scene. And yeah, they started off booking underground artists, but for the gay queer community. And it got really well received. So they have an amazing crowd there. And yeah, bringing back the vibe a little bit more because it was sort of a lag in Barcelona as well. And yeah, Ibiza used to be way more colorful as I remember it. And also the big gay parties were the huge clubs and now they all moved to smaller locations and there's not really... so much going on anymore and yeah so I kind of team up now and we're going to have a Maricas and the gang event at underground it's going to be next week in September and we have Isabella who's running the Maricas party in Barcelona and Handmade here from from Berlin and are going to play as well and just see how that goes. And it's not restricted to a certain crowd. So, of course, everyone's welcome. just to try to bring a little bit more of the queer gay events back to the island and with a different music than it's usually happening in Ibiza especially. Did you used to, or especially when you were coming up, did you get booked at gay or lesbian events often? Actually not working my way there. No, I used to play a bit more in Munich in gay events. But since I'm not super promoting myself as a gay artist, because I think that shouldn't matter if I'm a woman or a man or if I'm gay or straight, I should be booked for my music, first of all. But yeah, since I'm not super promoting myself as a queer artist. Maybe I'm not really on the radar, but well, yeah, my friend's party, the Marikas, I'm going to play there as well now. So, yeah, it's usually I get booked for, well, how you call it, a straight oriented party. But I do also wonder if that's a symptom of my suspicion that Ibiza, Minimal, Tech House, etc. is a somewhat straight. or overtly explicitly straighter scene than techno or underground techno, so to speak. Yes, I mean, I think it was quite different back in the days in Ibiza, but now it definitely, let's say, is, but it's also wild assumptions. From my experience, I can only speak about myself. Yeah, it's missing a little bit the gay crowd. Have you started getting booked more often? Like, do there seem to be more gay or lesbian parties or more gay or lesbian parties that are interested in booking you? Has this become something that you play more often or it's still something that... you mostly interface with through your own active involvement, like doing Marika's? I think it's more my active involvement. Did you find with Marika, so you were very deliberate in saying that it's not just for gay people or lesbians or queer people or whatever. Did you feel that... It was important, or why was it important for you guys to make it an inclusive party in this way rather than making it a deliberately and consciously gay and or lesbian party? Because this is exactly what I personally would like to avoid, is to exclude anyone. Music is for everyone and you can only create a good vibe with good people and it shouldn't matter. If you only allow the gay crowd, then that would be really upsetting. That would be a step backwards. It should be partying together as if it doesn't matter. The labeling only happens so they know they have a safe space to come, I'd say, or find like-minded people. Anyone from this would be the wrong way to go, I think. And in your personal life, has it been important for you to have a group of people around you, like like-minded queer women around you? Well, I must say that 90% of my friends are gay or lesbian. I use the term gay. And so it's a big part of my life, absolutely. I'm surrounded by... my my gang girl a girl gang all the time it's not that I only choose this because I am gay it's it's just yeah it happens but um so you mentioned that the next Marika's party is actually this weekend right exactly it's going to be on Sunday in Barcelona in a small location who else is playing It's going to be Omar from Uruguay and Isabella and me. Awesome. What else have you got coming up this month, this year? What else can we expect from the world of Teenie then? Well, yeah, a part of starting off with this and then taking the whole crew also to Ibiza, as mentioned. Yeah, we're going to finish up the Ibiza season. I have six more shows coming up. on the island and lots of bookings as always so pretty much taking teeny and the gang brand around we're gonna have one also at robert johnson in september and yeah apart from this i'm really excited for my label Is there a range, a date range when we might, is it maybe this fall, this winter that we might see that record? Well, the test pressing I pick up today. So if it sounds nice, it should be out in October. Awesome. Yeah. Very cool. Yeah, I'm excited for it. And you've also started tattooing on the side, right? Oh yeah, I did. I'm not amazing yet, but it's also not, well, hopefully going to get better, but people know what they have to expect when I tattoo them. So I'm quite rookie in this, but yeah, working my way through. Yeah, this is a fun hobby I started but it's actually amazing how many people write me and really want a tattoo now. So if it doesn't work out with the music anymore, I might just start as a tattoo artist.
