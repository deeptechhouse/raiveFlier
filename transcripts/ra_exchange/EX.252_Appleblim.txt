Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. So this week our guest is Apple Blim. Laurie Osborne was originally known as a key guy in the dubstep scene. This was because of the incredible label he ran with Shackleton called Skull Disco. They released a run of around 10 records and then stopped the label in 2008. Osborne went on to start his own label, Apple Pips, and with the label and his DJing, he's generally been all over the place musically. He's really into collaborating. He's turned in some great work with Peverellis, Ramadan Man and Common over the years. And the occasion for our chat was his recent album, The Second Story on R&S. This one pulled off some incredibly complex and interesting club music. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. So an exchange with Apple Blim is up next. So a few weeks back you released an album with Al, Second Story, that came out on R&S. Maybe you could start by telling us about the project, like how it came about and what its aims are? Sure, yeah. Well, I met Al, well, quite a few years ago now down in Bristol, just through friends and music. I'd seen the name Al Toretz on posters around the city and thought, interesting name. I wonder what that guy's like, you know, and finally met and got on really well. Quite an amusing first meeting where we were at a big house party and I was playing some techno Detroit stuff and there was someone on the house party dance. floor who was moaning and go and quite loudly and saying you know this is it's got no soul It's got no soul, not like, you know, it's not like black music, not like rock and roll and soul. And I could hear Al going, well, actually, mate, this is black music and this is, you know. And I was like, ah, someone's defending the Detroit flame, you know. I thought this person's definitely got to be worth talking to. So we ended up, yeah, just hitting it off. And, yeah, just bonding over, I guess, you know, tunes, techno. I was studying. Was I still studying at the time? Or maybe I'd just finished a place called Bath Spa University on a course which was, is sort of, I don't like to use the word renowned, but it's quite popular for sort of... creative music and quite a lot of interesting people have kind of been through this course basically in the kind of southwest area so even people like um addison groove went there shortly before he realized that he didn't really need to be there because he kind of knew it in any way which is you know and yeah so Altaret's Luke's Anger Vessel Batu Gatekeeper Wedge all these different people you know so over various years there's always there's always some interesting stuff going on so I didn't actually know Al Al had studied there but he was like a year above me And yeah, I guess we just started messing around on music through remix requests that I was getting. And I felt like I wanted to do them with someone else. So I wasn't that confident kind of technically. And because we were kind of hitting it off so well and bonding over the over sort of shared music, which I guess like. Coming from the dubstep thing, most of my friends were all into kind of either bass music or dubstep or da-da-da. And they were a bit younger than me. Al kind of had similar kind of like angles on stuff like techno and electro and stuff like this. So yeah, we did a few remixes together and they went well. one for um phonica records one for oscar for for luke slater um and they all got really good response and we enjoyed working together so i ended up kind of jamming more put out a single on else music you know ages ago now and then it was through that we were djing together a lot i was doing apple pips nights at Fabric and so on, and I was getting all my kind of people that I knew sort of local to me who were releasing on the label, getting them to play. So it kind of naturally evolved, and eventually we ended up doing some gigs in Ibiza at We Love Space. And Mark Broadbent there had got me out a couple of times. A chap called Ryan O'Gorman actually booked me the first time. And we played, me and Al played, I got him out there for a live set one year. Then we got us back again and we did like a main room of space, which was kind of like crazy trial by fire, you know, which was fun. So back to back live set? DJing that time. Yeah, and this was hence then, long story short, we kind of got asked back again the next year. And we just sort of thought, well, rather than doing another back-to-back, which we'd kind of already done, then it's like, well, we've done that. It was great and it was fun. What can we do next? And we thought, well, we've got these half-done tunes that we've been kind of tinkering on. Why don't we try and do some kind DJ set that's a bit more than a DJ set. So originally it was just thinking about maybe running some beats or some little edits next to sort of just normal DJing, maybe with a bit of Ableton. And as we started kind of putting it together, we kind of realised we were making tunes and having fun with them. Why not just kind of carry on? And we kind of set ourselves a bit of a challenge, really. We sort of said to them, look, are you up for a live set? They were like ahead of when we were going to be there so it was like right we've got this time to do this you know so we did it yeah i see for me i kind of have the project classed as like an attempt at a sweet spot between like club functionality and like experimentation Is that like an assessment you'd go along with? Yeah, definitely. I think that's naturally the way it was kind of always going to go, I guess, from the stuff that we're into and, you know, both of our sort of styles, as it were, I guess. I mean, I think you could say that about Alex's music anyway kind of thing. It's kind of like sort of hyper sort of sound design, but also... you know, it has to be functional in terms of dancing. It's dance music, you know. So, yeah, it was definitely, you know, it's a lot of syncopated beats and broken beats and kind of swung stuff. It's not really, there's no real straight kick drum. four by four stuff, you know, kind of on the album really. And so we weren't really sure how that was going to go down, I guess, live. I mean, I think we knew that people would dance because, well, you know, we like to make funky music, but in a kind of traditionally house and techno club and night at Space. Sure, yeah. You know, we really didn't know what was going to happen. Yeah, people stayed and danced and watched and, you know, it went down well kind of like enthused by that I guess you know yeah I see I mean is there anybody that you were maybe inspired by for this kind of like idea of making people dance with non-standard grooves is there anyone you think that's done that like particularly well I think like The stuff that we were listening to that we kind of met in the middle at, I mean like, you know, I was playing me loads of stuff like Christian Vogel and Neil Landstrom and kind of all this kind of like, I guess the underground of UK techno and electro. And then I was playing him stuff from, you know, the bass music world. So Digital Mystics and Rob Smith and, you know, Pinch and Pev were people that we truly bonded over. So we went and saw, I remember we went to Berlin to a substance, which I played at regularly at Berghain. was, I think it was Maller, Shackleton, who else, maybe Distance and a few other people. And I think at that time particularly as well, that's what you kind of noticed. about the music was a lot of the techno people coming out and listening to it and I think the reason they were also refreshed by it was the fact that it wasn't straight 4-4 you know or straight 4 to the floor I should say you know so there was a lot of swing and a lot of broken stuff and And seeing it work in that club as well, you know what I mean? It's kind of like, obviously I'd been seeing it work in places like Forward and DMZ, where it had grown from people more just standing and listening to then people really raving very hard to it. So you kind of realise that even though it's kind of this fairly, not a new style of rhythm, because obviously these rhythms have always been around, but... you know, people might initially come to a dubstep night and go, and even me, when I first heard Digital Mystic stuff, it would be like, how do I move to this? This is weird. This is kind of not what I'm used to. But then gradually, obviously, you realize it's got just as much funk as anything else. So, yeah, we were kind of like meeting in the middle around this kind of stuff. And, yeah, I guess. it's not something like it's a conscious, oh, we're not going to do that. It's more kind of like, let's just follow it down the route that we want to go down. Yeah, I see. I guess it's kind of inherent excitement and danger in pursuing these styles of music. It's like push it too far and you lose people, but get it just right. And you've maybe created something that like, you know, didn't exist in that form before. Yeah, I'm always surprised. I a couple of times doing the live set as well. And I mean, I guess you always wonder whether a kind of, you know, a crowd that is perhaps more used to just going out on a Saturday night and hearing, you know, constant four to the floor that they might be in some way feel not, you know, people feeling cheated. It's almost like sort of like in the opposite way when I started to play 4-4 stuff instead of dubstep, you know, or mixing the two up. people from the dubstep world would be shouting at you down the front going, what's this? You know, like they're confused by the fact that it's not a rhythm that they... wanted they paid their money for or whatever you know so i mean but but i was always we were always really pleasantly surprised it was kind of like you know people react with the fact that it's being done live and the fact that the owl's drumming and the fact that it's got this and it is funky you know so so yeah like um we played room two a couple of times and held the room and held the floor and people were really, really sort of like, you know, shocking out kind of thing. So yeah, it was really encouraging. Do you feel like people have become less single-minded about that sort of thing over the last 10 years? Have attitudes opened up a little bit? Yeah, it's hard to say. I always wonder about this, whether things change like that. I guess they must because it's like there's always going to be a core group of open-minded people but then there's that perhaps say like in the drum and bass era maybe they only listened to drum and bass yeah that's kind of the classic example isn't it they'd be annoyed if they've got something else you know or if you're going to a techno night and someone starts playing grime and people are like you know I've had that a few times as well around the world where it's like you're playing stuff and people are like play some techno, play some techno, you know, and it's like, sorry, I'm kind of playing what I want to play tonight, so, you know, just have to go with it. So, I mean, I think there's always the open-minded, there's always the closed-minded, but I suppose it's kind of trying to bring the closed-minded people in. And I think perhaps now even the more closed-minded people are slightly more open to things just because of... Yeah, you've had Grime and Dubstep opening up a different kind of rhythmic potential and then you've got people who are more happy to kind of mix it up, I guess. You know, there's DJs, whether it's, I don't know, One Man or Jackmaster or Ben UFO or, you know, these kind of like DJs, DJs who appeal to young and old and they're kind of setting the scene for things and they might play, you know. R&B or house or techno or drum and bass or some noise music or you know so I think yeah I think people are a little bit more stuff you know tell me a bit about how you guys would put together one of these wonky drum patterns is it just a lot of experimentation or are you kind of like setting up you know, compute program in a certain way? Is it algorithmic? It's just, I mean, you know, Al really is the kind of the beat master in terms of, I mean, he's a drummer. So like I'm a bass player by, by trade kind of thing. So we kind of come in at different angles, I guess. When I finally saw, I saw our drum using a drum kit and I was like, right. I get it now. Do you know what I mean? It's kind of like I can see why he's so hyper about his beats. I mean, like when he's putting a beat together, it's kind of like he's almost like in a trance. Do you know what I mean? And I'm kind of there suggesting things and popping things in. But a lot of the time it's kind of like Al just following, obviously, something to it. It's not his logical conclusion, but just kind of like. working it I guess you know and it somehow becomes this you know different beast and it is nice to push it and make it make it different but still obviously try and make it work within yeah like the context of this is going to be played on a sound system to a bunch of people dancing you know it's it's got to be funky yeah no i see do you guys have um quite defined roles when you're working together to a certain degree i guess i mean like i said al is is the hyper beat sort of edit kind of like man and i'm perhaps more kind of like sort of sound effects sonics and and kind of arrangement i guess that's always what i used to do even when i was in a band we'd kind of The guitarists in the band would come up with the main core riffs and then me and the drummer would kind of like arrange it out and suggest ways of doing it differently or time things out so they would happen differently. So it's kind of like... Obviously at different times roles change, but a lot of the time it could be something that I've started on my setup and then I take it to Al and he sort of furthers it and then both of us together will then kind of like finish it off kind of thing, you know? So it's kind of like my bits are probably more chaotic and unfinished and then Al's kind of mindset comes in. takes it in a different way and then sets it into more of a kind of a finished inverted commas tune or whatever. Yeah, no, I see. And always complimentary. You guys aren't scrapping, are you? Well, you know, it's an interesting thing, isn't it? Like collaboration, it's like, you know, I think we are often pulling in quite different directions, weirdly, but I think we're both happy. I mean, you know, it sounds like a bit of a cliche, but you kind I really think it should be like this, but they obviously really don't. So I'll step back for a bit. And you both, as long as you keep both doing that fairly regularly, then I think you end up with something that you're both. sort of happy with you know like any relationship exactly it is it is it's like you know it's like it's knowing when to just sort of like keep quiet and let someone pursue what they think is going to work basically because it's like there's no point damning something before it's really started you know it's kind of like well i might think that that's not really the way this team is supposed to go and then 10-15 minutes later i'm like ah, right, okay, and then it's turned into something else. Yeah, no, no, I see. So this is just the latest in a kind of long line of collaborations for you. You sort of mentioned the band you were in that was sort of back in the mid-90s, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah. You were called the Monsoon? The Monsoon Bassoon, yeah. Yeah, yeah, and you had some popularity, right? We had some sort of, you know, cult, inverted comm At the time, it was quite a sort of stuff like psychedelia and prog and even folk or anything else like that wasn't really the sort of done thing. And we sounded like quite heavily like that, I guess. So we were kind of like hated. We split audiences. So, you know, like a lot of people, the people that loved us really loved us. And then a lot of people come and go like, oh, my God, what's this? horrible program right i see you know so you're saying you were kind of in opposition to what was popular like pretty much i mean like another five or ten years later i think it would have been a different story because you know generally the the indie fan now i think understands more or listens to more psychedelic music more of out there music you know At the time, it was reasonably straight. I mean, you had obviously people like Radiohead and Mogwai and stuff like that who were massive, who were pushing things in quite an interesting way. But I guess we had like really obscure time signatures and we had flute and clarinet and saxophone and stuff like this, which, you know, like I think people hear a flute and they just think prog, you know. Jethro Tull. And, you know, we had at one point three or four people at the NME really behind us, which was quite weird because they'd always been very, very sort of dismissive. And then there was a chap who ran Fierce Panda Records. Now I'm going to forget his name really embarrassingly, but he really got behind us. And I'm actually put us on a Fierce Panda sort of. compilation EP which at the time was quite a kind of quite a sort of big thing because it was kind of like you know Coldplay, Super Furry Animals, you know, so many different bands had started on Fierce Panda, you know, or been given a leg up by Fierce Panda. Our track was, I think, the only track that didn't get played on radio. So it's kind of like, that's the kind of place we were coming from. But then we got three singles of the week in a row from the animals. But then the same month that we got one of the Singles of the Week, we got Worst Singles of the Week in the Melody Maker as well, which I've got proudly pasted into my little scrapbook. Pretty funny. Do you ever listen back to any of this stuff? Yeah, a little bit, man. I mean, one of my friends who I was in the band with is still very much involved in experimental and sort of prog and just interesting music. So, I mean, he's still making really interesting stuff and I kind of think, wow, where would we have ended up if we'd have carried on? But yeah, I listen back and I'm proud of what we did. It was kind of produced, our album was produced by someone that we really were obsessed by throughout our kind of younger years. a chap called Tim Smith from a band called Cardiacs. So really that was like a dream come true, having a production from him, you know, so that's a real proud moment is the fact that we've got this, you know, hour's worth of music produced by one of our kind of heroes and I think it sort of stands up still, you know. No, for sure. And were you listening to much dance? electronic music around this time? Yeah, yeah, definitely. It was hard to try and get any of that influence into the band really because it was, you know, it was guitars and drums and so on. But yeah, throughout that time. I was always, you know, raving and listening to music. And we all listened to it collectively. I mean, the band all loved things that I would bring, you know, like Aphex Twin and Ortega and all this kind of stuff. But other than just some of the sort of mathematic... nature of the riffs there wasn't really a way of bringing the sonics in because we didn't really have synths or drum machines or computers you know we were very much a traditional inverted commas you know musical instrument band but yeah always always inspired by that stuff you told us the first interview we ever did with you actually I think it was like back in 2007 or 8 that after the band split you felt maybe a little bit lost and wasn't really until you got yourself on the music production course you mentioned that you you know kind of found your way a little bit yeah is it just a case of really having something to like zero in on and sort of focus on yeah I mean as a as a bass player I guess you know and not being a principal songwriter in the band I was always more of a kind of a companyist slash arranger you know and loved it but obviously had never really sort of taken the reins and equally my brushes with with musical technology I mean you know throughout my teenage years we'd all been you know we'd all been raving and we had a friend who had you know the setup kind of thing you know which obviously in those days it was much harder to put a setup together you know it was kind of like mixing desk various synths sampler you know kind of like and you need to get it all working together this kind of stuff so really I just sort of had a chance vaguely tinker on it rather than sit in the driving seat and understand any of this stuff I wasn't very technically technical minded at that time so um yeah I guess being forced to just you know I went and did this course at Bath Spa creative music technology and that was when I first had my own computer and my own sort of software and and then was I guess inspired by The fact that I knew that early Grime and early Dubstep was made on Fruity Loops. So I got myself a copy of Fruity Loops. I mean, did you go into the course with the aim of being a solo electronic music producer? I didn't really have, I don't think I had any, I mean, it was definitely inspired by the fact that I was going to Forward and hearing this music and then reading these interviews and it was like, you know, Benga and Scream were like 15 years old or something and they were making music on Fruity Loops and I was like, wow, what's this? What's this? Fruity Loops like that which sounded quite simple and quick to use which it was so my early tunes were all made in that and yeah I guess that's sort of being at university gave me the time and the headspace I guess to kind of like to pursue that you know and also to be surrounded by people that were on a similar journey or whatever you know who would be able to help me. you know, if you're stuck on something, they can help you, you know, you can help them with certain things. You know, they were younger than me, but they had more technical knowledge, and I was older than them, but I had more sort of musical experience. So it was kind of like a good mixture of influences, I guess, you know? Yeah, did you get a lot out of the course? Massive amounts, yeah, it was absolutely brilliant, you know, highly recommend the course itself, and obviously And they really inspire you to sort of think differently about music. I mean, again, I came from a slightly more, I was 27 when I started and had been listening to experimental music or avant-garde music through my work with the band. But I think a lot of the younger guys had never heard stuff like that. You know, I'd never thought about concepts in terms of outside of just making music. making beats or making a track or making dance music or whatever. So yeah, I mean the course definitely. and it develops every year and they've got brilliant equipment and yeah, it's just kind of like pursuing sonic art, I guess. Yeah, sure. Was it around this time that you were also working in record shops? I know you'd had like a history of working in record shops. Yeah, yeah. I mean, not at that time. I'd worked in London when I was in the band at a second-hand record shop, which I'm working at again now. Oh, right. Yeah, after a long gap. Yeah. So, yeah. Which one? It's had various names over the years. Record and Tape Exchange. Then it's Music and Video Exchange. Now it's officially Music and Goods Exchange as the formats change. But it has been there literally since like 1968, you know, so it's the oldest kind of like, you know, secondhand record shop that's still going in London. It's a total sort of weird institution, really. but an amazing place to get inspired by music because you're working with kind of people who are sort of experts and massive fans and record diggers of just every sort of different type of music, really. So it's a very, very cool place to be if you're into music. Yeah. And I assume you're still sort of hardcore into digging. Yeah. I love records I always have done I mean and it's kind of one of the few things that I have much sort of deep knowledge about or whatever so it's kind of like it's my sort of passion and yeah so obviously living in London and working at these shops is it's just brilliant because different stuff comes through the door every day you know there's you never know what's going to come in and there's collections of every style of music and and um Yeah, you know, you get the chance to see and listen to some amazing records, basically. Sure. And what is it that sort of appeals to you about sifting through records? I mean, you've talked about it in quite glowing terms in the past. I just wonder what it was about that headspace that really like does it for you. It's one of those weird things, isn't it? It's like an itch that you kind of can't scratch. I mean, like the actual process of... digging can sometimes feel like work I guess I mean like through the shop as well you meet quite a lot of record dealers and people that you know travel the world doing this kind of stuff and it's like a lot of the time they're like you know it's like it sometimes isn't a fun process it's like anything isn't it you know you're kind of yeah you're going into dusty basements or warehouses or junk shops or whatever thrift stores But it's when you find interesting stuff, it's kind of amazing, really. It's kind of like, you know, I always sort of see it as, you know, these records are like capsules of energy and information. And you're flicking through all these different ones of every single one of those records has had a whole story around it of how it came to be made, you know. completely insane when you think about it, you know, and there it is physically in front of you. And then, you know, you could go through a hundred things that you don't recognize or whatever, or you don't want, and then something will jump out at you, you know? And it's kind of like, I guess it's just that kind of like that fun and excitement of not knowing what's there, you know? Chasing that dragon. Absolutely. Absolutely. What's the general feeling among kind of London record shops at the moment as to like the health of the scene, if you like? What's the mood like? It's a funny one because obviously the place where I work has been there for many, many years and kind of like. You know, you heard the sort of the cliche of people in record stores that, you know, hey, every day is record store day and all this kind of thing. You know, it's kind of like, you know, we'll kind of be there sort of like regardless really of trends. But obviously it's really interesting seeing the way things kind of change as well. So, I mean, you know, you find a lot of young people now who are getting their first record player. you know, and so they're coming in and buying their first records and they're buying records that say their mum and dad had or, you know, it's kind of like, it's kind of different because obviously when I was there last time, you didn't really get those kind of people. This was a long, you know, this was like, I guess, mid to late 90s. Different type of person was buying records then, you know. and kids, inverted commas, were obviously buying CDs, do you know what I mean? And then obviously they went on to files, but now they're going back to records again, you know, because it's like... it's slightly more romantic it's slightly more it's like oh my mum and dad used to have these or you know you get quite a lot of kids come in and buy some records and then say do you know anywhere you can buy a record player around here do you know what I mean you know so it's kind of like that's the kind of way round it is now I think you know so you've seen good numbers of young people come through then yeah definitely and it's funny you know there's all the young kids coming in to buy grime and dubstep and stuff i mean for me that's quite interesting because that's a scene that i was involved in but now it's kind of like you don't see those records much anymore so when there's a big collection in you know and it's a whole different strata of people it's young middle class kids coming in and buying it rather than the original grime kids coming and buying it because they're off doing something else do you know so it's kind of yeah it's the cycles of life you know so it's been of your story so i wonder if you could kind of tell us where you were when sort of dubstep and grime started filtering through to you and kind of what that experience did to you well i mean I guess the first place that I heard it, I guess before it was even called dubstep. I mean, so it was kind of like it was just because a friend had recommended to go to forward basically a plastic people. I mean, plastic people is obviously no longer no longer running, which is a real shame, I think, for sort of London clubs and everything. Really, at that time, you know. In terms of sound systems, it was just an incredible sound system, really. I hadn't heard music of that volume and quality really since kind of like, I guess, drum and bass, kind of like the era. I mean, I'm wearing a t-shirt today, sort of metalheads kind of style, where it's like, it's extreme volume, but it's extremely clear sound and it's extremely futuristic music. And it's, you don't know who it's by, you don't know what it is. It totally mysterious mass you know that's what I got really when I sort of like entered into into forward I mean you know maybe only 20 people 30 people there but just sort of like a wall of sound and kind of and and like this mysterious mysterious stuff really I guess we started going just on the cusp when it was turning from garage into what would be called I guess dubstep And I remember people kind of like whispering one night and it was like, oh, you know, digital mystics are coming down and playing and like Hatcher's been playing it. And I remember seeing Hatcher a couple of times and I almost didn't get it the first couple of times. I was like, I kind of like this, but it's kind of really weird and it's wonky and it's strange and there's no sort of like... discernible breakdowns or sort of, you know, melodies or, you know, it's kind of like, what is this? But I kind of stuck with it a couple of times. I was like, and then, yeah, by about the third time I went, it was like, wow, this is, this is bonkers. Yeah, that was, I guess that was the era of, of, of Scream and Loafer and all these different people. making tunes that I guess, yes, still didn't, it wasn't really defined. So it was very free and very, I guess for me, I just, I just couldn't get enough of it basically. Um, and was, was hooked in terms of like. a sound and in terms of even just like the dub plate culture and you know all these dub plates were getting played you know you'd look over the booth and every single dub plate would be a transition dub plate so it's kind of like what's this transition place you know like um it's like right okay it's a cutting house or what's the cut i know what a cutting house is but okay they're making dub plates and it's but they're all from around there you know so it's like this is where Hatcher used to cut dub plates and so therefore everybody else would cut dub plates there. And it was like, you know, you get this quality of sound and they were making their tunes, I guess, to be heard down at Forward. You know, you'd hear tunes. That was my first experience of hearing a tune getting broken at a club, you know. So it's kind of like, maybe on very small scale, it might only be like 100 or 150 people maximum going crazy to a tune. hear that tune come in a couple of times you're like what is it what is it and you know I remember there was a tune by Toasty called The Knowledge which was like you know really really massive at the time and I remember hearing that for the first time down there and then Scuba was on the dance floor and he was like just sign this mate just sign this and it was kind of like wow you know I've never really seen that happen where it was like I love this tune everybody loves this tune it's really fresh and he's wicked do you know so it's like yeah quite mind-blowing what were some of the conversations on the dance floors like around that time you know with the lack of information a lot of sort of like you know mystery surrounding this music it was like a case of like sharing information or i guess there was a bunch of us that were probably you know because we were outside the scene you know there was the people who were making it and their friends and the people that came from the kind of more garage angle of of Hatcher and Crazy D and Croydon and stuff. We were kind of like the new converts, I guess, who, yeah, so we struck up, it was, it was like a little gang, there was friendship. It was, you know, it was like a little tribe, really. But I mean, in terms of, you know, you didn't really talk on the dance floor because it wasn't possible because it was so loud. So you would be in this dark room for two or three hours or four hours at a time sometimes. That's what I used to love about it, really. I didn't really used to go out to drink. I used to go out to dance. And the great thing about Plastic People was, you know The curtain was across. It was dark. You know, the music's blaring. If you wanted to go and have a drink, you'd go and have a drink outside. And it's kind of like, it was separate. It was like, you know, you're there. It was almost like, you know, without being cheesy, it was like going to sort of church or something in the same way that Mala talks about. DMZ, it's like, it's meditate on base weight, you know, it's kind of, you come to kind of meditate almost, you come to kind of lose yourself, you know, obviously as the club became more popular, it did become more, it was a Friday night, Shoreditch club, it would get very busy, it would get a little bit rowdier, the music got a little bit rowdier as well with the kind of grimy stuff and so it did change, you know, it The vibe changed many times over the years, you know. But I used to like it when there was a little bit more room, I guess, and it was more about the meditation side. It started to get very jump up, I guess, at one point, which is still a great energy, but it's a different kind of energy. And people were getting quite rowdy and pushing each other. It was almost like a mosh pit. And you could see how it kind of went into that EDM-ish, bro-steppy-ish, more male characteristics of like, we're going to push each other on the dance floor. And, you know, it's kind of like, and I guess that's probably when I not lost interest. It was just sort of like, well, OK, that's kind of going that way. Yeah, it sort of definitely runs counter to the original. Yeah, you could see other people going different ways, you know. And was it at Forward you met Sam, as in Sam Shackleton? Sam, yeah, well, we started going to Forward together, but we met through someone actually at the record shop, so a mutual friend that I was working with. So we all started going out together around that time. And yeah, Forward was... was our little kind of spot really. I then moved away to study, but I kept coming back. And so I'd meet up and we'd go to the club and then, you know, we'd be listening to the radio in between. And then, and Sam was making some of his own music at the time. He'd been doing some sort of like strange rhythm sort of experiments on little drum machines and stuff with a friend. But then he'd also been doing stuff, I think it was in Reason then. So just sort of like trying to make beats and, you know, we really liked them. And I was trying to make a few beats on my Fruity Loops stuff. And that's kind of how... the skull disco thing happened i guess is is we were directly inspired by the club and by the records that were coming out and it was like well you know i mean i thought his tunes were good enough he probably thought mine were good enough and and so it was like let's kind of do it kind of thing yeah and i understand you've talked before about like a particular vision or like sam had this like idea in his mind that he wanted to kind of get towards or achieve like how would you define what that was like did you guys talk about it much before the label to be honest not not really it was more like it was just kind of like you know sam's got these tunes and and had an idea of of obviously the artwork and the name you know that's something that i think obviously sam could probably talk about better than me but it's kind of like it's very representative of sam's mindset i think in the sense that It included, obviously, cosmic and mythical and tribal kind of references, but also a bit of a pun in the name of Skull Disco, you know? So it's kind of like Skull Disco, you know? But, like, yeah, I guess he had Zeke Clough doing the artwork, and that always meant that it was going to get noticed because it's, you know, such amazing artwork. But, you know, that... company say that was Sam's influence do you know what I mean that was his thing that he put together they were friends from putting fanzines together on punk and noise music sort of years before I came from somewhere completely different you know but we just met over the kind of the music that was you know getting played at Forward you know. So it's actually been almost 10 years since the first 12 inch came out. there might actually be people listening who are sort of not aware of the label. How would you sort of give a quick summary of the vibe you were kind of going for with the music? I guess, I mean, if you listen to Sam's music, I guess from then and up to now, you can really hear his sort of rhythmic vision, I guess. I mean, we were, there was a tune by Mala called Conference. of Digital Mystics and at the time that was kind of like you know definitely one of the things that we inspired to which was this kind of like crazy sort of tribal dubby but ravey kind of music but it sounded you know it sounded ancient it sounded modern you know and I think I think Sam kind of captures that really in the stuff that he makes for me personally I guess I was pursuing, I mean, I was just trying to make tunes, I think, that sounded like what I was hearing, you know? So, I mean, I was really into Scream and Code Nine and Vexed as well. So that kind of coming from a slightly more noisy kind of background. So I guess the early stuff was, it was just experiments, you know, in that sound and probably quite basic compared to other stuff that was around. It wasn't, we didn't know what we were doing production wise. We didn't know what we were doing technology wise so much. It was very much just like on a laptop using what we had in front of us. And obviously it's developed from there, but it was, yeah, I guess. mythical, cosmic bass music. That works for me. You guys famously limited the amount of releases that you put out. Looking back on that, do you think that was kind of the right decision? Do you think you could have released more music or did it have to exist just... you know, in that very set. Yeah, I think it had kind of run its course. I mean, by about release six or seven on the label anyway, I mean, I was, my DJ career had taken off. So I was DJing all over the place every weekend and actually was finding it harder to finish tunes. Whereas Sam was really just sort of like heads down in the studio the whole time. So it ended up being more like... his kind of vehicle then for his tunes. And I think he had done that. You know, we'd managed to involve a few of the people that we liked in some remixes. So people like T++ and, you know, Badawi and so on. So, you know, we'd done a release with me and Peverelist. And then there'd been a couple of just Sam Shackleton releases. So I think, you know, it was Sam really that kind of pulled the plug. I mean, I probably would have just carried on, you know, in terms of like, if we had tunes, keep putting them out. But I think it was totally the right thing to do. I think, you know, he needed to go his way. Me and Sam met in the middle on a certain sound, but we had very different tastes, really. Do you know what I mean? So I think it was right for us to... We met for a little bit in the middle and then we kind of went on our own ways again, you know? Yeah, and I understand. So there was some crossover as well with you starting Apple Pips, which I guess came up at a time where people were moving away a little bit from the standard dubstep template and were going into like... other sounds and being influenced by other things. Was a little bit like the inspiration behind the label trying to capture some of this, you know, excitement and creativity that was coming out of those fusions, if you like? Definitely, yeah. I mean, like, you know, for me, it was a very exciting time in terms of travelling the world, meeting lots of different people, you know, like meeting different hubs of producers in different cities. taking this music that either my friends were making in Bristol or the people that I'd connected with across the world and taking their music and playing it around the world. It was an amazing thing. And being given the opportunity opportunity to start a label I guess by ST Holdings I mean it was it was through through Martin the producer um sort of having some tracks and um you know he'd been sort of saying like oh you know I love Skull Disco you know maybe we could do something on Skull Disco and it was like well we're not really doing Skull Disco but maybe I'm thinking of doing something myself you know and he's like right cool well I've got these tracks have a listen and so it kind of started quite naturally from that but then it was yeah it was nice to have a vehicle for tunes that that I was either getting past and then playing you know it was um and yeah that I guess the styles you know coming out of bass music and dubstep and kind of like opening people's ears to other things as well you know so it was people kept people People were very, people who were into that sound were very into that sound, you know, and then it started to sort of fracture. And I think that was a really interesting time to be able to kind of play a broad spectrum of different genres, I guess. people that had perhaps just been listening to kind of 140 stuff for quite a few years, you know, and some of them really appreciated it, some of them didn't, but it was kind of like, yeah, it was a fun time. I mean, do you think the original spirit of the label kind of persisted over the years? Yeah, yeah, I mean, like... Did your aims change at all? Yeah, I suppose I was DJing, I was DJing a lot and... I guess my, the tunes that I was putting out came from a sort of like a tighter circle of people, I guess, that I was living with. and interacting with down in Bristol, you know? So it was kind of like, we always had our own funny little scene down there in terms of even within the Bristol thing, me and my mates were kind of like, we were sat on the peripherals, you know, we were part of it, but we were also sort of, you know, we didn't fit into one sort of style or sound really, you know? So you had people like Pinch pursuing his thing, you had people like... pev pursuing his thing um and we had our own funny little gang of people as well in the apple pips thing which was yeah i mean i'm proud of the variety of the music that we put out and i'm proud of the fact that we tried to play that when we went out you know so around the time of the label starting was when you started jumping in the studio with lots of different people like pev gatekeeper ramadan man october owl Were you finding that all of these partnerships were kind of different and distinct in their own way? Like, would your role change through the different partnerships? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I guess, like, for me, you know, it was fun just to go and kind of... vibe with people in different studios you know so it's kind of like I've always found other people's energy quite interesting to kind of go and react with interact with sorry and yeah each one of those sort of collaborations had had different different fun points about it you know I loved working with October that's got a certain vibe his studio's got a different sound you know and it's obviously about what you do around it as well kind of thing you know so sort of like just listening to music chatting watching a film hanging out you know it's like you know that's a beautiful thing to be sort of involved in and each one of those ones brought me different things or whatever you know so yeah it was it was a it was a it was a fun time of uh you know some quite quite sort of interesting stuff got made, I think, you know. You've described yourself as a tinkerer in the past. Do you think collaboration is kind of a way to get around that, sort of focus you a little bit? Definitely, yeah. I mean, I'm lucky to have a lot of friends who are very sort of single-minded and pursue their sort of their sonic goal. I mean, I'm sure they'd all probably say that they were unfocused sometimes, but to me, they seem like they've got, they've got like a vision and they've got kind of like, I guess, yeah, ways of working in the studio that perhaps I don't, you know? So I think I sort of come in as a different influence in there. you know and and kind of like you know whether it was bringing different things to sample or jamming in different ways on the synths or you know i think everybody always gets something slightly different out of it you know it's like you both work in a way that perhaps you normally wouldn't work you know yeah so that's that's that's that's the strength of it for me you know slightly cliche question but is there like a dream collaboration that you would uh want to get stuck into God, blimey. Collaboration. It's hard, isn't it? Because I think there's some people that definitely shouldn't collaborate. You know, there's some people that just, you know. should always be doing stuff, you know, 100% themselves, you know. It's like me and Sam Shackleton tried to collaborate once, I think, and it just didn't work, you know. And it's kind of like, that makes sense, do you know what I mean? It's like, you know, he's doing his thing, you know. But I don't know. I mean, I'd like to... I'd like to see how Aphex Twin works in the studio, but there's obviously no way you'd ever want to try and collaborate. That's ridiculous. But like, you know, even if I could just sort of... Peering over the shoulder. Yeah, exactly. Just sort of like fly-on-the-wall style. That'd be pretty cool. So the records you've released over the last five years have been kind of full of little stylistic twists and turns, if you like. I don't think we how you've been DJing as well with those two things being kind of in lockstep, would you say? Yeah, to a degree. I mean, I think DJing-wise, you know, I started to realise... Once I had gone through the phase of letting the crowds know that I was going to kind of play what I wanted to play, having a bit of backlash from certain places where it was like, well, you're not playing dubstep anymore, so, you know. But having the freedom, also getting more bookings in places for a longer time and the more European style of, right, you're playing for three hours and you really... can do what you want. You know, obviously certain places there's more pressure to sort of keep the dance floor going. or to sort of fit in or whatever, but then it's kind of realizing that actually after an hour and a half, you can just sort of stop and just play exactly what you want really, you know, and I kind of realized that. And yeah, I mean, with the exception of, I guess I've never really tried to make drum and bass, but it's kind of like, that was what was so fun is realizing that you can stop and you can just play some ambient stuff for 10 minutes, you can play some. go into half an hour of drum and bass, you can go into hip hop, you can go into reggae, whatever, you know. So, yeah, I guess, you know, it's broadly reflective of those things, you know. Yeah. I mean, how would you sort of define the last few years? Has it been a case of kind of following your nose and seeing what was exciting you at the time? Yeah. I mean, I guess musically, you know, there's certain people that... you know, I will always sort of play tunes by, do you know what I mean? So it's like, and I will always go to for inspiration. So whether it's, you know, from the bass-ish music scene. it's pev and liberty or count and all that lot or kind of like pinch and the stuff that he does or 2562 made up sound yo these are sort of core things that i'll always go back to and i'll always play because they're always making something interesting and then you know people like even like addison groove or something you know it's like I guess I'm lucky to have known some very idiosyncratic and very sort of like individual musicians. And so I always go back to their stuff and sort of listen to what they're doing now and try and draw inspiration from that. And then, you know, within that, it's the stuff that I'm making myself and that my friends close to me are making, you know. I mean, does it feel less necessary these days to sort of pin down and define what you're doing? you do as a DJ and producer? Yeah I like to like to kind of leave it open really you know it's like try not to plan too much and you know I mean I don't DJ out half as much as I used to you know so it's kind of different now it's kind of more it's it's um I guess it's getting exciting again for the reason that it's like less familiar whereas at one point I was playing two or three times a week you know like week in week out now it's kind of more like all right I'm getting the chance to play some records again this is going to be fun what shall I put in the bag you know and I'm getting a bit more bold I guess do you know what I mean you know and also just enjoying it a lot again you know yeah something we were talking about in the little three cuts film we did a couple years ago where we were kind of discussing the relationship between releases and gigs have you still kind of continue to see a direct correlation between these things yeah to a certain degree i mean obviously we've been working on the kind of like the the rns sort of album stuff for quite a while and so when you're working on a project like that you know you hope for sort of gigs and stuff straight away but obviously it needs it needs time to kind of germinate and kind of take hold out in the world and i think that's kind of what you forget is that you know Yeah, you've got to spend your time making the music, then you've got to spend your time putting the music out there, and then there's also... just sort of a gestation period where obviously people are listening to it at home, people are passing it to their mates, people are listening to it on their headphones, you know, and it's kind of like, you know, you need to give it some months just to kind of settle in, I think, you know, so it's kind of like, yeah, yeah, in terms of getting music out there and gigs, yeah, it's still obviously that's the main. that's the main thing that's going to affect your, your sort of like your schedule or whatever, you know, but, um, yeah, but we're sort of starting to get things with all, with, with, with second story and Apple blim. And yeah, we'll see how that goes over the next six months. And obviously we're starting to put together the sort of like the next album and stuff like that. So hopefully it will just kind of, it will grow and we'll get more opportunity to sort of play as that happens. So we're talking as well in the film about this idea or aim of yours to achieve a slightly better balance between your professional life and social life. Is that something you've... feel like you've got to a good place. It's like an ongoing problem for people in the industry. It's getting there. I mean, like, you know, in terms of, I mean, I've just recently moved back to London kind of thing. And that's sort of mainly inspired by. the fact that we've got this record deal with R&S. So therefore, you know, we've got work to do over the next few years. So Alec had already moved up here a year or more ago. So, you know, it's directly inspired by that. But yeah, it's been strange leaving the kind of bosom of Bristol as well and the kind of like the friends and the producers that you know down there, you know, so. I think creatively I still haven't sort of like found my flow again here. I've been here sort of a few months now, but luckily I've got quite a backlog of music, which is kind of like ready to roll kind of thing, you know? So, which was made in a quite intense burst in Bristol just before I left. So it's kind of like, hopefully I can kind of try and get that out into the world. And then by the time that's out there, I can. be more settled here and more creative here. Do you like living in London generally? Yeah, I mean, it's been a bit of a mind blower. I mean, like, it's because it's been so long. I mean, I lived here for, yeah, eight or nine years when I was quite young, sort of like 18 to sort of 26, 27. So it's a completely different place, I feel, now. It's still the same amount of energy in the same different sort of cultures and so on. Yeah, I kind of thought, oh, yeah, it'll be a breeze. I know what London's like, you know, I remember. And it's like, whoa, it's very different, you know, especially when you've been somewhere like Bristol for so long, which is such a sort of close-knit, very laid-back, you know, very chilled place. Yeah, sure. I'm sure people continue to associate you with Bristol. Yeah, yeah, it's weird. It's weird. I still don't feel like a Londoner again, whereas when I lived here before, I definitely felt like Hackney was kind of like my home. That's where I'd lived the longest in my life kind of thing. So it was kind of like, yeah, Hackney's home. But now I definitely felt that Bristol was home. So it's, who knows? I'll give it some time. aspects of London life that I'm sort of like concerned by and then there's others that I'm very enthused by, as ever I suppose. Yeah, I understand. So how's the upcoming months looking for you? What have we got? I mean, I've got a couple of releases, just... I've got my first release, strangely, on Temper Records. So even though I did the mix for them many moons ago, I'm releasing something on Temper this summer. They're like three tracks, something a bit different. One of the tracks got played by Scuba on his Essential mix, so you can check it out. there if you want to chat a track called Avery and then some kind of weird sort of noisy stuff on the B sides kind of droney kind of like ambient kind of weird stuff and then I've got remix coming out on K7 of of of Wilsall around the same time I think and then yeah I've got these bunch of tunes basically that I'm just sort of in talks with various people about putting out you know so really it's trying to get a lot of of the summer, try and write as much as possible with Second Story for our second album. And yeah, we've got various kind of like festivals and live shows we're playing at Free Rotation, which obviously is a mega one for us. I mean, I've still not actually been. So all my friends have been and most of my musical sort of companions. patriots have all played there and raved about how good it is so that was really amazing to get that offer come in that was that was like a real kind of like oh yeah we must be doing something right kind of thing you know um so we've got that we've got a couple other things around europe there will be another fabric thing at some point but yeah just and then i mean i've started lots of new music since i've been up here but um and it's quite different again so hopefully trying to finish some of that over the summer as well you mentioned the uh temper compilation there have you listened back to that the last couple years it's just um you know i think for many people uh but kind of really captured the spirit of the times you know real seminal mix yeah I just wondered what your relationship was yeah I haven't listened to it in a while actually I think I've been a bit scared to over the last year or two in case I just sort of think like oh no it's never I'm never gonna never gonna have it as good as that again you know because it because it was it was like a really exciting time and I was getting given all this music by all these crazy producers and I'm in a slightly different place now I'm more kind of like it's more about me trying to make music now whereas at that point I wasn't even I was I was making the odd thing but at that point I really really was a DJ thing for me at that time it was like you know I was very enthused by the Bristol music you know it was like I was getting past tunes by Rob Smith you know sort of like one of one of the sort of originators and Pinch and Pev and 2562 and all these different things so it's like yeah you know it's a different time it's a different kind of genre almost and i guess now i'm more just trying to concentrate on music that comes from my head rather than other people this kind of thing you know but yeah i think it stands up to the test of time and and i think it's a testament to the music that was getting made then you know Thank you.
