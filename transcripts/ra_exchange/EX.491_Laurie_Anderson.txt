*whistling* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with the American artist and musician Laurie Anderson. Over five decades, Anderson has been a crucial connecting point between the American avant-garde and the world of music. Although she's best known for topping the charts with the 1981 hit "Oh Superman," it's her experience in the worlds of performance and multimedia art that shape her deep and lasting contribution to culture. Here she speaks to Jordan Rothlein about ideas shaping her latest work, Songs from the Bardo, covering everything from Tibetan Buddhism to technology, death, and the role of art at the end of the world. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Laurie Anderson is up next. Suffering is no use. Even though you are attached to your relatives and family, it is no use. So do not be attached. Invoke the Lord of great compassion and there will be no suffering or fear. I wanted to start out by asking you about songs from the bardo I'm hesitant to call it your new album because it's a collaborative piece. Is that right? It is a collaborative piece, yeah. It's not really my new album, but it's an interesting project because we just did the first version of this with zero rehearsal. We didn't even meet each other. before this. We just showed up at the Rubin Museum. Tenzin started to read. I started to read. Tenzin started to play. Rubin started to play. Jesse started to play. And then we just suddenly were at the end of it. have to say, when you don't rehearse, or don't even read what it is before you begin, you say the words in a different way. Because you're seeing them for the first time. And so are the people listening. So it's very intense. It's very now. And it felt very ritualistic, you know. So it was very much in the spirit of what that piece is. And it was a translation. I was familiar with it because I knew a lot about that from studying with Robert Thurman. who has done a really beautiful, I guess it's five CD collection of In the Between, it's called. And it's the first. lines of that are i have to tell you this is the tibetan book of the dead but the first thing i have to say is there are no dead people let me repeat no dead people there are no dead people you're like wait a second where is this going so takes you through the bardo and what happens. And I've been thinking about that a lot in the last few days. And I actually read that text yesterday, the whole thing, while I was sitting in a funeral home with the poet John Giorno. He was a very good friend of mine. And he was a Tibetan Buddhist as well, as I am. and he's lying there in his coffin, you know, and I was there with Ann Waldman, who is a poet, and also had worked with him a lot. Now, this is the guy who was the model for Warhol's sleep, okay? He was the guy who Warhol famously filmed. asleep for not eight hours, but maybe six hours. You see his chest rising and falling and rising and falling. It's in the new MoMA that just opened up. It's very prominently displayed because it's a very iconic Warhol work of art, sleep. Yeah, it's one of the most, maybe one of the most infamous ones and like a catalog of infamous artworks. In a catalog of infamous, sleep is right up there. Sure. So I was just watching Johnny in his coffin thinking, wow, I wish he'd wink at me or something. He was, his spirit was, if there's anybody ready to die, it was John Giorno. He wrote about it all the time. He also wrote a book on, a poem called Bite the Tongue of the Corpse. So Anne Waldman bent down to kiss him and she said, should I bite, pull out his tongue and bite it? That would be about the most transgressive thing I could think of doing, the most John Journal thing I could think of doing. She didn't do it because, well, his mouth was glued shut, for one thing. I don't know if this is something for a podcast, but go for it, you know, because, you know, John went for it, and DeBardo goes for it. It makes no... The Tibetan Book of the Dead goes for it. It's all about what happens when you lose your body, you know. It's very hardcore, and there are lots of things about skeletons full of blood. Oh, yeah. You know, it's very Halloween. It's very wild. And, of course, these Halloween figures are the fierce warriors that you need to fight against the things that you have that need cutting. like your jealousy, like your fear, those things don't just go away because you say, oh, I shouldn't be afraid. You need something to scare them away. So that's what these demons are for. Yeah, I was struck listening to the record, I mean, by a number of things. I think for anybody who is not super familiar with Tibetan Buddhism, some of the imagery and sort of the vibe of the whole thing is maybe quite different than what a lot of people would just expect, right? I don't know what people expect. Exactly. I really don't. I stopped wondering that a long time ago. I like adventurous listeners. Oh, absolutely. What's that? Check it out. Wow. Skulls full of blood. Oh, it's fantastic. But I also was really struck by the sort of intensity of it, but it never felt overly intense. And there's a sort of like a joy maybe or this, I don't know, kind of overall... optimistic sure it's very optimistic it's very optimistic it's not and i just noticed yesterday when i went to this funeral home there was also another funeral going on and everyone was crying there was a long line of people wearing all black and they were all crying our funeral, everyone's wearing really colorful clothes and they're laughing and having a good time. And John was full of joy. He wrote a million things about dying and what that adventure might be. And so a lot of Tibetans came to, or not Tibetans, people who are, you know, artists and meditators and people who are not like... who have thought about this, it's not a shock to us that we're going to die, particularly. I had a feeling like with the other funeral, it was like so shocking to them that their friend died. They were like, what? So John was always writing about it and a very funny, wonderful person who invented dilapone and many beautiful works about what it means to turn into light. So it was a kind of... of a celebration of John's life. You know, for a couple of people who are his nearest and dearest, they were crying. Okay. I mean, I'm not just saying you don't feel like crying when you're losing your partner. You do. It's not a thing where you're going, oh, fine. John was fine. You know, you're crying. But for us as friends, We were having what could be called a good time. Obviously, when someone leaves this earth, there's some sadness to it. But I think... What I'm hearing from you is that, you know, and I think this ties back to songs from the Bardo. It absolutely does. And this is that, you know, what you said at the very beginning of this conversation, like, you know, it's not about dying. There are no dead people here. It's sort of about a journey and a very particular part of that journey. Where we are in time, yeah. And for people who are Buddhists... The belief is that it's very important not to cry when someone dies. Because the belief is that that consciousness still has a kind of awareness and you do not want to call them back because they can't come back. They can't. So you can't go, oh, no. You just go, wow. sail off, try your best, jump off the planet, go for it, don't be afraid, don't be afraid, you know. So you try to generate a lot of positive energy. And that helps you as well. And not to cry. So don't cry. And I think it helps people focus on the fact that this is not about them so much as it is about the person who died, who needs a little lift at the moment, probably. You know, it might be a little confusing. So we living people could... just help a little bit, like, just by not trying to go, you know. So anyway, that's the reason, I think, that those things are more cheerful events than... I suppose if you thought that your father, mother, sister, brother, little cousin was going to disappear forever into a void, that would be... or go to hell or heaven, it would be a different situation. And I'm not saying anyone should believe anything in particular. I think go for it. Whatever makes sense to you, whatever stirs your heart is what you should believe. I believe that consciousness remains in some form. I don't know why. because nobody knows why they believe something that's not a rational thing, obviously. You just have a feeling. My feeling is that your consciousness continues in some form. Nobody, but very different. I found myself, you know, as someone who was not, who had heard of, you know, the Bardo. but was not so familiar with the text itself before listening to your penis. It's very esoteric. I did find myself, you know, belief set aside. I felt, I really felt something when I was listening to it and I felt a connection to it. Do you remember the first time you came across this text? Not really. But it does ring a bell in the sense that when I read other texts that are about afterlife situations, I can also get very... interested in Dante's version of heaven and Dante's version of hell and different versions of it in the Bible. My grandmother was a Baptist missionary and went to Japan to try to convince... Japanese people of that total immersion was the way to go. And she didn't bother to learn Japanese. You know, she just thought by singing hymns and that people would get the point somehow. They did not. But one of the things that did happen was that she was a very vain southern lady and she made her own hats and they were really wild elaborate hats with violets and veils and stuff hanging from them and the Japanese people were looking at those hats and they went whoa can you show us how to make those hats so she showed them how to make the hats and she was also a gardener and she loved roses and She saw them cutting bonsai, and she was like, that's the coolest thing I've ever seen. So they taught her to cut bonsai, and she taught them to make hats. That's a lot. You know, how are you going to... change somebody's belief system. You're not, really, probably. You know, when people really see the light on the road the way Saul and Paul did, you know, and this kind of conversion stuff, that's very, very rare. Usually you kind of believe what you first were taught somehow about what happens when you die. Then someone says, well, all your deeds are counted and you're judged and then you're assigned another place as a reward or a punishment. Others, nothing happens. When you're dead, you disappear forever. And so it's very important to be a good person now and be fair now and help other people now. Buddhists are, here you are in the wheel of karma. And there's a big question, okay, here we are at what could be the first really humans to look at the... end of human life on the earth. This is who we are right now. We're faced with that. No one has ever had to look at this before. We're the first ones who go, whoa, how do you tell a story of human life ending on the planet? Which it very well may. I don't think it's 50 years. I think it's more like 500 years. But I think it will end. It's one of the first times, if not, well, it must be the first time, you know, the idea that the world is coming to an end has been sort of a part of the human dialogue since the beginning of time. But we've never had empirical evidence to back it up. And we never will until it happens or doesn't. And in any case, we do see the collapse of life systems and we do see the collapse of many, many things and can extrapolate from that that it's not looking good. On the other hand, how do you tell that story? Is it to people who aren't there? If you believe that stories are told to people who might listen, how do you tell a story to no one? This is our... the first time we've had this awesome job telling this story to no one. And so when I asked one of my Buddhist teachers, what happens to the wheel of karma? when no people are left? How do they incarnate again and again the way the Dalai Lama says they do? How do you come back if there's nothing to come back into? There's no body, even an insect, to come back into. Of course, you could come back as an insect. Many people do. But, he said, Well, I said, you know the answer? And he said, yeah. He said, that's why the Buddha talked about other universes. I was like, oh, wait a second. That sounds like the biggest cop-out ever because that's easy to say. We're talking here about our planet and what's going on here. So anyway, it's all a very wild. time to be living because it is absolutely true that we're in the sixth extinction. There's kind of no doubt in any way about that. What happens to us? We just don't know. And that's an amazing place to be. It's an amazing, it just wakes you right up. You're going, what is this? What is any of this? how could this happen? I mean, it has happened five times, so it's going to happen again. It's not like a... something that's completely weird. Anyway, but it's completely weird in that we, it's like a Greek tragedy, which the definition of a Greek tragedy is everyone can see that things are going horribly wrong, but everyone's acting in the way that they need to act. they can't change and still things are going horribly wrong and you And you're conscious of it. That's a tragedy. So that's what this is. You know, it's something we can't stop. What you've just told me and sort of the whole way that you've talked about this, like looking at a big issue like mass extinction or like climate change, the moment that we're living in right now. And then saying, how do you tell the story of that? Feels to me like quite a good summation of the way that you work as an artist. Looking at something quite big or looking at a... big topic, whether it's something... Untellable. An untellable topic. Right. And decide, well, instead of framing it up for people in some really obvious way, I'm going to tell the story of that in the way that I know how. The world is full of stories about how to deal with this. And one of them, of course, is the biggest one is, oh, no, technology will figure out how to do that. You know, and... I'm sorry. I'm a geek. But I see no technology being developed to, you know, prevent massive immigrations, massive fires and floods and melting of water, you know, and creation of rafts and so on and so on. You know, and people who do say that, you know, who think that the fire engines of technology will come in. at the tipping point, which is very close now, and solve things when they're not even working on them is insane. So please don't be an insane person. And I know that that's really dark, but... It seems to be truthful to me, and also I think, and I can't remember who said this, but it's one of my favorite quotes about technology. If you think technology will solve your problems, you don't understand technology, and you don't understand your problems. So if you want stuff to get faster, quicker, better, slicker, go right ahead and sign up for the next update. But if you think that it's actually looking at some of those things and really, I mean, of course, some people are, of course, of course, desperately trying to. to see if there's something we can do. I am too. I'm not just going to stand by and be hit by a big wave. I'm going to see and do everything I can to live and to think about the future of people. I also don't want to be an idiot just thinking like, oh yeah, don't worry about it. It's going to be, it's going to solve itself or we'll solve it or something. There's something that today in the paper about eating insects. Did you see that? I didn't, but I've heard about this, that this is, uh, plenty of food around exactly that might be true it could be i have a studio because i do a lot of paintings right now i have a studio in the brickland navy yard i'm next to a place a startup that's doing companies about growing all your own food in your house that means wheat rice protein. You know, that may work. I don't know. How large of a house are we talking? We're talking about an apartment. Wow. This is like, how much do you really eat? How many cups of rice per year do you eat? Count them up. I don't know. You don't eat 300 cups of rice, probably. But you eat 300 cups of something. Anyway, that might be just a crazy dream. And I don't think they're counting on you having a big loft. I'm thinking they're counting on you having a regular house or apartment. And not a small one. but a place where you can grow this stuff. I don't know. I mean, I'm all for everybody doing everything they can to make the world a better place. And I just think that probably, you know, I just heard about the cancellation of this show called New Sounds on WNYC. Yeah, I know it. Yeah, John Schaefer Show. And I was so sad to hear about that. And they were asking me about it. And I was saying, you know, why did they cancel that? Well, because they want more news. I was like, are you insane? More news? We need less news. We need less news, more music, not more news. People are drowning in news. They're looking at the news every 40 seconds. Like, well, I am. I shouldn't blame other people. I mean, they're probably, I don't know what they're doing, but I'm watching. looking at way too much. I'm just a junkie, I have to admit. I'm very worried, and I look at it all the time. Do you? Oh, of course. It's hard not to. Yeah. But what I sort of wonder from, you know, from everything that you've been saying, you know, what is kind of the role of art? in all of this? What do you feel like your role as an artist is in all of this? Save the world. And how do you save the world through your art? You take people away, you know, you... open their minds. Other things can do that too. For some people, food opens their minds. They're like, have a glass of the greatest wine. They're like, yeah, my mind is open. So I think one of the ways to do that is music. It's why I love VR too. Virtual reality, it helps you be bodiless. It's like being in a bardo. Although you have some virtual hands, you need your body to be in that actually, in a certain virtual way. Unlike music where you can just listen to it very passively. Or look at a painting, you don't need your body. You need your eyes, but you don't use your body to walk through it. So anyway, kind of a pointless point. I think that you can find freedom in many ways, and everybody has their different way to find it. I find it through making things to break the rules. And I like seeing where those boundaries are and I like bending them. That makes me feel good. Well, it sounds like you, you know, you take quite a lot of inspiration from what's happening out in the world. Maybe it's news, maybe it's science, anything like that. You're able to kind of filter it through your... artistic sense are you then hoping that maybe and maybe this is where the saving the world part comes in that it kind of feeds back into that science and news cycle and is able to affect things in some way inspire people in different ways i don't think it has much effect on politics, for example. I think people are so led by their news sources right now. And I feel that this is the gap that troubles me the most, that you can make something sound quite real, and you can make it sound rational and like news, and in fact it's kind of propaganda. So I see that happening, and in all aspects, I mean in all aspects, both liberal and conservative, all the way across the board, that it's... It's opinion as opposed to as close as we can get to actual events. And we can't get that close anymore because they're so full of opinion. But I do feel that it's become so chaotic that I'm worried, I have to say. I'm worried that there's so much screaming. Everybody's just going, I'm right. No, I'm right. Nobody's going, tell me what you think. It's like, you know, if a Mormon came to my door and said, Can we talk? I would say, absolutely, come in. And before you tell me about your beliefs, can I tell you about mine? Have a seat. Has this ever happened before? No, but I'm ready. I'm ready when somebody does knock on my door. Probably never will. But they don't want to hear your beliefs. No way. They want you to be a golden star in their crown. So we've stopped listening. So I'm a big Cage fan. Listen up. Listen to other people. It is hard to listen to braying, though, and to like... That's hard to listen to for me. And so I just think, be patient and see how these other opinions that seem so different from your own are being formed and why. So I make an effort to do that. And I very rarely succeed. Has there ever been a point... a previous point in your career where it's felt quite like this? No, no, never. And where does that sort of... Not in my life, not in my career, not in my wildest dreams could I ever have thought that people would be talking about the end of life on the planet. That's just inconceivable to me. That's just the wildest, craziest thing I've ever heard. When I was a kid, I would never think that that would ever happen. So my mind is officially blown, you know. And also, I would not think that there would be so much violence in this country and so much fear and so much anger. This has been a big, big shock for me, and many, many, many people feel that way, I'm sure. I know that it's very destabilizing to realize there's just a thin crust, and underneath that is just... Unbelievable amount of anger. This is one of the reasons I'm drawn to Buddhism. It's not about pretending it's not there. It's kind of recognizing. For me, making a record like this was a way to kind of come to terms with what it's like to live now. Of course, there's never a solution. We just keep trying different ways. If you are afraid, you will escape from the lights of wisdom and be attracted to the soft lights of the six realms of existence. Under the influence of bad karma, you will be attracted to the soft white light of the gods. Under the influence of aggression, You will be attracted to the soft, smoky lights of the hell beings. Under the influence of pride, you will be attracted to the soft blue light of the human beings. Under the influence of intense desire, you will be attracted to the soft yellow light. of the hungry ghosts. And under the influence of envy, you will be attracted to the soft red light of the jealous gods. They are an obstacle blocking the path to liberation. And if you are attracted to the soft light... you will circle forever among the six kinds of existence. So give up pride, aggression, desire, and envy. Give up your unconscious tendencies. Feel longing for the luminous, brilliant light-ray hooks of compassion. Awakened One. Listen without distraction. Even though you were shown the light of each of the five families, you were bewildered by it. If you had recognized the natural radiance of the wisdom of those five families as your own projection, you would have dissolved into the rainbow light in the body of one of the five families. and become a Sambhogakaya Buddha. So now, watch without distraction. On the sixth day, the five families will all appear together, and what is called the Four Wisdoms Combined will come to invite you. Recognize them. Beyond those Buddhas are the five families. The eight wrathful male and female guardians of the gates. And the six sages will also appear. Samantabhadra and Samantabhadri, the all-good father and mother. of all the Buddhas.
