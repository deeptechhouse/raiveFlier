. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. DJing is an art form, and Greg Wilson is some sort of renaissance master. The English jock transformed DJing irrevocably by being one of the UK's first to successfully mix records into one another. It almost sounds silly now, but back then it was nothing short of a revolution. Wilson's skills behind the decks during the late 70s and early 80s were heard at legendary nightclubs like Wigan Pier, Legend, and the Hacienda. I recently caught up with Wilson in Oslo after a gig to talk about those early days and the circumstances behind his retirement and his recent unretirement. So it's 3:47 a.m. We're in Oslo. I feel like it just needs to be stated at the very least. Do you have... Norwegian stories to tell. Have you been to Norway quite a bit? Well, only, I mean, the last time I was in Norway was 1978. So it's a bit of a long time, which was weird. I mean, because coming back here, it felt like, you know, it was a moment, you know, coming back to Norway after that period of time. And then obviously... you know, the other week, you know, that kind of, you know, the massacre that went on. So you realize that you're coming back into a completely different, you know, vibe and everything. So, yeah, my story of Norway was that back in, what, 78, when I was 18, you know, I was then DJing in my hometown, which is in New Brighton, the other side of the Mersey from Liverpool. And I kind of realised, even though I loved it there and all my friends were there and it was my hometown, I was like a big fish in a small pond, that... There used to be a DJ that worked in the, there was a floor above. And back in those days, you know, they still had like what they call cabaret in the clubs, which was that they had like local bands in who did some of the chart hits of the time and some oldies and stuff. And then there was a DJ that played in between. I was downstairs in like a cello disco, like playing the newer stuff and everything. But the DJ that was upstairs had been in this club for 15 years. And I can remember like looking at him one night and... 15 years already by 78. Yeah, he'd started there in the early 60s. This club had been going since then. And I just looked at him. He must have only been in his 30s, but he seemed like really old to me at the time. And I can remember thinking, wow, you know, that could be me. I could be here and find myself still here. And it kind of scared me and it made me realise I had to move on, I had to rip myself away from it, even though, as I say, I loved it. All my mates were there and everything. I was having a great time. time to move on and so one of the things I'd heard about was that there were English DJs all over Europe in places like Germany, Scandinavia, you know even some in France and you know like Switzerland, Austria, these kind of places and they went out on monthly contracts and there was an agency that was based in Copenhagen called IDEA which which brought out loads of English DJs. I got in touch with them and they came back to me and they said, yeah, you know, I sent them a demonstration tape or something. And they said, yeah, come on out. And you literally drove over, you know, I drove over from England. I did Denmark for a couple of weeks in Denmark. And then I got a boat over to Norway. And basically what happened was, you know, I remember that. boat ride was awful because I was I remember getting on the boat I was like only 18 and I'm like looking at all the girls and thinking they had a disco on the boat and I'm thinking oh great I'm going to have a great time tonight And about half an hour later, I was kind of laid down, feeling just so sick. I was so seasick. And I couldn't move from the spot where I was all night. I was just pig sick. And so when we got to the other side, got to Norway and docked and everything, drove my car off and the police kind of basically made me put my bonnet up and the next thing they were kind of taking and I know nothing about cars and they were taking bits off and there were bits at the side of the road and then they said okay you're fine you know they had a dog sniffing stuff out and said I was fine but they just like left loads of bits of my car you know my engine and I had to try to put things back together. And I managed to do that. But about 50 miles on, the car died on me. And I was like stuck. And so the place that I was supposed to go to, which was up in the north of Norway, I wasn't going to get there. So I had to ring this agency. And they found a... DJ in a nearby town who put me up for a couple of days while the car got fixed and they got me into another club which was in a place called Sheehan and the guys who own this club paid for my car so I was already beholdering to them before I even started and so eventually I got over to this club and I saw it and I just thought, oh God, it's awful. It was like a kind of rock club and I was like a big black music, you know, fan and... you know, and all of a sudden, all this, there was a band, a Scandinavian band called Gasoline, who were, like, really big, and I'm thinking, oh, God, this is awful. I had a month there. And there was a girl DJ from the same agency who'd done the previous month, and it was her last night. And she came, and she was talking to me, and I'm saying to her, you know, you know, oh, God, I don't like it, I had no idea, but she'd been seeing the boss of the club all month. she went straight to him and she said your new DJ doesn't like the club and he's over to me and he's like you don't like my club and I'm like yeah yeah I like your club and everything and he just made my life a misery you know I mean he didn't do me any favours and I worked I think I'm not even sure if I got a night off I certainly did six if not seven nights a week and you know it started at you know nine o'clock and finish it I think I think you have to close at three and sometimes you'd be in there and it'd be like 12 o'clock and there'd be one person and you'd just be praying that they'd go and they'd close the club and then another person would turn up and he he'd still have me you know wouldn't even let me put an album on to kind of do so you know I got so homesick I just wanted to get back to England from there but one night I'm working I'm you know I'm playing my music and obviously as I say I'm you know black music based and there's this guy and he's kind of stood near the side he's not saying anything he's kind of looking me up and down. I'm kind of aware of him. All of a sudden he walks over to me and says, yeah, yeah, yeah, the boys are here. And he's like, yeah, and he gave me an address and he said, yeah, come and see us. And he's an English guy. And then he gets off and he's left me with this address. And I went to this house and I kind of knock, knock, knock on the door and no answer. And I see like Then the door opens like really quick. Oh, right, come on in, man. And I met these guys. And what had happened, I mean, the DJs who'd got this kind of flat had previously been in another town and there'd been a Sony convention where they had all the latest hi-fi equipment. And basically what happened was that as they were leaving, they went past this room which had all this latest hi-fi gear in and there was no one there. And they basically lifted all this gear, like, you know, about three systems worth. So they wanted to make sure you weren't a sycone representative. Yeah, they thought it was the police. And they'd, like, left it in some kind of, you know... locker in a train station but they'd taken one system back and basically they had this great system in there and my memories of that is listening to things like Richie Pryor and Cheech and Chong I remember I got really into Richard Pryor they were like huge kind of fans and everything they'd tune me into that I was this young guy and they were like seasoned they'd been out in Europe for years you know you were listening to comedy albums yeah I was listening to on a great hi-fi yeah we were listening to like you know other stuff as well but that stayed with me you know because that was my introduction to Richard Pryor who you know is like kind of big influence on you know like my the way that I look at like black culture obviously and everything She had a dog, and when she left, the dog came up and talked to me. Hey, Rich, I'm fixing to split. I know it's been a pleasure. Don't get me wrong, you know what I mean? But I'm a little tardy with the food, nigga. And she feed the motherfucker three times a day, you know what I mean? So I'm going to check you out. You take care. Yeah. I'm going to leave a little piss over here for you to remember me by. they had vans and stuff they were like really kind of in tune with the way of doing things as DJs out in Europe and they've been right all around the place and everything I only stayed that month I decided it wasn't for me and so I had to get a boat back from Gothenburg in Sweden I drove to Gothenburg and about 50 miles from Gothenburg my car decided it didn't actually break down but it wouldn't go any faster than about 40 miles an hour and I literally got to the docks at Gothenburg and watched my boat go in and I was just destroyed oh no And somebody, this girl came out, she worked for the company, the boats, and she took pity on me. And she gave me a place to stay because there wasn't another boat for two days or something. And that was it. So I kind of went back. I went back to where I worked in New Brighton, called the Golden Guinea. And I did another two years there, two great years, loved it. But then, you know, I got a little bit older and I thought, right, you know, time to go again on things. And I got back in touch with this agency and I went to Denmark and I did a month there. I had a bump in my car, not a bad crash, and I had to bring it back. And when I came back, I got a little bit more kind of worldly wise about how this all works, and I knew there were other agencies. And so I decided to ring one of the guys that I'd met in Norway, one of the DJs. Because there were three different DJs in this town, Sheehan, that were English, you know, like different clubs and everything. DJ I met, the one who'd come into the club was a guy called Paul Ray, who remains a good friend to this day, actually married a Norwegian girl, lives in Trondheim. The other guy was a guy called Nicky Flavell, who... You know, both these guys were great DJs, like really into soul music and everything, black music, and, you know, so we had a lot in common. And, you know, two years later when I'm back out in Denmark and then working out what I'm going to do from here, I rung Nicky's number. He lived somewhere down south in England. His father answered the phone and said, oh, he's back in England. He's working at a club called Wigan Pier. And I thought, oh, well, that's only, you know, 30 miles away from where I live. So when I came back to get my car sorted out, I thought I'd go over and see him. So I came back. I'd already taken a contract for two months in Germany at a club in a place called Muhheim. But I went in this week. back in England and I went to this club we can play up here and it blew my mind it was everything that I wanted in a club it was like first club in the UK that had a laser system, it had a great sound system, it had Technics turntables. This is at a time when most clubs in the UK, the sound and lighting was an afterthought. They spent more money on how the bar looked than worried about sound systems and stuff. So all of this amazing American-style disco that had been properly fitted out. And Nicky tells me that he's going to open a club in Manchester that the same company own called Legend. And that there's going to be a vacancy for the resident DJ in Wigan. auditions like the next week or something. Well, I'm gone and I'm like talking to the manager there and he's saying, you know, you can come and audition. I'm like, I'm going to Germany. And I was really tempted not to go to Germany just to audition because this place was so amazing. But obviously I couldn't do that. And so. I said to him, look, if I sent you a tape, would you listen to it? And he said, yeah, yeah, okay, you know. I didn't think much of it. But when I got to Germany, I did a tape. And I sent it back over and I heard nothing for a couple of weeks. And I spoke to Nicky in the meantime. And I think he did a bit from his side and got him to listen to it. And then I got this call. Do you remember what you put Oh, I don't know. I just recorded what I was doing that night. It was just like I stuck a tape in where I was working and recorded what was happening. I can't remember, you know, like what would have been on there. It would have just been the current music of the time. It's interesting, though, because, I mean, you said you thought you wouldn't even go to Germany to just do this audition. It was that important to you. Well, the club was incredible. I didn't really want to be abroad. But, you know, I mean, the reason I was was because, you know, there was better money to be made at the time for DJs working abroad. You have to put the hours in, of course. And, you know, it was going up a food chain. really you know I mean I was when I went out there and did she and I was like the bottom of the food chain but by the time I went out again you know I mean had I stayed out I would have either gone to Hamburg or the Canary Islands I could have gone there there was a place a great place that I'd heard about that was in Denmark called Daddy's Dance Hall in Copenhagen which a lot of the DJs love going to because you could play like really good music and stuff It's really fascinating to me that you talk about this because so many DJs I talk to say that, you know, the international booking circuit, so to speak, didn't exist until, you know, a certain point for a lot of DJs, you know, once flights became so cheap. And yet what you're talking about seems to completely fly in the face of that. At a certain point early on, you were getting, I guess it was a different style of booking. You went there for a month. Yeah, you did like a full monthly kind of contract. and also you know I mean it's like now you know with the you know during recent times this whole kind of Norwegian disco thing that you know why did it come from Norway I mean I'm pretty sure it's you know a lot of it was that these English DJs were coming over playing records bringing records you know turning people on to certain stuff you know like black music wouldn't have been a big thing in Norway had It had been left to its own devices. It was very much the English coming over and playing that kind of stuff that would have made an impression. And even today, you know, like the guy who was promoting this event, he was a DJ himself. He had no idea that any English DJs were in this country before probably, you know, the early 90s or something. But yeah, I mean, they were all over the place. As I say, I'm in a small... you know sheen's not like a big place in norway but there were three different uh discos with english djs working in that one town you know so you can imagine you know throughout the country and everything um and then there were like denmark as well you couldn't couldn't get work permits for sweden the funny thing was i mean at the time djs used the microphone and that was one of the reasons why they wanted english djs because of the english accent over the microphone And in Sweden where you couldn't get a work permit to work the Swedish DJs Use the microphone and spoke in English So it was you know, that was how it was seen back then This is in the days in the in the time, you know before mixing like really came to the fore, you know, and so Yeah, so I think I think I think somehow we solved a new disco tonight and we've solved why like ABBA in Indy took hold in Sweden because he didn't have any English DJs to come around and teach him anything yeah I suppose yeah alright great so sorry to go back you know you sent this tape in yeah and to Wigan Pier yeah and and and I got this call one day, I'm in Germany, I'm doing this club in Mulheim. Now I'm in a decent club. Germany was a real eye-opener for me because the club that I worked in was really well-equipped. It was the first club that I'd ever been in that had a Technics SL 1200s. So we're kind of moving to a different level. But there was also a nearby city called Essen and there was this club there called Librium. and on my nights off I went there a few times and that had a big impression on me because they were so well decked out with sound and lights and a lot of German clubs were but basically the DJs in there were mixing and they were kind of mixing between dance music and alternative stuff and everything And even though I'd seen mixing DJs before, the first guy in the UK who was mixing really was a guy called Greg James, an American DJ who came over to work at a club called The Embassy, which was like kind of London's answer to Studio 54 for a while. A lot of people, celebrities and stuff went along there. And I used to go with... people from the record companies. I used to come up from Liverpool quite often to London and I knew all the people, you know, the promotional people at record companies and went there. So I'd, you know, and we'd all tried mixing ourselves around, about 78 it became. you know talked about like in british dj circles and we all had a go but we didn't have the equipment we had these like old belt driven turntables and you know you try to touch something and get it in time and needle jumps across the deck so it didn't you know it didn't take on and the microphone remained the main kind of thing of the british djs But going out to Germany and seeing it working in that context, it kind of put this idea in my head that in the right situation, I could see myself taking that approach to it. And that's what transpired, you know, soon afterwards when I went. to legend but you know I went to Wigan Pier first I got this call saying come back over I remember I actually wept with joy you know the idea of going back and working in this club it was just incredible and so I went back there as a four night a week resident Getting paid great money, you know, like, because, like, when I left the UK, DJs got, like, if you got 15 quid a night, that was a good wage. When I started, you know, the first night I ever worked was £6, you know. Now, you know, going back to Wigan Pier, I was on something like, it worked out as something like £42.50 a night, which was like an incredible amount of money, you know, like at that time. And I was doing like the four nights there. One of those nights was, it was like the specialist. jazz funk night as they used to call it then which is wasn't just jazz but it was all the black music soul funk disco or what's now called boogie the jazz side of it you know even out and out jazz jazz funk so all, you know, the whole remit of black music was played, latest stuff from America, a lot of Japanese imports, actually, a lot of kind of digital Japanese jazz albums at the time that were big, and the Tuesday night at Wiggum was great, you know, I mean, it would have been going for like 12, the club had been open for 12 months before I started, and there'd been a DJ called Kelly in there originally, and then Nicky Flavelle, and it was, you know, the We'd get about 350 people in there. I mean, the club was big. It held like 800. Was the crowd really different as well? I mean, I imagine from night to night once people knew what was, you know, during the week. But at that specific club, was it different to a different club, you know, in that area where you like people heads? I guess the term wasn't around back then. I think Wigan, because of Wigan Casino, the Northern Soul venue, it was seen as a place for clubs. he was so different. A lot of people, you know, make the mistake of kind of thinking I was Wigan Casino, which is chalk and cheese. Like Wigan Casino was an old run-down ballroom and the music that was played was like kind of old 60s tunes, rare 60s tunes. You know, whereas Wigan Pier was a state-of-the-art kind of discotheque based on what was happening in New York. The people who fitted it... called Bacchus Julianas who basically did all the Hiltons throughout the world, put the discos and everything and they got the contract to do this and really, as I say, it was the first club in the country that had this proper laser system and stuff and I worked in, the DJ console was a 15 foot high fiberglass frog. I actually worked to the side, the light controller, I worked with a light controller who looked out the front, the mouth of the frog, and I kind of worked kind of side on, used to kind of look over, you know, to see what was going on down on the dance floor. So it was a different world, you know, from what was going on. And people would come to Wigan Pier from... you know, all over the North, there'd be coach trips down, you know, you get people like at the weekend, you'd see them because there was like a balcony. We were above the dance floor looking down. There was like a, it was like two, a two tier kind of thing. But you look down over the dance floor. And there'd be people just all night just stood watching the lights. They were just so mesmerized by, you know, the lighting in the place. And so, yeah, you know, the weekend was obviously different because it was a much more mixed crowd. And at the weekend, the kind of music that I'd play would be, you know, like... The bigger stuff that would be played on the Tuesday night, you know, like the bigger black music, there was a lot of kind of great alternative, what you call futurist or the kind of new romantic kind of stuff that was about at the time. So that would be played. And then the more... commercial black music that we wouldn't play on a Tuesday things like Shalimar Imagination Michael Jackson those kind of things they wouldn't be played on an upfront night so but you know it was a really good mixture of music that was played at the weekend the Tuesday was as I say it was it was the latest stuff coming out of the States plus as I say weirdly there was all these Japanese kind of jazz albums digital jazz albums at the time which cost a fortune they cost about three times as much as a normal album but if you're on that scene you have to have them you know and um And so, you know, I took over that night and I did really well with it and developed it. In the meantime, Nicky Flavell went over to Legend in Manchester, which for me went a step further. It was a smaller club, held about 500, more compact, but there wasn't a sound system like it in the country. It was the first place I ever come across with like some bass system and they had three Technus SL-1200s there. But, you know, it was just, you know, I mean, if you opened this club now, it would blow people's heads off. There's nothing like it. They don't make clubs like that, weirdly, anymore. You know, you hear people talking about things like, say, Fabric and London. They say, oh, what a club and what a mate. You know, it doesn't touch what was going on there in terms of, like, the way, the stuff they had in there. What do you mean? Like what stuff exactly? Well, for example, they had something like half a mile of neon in circles and triangles and stuff above the dance floor. They had the sound system, the way that, I mean, the top end of the sound system was built into this prism above the dance floor, which was also mirrored. The laser would hit that mirror and send the laser kind of in a, you know, like a prism over the dance floor. You could also kind of white out the dance floor with strobes and kind of these pin spot lights. So it was just pure white throw smoke in there. Michael Gerald was one of the people that used to go there. He wrote something about it. And he was like a big kind of jazz dancer at the time. And he wrote about being on the dance floor and just that whiteness and not even knowing where you were, you know. And, you know, the light controller there, you know, it was a full-time job, you know, to control the lights and to get the best out of what was going on there. So... I mean, it was just really fortunate to be involved in these clubs. I mean, there was only the only other clubs in the country during that period of time that could compare. There's a club in London, Camden Palace, which was great. You know, that came a little bit later than Legend and Wigan Pier. I think it opened about six months after Legend and probably about a year and a half. you know, after Wigan Pier. There was a club called Zenon in London that opened. It was a little bit, you know, kind of exclusive type place. But, you know, this is it. You can count them on one hand, you know. And so, you know, I'm working in one of these clubs. Nicky's gone over to the other one. Didn't kind of work out for Nicky for one reason or another. And they got in like the big DJ on the scene, who was a guy called John Grant, the big like black music DJ. And the way that it worked in those days, the black music scene, it was like a huge underground scene. You know, that, that... See, it always drives me crazy that people think that dance culture kind of started in the UK in the late 80s with rave and somehow it, you know, like Ibiza happened and then, you know, all of a sudden, that was bollocks, you know, I mean, that brought ecstasy onto the scene, but there was a massive underground dance culture that goes back, you can trace it all the way back to the 60s, you know, but at this particular point You know, the way that it worked was that apart from the club nights, there were all-dayers. Practically, you know, every Sunday there was... somewhere there was an all-dayer going on and most bank holiday Mondays and how it worked was at these all-dayers which run between maybe two o'clock and midnight that the DJ lineup would be the biggest DJs throughout the North and Midlands I mean there was a southern scene as well but that was kind of separate the North and Midlands was one side of it the South was the other And if you got onto that scene, you play alongside all the big DJs within this part of the country. And when I kind of got my original bookings on that, I was like way down the bill, this little tiny name at the bottom. But bit by bit, my name got bigger and I eventually got to the top of the bill. And that was your status really within the scene. And it was your pulling power as well. If you could pull a coach load of people from your venue to, like I do all days in places like Leeds, Sheffield, Bradford, Birmingham, Nottingham, Derby. Preston was huge, you know, there was a big Aldea there. And so, you know, that was, you know, from me doing the Tuesday nights at Wigan Pier and getting on the bill at the Aldeas, I was now starting to come into that orbit, you know, and get my name about on that scene and become a name DJ within, like, black music circles. how it really accelerated was that what had happened was the guy who did Legend was a guy called John Grant, big name on the scene. You know, he's one of the big names on the bills at the old days and everything. He basically went across to work at another club in Manchester, Left Legend, which was doing pretty well while he was there on a Wednesday night. But this other club was promoted by Blues and Soul magazine, which was, you know, that was the DJ Bible at the time. And Piccadilly Radio, which was like the biggest commercial station outside London. He basically took the whole crowd over to this other night called the main event and legend was starting to struggle and the the residents at legend took over for a while and they were trying to keep it together and it was what it was dying the night was dying and it was at that point because my Tuesday was doing so well at Wigan Pier that the owners as I said they own both clubs they said how do you fancy a go at legend you know and I was like yeah you know. I love the place. When I've been in there... And I went over there. Did you know, though, that it was dying in a way? Well, yeah. I mean, I wouldn't have got the job otherwise, you know. But you still wanted to go over there and see what could happen. It was such an amazing, amazing club. I just wanted to play there, you know. But I went over there and I think the first night I played, there was around about 90 people. And this was a club that at its peak with John Grant had been pulling in. 350, 400 people. right down to that and I kind of looked at it that first night and the thing that I saw was I mean it was it was a legend was a black club I mean like Wigan on the Tuesday at Wigan Pier there was a real there was a strong black presence but initially that black presence was maybe 20% of the crowd later it changed later there was like you know at least 50% if not higher black which was mad Wigan because Wigan has next to no black population. These were coming in from Birmingham and Huddersfield, Sheffield, Leeds, all these kind of places. They were coming in on a Tuesday night, which is bizarre now when you think about it. You know, sometimes there are as many as like 500 black kids in Wigan on a Tuesday night where, you know, you could count on, you know, on a hand, you know, how many black people lived in Wigan. you know and um legend on and the reason you got these nights on tuesdays and wednesdays was because you know they wouldn't have given a night on a weekend you know for that kind of crowd legend was seen as a as a you know like the way that was a black night it was you know 90 predominantly black very few white guys more white girls because the white girls came for the black guys you know and So this first night when I'm looking at 90 people, those nights were serious music ads, serious dancers. And so it was at that point where I made the decision, which was they don't want DJ verbals on the microphone. It's all about the music. And so that was when I thought the mixing that I was going to do. put the emphasis towards the mixing and it was a really fortuitous decision and a lucky decision in a way because I hadn't I had no way of knowing but in in three or four months the electro would start to come through which was obviously drum machine based and maybe the first type of music that was kind of more made to be mixed you know as such But, you know, I've made that and I kind of took that approach. And it literally for like a few months, it was, you know, at the end of the night, the manager would say, you know, I'd say, how many were in there? He'd say 96. I go, oh, nice one. We only had 94 last week. And it was literally, we were talking in figures of five and six people and building it up. What happened was that this other club across town called The Main Event, John Grant had gone by then. This great DJ of the time had decided he was going to work as a harbour master in Southampton. That's how much of a career being a DJ was. And so he'd split and Colin Curtis, who was another great, you know, big name DJ from the scene, and Mike Shaft, who did Piggly Radio, they were doing the main event. But bit by bit, Legend was pulling numbers up. And it was one of those where, you know, once we got like to something like 250 people on the Wednesday. main events had started to lose people to legend. It was one of those tipping point moments that it closed the main event within two weeks. Once it happened, it was just brutal and quick and the whole crowd just shifted and all of a sudden I had a club that was just packed with 500 people and with queues of people outside waiting to get in and that carried on. for the rest of the time that I was DJing there, which was like another 18 months. It was to the end of 84 when I stopped. You know, it was a phenomena, you know, legend. And into that, at that very moment, it was May 82 was the moment we first hit capacity. and that was the same month Planet Rock came out and the electro music came through. It was also the same month the Hacienda opened, which was interesting because later down the line I'd go and start the first dance night at the Hacienda. So everything kind of... And I also started doing mixes for Piccadilly Radio, which were the first mixes of their type in the country, all May 82, weirdly. So my status was elevated from being a respected DJ on the scene. to lead in the scene in terms of what I was playing was having an influence on everything. And that got me in a lot of trouble because I went for the electro. A lot of people on the black music scene were very anti it at the time. They thought it was going to destroy the scene. So here I am, this young guy, what was I, 22 at the time, and I'm like, my clubs, my two clubs, I mean, Blues and Soul were the main awards then, and I won Top DJ in the North, my club's legend in Wigan Pier came first and second. It was a clean sweep, and so my ego's saying, I want a pat on the back. from a contemporary's and everyone's accusing me of polluting the scene with this music. And so it was, what was the, um, Electro was to, um, not enough funk in it? Say what? It didn't have enough funk in it? Oh, no, no, it wasn't that. What was the... It was the sounds. I think they thought it was kind of synthetic because it was computer-driven. You used to hear things like, people would say things like, you know, it makes itself, you know. I think some people are so naive, they thought you put a plug in and the music came out the other end, you know, that they... It... Eventually that changed. I remember Herbie Hancock, who was obviously a hugely respected jazz musician, he did Rocket, and he kind of said, somebody still has to programme this in. you These kind of things change people's opinions, you know, but initially it was just all about change, you know, any change comes about and it throws everything upside down. And it really did completely change the scene. So the way I see it was that, you know, I was this young guy with new ideas and I was mixing, no one else was mixing as well. That's the other thing. And no one else had the equipment to mix. So I had the right club. I was mixing, I was playing this new music. So people can compete with that because most of the clubs where black kids were allowed were just these ramshackle, run-down hovels, you know. So I'm at the state-of-the-art clubs and doing this. And so it just had this massive effect. So all of a sudden people that were, you know, were doing well on this scene were struggling because they couldn't keep up with what... was going on so you know even the shop where I bought the records from which was the only shop in the north of England where you could buy this music was spinning in Manchester the manager of that shop was completely anti-electro and he was one of like the people who slagged me off the most for even putting the shop you know electro shit charts and but it was the kids who were into it and the thing that really changed it for me was that Initially, I was a bit on the defensive because I hadn't expected this. These people I respected because they were like my contemporaries on this scene were being critical towards me. And then it changed and I started to get a bit angry about it because I was thinking most of these people who were being critical seemed to me that they were middle-aged white guys who were kind of saying what black music was. And I'm like... hold on a second, you know, ask the black kids. It's the black kids who are into this. And they'd say things like, you're leading them astray. And I'm like, this is mad. You don't lead these kids anywhere. these are the leaders you know this it wasn't a situation of you know being a dj you know like they followed you you know they you you you hit a level it was a reciprocal situation with these i totally respected this crowd because these were into the most upfront music the best dancers and everything so they were into what i was playing was amazing you know so so When I heard these people saying, you know, you're leading them astray, I just thought, that's ridiculous, you know, because, you know, it doesn't work in that way at all. So I began to almost, like, take the offensive at that point. And, you know... I could see it was just basically the old ways was coming to an end and the new ways was coming through and that's what proved to be the case. And later down the line, to the credit of all the people who were staunchly against it, every one of them that I can remember has said we were wrong. And it was funny, you know, a lot of these people who were really against electro, which was more funk-based, you know, music using, you know, like kind of the technology of the time, later got really into house, which was the same thing, but with a straight 4-4 beat, you know, which was kind of, you know, but I just think it had just taken them by surprise. That's why they were kind of overcritical about it at the time. But later down the line, they finally came around. But what it did was it opened everything up for what was going to come, which was hip-hop, techno, house, and electro kind of embodied all of those three kind of forms of music. Tell me about... Tell me something about the Hacienda that I wouldn't know. Well, I don't know if you'd know it or not, but when the Hacienda opened, it really was struggling as a club. It was very badly designed in a lot of ways. I mean, again, you know, one of the kind of myths is that this was this Great Dance Club, which it was, you know, late 80s. But when they initially opened it, the DJ booth, and this is during the time I worked there, which was like the latter part of 83, it was to the side of the stage in a separate room. And it was below ground level, so you had a slit where you could see literally people's legs as they walked past you. You were like in a radio studio. They had this mixer. I mean, now by this point, I'm known as a mixing DJ. And they've got this mixer that hasn't even got faders on. You've got to push these buttons to get the... Why did you take the job? Well, because... Really, you know, they come across to me. I mean, the people who approached me about it were Mike Pickering, who later became a famous DJ there, and Rob Gretton, who was the manager of New Order. And Rob was like, you know, people talk about Tony Wilson, but Tony Wilson didn't know anything about dance music. He was a nice guy and he was the figurehead of the club, but I didn't have a clue about dance music. Rob Gretton did. Rob Gretton was and what happened with the Hacienda is that because Factory Records like owned it basically New Order A Certain Ratio, Kondo Kwango which is my pickerings band they'd all been out to New York and they'd seen places like Paradise Garage Loft the main place the one that they were always talking about and the one that they really wanted to base what they wanted to do on was a club called Dan Ceteria. There's a DJ there called Mark Kamens. And at one point, I was going to do an exchange. Mark Kamens was going to come over to Hacienda for a month or something. I was going to go over to New York to Dan Ceteria. Never came. We often talk about this, you know, because I know Mark now. And, you know, so they'd now seen what was going on in New York in terms of dance culture. and they wanted to do a bit of that at the Hacienda. They'd come back to Manchester and like a certain ratio the guys from CERN used to come on a Wednesday, you know, and I remember like coming into early 83, you know, like the manager at Legend would say, you know, like this is some of the, you know, Tony Wilson, because Tony Wilson was, he was a TV presenter. So everyone knew he was anyway. And so Tony Wilson's in tonight. He's kind of popped in and then different people from the Hacienda were popping in on a Wednesday to see what was going on. at Legend. Another thing that happened was I did, there was a big TV program called The Tube on Channel 4, which was the main music program in the UK at the time. And I was invited on there to demonstrate mixing. It was the first instance of, you know, live mixing by a UK DJ on TV. And I, you know, anyone who's into factory records and stuff would have watched the tube. And so I think that at that point in time brought me to the attention of a lot of different people who weren't really the dance crowd, so to speak. And so they saw that on their doorstep was a... club that was you know playing all this music that was coming out of New York because I was playing you know like all the stuff on like Prelude, Emergency, Tommy Boy, Streetwise, all these labels, Profile, it was all imports you know at Legend and so they approached me and would you do the Friday night and you know, I went over there and it was really difficult because there were so many things against it. There was, as I say, apart from the DJ booth, apart from the fact they could hardly get any people in the place. They had a decent Saturday nights, you know, but Friday struggled and the rest of the week struggled. They had to open seven nights a week. It was bizarre. And... Also, in Manchester, you had to be a member to go in clubs at the time. So before you even went into the club, you had to buy a membership which cost about 10 quid or something, which for the black crowd that were coming to my nights, that was a lot of money back then. and they didn't like that particular club anyway they didn't see it as their kind of place and at the same time they had to pay a load of money before they even got in the place that was difficult I remember one night like a coach load came from Huddersfield like 50 odd people on a coach and they couldn't get in because they weren't members, and they ended up going to another club around the corner, and they weren't going to come again. So we had, in the end, and the other thing that they were doing, they already had bookings in for certain nights with bands that they pre-booked months before, and so we'd have... good night for example we had Houdini came and played that was a good night we had Neutrum and two had like a big track on the electro you know electro track British band you know this pulled the crowds in and we also had the British breakdancing and body popping championship which was the first like kind of main breakdancing contest in the UK so they were the three nights I remember like where it was really good but the next week you know they might have orchestra manoeuvres in the dark playing and I wasn't you know I didn't DJ that night so the momentum was gone Really, you know, we were kind of working against the tide and eventually, you know, like when it came towards the end of that year, I'd made a decision that I was going to move away from DJing and trying it into production and stuff. And I'd seen that with the advent of... the whole breakdance thing, which was amazing when it first started, it eventually kind of split the scene because... if I played anything remotely electro, there was a ruck of guys challenging each other on the dance floor and the girls were getting pissed off because the dance space was taken and you could see there was going to be a split. And it was, you know, eventually that was what the original hip hop scene in the UK came out of. And, you know, the other crowd that, you know, like kind of... went more towards what eventually became the house scene because the house scene in Manchester and Nottingham and Birmingham and these places came out of the black scene as well so The Hacienda, it was very, very difficult to get any momentum there. What was interesting, though, was that they had a Saturday night, which did well. Any club has a decent Saturday night. And they got me to come there for a period of time to play an hour, the type of music I was playing on the Friday, to try to... climatize their normal crowd which were kind of rain-coated students and indie kids to the type of stuff I was playing because what you've got to take into account is sometimes one of these kids would find me in this room and berate me for playing dance shit what are you playing this dance shit for you know there was this whole thing this was not a dance crowd that you know were like into dance music So the idea was about, you know, play. But what I did there was I was by this point, you know, there was a breakdance crew in Manchester who became quite famous called Broken Glass that I ended up managing. And they come in and dance, you know, while I played. And that's, you know, everyone loved them in the Hacienda because it was so visual. And I think what they did was they, for the first time, gave the Hacienda a credibility with the black crowd in Manchester. And that paid dividends later down the line because, you know, again, people... Another myth is the Hacienda in 88, 89 explodes with rave and that's where it all starts. But people don't realise that Mike Pickering's Nude Night in 86 was doing really well on a Friday with the black kids were the main kind of... people that were pushing the whole thing for in fact the first house track Mike Pickering played he said a kid from like Hume or Moss Side came in and gave him a copy there was no way back you know Donis and can you play this so and you know people like Gerald you know I always say like now is that This assumption that, say, a guy called Gerald Voodoo Ray, I think people would imagine, you know, here's this guy, Gerald, and he goes into the Hacienda and he has this epiphany here in this great house music and he goes away and writes Voodoo Ray. It's the other way around. It's Gerald and his contemporaries are the people that brought that music into the Hacienda in the first place. I mean, Gerald's... jazz funk, you know, also the electro scene. If you listen to Voodoo Ray, there's a lot of jazz influences in that. You can hear the electro, it's not kind of conventional house track by any stretch, you know. Bye. Those seeds when I was there, I think, you know, especially as I say with Broken Glass coming in and, you know, they almost became like the resident Hacienda dance crew kind of thing. I mean, they were loved. They were like mini celebrities in that place. They, you know, they brought in more and more people as time went on and gave it that kind of... of credibility that previously lacked. You said in 84 that you decided to move into production. Yeah. Get away from DJing. Mm-hmm. Is that a money thing? No, no, no. Was it a fame thing? Was it a I need a new challenge thing? Yeah, it was that. And it sounds ridiculous now because what did DJs go and do a few years later? They started producing. But when I made that decision, there weren't, or certainly not English DJs. I mean, really what it was with me was that we didn't know too much about what was going on in New York. We got bits and bobs of information and stuff, but the names are on the records, like Tom Moulton doing remixes in the late 70s and stuff, but particularly in the early 80s. T Scott, you know, like, I always remember like North End, you know, Happy Days, the mix that I'd play was T's Happy and the idea that this was a DJ and he had his name on the record. you know, name, mix, you know, it kind of, wow, you know, you could see the elevation. And Larry Levan and Shep Pettibone, Francois Kavorkian, all these names, you know, were starting to crop up on more and more records. And then the realization, yeah, these, a lot of these are DJs and they're remixing. And I wanted to do that. I was doing my mixes for radio and I was starting to kind of move. doing a lot of editing and stuff, and I wanted to remix. I knew all the people at the record companies, and I'd go to London a lot, and I'd be saying, you know, can you get me a remix job and stuff? And they'd speak to their bosses, and their bosses would literally say, like, American DJs remix, English DJs don't remix. You know, it's like, again, it sounds crazy now, but that was the way it was. I was banging my head against a And eventually, um, I kind of approached it laterally, which was if I can't get work remixing, then maybe I can make my own music. And I hooked up with two musicians. One was a guy called Martin Jackson, who was the drummer with a band called Magazine previously, who just bought a Lindrum. The other was Andy Connell, who was the keyboard player at the time with A Certain Ratio. and we did some experimental dance tracks, which eventually came out as all the tracks but one on an album called Street Sounds UK. Electro Street Sounds was a huge thing. They put out compilations of initially the big black music tracks, the more soul-based tracks, but eventually... this electro series that was you know so influential to so many people I mean they went into like something like I mean it eventually flipped into hip hop they were initially called electro and then it was electro hip hop and then eventually it was hip hop but they went into something like about almost 20 volumes of these and the early you know the early electro just had a massive impact These were like all the breakdance crews, which by '84 there were breakdance crews in every town up and down the country. They all had ghetto blasters and the electro albums, because they were mixed, they were also the first mixed series of albums in the UK, that they were what the break crews would play. So the cassettes sold probably more than the vinyl, I would imagine. And so, yeah, that's what I did there, you know, and I got into, by default almost, into, like, production and thought, you know, the time was now right to take a change of direction. I could see the scene changing because of the way breakdancing had kind of changed the dynamic in terms of what was happening on the dance floor. And I knew that the next step was the kind of turntabler's inside of it, cutting and scratching. I'd kind of taken tentative steps into the, you know, my scratching was very primitive. You know, when I listen back, I'm almost embarrassed, you know. Oh, God, I was, you know, like, but, you know, I was probably one of the first people, if not the first, who was, like, kind of scratching, you know, and stuff like that. Not very But I kind of realized that the people that were in New York that were doing it, from the records that we were getting, that to get to that level, you literally, you'd have to practice eight hours a day. And I didn't want to be doing that. I was, and you know, like the guy who became my prodigy almost was a guy called Chad Jackson, eventually won the world mixing championship. And he was that kind of person. He was eager to do it and he put the time in and everything. I was more about editing. So I was going, rather than it being a live thing, I was more moving back was the slower process, which, you know, was more production based eventually. And so I... There was also that kind of level of youthful ego again saying to me, because going back to that guy, John Grant, who was the DJ that had gone to work as a Harbourmaster, he'd like quit at the top. He was the top DJ in the area when he quit. And that... resonated with me a bit. Like, it was like, you know, like a undefeated boxing champion going out, you know, rather than taking one too many to fight. And I just thought, right, make this grand gesture, I'll quit. at the end of the year and that was exactly what I did and initially it looked like a good decision because I was managing Broken Glass the break crew they were they did like national TV and stuff they were touring around the country I was doing the UK electoral album that eventually that got to number 60 on the UK chart which was you know pretty good going We were doing interviews in magazines and everything looked fine and then it just all went pear-shaped and everything fell apart to the level where I lost my car, I lost my house, I was so skinned. I didn't want to go back to DJing because it would have been seen as such a kind of... of defeat a turnaround and it just threw me out you know I was all at sea for a long time and it it took many many many years you know the effects of that you know before I kind of in any way stabilized again you know so you had no idea I was gonna I mean you saw a change in But you had no idea it was going to change in a way that was going to affect you so negatively? No, not at all. Obviously, you know, I was hopeful that it would all move in. a positive direction as things had previously but no and what it was you know I could only see it later down the line was that I'd made my move in this direction two years too early maybe three years three or four you know because later you know when people like Paul Oakenfold emerged and Weatherall doing remixes and everything the time was right then British DJs did remixes. By that point, you know, I mean, I was in a different place. I was managing bands, I was managing a band called The Ruthless Rap Assassin, so I was in a different place again. But yeah, you know, I could see what happened is that, you know, sometimes you can be a little bit too ahead of the curve and, you know, you can make a move and, you know, you can fall down because of that. because people just aren't quite ready at that point for what you want to do. Maybe you're not even ready yourself to some level, you know. And so, yeah, it became very difficult, you know, and it took a long time. I had to move to London before I could find myself, you know, get myself back on my feet and get my direction going again. So, yeah, that kind of took me out of play for quite a while. When did you move to London? I think about 86. Yeah, I think it was 86. And I went there and then, you know, I mean, I was so struggling around that time. And, you know, I knew a few people up there and there was one particular guy who was a great help. It was a guy called Ian Dewhurst who'd been an old DJ back on the Northern Soul scene and the jazz funk scene later. And he was, at that point in time, he was running Fourth and Broadway in the UK at Island Records. And, you know, that, you know, kind of did a few bits and bobs for him. and that helped me get back on my feet and then at the same time Broken Glass, the breakdance crew that I'd managed, one of the guys, and that was a guy called Kermit, who'd previously been one of the faces on the scene, you know, like the black scene and everything. He'd been one of the kids that used to come to the club. And he'd got together a hip-hop crew called the Ruthless Rap Assassins, and I started managing and producing them, and we eventually signed a deal with EMI and did two albums with them. Kermit went on later to work with Sean Ryder and form Black Grave and they had a number one album and everything. So it was... It was a kind of rollercoaster type of existence, an up-and-down existence, you know, like it is, I suppose, for many people, you know, musicians and stuff in that world that sometimes it goes well and sometimes it's disastrous, you know. But I think it was good in terms of it taught me about humility. And, you know, like when you've got to kind of look down the back of the couch to scrape enough money, you know, together to go and get yourself a packet of cigarettes or something, you know, you start seeing things in a little bit of a different way than you did previously. So, you know, you had all of these successes after age 18, basically, right? Well, I started in the 20s. One success after another. I guess looking back, you probably needed to cut down a peg a little bit. Maybe, maybe. Yeah, I think that, you know, like there is a kind of level of that and there is, you know, that kind of ego that you have, which is good as well, which is the very thing that... that made me take those risks that other people wouldn't take. I'd have that kind of self-confidence to think that I could change things when people would have said, you're mad. But I did change things because I was just... very single-minded you know i mean i you know i i was always about you know taking my direction i never did anything against anybody else uh it was always just i just believed in doing it in different ways than other people. And I was very progressive and very open to new ideas where other people, they kind of got stuck in the ways a bit, you know, and that shook it up quite a lot. But, you know, as I say, I think what happened was I overstretched. I kind of saw too far ahead of myself. went for that and then when it didn't go right I didn't have anything to fall back on at all and you know it was just like this big big abyss that I kind of dropped into when did you climb out of the abyss well as I say I think I kind of climbed out and kept falling back down and it was hard you know I mean the worst the worst of it for me really was after After the Rap Assassins and everything, going into the 90s, you know, I'd had different projects. And I got to a point where, you know, I'd had so many kind of knockbacks and disappointments. I had a project called Mind, Body and Soul that was signed to Polydor. And everything looked like that was going to take off. And then, through no fault of our own, you know, like there was a big change in the company and personnel. there was a new managing director who had his own idea of what he wanted to do and wanted to get rid of all the A&R guys and all of a sudden we're kind of no longer getting the treatment that we need and it's all gone. I remember that it had come to a point, which was around the mid-90s for me, where I'd completely lost any muse that I had, that I couldn't even sit and listen to music. And it all came to this moment that I remember that I was sat at home, I always had a I always used to have a pen and a pad and I'd write things down. And I had this pen and pad and nothing was coming out of that. The telly was on, but the sound was down. I didn't want to listen to any music. There was nothing inspiring me. And I remember I could just hear the clock ticking. And I remember thinking, that's my life ticking away one second at a time. I could really hear it that clearly. And that happened a number of times, you know, being in that scenario and being stuck in that and not knowing how I was going to get out of it. And there was a bit of a, you know, where did it all go wrong? You know, there was that. And the worst thing for me. was people would constantly be telling you god if you would have only stayed and they used to say these they still equate it to money and money's never been the big thing for me um but people would equate it god do you know how much he's making they tell me how much these djs were and if you would have stayed doing it you would have been doing this and that i don't know if the term was in existence back then but i'm sure it would even hurt more if someone had said it's all gone pitong for you. Well, absolutely. And it had gone pitong. Because you'd be like, well. Yeah. It had absolutely gone pitong. I could have been pitong. I knew. I mean, you know, pitong was actually my direct contemporary. but from the South. So in the early 80s, the jazz funk scene, whereas I was the young guy on the Northern scene, Pete Tong was the young guy on the Southern scene. We were, you know, a lot of similarity. I mean, I obviously knew Pete Tong because he was like DJ from London at that point in time. So, yeah, I suppose you can look at that. You can look at how certain people had just like become. you know, very wealthy out of, you know, being DJs. Well, it's all luck. I mean, you tried to go into production two years early and he went the radio route full bore and got it at the right exact right moment. you know but I mean you know one thing that I look at now and I'm really glad of is that you know I see DJs out there you know who basically back themselves into a corner that they have to play a certain style or type of music that you know I know that they can't be enjoying that you know that because I know where they're coming from, I know where their background is. But that's what happens, is you start kind of going down a certain road and you get paid a lot of money for doing that. But that's what's expected of you. I always remember this occasion where there was a DJ called John Kelly, who had come from Liverpool. And this is in the 90s. At one point we... did this underground party. I was involved with some bands that were on it and we put on this underground party. It was in this rehearsal room that Echo and the Bunnymen owned and it was in the docks. It was like a legal party and it was one of the last of the illegal kind of parties. Great night, fantastic. Police came but didn't close it and loads of people there. And John Kelly, who'd been the DJ at a club called The Underground, which was like a really early kind of Liverpool, like rave type club, influential. That's how I knew him and I'd originally met him because he played a track that I'd produced. He turned up there and he'd been playing, I think, Back to Basics in Leeds that night. And he comes in there and he's got his record back and he's like, wow, can I play? You know, I don't want any money for it, but can I play for now? And it was like, yeah, you know. And I can remember late, it was about kind of six in the morning or something. And, you know, it was that time where people started to filter out. I could, looking across the dark, I could see him and he was stood there and he was like looking into space and I went over to him and I said, you're right, John, you know, and he was like, it's just like the underground. It's just like, and he was like, I can't do this anymore. And I was realising what he was saying, that he can't play anymore what he wanted to play because now that he was established and everything, he had to play in a certain way So, you know, that kind of said a lot to me and I'm so happy that I never got into that situation because for me, music, it was before I was a DJ and all that, you know, it goes back to when I was a kid, you know, music's the primary thing in my life. So to lose contact with that in a sense, you know, there's no amount of money that's worth that. for me. I mean, one of the things that I kind of realized during the time I wasn't a DJ, I actually mentioned this on my blog, is that I kind of came to this conclusion that even though I wasn't a DJ and hadn't been for a long time, I'd never stopped being a DJ. And what that was, was that even if someone had just come to my house, I was still going, have you heard this? And I was then saying, oh, have you seen this? Have you read this book? Because I was getting into other stuff, you know, because I didn't spend all my time being a DJ. And then I kind of went, all right. That actually goes before I was a DJ. So it's something inherent in my nature that I had to share things. Wouldn't you say though that you're known for something now? At the current position that you're in, wouldn't you say that there are expectations of what you'll do at a party? That you're the edit guy? Yeah, well, that's one aspect of it. I mean, I'm very comfortable in terms of... Not that you don't like that. No, in terms of what I am and what I bring to the table and, you know, what my place is in all this, I've come to realize what it is. And... in many respects, it's to do with being a bridge between then and now. You know, I am, in a sense, somebody from the past who has managed to connect into the present. helped by things like the re-edits. I mean, when I came back to DJing, you know, I was very aware that what I didn't want to be. And I didn't want to be Mr. Nostalgia coming back and playing the golden tunes that, you know, coming back with my old record box and doing what I used to do back then. that has a certain amount of mileage, you know, this novelty value that people might go, yeah, you know, go and see him and maybe they'd go and see me once, maybe twice, but that'd be it. Then they'd move on and have a look at the next novelty value thing. So there was no mileage in that and that was one of the reasons why, you know, when I had to make the decision, what am I going to do? Am I going to play vinyl? Am I going to play CD collecting vinyl, you know, after I stopped DJing, mainly because I had a load of records stolen. destroyed that for me you know other stuff that i've bought since then have been on cd so i had a bit of both and then a third option emerged which i could go the laptop room and then the idea of the laptop alongside an all real to real so you know current contemporary technology against antiquated technology and that balance that that was the balance so Then with the music I played. Had you done a lot of reel-to-reel stuff while you were DJing before? Well, that's how the reel-to-reel came back into it. When I was working in studios doing production, what I'd do is I would make tapes of sounds. So I'd collect sounds from anywhere and everywhere. and I'd edit them all individually onto tape with, you know, kind of gaps in between. And basically, I'd be working on a track, and what I'd do is... I'd sit back and I'd put a tape on and I'd listen to the track with sounds, just random sounds playing at the top and then I'd go, I like that sound with the... So I'd either just have it as a one-time thing or I'd throw it into a sampler and put it back into the track. So these tapes I'd already made for working in the studio and it was the same principle I used when I came back into DJing, working on a random... When I'm playing, I'm listening to sounds through the headphones and then I hear a sound that sounds alright with the track I'm playing and I'll spin it in there a few times and then I'll move on and that's how I work and it works on a random principle. I want it to work. Some people say, how do you know where the sounds are? And it's like, well, I don't do it that way. If I wanted to place a sound directly into a track, I'd just do that anyway and then run it off that way and play it that way. It's not that. It's just a random thing that I want to bring in just to pepper it up that little bit. So, yeah, that comes from during the time that I wasn't DJing. And yeah, so coming back to it and having, being able to bring the Reevox into play, which was mad when I started doing it, people thought I was going to show a film or something. They were like, what is that? You know, like this big... whole clumpy machine. But I'm used to it. I'm used to spinning sounds. I'm used to that. It's my instrument in a sense. Some people say, well, couldn't you do that in a CD? Well, I suppose you could to a level, although it wouldn't be quite the same. It works this way, and so that's how I want to do it. With the music I played, again, the re-edits played absolutely into my hands. I've been away from it so long and during a lot of that period, certainly the latter part of the 90s into the early part of the new millennium that I hardly ever went to a club. I'm completely disillusioned with clubs. Whenever I did go to clubs, it went beyond me that a DJ just wanted to play one tempo and one small strand of style. all you know because that was never the way we as i said we worked from a whole remit of black music you know and from down tempo to up tempo all sorts of moods in there that's what it was about so to narrow everything down to one thing and i you know i felt older in the 90s than i did i did later because i i thought i've lost i don't understand it i don't I don't see this anymore. And where it came to a head there for me, where all my understanding started to kind of creep in on what was going on, was I remember going to Cream in Liverpool one night. I was never a big fan of Cream. I always thought it was a bit after the Lord Mayor's show, this super club. you know, it kind of thing opened five years after like the Hacienda was at its peak and stuff. So, you know, to me, these things, I'm more interested in things developing through and coming up than, you know, like big branded like nights and stuff. But, you know, I went down there a few times for certain things. And this one night I went and we had a friend who was only young in his early 20s. And taking his tab of A and he'd gone straight on the dance floor we'd gone and sat near like the bar and chatted to someone so we were there maybe two two and a half hours or something and then we wanted to get off and so we went to look to find him there he is on the dance floor and kind of pulled him off the dance floor and I'm like saying to him you've had a great time DJ was a bit shit and I'm like what? I couldn't understand it. I'm saying, you've just danced for two and a half hours and you're telling me the DJ wasn't very good. I just couldn't get it. And then it clicked. I thought, ah, right, this is what's happened. He's taken his ecstasy and he's going to dance regardless of the DJ being good or not. That's what people are doing. And you see, this is where I, for me, it went wrong was if you go back to like, say, Hacienda is an example. When it all exploded and Mike Pickering said this, I've seen him say that they were the best times because the black crowd was still there and they weren't just playing house, they were playing hip hop and they were playing street soul. It was all together on one night and then they went all kind of house music all night long and it all went to one kind of thing. Now, in that early period, initially you had the music and then Ecstasy came on the scene. And Ecstasy enhanced the music and it was a great thing during that kind of period of time. People were getting on one and it was great. It was a wonderful time. But then what I think happened was that the drug took over from the music. So the drug became the primary thing and the music became the secondary experience. For me, it's the wrong equation because music is a very powerful thing. I mean, it's why we're sat here talking in the first place. You know, it goes back, you know, as I say, to when I'm a kid, you know, so to have to... to have to take a drug to enjoy music in some sense is the wrong way around for me. I mean, fine, anyone wants to take what they want as an enhancement. And I think the more it went on in the 90s, it was purely the drug experience and the music kind of plugged into that. And this is what I saw specifically on this night with this friend, that he'd... taken his drug and he was going to dance world bataille you know he doesn't care you know but he'll still say at the same time didn't like the DJ wasn't very good but he's just danced for two see me going back to the 70s mid 70s when I started you'd be looking at an empty dance floor if somebody didn't like what you were playing it was very clean cut now it wasn't clean cut a DJ could come in also the other thing that I kind of used to look at around that period was that I think DJs became so technical that they started not to play the best record but to play the one that mixed the best from the previous record. When I used to hear this term sets, because we didn't used to use that term, I'm going to do my set and I'm just kind of working on my set and I'm like thinking... Right, what you're saying is that you're at home all week and you've got a gig on Saturday and you're practicing what you're going to play on Saturday. Mix for mix. You're getting it really perfected. What was the vocabulary that you used? Spots, maybe. You know, the night. We used to work all night. I used to get in at nine o'clock and we finished at two. A set was a thing a band did. a band played a set and so they had a list of numbers they were going to do but within that you know, they'll play the same song differently from one night to the next because there's, you know, maybe four or five elements to it and now it comes together. With a DJ, the more technically good they become, it's locked in to a level they may as well be playing a tape, you know, because they know what they're going to play. And what got me was when... Say, for example, if I go and play... I'm here tonight. I'm in Oslo. I've never played in Oslo before. So, obviously, I've got an idea of what I want to play. but I want to be open to see, you know, it can go slightly in one way or slightly in another. I mean, obviously, if I walk in there and everyone wants techno, I've been booked into the wrong venue. But within what I do play, there's a wide scope of music to choose from from that. So I'm not locked into it, you know, whereas these guys were locked. into it absolutely locked into it so they and and and then with that you get the attitude of you I'd hear DJ saying I did it it wasn't too good you know they didn't understand me you know like and and they say things like somebody came up and asked me for a record dickhead how dare they ask me for you know I'm like We used to go on the mic and say, you know, like, if there's anything you'd like to hear, come and talk to us. You know, it was such a reciprocal thing, you know. If it's inappropriate, you can't play it. If it doesn't work within it, yeah. But you want to have that contact. But now people were saying, look, I am above you. I know the score. You know, I am the man here. You know, DJs were thinking that they were the shaman. They really, you know, getting so above the station. You know, I used to see that all the time. And really, you know, I mean, they'd lost track of what I you know, you're channeling, you know, I mean, you select your music and you like what you like, but who am I to say that what I like is better than what you like. You love your music. How do we quantify that? It's such a subjective thing. That's what's the beauty of this. So, you know, what you're hoping will happen is that people will respond to your personality in music. And like that, you know, and then we can start to kind of work around that and introduce things and stuff. And that works from there. But for me to kind of put myself in the position of thinking I'm some kind of teacher, I'm going to come and teach you what good music is, I just think is so up its arse, you know. And, you know, it was never, ever about that. But that's how it increasingly became, you know. after that kind of acid house explosion and when DJs all of a sudden thought that they were, you know, the holy man, you know, the holy man of music, you know, come with all the answers for you, you know. And so, as I say, I was adrift in the 90s because I just thought, you know, I don't know what's going on anymore. I'm, you know, I'm getting old. And so coming back into it, you know, the re-edits, I didn't know people were re-editing stuff. I had no idea that people were re-editing things. I was doing that back in the, you know, kind of early 80s when I was doing my radio slots and stuff. I was taking tracks and editing them around, calling them turntable edits, using two copies of the record. you know, running one behind the other, like we used to do live. We used to kind of call double up, even like three turntables, you know, Wigan Pier and Legend, trebling them up, you know. I'd always, you know, ask the record companies, because all the UK releases I got sent to me, so I might have bought something on import, but I'd still say to them if it was coming out in the UK, just to get a few extra weeks out of it, you know send me three copies or two copies and I'd start playing around doubling them up and people would go into the record shop and say have you got like you know Sharon Red beat the street for example and they'd buy it and then they'd come back and say it's not the right mix you know and it's like the only mix you know and it's like they'd heard me playing around and that's what got me on the telly in the end because I was doubling up a copy of this David Joseph record and the people from the tube were in because David Joseph was doing a PA and he was going to be on the tube and they heard me playing around with this record and went this sounds interesting come on in and do this thing so you know, to find out that people were re-editing, taking old tracks and changing them around, you know, straight away that said, that's what I do. So I started, you know, that first night that I did, which was in Manchester in December 2003. you know, I made some edits that night and also played some original ones. The one that really got me, I had this edit of Chaka Khan, I feel for you, which turned up on credits of the edit volume one in the end. And I'd done that in night. in 1984 you know no one was interested in what I was I was trying to get work I was trying to get the reason I was doing them was to go to record companies because I'm thinking well all the music I'm playing the mixes I'm doing this latest American kind of from black music these people in the companies probably don't know these records so they can't hear what I'm doing so I'll tell you what I'll do I'll take something they know like I Feel For You Chaka Khan or Two Tribes, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, or, you know. And they know that, so they can hear what I'm doing with limited facility. So maybe they'll give me the op. Didn't work. No one was interested. Then, you know, like nearly 20 years later, I play this in a club and kids are coming, oh, what is this? What's this edit? This is brilliant, you know. And I'm like, this is mad, you know. It takes all this time for people to kind you know appreciate that you know it's great you know it's great that that kind of come around so the re-edits enabled me to take this music from the past but present it a contemporary way and then you had like acts from now who were again drawing their influence like people like Metro Area, Atlantic Conveyor you know that I could play alongside this to you know and that's that became you know like the approach that I took how it's worked out I'd never had the idea that it would go this far. I didn't know what I thought. you know, I've been kind of persuaded. I mean, why I come back into it was really, and it was for the right reasons because there were times in the nineties were again against this backdrop of, you know, you should never have stopped and how much you could be making and blah, blah, blah. But people would say, you know, with good intentions for me and friends, you know, we were really concerned because you could see me on the bones of my heart, you know. And they'd say, look, you know, all you got to do is get a set together. You know, you can get agent, you know, just on the back of the fact that you worked at the Hacienda, you get an agent, blah, blah, blah. And, you know, they put it in those terms. And to a level, you kind of think, yeah, you know, maybe that, maybe. And then I'd say, well, you know, could I, like, a bit of No, no, you can't do that. You've got to pick. Okay. Wasn't going to work. There's no way I was going to do that. What they were really saying when it boiled down was try to find 200 quid from somewhere, go into a record shop, buy 200 pounds worth of records that basically sound similar to each other, call it a set, go out and DJ and say, you know. ex-Hacienda DJ or whatever and you'll get some gigs but god you know if I would have done that it would have been over within six months or less and I would have had no respect and I would never have been able to come back into it so thankfully not you know when I did come back into it was on my own terms but the driving force was because when I started looking around the internet when I got a computer and started to see what was going on and seeing that there were websites and forums and different people and realizing a passage of time had now gone by and that dance culture was seen in a historic sense and people were talking about, especially about the rave era and everything. straight away, you know, I could see, like, there are huge, big gaping holes within this that no one's talking about the black scene. The black scene underpins everything that followed. You know, without the black scene, you don't get nothing, you know, because that's where it all comes from. And yet it's being presented, although, you know, as I say with the Hacienda, like it emerges out of nowhere in 1988 as this cathedral of dance. You know, no one's saying, well, why? You know, didn't it start as an indie club? Was it owned by Factory Records? Or, you know, why? How does this happen? And so I decided to do the website, Electrofunk Roots, which was zooming in on that early 80s period that had a lot of archive material so I could document that and get that down. And, you know, it was on the back of that that people said, would you be interested in DJing at our night? And then it seemed valid. You know, it seemed a valid approach. And so, you know, I made... I made those moves and it just organically snowballed over the years and worked out the way that it has, which it's still surprising in lots of ways to find myself sitting here in Oslo or wherever I might be and people wanting to pay me to come and play music, which is fantastic. *music* Thank you.
