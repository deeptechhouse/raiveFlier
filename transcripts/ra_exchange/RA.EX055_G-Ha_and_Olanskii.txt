Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic world. music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Jiha and Olansky are two of Oslo's unsung heroes. They have helmed the Sunkist Party for more than a decade in the Norwegian capital, and in the process have brought countless international guests to the unlikely clubbing hotspot. Olansky now runs the club Jaeger in the city, which is where I talked to these two veteran DJs last month about the city and its influence on the electronic music world. My name is Gia, I DJ and do parties here in Oslo and I've done that for 20 years or something like that. My name is Olanski and I'm from Oslo. I run Sankist and I run a club called Diega. Been doing this for the last 15 years. Did you grow up in Oslo yourself? Yes, I did in a small suburb. playing in youth clubs and stuff like that. So when did you first start DJing? You said you've been DJing for 20 some years. I was about 14, I think, so that must be like 20 something years ago, yeah. What you said you were DJing at youth clubs? What sort of music were you playing? Ah, that was like everything Beastie Boys to like Sidney Youngblood to Billie Jean to whatever but We also started to play like Jungle and early house stuff in the youth club. To someone like an American, a silly American like me, a youth club, I don't even... It's like a nightclub, but without the alcohol and with the kids instead. But also like... Yeah, just a place to hang out after school and stuff like that. Were you going to nightclubs then once you were able to get in? Were there certain places in Oslo that were big for you? I started here at the same venue as Jaeger is today, 20 years ago. I wasn't old enough, but they were not so picky on checking the ID and stuff like that back then. Yeah, I started here playing like hip-hop and yeah, commercial stuff. And I got sacked after a few years for playing too much house music. Were there house clubs in Oslo that catered to it or was that the only place? Yeah, it started just after that, I think, after I got selected here. It was like a big super club down the street called Pure, which was a bit dodgy, but... It's run by some dodgy people. But it was fun back then. They had guests like Tony DeVitt and stuff like that. And was that sort of big for you, seeing international DJs bringing in this music? Yeah. Who were some of the DJs that really blew your mind when they came in? It was just after that again when we had clubs like Skansen and Jazzy that the guests were really interesting. I think Lorne Cartier and Derek May and all those guys played there quite early. And also Skansen we had lots of the new... the phonic sort of people and the recordings guys coming which was like big influence for all of us. It seems like Oslo's kind of def- music I know it's hard to pin down but it seems like it's a little bit more eclectic than some places and I wonder if you can put your finger on why that is is that because the clubs had to be eclectic the DJs have to be eclectic I actually put it down to people like Gia because... At the early days, running clubs wasn't something you did because you, I suppose you had to. It wasn't like in England where the pub shut at 11 and then there was only clubs. Everything was open until the same hour, so if you did a club it was because you wanted to. And I think the clubs came out of more passion. I mean, I suppose for some people it was a fashion thing as well, but all the same. I think the clubs that we remember in Oslo today were driven by people who did it because they really wanted to and that created a different atmosphere, certainly for the DJs, than say, you know, more commercial interest. So although the clubs weren't like necessarily always massive or there wasn't, you know, heaps of them, the clubs that were... important we're always run by people who are really into music and I think that opens it up a little bit I mean I cut my teeth in London so that's again a very different scenario but I think yeah I think it's also being a little bit outside of the center you know people like Gaz said before You had to kind of put in a few different styles in there to please, you know, different sort of people coming out because it wasn't a massive house scene that would come and listen to just this kind of house. music or just that sort of electronic music. You said you spent some time in the UK. You were born here though, right? I was born in Oslo, yes. What were the circumstances of you going to the UK? I did a BA Photography in London and stayed on. I ran a club called the Nottingham Arts Club for quite a few years. I actually didn't move back until three years ago so I was there for nearly 12 years. So I think my influence here is actually kind of being in London and sending things back through the Sunkist club that we've been running for 11 years. So in many respects, Sunkist was a sort of a love letter from London to Oslo. You said you were running the Notting Hill? How did that come to be? How did you get involved with that? I think London killed my interest in photography. And I started doing parties and through people who knew people I got a job at the Nottingham House Club working as an assistant for the guy who was booking the place. And then as time passed he went away to open his own club and I got the job so I was sitting there basically booking all the nights. I wasn't booking all the DJs or all the bands per se, because the place was open seven days a week. But I was basically... booking in all the concepts or dealing with the other people working the different nights, which is quite a lot the same as I'm doing here at Jaeger now, really. I mean, the Arts Club was very eclectic. We had Alan McGee from Creation Records doing Wednesday nights. I was working with Paul Thomas who did the One World Show on Radio 1, which had just about everything electronic. Phil Ash and Patrick Forge ran Inspiration Information, playing Boogie Soul. dancehall jazz stuff for 11 years. One of my favourite nights I think. And I mean Sundays we had house clubs, Lazy Dog was every other Sunday. Probably the most crazy busy, consistently crazy busy club I've ever seen in my life. And we had Sunday Sonic with Stuart Patterson and Neil Asdall on the other Sundays and they had a lot of really good American guests or, you know, Derek Carter would come straight from the end and sleep in the couch and wake up sometime later at night demanding absinthe. You said that you started, you only moved back three years ago, so obviously you started Sunkist while you were in London. Can you guys talk a little bit about the genesis of the night? I think I'll do the first part. It'd be interesting to, because GAD didn't come in until like the winter of like four months into it but and he changed the club I mean romantically but I've been in contact with the guys running Blow not the ones who are running it now but back then this is a venue in Oslo yeah I mean a really nice venue in Oslo which opened 15 years ago actually and I did a few gigs there in '99. And I suppose I said, "Look, I have all these DJs around me in London. It'd be nice to do something where we do a regular Friday, Saturday, and I bring them over." And at the time, we actually did it as a flight chair where we did Tromsø, which is up in the far north. Trondheim, which is in the middle, and Oslo on the Saturday. Initially the booking was quite eclectic. The first one was Tom Middleton. And we had Jay Hannan from Lazy Dog played. Phil Asher came and played as well. And there were people who were close around me or around friends in London. And then I realized I needed someone to work with me and to play if I wasn't there or take care of the artists or whatever. And in that period I met Gaiad who was still running Skansen at the time. and yeah we just clicked and the next couple of years it became more house I mean we introduced a lot of guys contacts like Rob Melo came and played and Doc Martin yes well that was That's another story with a propeller plane up, Morf. What is this propeller plane story with Doc Martin? No, it was funny because he flew, I guess he flew business to London and, you know, whatever else to Oslo. And then we flew him up to Tromso and then... We landed in pitch black darkness, he played and next morning it was completely like crisp bright day, probably quite late in the year. He had snow on all the peaks and Tromsø is sub-arctic, it's pretty wild up there and we got to get the plane to Trondheim and basically it was a small propeller plane and although it was a completely clear day, the turbulence was... Completely nuts. It's like a milkshaker two hours down to Trondheim. I'm not sure if... I'm not sure he didn't say anything. I'm not sure how he took it. We're still good friends. But it was spectacular. The views and the day was just amazing. But you're sitting there and taking in this kind of... The view is great, but the flight is terrible. Well, it was one of those things. It's really wild and crazy and hardly anyone living in the areas you fly across. It's just really sort of sawtooth mountains with snow on them. You're thinking, I don't want to crash here. It's beautiful, but I don't want to go down right now. But yeah, Sankis is organic in the way it's developed for the years, but it comes back to that first thing about bringing abroad to Norway somehow. in every aspect of it through who we book as DJs through I suppose our I go for what we think is interesting, it's not so much based on what necessarily we'll sell here, but what we like. And through production, which has always been a little bit different than everything else. Just to go back, sorry, you were running Skansen? Skansen, yeah. Well, I was not running, but I was sort of... a resident and doing the bookings and stuff like that. Which was quite famous at the moment, but it was just like a small public toilet, really. But it was really good, yeah. We had some really amazing DJs playing there. And then, Oslo is still very small, now there's lots of things happening, but not back then, it was not like hundreds of people doing parties, but then this guy shows up and I see his flyers and the names he's booking, I was like "Shit, who is this?" And Blå was a jazz venue back then, so it was really hard to sort of get in there and do something. So I was really, really curious about who is this guy. And then, yeah, when I met you, he was doing stuff in a totally different way than we did here in Oslo. Because here it was enough to just put on a name and put UK in the back of the name. shows up but he was like actually doing a proper production with lights and decorations and everything you said it was a jazz club and that you were almost surprised I guess to see these names book there. How did you convince the owners that dance music was something they wanted to do? I think certainly Bloor's strength back then was that they were a jazz club but they wanted to expand the word jazz to its outer limits. So for them jazz wasn't just you know It didn't have to be a style of music, it was a thought more than anything else. I think that's quite clever because you pin the club in some sort of philosophical, if you like, idea. And to a group of people, or I wouldn't say a crowd, but you identify yourself. with something and then you expand from that. You said that you transformed the club though in some ways with the production. Was that, I mean, something you had to do because of the way the club was laid out or something like that? I'm very particular, I think. I mean, it's... It's not necessarily about all the details, but it's about the details that somehow I have to deal with. What are the details that you have to deal with? I think flow is really important in the cloud. I think where you put... I wouldn't say energies because I'm not really... I'm not into auras and strange things, but I... I believe how people flow and where you put things like a DJ or, you know, a dance floor and how they interact are all very important. And so we spent a, I spent a fair bit of time thinking about how the space could be used best because it's a venue with a big stage. Really, I mean, when you do a club there, the stage is like a big white elephant in the room. So that took time. We used to do lots of slide projections at the arts club, so I imported it here and we did that, working with slides as wallpaper, basically. to create a different atmosphere in the club. And I mean, what Sunkist is now is not what it was when we began. I think for me, it's often about putting layers on layers and fixing things slowly and then see what else needs to be done. It's not my way to kind of... sit down and do a complete and viable product. But, you know, to see how it works and then adapt. I mean, where Sunkist is now is probably at least the first five years of it, kind of. slowly doing different things like moving the DJ box around the room a little bit until we realized where it should be. Starting to use the stage as a dance floor instead of a stage. I mean now it's completely packed with people dancing. There's a massive PA up there on top of what's already there. Imagine that makes a huge difference. It does. I mean, the room sounds great. I mean, it really is. There's a great sort of sound pressure in the whole room without being really loud. And yes, it's a... I tend to think, like, you know, you go into a club and think, why didn't they fix this or do that? And I quite like to think that, you know, with the stuff I'm doing myself, I'm not... I can't do everything. Well, we can't do everything straight away or all the time, but at least, you know, you notice and you do something about it in time. And this is how things have come to. to be. I suppose people don't come to a place and recognize everything that's done that's right, but they'll see everything that's wrong or hear the sound shit or whatever. And subtly, I think part of Sunkist's success is that, you know, things work, mostly. there's an edge to it in terms of what's delivered. And I mean that's inspired by a place like going into the main room at Fabric and standing in the middle and just feeling the sound. And I don't think there was a lot of clubs in Oslo where you could do that. I was really struck last night. I was at Jaeger for Craig Wilson playing. I was really struck by the function ones and it's just this like tiny outdoor sort of thing. And I was just like, this is great, but totally unexpected that like such care would be taken with that. My sound guy. from London who came to install the PA. I mean, that's half of the PA that we put in the basement, which is 250 capacity. I mean, the DJ booth has a bigger PA than most small clubs in the city. It's the same sound spec as for space, main room and the booth are in the DJ booth downstairs. For 250 people. Yeah, but I thought, you know, I'm going to be in this booth and DJing every Friday and I want it to sound intense. That's... You know and I miss that when you go and play parties elsewhere, and there's you know a shitty little self-powered 12-inch speaker in the corner and downstairs. It's like you're in a different room You know but uh yeah He was laughing his head off this guy from London when he came and installed particularly the stuff in the bar It's never been full up it ever It doesn't look too massive but it is. It is. But it's good. It means you've got headroom. It means you've, you know. I'd rather, with these things I'd rather go all out and know that it's going to work and stay and be proper than go halfway in and then... regret it not being good enough. So... Yeah, when we do go to fix details, it should be done proper. Tell me how Oslo's changed. in the past five, ten years? You guys said that, you know, you said earlier that there was not so much of a scene as there is now. There's 200 people throwing parties. No, it's sort of exploded, really. Now it's like, I don't know, it's packed every day. It's like a mini Berlin, I think. Really expensive. really expensive so I just I don't how can people afford to go out like five nights in a row I DJ for five nights in a row every week and it's the same people coming every night and it's like so it's like we change just venues it's the same people and the same music but I just really like you Yeah, I don't, well, I get bored of myself lots of times, but no, it's like a really, really small family scene here, but it's also now like lots of other people, and also I think it's because it's lots of Swedish people moved to Oslo lately. Why is that? Because they earn much, much more money here. And also it's like lots of Swedish people working in the bar here and they know, Swedish people know how to serve people. Norwegians are just lazy. Is that the sort of stereotype between the two? One of the stereotypes between the two countries? Swedes think that the Norwegian people are lazy. I think what G is saying is that basically in Sweden to work as a waitress is actually something you educate yourself for. It's a career path. Something to aspire to. Whereas in Norway it's always been something you did whilst waiting for something better. And I think that's the difference. But yeah, there's a lot of youth or young unemployment in Sweden in Norway. In Oslo there's hardly unemployment to speak of. It's really good that they're here because we need more people in the city. That's the way it is. It's a very small city. I've been surprised. It is, but I mean, like I said, I lived in London and I found that London's a massive city if you start moving around it. But if you live there for a while, you realize that people don't move around. They stick to their own little bubbles. They might go somewhere to shop. or to see a friend that they met in school. But otherwise, I mean, I lived in West London and most people in West London didn't leave West London, you know, ever. So... It's yeah, I mean West London is probably bigger than than also but it's it felt you know still felt like It wasn't such a difference except for also being much more relaxed. Why did you end up coming back? Several things really, the wife wanted to go back and I've been there for so long. I think leaving London was easy, going back to Oslo wasn't something I really wanted to do. So we compromised, I got myself a cabin in Berlin so I could get away. and go and check out DJs. Which has been really important for Sunkist because it wasn't about booking names because they were names. It was about going to check people out and book people. We heard play, you know, people who we knew would deliver. And in a city where, you know, most names don't mean much to people. I mean, it doesn't have a press or it doesn't have... you know, a huge group of people who follow what's going on on the internet. You know, when we're booking, we're booking for a small group of people. I'd say 70%, maybe even more, come because they know the name of the party. So what you have to do is you have to put on people all the time that will deliver on the night. So it's the name of the party and maybe the club that's the driving force. I think even in London that matters because we worked at this with the arts club saying, look, you've got to make people familiar with the club first of all. Otherwise it will be busy when you have a big name and no one when you don't. So I think this is a better way of running things anyway. But I mean, you really have to book, like when we have Ricardo or Richie Horton, all these really big names, it makes a difference. You know, people might come from Gothenburg to go to the party. But you really have to book. big names for it to make a difference on top of the party itself because the scene is not that big. But the people want to go out. They just not necessarily want to sit online and read and educate themselves on who's who. So that's very different from Berlin. I mean, people go to Berlin to go clubbing and they sit and they look through Resident Advisor and say, look, all right, this is the party I want to go to. These are the guys I want to hear. And for me, that's lovely. Go to Berlin and go and check out artists. Half the time it's like, yeah, but it's not for us. And the other half is like, yeah, and then you come across people that... I wouldn't have thought of booking, but they're playing great. And it's like, yep. You do the party monthly, right? Yep. And it's been running for... since 10 years now 11 years do you guys see it changing or i mean ending at any point or is it just clear sailing right now the way it's been booked this autumn it's definitely not ending yet it's been a Of course opening, because I opened Jäger and it's been important to say that Sankist still is a blow and you know it's got its own life. It's a different family who runs it from here although there's some convergence I wanted them to be. Not separate entities, but not the same. And I think for me it's nice to do something somewhere else, just to kind of not get stuck in one place and, you know, you start to grow roots somehow. But no, I didn't I remember talking to Optimo about this and they were like, oh you do something for 10 years and then Quit when you're while you're ahead and then start something new I Mean, I guess they run two clubs or two club nights for 10 years each And that's fine, but I don't really... I mean, most people who go to Sankis now would think it's three, four, five years old. Because, I mean, we've done one birthday in all those years. That's the 10-year anniversary. It's not really about age. Why would people think it's only three or four years old? Because we've never really told people how long we've been going. You know, people find a club night and they say, oh, great. And then, you know, they realize it's been around for a while, but no one's sort of asking how long. I think I learned that from my old boss at the Arts Club. On the Arts Club's 10-year anniversary date, he specifically instructed that there'll be no celebrations and left on holiday. He was really worried that the club would seem old, you know. The celebrating birthdays isn't something you do in the club. because you don't want to project that we're kind of getting old and tired, whatever, the rest of it. Why do you think Norway's been such fertile ground for producers over the past 10? years or so, you know, and you have Prince Thomas and Lindstrom and all these people. And is there any sort of answer? for like the why this certain sound has gotten I mean I'll try and give some explanation to this I mean I think guys supplement this but I actually wrote a piece in time out about this maybe five years ago and they were wondering same question why disco why Oslo it's not New York and what's going on up there it's something to do with with the country I think and some to do with coincidence you know it's like Tromso when the first stuff happened in Tromso they most of these guys lived in the same street in Tromso which is a small city of 50,000 inhabitants plus 10,000 students. And they found boxes in the attic. I think Torbjörn Bruntland from Roksop said there was 23 people who were into Depeche Mode and now there's only 22 because one of them died. I mean, he was kidding, but what he was saying was that... The slightly older generation had bought synths and things and they were stuck stuffed in an attic and these kids found it and they they sat in the in you know someone's room and made tunes like And this is partly what's happening here with the disco scene as well. Although Norway is an expensive country, it's not like London. You don't have to work your butt off every day. You can actually live fairly comfortably here. And you can take time off and you can go and pursue some sort of passion without living in a dive. And these people who, I guess they have this sort of passion for oddball music or, you know, sort of sidelines, they just kept doing what they were doing. Actually, it's funny, you know, you look at Bergen, for instance. I think Bergen has this sort of, you know, if they could cut Bergen out of the map and put a... you know, put an outboard engine on that thing and start it up and sort of just drive away. It probably would. You know, I'm putting it on a little bit on the edge here. but there's something about it. And certainly in Bergen you can tell that it's reflected by a certain sense of musical purpose that's different from everything else. I mean, there's a little bit of a punky attitude, I think, to certainly what Mikael Teller has done with all the Teller records and all the bands that he supported. And they have this studio. in the middle of the city where everyone sort of hung out and you know even Rogueshop even when they were big it would be in the same studio as everybody else and everybody knows each other and hugs each other and goes to the same record store and the same coffee shop and whatever and and also it's possibly a little bit the same we've we're we're on the outside a little bit of all this other stuff And I think also compared to London, you go to London, you don't want to be a DJ, you got to work for it. So you, I guess you end up adapting. Whereas people like Prince Thomas and Lindstrom, they never adapted to anything. It's like, this is what I like. And they never sort of, I don't think any of them said, oh, I'm going to be. successful you know that's my goal in life I think they become successful because they were themselves through and through you know that took a long time for Lindström to be I mean Norway is weird I mean when Lindström did I Feel Space no one in Norway wrote about it or you know spend time on it certainly not the press or even the indie press So it's not working in a vacuum, but it's not working on a treadmill either. You already have the space to be your own a little bit, and that can take you places. It's not to say that it had to go this way, but that's what happened. you
