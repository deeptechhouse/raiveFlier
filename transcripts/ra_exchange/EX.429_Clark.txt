🎵 Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week, we return to Deck Mantle Festival for another installment in ARI's conference program. Staff writer Matt McDermott had the chance to sit down with Clark, a prodigiously prolific electronic artist who's released nine albums and a slew of EPs with Warp Records since the early 2000s. Although he's been synonymous with the label's core IDM sound, his hyper-detailed music has embraced a wide variety of acoustic sources. Even though his output can be extraordinarily intricate, he prioritizes narrative development over production pyrotechnics, creating aura-inspiring but emotionally affecting work in the process. In this conversation, We hear about how his approach has developed since his debut record and the importance of electronic artists embracing chance and spontaneity in their work. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Clark is up next. *Dramatic music* Well, it's been nine albums. Let's talk about the most recent one, Death Peak. I feel like this one in particular... with the introduction of the choir and some heavier music ideas. This one felt more conceptual than the previous album. It's very odd because I don't know how this happens, but time seems to sort of speed up as soon as you release an album. So much has happened since it that it feels like it's about 10 years old. I mean, I don't think it sounds 10 years old. I think it sounds... When I hear it live, I'm like... It feels like visiting an old friend or something. It's like... I forget that that album exists. And it's nice that it's still out there and kind of percolating. And trying to reconfigure my mind to what that album's about. And it's quite... There's some, like, cogs creaking. because I spoke about it so much and my feelings are different now. Well, one of the things you said about touring and touring primarily as a live artist is it's sort of your way to bid adieu to the previous album. Totally. It's like kind of... giving it up for giving your kid up for adoption or something and you you sort of hope that the foster parents are going to treat it well but you can't really you you just like let go of it and i think it's really important in a way to get just you're so familiar with the record and then you kind of don't want to hear it for a while and it's up for you know other people then kind of take the baton and live with it. I can't imagine not touring a record because the idea of just kind of having an online reaction and just sort of trying to... gauge it from that is so quite frankly sort of scares the shit out of me like what you you need to have that visceral connection to first of all hearing it loud and it seeing how it connects with people and so important and just for a sense of closure and being able to move on for me it's I mean it's different for everyone but for me it's yeah it's like saying goodbye to it or something it's interesting I feel like a lot of producers will you know DJ their material out prior and kind of test it that way but yeah I do that quite a lot actually yeah yeah that's I should do that more I'd like a lot of Turning Dragon was just in the days of like I really really early iPods. Some of the EQs and stuff on it are like mixed. It's ridiculous the way, it's really stupid but kind of fun the way I mastered it would just be straight onto an MPC from an iPod with an iPod EQ. There were these really... horrible eqs on the old ipods that were sort of horrible but in a really captivating way like loads of treble and they would just smash it onto an npc through a phoner cable and and then like play that out and it would be like the first time I'd heard it out and it was so thrilling and people seemed to like it and that having that energy was really important and now I'd obviously I wasn't a total idiot like I had the master like the proper master on a computer but ended up using just these like NPC masters for a lot of it that were just so quite savage and had something about them and it just reminded me of testing them out so it was like a kind of pretty weird but fun thing to do You sort of like to take a number of approaches in the mixing process as well, right? Like listen through earbuds, listen through laptop speakers, listen through nice monitors. Yeah, I guess, yeah. I mean, that album was the most sort of pushed or like, I don't know, all my records are mixed in different ways. ways but I'm not as into that side of music anymore because I just spent so long cutting my teeth on learning that side of it that it's sort of in the background now and it's just this like intuition of what to I don't like relentlessly a b things and get het up about mix downs because I sort of feel like that also it adds it can add something to music that I don't like It's like a sort of asking a producer friend what mix you should use on an album is the worst thing. It's always like if you play it to someone who doesn't make music, that's just a music lover, because they'll usually choose something that has got technical flaws in it, but is better, just a better track, like more emotion or more energy. And that's quite a hard thing to let go of, actually. Just like the idea that there's a few tracks on the Clark album that really extended, like really techie versions that were like just not very interesting. And then you'd play, there was just, I can't remember the track title, Grit in the Pearl, Spit at the End, which is just like a mess, but has got something that I sort of needed a friend to play. point out that that was worth keeping it's just got to be someone you trust whose taste you kind of click with but I know with the self-titled album you made that relatively quickly for you in about four months and then Death Peak was about six months you sort of gave yourself a deadline because you're sort of prone to having a lot of versions and then just having to like pick one at the end yeah it's that's the that's the thing that takes time quite often the actual tracks written really quickly and then you just have this not procrastination but yeah reflecting on It's never really an intellectual decision, though. It's not like, there's not really any, you can't really rationalize it. It's odd. It's just a feel thing. It's just usually the tracks you play, you listen to most. I feel like the progression of your music, it seems like, you know, you come from a background playing violin and piano, and then sort of... diving into Cubase sound design, like more painstaking methods and then since then it feels like you've been attempting to infuse your music with more spontaneity the spontaneity and naivety I'm kind of sick of how my computer makes me work It does feel a little bit too easy sometimes. And I just like the thing of being able to make, well, the thing of not being able to make mistakes. Like if you say to yourself, I have to delete the project, I can't. I don't like always being able to go back and tweak things. I don't know. I think the things I look for in music are more... They're just not technical things so much anymore. I don't know. It's like... I don't know. I can't really explain it, but I'm just enjoying playing at the moment more, playing piano a lot. Yeah, music's funny. It's like chasing your own tail or something. Like technical music. can be interesting but also not it's like reading a dictionary or something it's like no one you can know all the words and still have nothing to say you can you can just be like a poet that knows knows exactly the etymology of the word or whatever and just just be rubbish or you can just be a really naive person that doesn't know a scale or can't keep time how can't produce but if you've got something worth if you're just compelled to do it and it's like a kind of madness then you'll do something fresh and it will that's the truth I think more and more I think that's you know how I that's music I like yeah I think there's a story about like Brian Eno being in the studio and a six-year-old had come in and played a piano line and just like running with that you know yeah completely or just be or just having that almost like acid like psychedelic acid thing of just sometimes I'll It's usually if I'm sleep deprived, like you just listen to three notes on a piano and you're just like, you feel like a kid. It's like the most seeing it as this magical thing rather than this like blasé kind of technical thing that you need to like conquer and kind of master. And there's something quite... I don't know, there's a sort of sneeriness to really technical music, for want of a better word, that I try and, that just personally puts me off. And so... It's weird when people think my music's really technical. A few people, I'm baffled by that. Well, to get back into the spontaneity, let's talk about the live show. This is one of the most, if not the most ambitious live show you've done. And there's like a performative aspect to it. Human special effects, I think is the term that you've used. And there's also like a, there's a lot of room for you to make mistakes live as well. Right. Yeah, there is. Happy accidents. Yeah, I like that, happy accidents. Yeah, no, there's mistakes, I think. Just like having a synth to play and then drum machines makes it, there's room for improvisation, which is, I think it would be. boring for me otherwise you know I want to do more sets that are just completely improvised I've done a few but mainly because sound cards have um like Or, you know the crossfader on an APC? I didn't really realise that that existed. And then it went to the other side, and I thought it was my sound card. So I thought that had broken, and I just had this one drum machine. And so the rest of the 40 minutes was just one drum machine, and I got really into it. And I tell myself that other people were into it. There were a few people like, yeah, that was good actually. But it was, yeah, it was pretty raw. I feel like there's also a guy named Sean Rudiman performing on Saturday with Juju and Jordache. And he just goes in with no plan every time. But he explained it. He said it was because all my equipment failed. It's just front. You just have to front it and just pretend it's... Another thing is, I think this is a jazz thing that I... like if you make a mistake just do it again and just look like you mean it and then people are like you think it's a mistake but it's not it's all intentional yeah of course it's intentional You said sometimes like when you're playing live, you just cut the sound just to feel the fear a little bit as well. Yeah, definitely. That's good. Yeah. It's just a, you know, it's just a live show. I think that it's like anything you sort of build up the, the actual thing of it may be going wrong. It's quite bad, but it's not ever as bad as you. It's not like anything. And weirdly, if you're a bit flippant about it, you're less likely to make a mistake. I think if you're like, oh, I can't touch that. It just usually, for me, I just either don't enjoy it or I do make a mistake. It's like I'm someone that I don't, like, from fear of losing my phone, I'll lose my phone. I'm that sort of person and I've lost a lot of phones and like, I think I'll put it somewhere weird or just, it's kind of, I'm trying, it's not, the analogy is not really working, but. I mean, if you're, if you're trying to get a take in the studio. Yeah. Trying, but yeah. Yeah. If you're trying really hard. Mr. Miyagi would have put it better. You know, I feel like a lot of this. you had like a sort of casual, I don't know if I'd call it a casual approach, but you were working, it was almost like a lark in the early days, right? Like when you first started sending stuff to Warp, you made it purposely fucked up. Yeah, I was never casual about music. I've never been casual about it, but... there's always been an element of like finding absurd ways to work and just finding humour in music for sure. My favourite music's kind of got a comedy element, I think, sometimes. Just, and not, yeah, I guess taking it seriously and not taking it seriously at the same time. Like once you've got like a really solid... pattern of just being obsessed with it and working on it you can lighten up a bit or something yeah I didn't mean to knowing something about your work habits I don't think casual is the way to describe it yeah I don't like yeah I don't like get put a suit on before work like Nick Cave. So, I mean, you said that there's like a sense of humor in some of your favorite music. Like when I think about like the ghost box stuff or something, like it's kind of creepy, but in this campy way. Like Thelonious Monk or some like, I just like some really, uh, some techno does it for me like some of random stuff I love his like some of his kick drums they just literally sound like dogs barking or something it's just just like really so primal and odd decisions people make in music that always stick out and yeah I mean I still just find the idea of changing all the notes in a piano before a concert pianist plays and like just doing it so they don't know and then they still play the piece but it's just just that's just not it's just childish and I just find that really funny though or just like playing the piano and then punching it is funny I just find that funny And I mean, this sort of stuff is kind of prevalent throughout your catalog, like where you just have this really kind of grotty acid house track and then it sounds like Merzbaugh's coming or something like that. Maybe, yeah, but it doesn't mean that the bits that are like... you know sort of more emotional or doesn't mean that they're not it doesn't invalidate them i mean it's not it's not really just feels a bit more honest to make to represent the whole gamut of what humans are rather than just go for one i don't know but then i i really like artists that do just do one thing as well it's not like i'm trying to think of an example hmm like burial i guess it's quite an obvious example but he he's just got this thing that he does and it you know what it is and that's that's amazing i love that but it's not for me i'm just more chaotic i suppose yeah it's like pushing it to the point where you're almost like a jack of all trades like you never you never want to do that but like there's fun to be had if you kind of flirt with all of these different things and then rein it in so that you still people know it's you there's still a thumbprint on it but it's a bit more obtuse or like sprawling to me that's just really exciting I love that And, you know, getting back to the early days, you made the debut Clarence Park while you were in uni. And there's sort of like this thing with that era, this kind of like, I guess, pastoralism that came through with like a lot of... Yeah, maybe. Like the IDM-affiliated acts and warp acts from that era. What does that mean? I don't know what that... That... I always think of English classical music. Yeah, in England, people call classical music of that pastoral, they call it cowpat music. Which I always think is quite funny. It's like sentimental. A lot of English classical music is quite sentimental and a bit obvious. Like if you compare it to Russian classical music, which is just mental, just like really forbidding and mathematically genius. Whereas pastoral I always associate with this like cosy. coziness. Yeah, I mean, I guess everything from like the album art to the fact that you said it's sort of inspired by the seasons and nature. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I've never tried to sort of do a sci-fi thing really with electronic music. I think that was already a bit dated when I signed to Warp because it was sort of just post intelligent drum and bass which was like the most future music ever and it just felt a bit done and it suddenly became quite retro actually. and like the idea of future what was that amazing journalist lecturer Mark Fisher said about like now futurism is kind of it's like a genre in the way that gothic is it's not there is not really a it's all been done so if you have a future aesthetic it's like it's kind of cliche and a bit a bit kitsch and retro now so in the same way that a lot of things are in culture like everything it's kind of depressing on some levels everything's kind of been done and you just get variations and i don't know i don't know i'm no cultural theorist Next question. The idea of like retro mania or something. But when you signed to Warp, you played a party for them in 2000. Is Chris from St. Albans? Is that the... Yes, I think so, yeah. And you were sort of sending... I was only about 18, so it was off a minidisc. And I thought CFAX stole my minidisc player, and he didn't. We were both quite drunk, and it was fine. It was fine, but it was... I'm sort of blushing at the memory of it. It was like more than 20 years ago. Did you go up to him and accuse him? Yeah. Yeah. And I think he was accusing me of something. I don't know. But it was fine. We're quite chatty now. It was fine. So you didn't come to blows? No, no, no. Nothing exciting like that. It was very English. All very English and restrained. But the mini disc player was like really yeah that's what you were using then yeah I recorded loads on it and would just use um Yeah, it had a random play feature, which is sort of... Just put loads of... I would just like record Ackerbilk, the clarinet player. It's terrible to buy records from charity shops and then just chop them all up and then just put random shuffle on. And that was... Again, that just struck me at the time as really funny. But then... I generally would use effects, just loads of effects and resampling. And I had a synth, a Yamaha really crappy digital synth that was just, you could get sounding really good if you just resampled it again and again and again through the filters on this EMI sample. so that was yeah and just also having to finish tracks in a day because you yeah that's that was good that vibe of you just do it in the moment like most of Clarence Park was written in two weeks and there's lots of other music from that era that didn't hasn't come out yet that's just yeah one one session on a track And was that because of limitations on sampling? Yeah, and just limited sample memory and you just put it on mini disc or tape and then do the next one and like that and then you don't have time to think and if you want to go back and tweak it, it's a hassle and it draws your attention to the thing of, you don't want to kind of retrofit it with new. features and that's something that I'm more and more in favor of I think but not to the point of everything has to be one take you know but just being quick working quickly is I enjoy it so you've sort of gone full circle with that from like all sorts of circles but yeah kind of come back around to the Beginning on some things. Yeah. And I've also noticed that, you know, there was this early period where you were like really kind of refining your sound, like 2001 through 2006. Yeah, the least fun I've had on a record was the second one, I think, Empty the Bones of You, was just really cutting my teeth on how to... I still enjoyed it, but it felt, that was like, it felt, it's the only album really that's felt like work. Like the other ones haven't felt like I've been at work at all. It's not like you, you don't. you're not, you know, if you're obsessed with something you're just, you can't keep away from it. It's your, like work is not being able to work on it. That's, that's a really weird but good sweet spot to be in on a record. But that album was like, just because I had to discover so much and the first album Clarence Park was just a, like, was pretty ropey in places. Technically, you know. Some of it, like the, yeah, I'm cringing actually thinking about it. Not all of it, some tracks. Yeah, like cringing and proud at the same time. There should be a word for that. There's probably a German word for that. But wait, so for Empty the Bones of You, you were sort of, this is like the Cubase, like really painstaking copy. Yeah, just like loads of, it was the first time I could. um overdub and like go back to tracks because it was all it wasn't an atari and it yeah um so just just like oh yeah i can go back to this again and again and again and you're like opening pandora's box in a way um and then the album after that it was like oh yeah you can go back to stuff again and again again you just i got really confident with it and i think that sort of shows in the record it's just it's sort of almost too confident but not but like enough restraint for it not to be totally annoying hopefully It was, that was just, yeah, it's something kicked off on that third album that I enjoyed. Well, on that one, like it was the, uh, like body riddle. It was like you had, you had like that observe harvest track as well, which is just basically like a noise track. I think it was maybe like a Japanese business or something. Oh yeah, I used to open live shows with that. Yeah. And I wanted to open the album with it and Steve Beckett was working at Wharf and he was like, what? that and HMV, people pick up your album, put on the first track, and that's the first track. Why are you fucking mental? Basically, this track is just a wash of feedback for a few minutes. Yeah. But it would have been all right if the whole album was like that, but the rest of the album's quite sort of... I was going to say dainty. Like, it's quite melodic, so it would have been a weird decision. But, you know, sometimes like A&R, I think, is simultaneously you don't really need it. You can go alone. But sometimes just little nudges that people make, it's got to be someone you trust. But just even if it's just, I feel like everyone could do with a bit of A&R. You just need it. Just even if it's like, oh, that track could maybe be a bar shorter. You don't have to listen to it. You don't have to listen to it. Of course you don't have to listen to what people say, but I find when people overreact to anyone suggesting something with their music, they think it makes them look really confident and uncompromising, but the actual effect is like, well, you're... testing too much like I'm secure enough in my music to be able to you know take feedback and either listen or don't listen but I'm not like how dare you this is the way it's going to be because I know what it is and I don't It's fine. I'm not so guarded about it. But I used to be. I probably used to be that person actually that was like, oh, don't talk to me about what I need to do. But this was a relationship that you had with Warp at the time where they would sort of give feedback and you'd... Yeah, and I was like, I said to them that I wanted Herzog to be the single and Steve was like... when you say single, what world are you living in? Because they were releasing like Maximo Park at the time and they had these big pop singles and it was sort of a fair enough comment. But I mean, he loved the album, but it was just, it's not really a single track. It's interesting that you talk about Empty the Bones of You being... one of the only times it felt like work because I was checking in with like a huge fan of yours who also makes music and just, you know, uh, he's talked to me a lot about these productions. and he's like, you know, I feel like that record is more influential on this newer wave of intelligent sounding stuff, like say a Lanark artifact or Bruce. And he's like, I feel like that stuff sounds more like Empty the Bones of You than Apex or something like that. Maybe. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, someone played me something like Artifact and I thought it sounded amazing. Because I'm doing all of this, well I'm not really making electronic music at the moment, I'm just playing piano and recording. But I was like, I don't want to listen to that because it will make me lose my focus on playing piano. And that's like a compliment because it sounded really good. I can't remember. I'm rubbish with names. Yeah, I was into it. I sort of wanted to speak with you a little bit about that, actually, like influence. You're always working really hard. prodigiously like like uh are you careful about what you take in uh yeah totally yeah i mean it's a it's a balance though because it's not it's not like i don't listen to other music because i don't like it but it's just it's a kind of discipline of not you know because you do you you are influenced by music without influences is is is that technical music it's that um people that go to berkeley and learn every scale under the sun and they study jazz from all of the jazz modes or whatever and they can play like beasts but they have no influences they have no like there's no culture current culture because there's a kind of jazz has become quite establishment music now and there's no there's a kind of all the best stuff's happened so why would we bother with this pop music? And that's just bullshit. So music without influences is not interesting to me. Anyone can make something original that's not that compelling. it's the lineage and how you transform it into your own thing that's interesting but so yeah I'm quite careful but also I'm kind of not I do just get obsessed with what I'm working on and it's not because I think other music's shit it's just that I just get really sort of fulfilled by just get obsessed with tracks I'm working on can't stay away from them so I do check stuff out. I'm really into Laurel Halo's last record. The Latency EP? I haven't heard that. Yeah, or the Dust record. Yeah, that one. Yeah, that one's really interesting. Yeah, I tend to look at what's out. And then check it out a bit and then just think, oh, I'll ignore that for two years and come back to it. And if it's still good, then it's good. Because the sort of life cycle of music is so quick and the hype kind of, the fine mist of hype that is around everything. It's like sometimes you want to just listen to something in a more pure way and experience it for what it is rather than... read about it and feel kind of cajoled or coerced into thinking it's good when it's better to leave stuff sometimes do you ever apply that rule to your own music yeah totally yeah all the time yeah come come back to stuff all the time so you you have like thousands of tracks at this point like uh sketches yeah yeah not finished And what are you up to now? I know that you've been doing a lot of, I know you just scored Dogstar Man, which is, you've been playing some cello as well. Yeah, that was a really interesting one in the end because it was, I hadn't heard of him, but he's a really sort of renowned avant-garde director in film circles. Stan Brackage in it. I sort of initially watched the film and was like, fuck, I don't know what to do to that. It's not my style at all. What's he doing? I've got to finish it in two weeks. Shit. And panicked and then actually got really into it. films the films really intense for the time it was written in it was really influential and kind of you can see you can see the mark he's left and people that have completely ripped him off but in a more conventional way he's really amazing but um i wrote lots of music for that very quickly um and then it's just that thing of rendering it and realizing that yeah that could be an album so there's there's yeah i don't know how much to talk about there's just there's there's about four or five potential albums and it's just a timing schedule thing it's just like kind of get yeah it's just the idea of how to release it is what i'm working through at the moment basically are you making a solo piano record as well is that I don't know I'd love to do that yeah but I don't know I've always I sort of feel like that's the something to do for sure it doesn't feel like that Different too because I've always had piano in my songs Not all of them, but so you're still in Berlin right now. No, we're in your writing. Okay, got it Yeah, and and when you were in and when did you make the move about three weeks ago? Okay. Yeah, really stressful. Yeah When you were when you were in Berlin One of the things you were obviously observing, but not necessarily participating in club culture at the time. Oh, yes. And it was funny. I was reading something you said in another interview. It said, you're like, these people seem to have a lot of time on their hands. No, I didn't. God, you've really trued up some shit, haven't you? No, I didn't mean that. No, I mean... It just seemed like you always have to have... What's the question? Well, what I'm saying is you seem more comfortable having four or five projects on at all times. Yeah. And... Yeah, you can have too much on the go, though. It's like, I more and more feel like... Just like working on music all the time. What is your... What are you... What is that? I mean, I do... I've made a bit of a meal in the past of how much I work on music, but it's better just to... actually have a life outside of it as well and just work on it in a because you can i don't know you can just spend all day making music in a half-hearted fashion or you can spend like five hours of just ultra focus and then just do something else and that's what i favor more and i i don't think that's because i'm less passionate about it i think it's just a smarter way to live just to hone it a bit and um but the question about people too much time yeah i don't i don't know why i said that it sounds well i know you played in the club as well i just think at the time i mean i guess burkine people go on friday and leave on tuesday that seems a bit much But then isn't this festival like for the people are you all staying like for the whole thing? No sleep you've also DJ downstairs that Berghain as well and and You've made you played Slayer. Yeah with all the reverb up on the mixer by accident That's clever. But yeah, it was around the time of, I mean, I'm still, I don't know if this is cool or not, but I really loved Ed Banger. Not all of it, but like Sebastian and Mr. Wazzo. And like Early Justice as well. I thought that was amazingly fun music. And it seemed to just like... yeah it's like trashy and not all of it was great but the good stuff was just just so much fun to mix with like you could mix it with metal and all sorts of things because it wasn't it didn't have that clean sleek kind of future techno thing it was just like trashy and kind of had loads of funk in it and I loved it So I mixed that with Slayer, I think, in the Vurkheim. And some people liked it and some people hated it. So must be doing something right. Yeah, I guess like Justice used to start out there. DJ sets with some metal as well. Yeah, maybe, yeah. And Sebastian's popped up. Oh, he did Charlotte Gainsbourg. Yeah, it's beautiful, right? Yeah, really good. You're more known as a live performer. Do you enjoy DJing a lot as well? I think I would get more into it now. Yeah, or just make, you know, like 70% your own stuff and then just being able to have the flexibility to drop other people's bits that you liked. Yeah, I could get into that. Is that something that you think you'll pursue going forward? No, I mean, no, because I just don't have... time at the moment it's such a full time the last time I did it was around the Clark album like I did loads of mixes some of which still haven't come out but I would I sort of was like, right, I'm going to see what this is like to just DJ and abort loads of music. And it's really time consuming and you need, you just need a lot of energy. And again, it's a distraction from, I don't know if there are any, I don't know if someone that can just does it all convincingly, you know, like, cause I do lots of film work as well. And like, composing for that, DJing, making my own music, releasing albums, it's just something's going to break that frigging camel's back, isn't it? And for me it would be, I just can't DJ. Yeah, I mean, I've heard similar people say that. Like, I think, like, on one of these exchange podcasts, Move D said that, like, I don't see too many people even doing, like, the production and the DJing at, like, an extremely high level, which... debatable most of the people playing the festival this weekend are DJing or like if you DJ you sort of tend to make music that you're playing in clubs which would probably that That's probably the appeal. And this is not something that you've ever... Or I guess here and there, like there have been some... I mean, it's not that... Yeah, it's just, again, it's like... I would love to actually have more time to do it, but I just don't at the moment. Maybe in the future. I know that... I like the idea of just turning up with a USB stick. I definitely... Yeah, it's just amazing. It's interesting, like even in sort of clubbier tracks like Honey Badger, which came out last year, you're not really willing to sit still for the duration of, you know, a six-minute track. You love a transition like thrown in. Three quarters of the way through. Yeah, probably. Yeah, I can't really explain that. It's not contrived and I'm not trying to just be contrary or whatever. That's just how they come out. It's definitely something that has become a bit of a trademark, I guess. I have a theory about it. Yeah, go for it. It would be weird if I go for your theory. You know, more than most people, people think of you sometimes as like this. sound design person but like the the real through line i think is like the idea of narrative yeah and i think like maybe this is what's drawn you to film as well like like when you you've spoken about film music and yeah you sort of spoken about like how most people do like foley and phil and kind of texture and that's that's not really what interests you like you're you're interested in like memorable themes yeah yeah kind of i again i feel like a a charlatan when it comes to things like technical sound design like i mean i know i put a lot of effort into detail in my music but i don't i'm not i'm quite slapdash about certain things I'm really and then other things I'm not like the things that I get really meticulous about are structural you know transitions and like Un-UK on the last album like there was one you know I can spend like hours on two seconds and just listening to it hundreds of times and the sort of yeah just the the compositional uh i guess roots or like the the foundations of a song what like what what the melody is doing and what the how that interacts with yeah all of the elements be they like noise or harmony or rhythm that's the that's what's really so when people are like oh you're a sound designer I take it as a compliment and I'm usually like yeah I really I'm really into sound design but I don't really know what it is I guess quite often sound design is like a and it I find I find I'll like spend time on it when I haven't got any music left in me It's just like something you can do. I guess this is a bit of a nice diversion, you know, diversion. It's not even a, yeah, that, um, but like, cause I've been singing quite a lot recently and also working with singers. And what's really revealing is that you can work on, like I can work on music in any mood. Like I can be in a sh... I mean, I'm pretty, whenever I'm working on music, I'm generally quite happy, but everyone has off days. It's just human nature or, you know, even if something is quite bad in my life and I'm actually properly depressed, I can still work. And it's like a slightly masochistic, like pride and like, yeah, I'm just going to. I can like switch something off and just work. But you can't, if you can do that, if you can sing and do that, which is like this really vulnerable, you know, like everyone's a bit self-conscious about their voice. And if you can sing through that, then that's like you've reached some, and I can't do that yet. Like it's so connected to your mood. And I feel like sound design is something that you can just kind of, it's more like editing or graphic design. You can kind of, you can do it in a, you can detach more. But I think what I'm saying is that the music that I think is really captivating and has a good lifespan and lasts and will be in the world for a long time is music that takes something out of the... at the maker it's like you're exposing it's an exposure and that's that's to me interesting Thank you. Bye. Thank you. you Thank you.
