Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Extra, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch, and I'm the Associate Editor of Resident Advisors. 2009, Benoit and Sergio have been a square peg in club music. They're regulars on dance labels like Vision Quest and Spectral Sound, and on tour they share the stage with DJs. But they're pop artists at heart, unsure of what they call the tyranny of the kick drum. This tension is what makes them unique. Songs like Walk and Talk, with its cheeky lyrics about ketamine, really couldn't have come from anyone else. Earlier this summer, as they put the final touches in their a long awaited debut album, Benoit and Sergio stopped by R.A. to talk about the two sides of their music. ♪ A grown man makes demands every time ♪ So, you guys are working on your new album? We are indeed. Every day in our minds we're working on it. At least, if not in the studio. Yeah, I just noticed earlier today that when you guys did the RA podcast... You said, basically the album was coming up, and you said something like, we're making a lot of room for it because we want it to be really epic. So it seems like you're kind of thinking of this album as a big turning point in your career, a big part of the Benoit and Sergio story. I hope so. So before any of the big tracks came out, We started working on the album, so it's been sort of germinating for quite a while. We were pretty on standby also because of touring and working on the live set as well. But yeah, I think we did three tracks for the album in like one week in December. And that was the moment we were like, okay, we've got an album. What was the most memorable moment of the album? And then, you know, Walkin' Talk came out and everybody and all those tracks and we just sort of got rushed into the touring life. I mean, the timing. I think the timing tech is a combination of doing the track we really like properly and also just logistics because we're two and the life said we have to put them in standby but so i guess we're taking our time for sure yeah Because it'll probably take about three years from the first track to the time it's done. Because it'll probably be done around fall or something of this year. But the other thing that might be taking time for it is we don't really play any of the tracks from the album on. during our live set. It's like two different universes, really. There's like the album universe, which is, you know, I'd say it's like we're less dancey for sure. And then there's all the stuff we're trying to get into the live set every week to play at a club, you know? So there's this kind of like almost bifurcation of like what we're doing. There's the club. and then the studio stuff. Yeah, I thought it was interesting the way you were just talking about it. It seems like there's no question, like, what's a track for the album and what isn't. Right. For sure. There's one that's in between, but yeah. Yeah, let's see. Yeah, because the album stuff is, we would say it's like... I would say more musical for sure. Dreamier, more musical and more sort of There's a lot more attention to lyrics and vocal stuff as well. So I always say, I don't know if Benoit agrees, but I always feel like there's only a certain amount of words you can say in a dance track. Like you can't go on with like 16 bar melodies of vocals. I don't think. And these album tracks have very long vocal melody lines and lots of words. So just in that sense, we know, okay, this is like full lyrics with vocal melodies. It can't go into the club, right? And then the music that follows it is also... more melodic less pounding less dance so it's very clear for us like oh this is definitely an album track just wouldn't fit elsewhere if it's on a record so yeah and I think a lot of the lyrics too are they're sort of coalescing around a certain theme you know um So it just makes sense and it feels natural when we have a track that we feel like, okay, this is right for the album. It's very clear to us. Yeah, I mean, you guys kind of, this sort of, you sort of straddle the line between pop or indie and club music in general. I guess it's interesting to hear that that comes down to technical differences in the music. I think so. Go ahead. But the vibe, if you listen to the tracks, it's just... for the global I mean on the dance floor this choice just I mean would not be out not dance track or like they're not ready for like cloud 2:00 a.m. yeah I mean some of the tracks are like 95 BPM you know and like Nico jar can go and play 95 BPM in a club but like we can mix those all I said right Lisa We can't do that. We can't go like 95 BPM, some dreamy sort of like slow down tempo track up to like 125, you know, just like it doesn't work. So sort of like a paradox, like the stuff we really are making. in the studio and that we feel the most musically isn't stuff that we go out and play every weekend. But I think a lot of producers feel that too. I mean, I think Ricardo Villalobos is an example of that as well. Jean Roberts was just speaking about how he's doing it on L.A. right? He just said like he's working the album and he's not I didn't say clubbing up but he's he's actually taking the tracks from the album and reworking them to make them a little more pumped up yeah we're thinking of doing that for the album but we just don't know yet if we if we work Yeah, I mean I think yeah, I'm also like Ricardo like stuff is so Abstract a lot of the time then you go see him play. It's like two different people, you know, yeah At least at the bigger venues where he's playing. I saw him at Fabric and I was like, wait, that's Ricardo playing? Based on his work, you would never think that. I don't think there's anything wrong with that either. I think some people are like, oh, how can he be playing this music at Fabric but in his studio he makes it? this music as if there's like some unbridgeable or there's some contradiction there you know I don't think there is I mean our part is pretty broad and I mean we like actually we do like I like what we play during the clubs too I mean it's just a different kind of fun or pleasure, you know? Right. But I think... It's fine. Yeah, but I think... I mean, maybe you feel this too, is that there seems to be sometimes like a kind of... not an animosity, but like... he's maybe Ricardo somehow being inauthentic because he's playing one kind of music at a club, but he's making something else or maybe, you know, you know what I mean? Or do you feel that there might be that kind of sense for fans that like, there should be a seamless sort of connection between like your production, what you play out. It's not like we're not feeling what we're playing at a club or like. Anybody else who's DJing isn't feeling what they're doing. I don't think that that's the case, but I think maybe I don't know. Do you ever wish you could just play like a concert? You know, like play the songs from your album without any regard for dance floor? That's something we would have to do, yeah. For sure. For sure, yeah. Yeah, I mean, like, just we were playing in London on Saturday night at Corsica Studios. Do you know this place? Yeah. It's great. It's an amazing place. We were doing this sound check for, like, how long? Like, super long because we were just, like, you know, super loose, just jamming and, you know, like, concert style, you know. ten minutes on a track just so like, you know, doing vocals and like just jamming back and forth on the synths and stuff. And we looked at each other and be like, man, we should just be doing that, you know? But then it feels like you couldn't really do that at 2 a.m. because it would just be sort of like jazz noodling or something. You know what I mean? context changes at 2 a.m. You can't really do that. But it would be fun to at maybe 8 p.m., you know, if the context were right. Because, I mean, what you said earlier about how you can't play the, you have a track that's 90 bpm, but you can't play it. But, obviously, if it was a concert where people bought a ticket and they showed up at 9 p.m., you guys go on 10. What is the... I think also in the dance culture, in the dance context, there's a problem of mixing, you know, the continuing the pace and stuff. The fact you stop the music, maybe do a little bit of a vocal intro, you really can, it adds so much freedom in terms of changes and stuff. Exactly. You think the problem is we try to keep some kind of a DJ feel by mixing and that tempo changes and even mode changes are really our problem like key or even... You can't do that I think. But in a concert style you stop and then you can go where you want basically. and that would be nice. You know, take a lot of, like, man, you could go anywhere. Choose your own adventure style, you know? Does it seem, like, kind of inconceivable to cross into that world, though, like the world of concerts as opposed to parties? No, not really. I mean, it would require a lot more sort of apparatus, you know, other players and more equipment and all that sort of stuff. But, you know, there are also people we know who would be into doing something like, you know, hey, let's go and let's go and do like more festival stuff, you know, jamming, make it more concert style. So, you know, that's very tempting, especially when you have friends. you admire who are like let's let's do this you know let's try something new so it would help out a lot to have that to have that uh infrastructure already in place and then move into like kind of a festival setting we'll see so i mean obviously there's kind of a you know for lack of a better term, like pop or indie crossover thing is kind of novel. Like there aren't very many groups like you guys. How do you think you ended up here? Or why did you end up with this sort of mixed, you know, sensibility? I mean, I think just because we like both genres, are both sort of camps very much. Like I love Berlin. dance party scene is amazing and I also love like American indie scene and you know so it just seemed like if you like both of them and you're drawn to both of them then you sort of naturally combine these things that you like and I didn't feel like that much of a struggle or weird or anything like that for us to do it it felt more natural just to do it this way you know with the gear we had to start off with you know which was basically dance gear like Roland's and Juno's and all this sort of stuff sort of classic dance gear But then bringing in the vocals. I think the vocals just gave that indie feel from the start. We were for a while trying to do minimal and then basically it was like minimal indie music or minimal pop and it sounded right. But then I guess, you know, I was in, we were in Detroit last weekend for Dempth and I was having lunch with a friend and he was saying, have you heard this group Blue Hawaii? Yeah. He was saying like, blue Hawaii is kind of like minimal meets indie. It's like minimal techno with vocals on top. And all of a sudden it changes the whole equation or calculus. The result is pretty different from how you guys sound, but that, you know, on a simple level, that's basically right. Yeah. Okay. But when you guys were first making music together, it was in D.C., right? Yeah. Do you think not being in this Berlin-style community, not being in this community of DJs, did that have any effect on the fact that you sort of had this band approach to making music? I think so. I mean... Like we always say, the sea is pretty much a bubble, I mean it's isolated, it's like making music, you go in the woods and you have your studio and you're... I mean it's pretty much the same thing. So I think for me at least it kind of helped. to kind of do your thing, you know, do your own thing and completely abstract yourself from the rest. So that freedom from at the beginning, for sure, I think being in DC helped because we're not so exposed to... "Oh, we gotta do this" or "This is never gonna work if we do this" you know, kind of... Yeah. I mean, it's not to say that DC has an amazing... But it's... It's like one of the best around. So it's isolated and yet, like, man, it's one of my favorite places to play. It's one of my favorite places to go out. The crowd is... Yeah. Super good. But he was actually starting. He was fairly small when we just started. And now it's sort of blowing up a bit more. So what is it like? What's the music like? What are the clubs like? I think the best club is U-Haul. The vibe is good. The vibe is great. And they bring in, you know, anywhere from, you know, Lee Foss will play. But then also I have like, you know, concerts during the week with like, almost more like electronic indie stuff. Like, who was just playing? I don't know. Pothaduprince? Yeah. Yeah. Matt Deere in his band, you know? So it's like... The booking's awkward. I mean, you could... It's not the quantity, but every weekend you have somebody really good playing, basically. Yeah, and it's always full. And it's people going crazy. It's great. And they have smaller clubs too, but it's a very good scene. But it seems like maybe the fact that you guys are getting together to make music and you're not hanging out with other musicians and seeing exactly how they do it, maybe that fostered this kind of unusual style or whatever. Could be, yeah. I think at the beginning it was for sure. Now we're really more exposed with touring and stuff, which is great because also it's good. You need both. You need advice or feedback. But the beginning, yeah, we were just, you know, what about our world, yeah. Yeah. I mean, Bruno was coming. We were in contact with Bruno and stuff, but... Bruno Pransalas. Yeah. But, you know, I think it's also just, you know, if you're... Yeah, everybody... if they don't sort of like look to other people, if they just sort of like sit in the studio by themselves and just sort of like make their own sort of like potpourri of music, it'll be weird and strange. And that's sort of what we did anyhow. Cause it was like, let's, why does it matter? We didn't think anyone ever put out any of our, so we were just really doing it for ourselves you know like it was just for us like like we were surprised that anyone would ever want to like hear anything we did sort of still feel that way in a way you know like this is just weird this track is bizarre you know so So what was the first inroad, or how did that end up happening, that people heard your stuff? Well, it was through Detroit, through Dempth one weekend, and we just finished that Full Brown Man track, which you were so kind to sort of champion. And Bruno Ponsato heard it. We didn't even, we just gave it, I gave it to my friend, one of my best friends, Ben Paris, who's a friend of mine from Baltimore. And he just was playing it all weekend on his MacBook in hotel rooms, you know, at after parties, you know. And people were just like, well, what's this? And Bruno heard it and he asked if we wanted to put it out with his record. And we were like, of course, because Bruno at that time and still is like a kind of a mad genius producer and idol of ours. So we were like super. excited that someone like Bruno would want to put it out, you know, and the rest is history from there really. I mean then you guys liked it and then we went from there. So going from there means you moved to Berlin and like what exactly was the next stage from that part? Well, we moved to Berlin. I moved to Berlin. He was still in D.C. And then we had a few little jams in the pocket at that point. So we had like walk and talk was finished when I moved to Berlin. But again, we were like. this weird track, like who's going to be into this thing, you know? It's like, we had no idea. We just had it. We're like, gave it to Seth and those boys and they were at Vision Quest and they were like, yeah, we'll put this out. And so that was in the pocket and there were a few others in the pocket. There were other freaks, right? Ryan had it in DC. Yeah, we had basically the whole Vision Quest EP was done. And then we had sort of like the beginning of Everybody as well was in the pocket there. So we had like some things that we thought was going to be a nice one. Yeah, Everybody. Yeah. So. Has it changed making music? Like you just said, you know, you had this feeling like, who's even going to hear this or who would even like this anyway? Is it different now that you know their expectations or you have a reputation to fulfill? Honestly, unfortunately, yes. I think even for the audience, which is not really good, but you think more about what you're doing. I'll be honest, yeah. I think it's true. We try to. I mean again when we're back in the studio in DC sometimes we go like a little more free I would say. But when you caught up in the touring and you try your track and you know we're making a track and we kind of try it in the same week and stuff. I mean, you can be blinded and be like, oh, I couldn't care less, this is a jam. If the audience didn't react so well, write to it. So yes, I think some tracks, I mean, especially, I guess, the dance one. The album, again, we're very attached to them. I love them. I really love them. The album's like either way. If people don't like it, I don't care. Because I really like it. Yeah, Benoit really likes But, like, yeah, for, like, the more dancey stuff, you know, it's like you test it out, and it's like, okay, this one didn't rock the crowd, so then you sort of, like, sweep it under the rug a bit, you know? But, you know, what's interesting is, like, we have this new track that we're playing, and this one I feel is really weirdo. Like, we just sort of went back to, like... let's just be weird and whatever and um and this is the one you know this is the one that works biggest jam now you know what i mean It's also the one that just felt more and most like us being free again. So maybe that's the lesson. But I think it's the environment. For me, for example, to make music, when you're on the road, it's hard. Being on the computer and touching up things left and right is kind of... I feel we're best when we have a keyboard and stuff and we're choosing one of those jamming tools. it's usually the best music come out of that for us I mean I know some people are amazing and doing everything on the computer so what's your ideal like you know session like what's your ideal work process well we were doing it in the winter like we didn't have any touring we took two months off with no shows at all. We were in DC, so we had like all of our gear and, you know, I was in walking distance from the studio and we would just. sort of show up every day at 10 and work till 6 and go out to Chipotle and have a burrito at lunch and then maybe drink some wine in the afternoon to get more loose and just jamming and not having to think about traveling anywhere and just sort of like being in that routine almost like work style you know like every day the same time and then you get into this groove and it took us about i was because we hadn't been in that groove for a while for like a couple years it took a few weeks where we're just every time we're like yeah so like the first couple weeks was super um a little bit awkward and then we got into it again and it was really fun like how it should be you know so that would be the ideal thing I guess it seems kind of sort of like ironic in a way that when you once you have enough of a reputation that you're getting gigs and stuff it seems like that's the hardest time to actually to make the music to keep getting gigs. Yeah, you kind of have that ideal situation snatched away from you. Right, exactly. I think, yeah, that's the thing. It's like the problem of, you know, artists today because of internet or whatever have to tour. And I think it's, I mean, it's kind of a vicious cycle because I think it could tend to lower the quality of the artist's release if you're not careful, you know. they don't experiment anymore they just try to release and they have so little time to do that yeah it's rush jobs you know then it's and then you can get caught in your own recipe you know what so and then that's it you know you have your like kind of classic recipe and you you just release that it's like pro forma you know yeah so yeah it's hard I mean It's not like complaining. It's amazing. None of the tour and all that sort of stuff. But yeah, it's like, I mean, that's its own pleasure and its own magic, you know, and you don't want to lose that either. it's really hard. It's also hard to find. Yeah. I think the best thing is just to take time off. Just clear your schedule for that. That's like you really can rejuvenate and feel fresh again and come up with stuff that you're proud of. Do you feel any kind of pressure to make dance your music than you did when you first started? I mean, that's the thing. That's sort of what we're saying. It's like the album. The studio is one kind of thing. But then we're also doing studio stuff, which is for the live set for 3AM. at the club, you know what I mean? So there's this kind of split between your studio time. Because we have a live set, so we have to play our tracks. At the very beginning, we were picking one track from somebody else to have a break of sound. just pretty much like from somebody else. But we don't do that. No. Not anymore. So is it kind of a relief to work on an album and just be able to put the entire club thing on your mind entirely? For sure, yeah. You mean when we were working on it? In DC. Yeah. Yeah, it was not I mean it's just not so maybe doing a break from touring was kind of nice like you just think okay We have the weekend to actually still make music. Actually, you know, that's that's not an airport Plane to catch that's a nice feeling But yeah, it's it's it's it's like I don't know it's very good. Yeah, it's good to not be worried about having a pounding track I think like to worry too much about sound and this and that and conflict of bass and kick and all this stuff we were like this is nice to not think about this kind of thing because I mean essentially we're not really focused on this kind of issue. I mean, dance music is about sound, so we understand it's good to have an amazing sound and stuff. But I think-- so then we were completely focused on melodies and layer and structure. It was a nice feeling, for sure. Yeah. Like when we were really sort of getting rid of the tyranny of the kick. I was like, I remember coming to him one day, and I was like-- There's this one track we're working on. It's this really sort of lovely track. And we had made it with a club in mind at first. And I was listening to it. I was like rocked or something, like lying back in my bed at night. And it was just like so... pounding and the kick was so like aggressive and tyrannical and I came down the next day I was like we're just turn that let's just mute the kick and just get rid of it for now and then we sort of like when we dethrone the kick and we just had all this space to work with it was just like oh it feels so nice you know so I'm really sort of like I'm getting tired of kick drums I like them still but it's good to take a break from the kick Is that kind of like, creatively, is that sort of the breakdown between you two? Would you say, Ben, you're more of the pop guy, and Benoit, you're more the producer? I think, I mean, we're really both too, I mean, obviously Ben's got the vocals, that's, and lyrics, but otherwise, pretty mixed. I do work on sound. But otherwise I think we do, in terms of layers or on the... No, I think we are just the thing, I think one of the things that we love about making music with each other is we really like similar things in music. Like, you know, it's rare, like... He'll be jamming. It's very rare that I'll ever be jamming. I'll look at Benoit and be like, what is this guy playing? I don't think that's ever happened. No, no. We have very similar things that we respond to musically. sometimes we both get caught in some weird yeah I mean that's not to say that sometimes we both come up with like really like what are we doing but it's always it's always together in a way you know so we listen to it like a day later like whoa what was that but it's very rare that like I think we ever like hmm I don't know about what this guy's doing you know I think that's cool so I don't think it breaks down like that at all I think he likes dance music more than I do though yeah I like all but he's got yeah he likes I mean yeah yeah I kind of have this disco funk so I do like the little bit the metallic I always thought of the electrician. That's where we'd be baffled. Yeah, yeah. I do that. But yeah. Did you guys bring different things to the duo? Did you listen to different music from each other beforehand? We did a little bit. Yeah, I mean, I think we... A little bit. Have you guys played in other groups? No. This is your first thing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So... No, it wasn't like... I was just like, yeah, we just got together and started jamming. I was like, wow, I love what he's playing and he liked what I was playing. It just, it fit. Like, it wasn't like, you know, it's not like he's coming with like some like heavy metal back. route and I'm coming from like Paul Simon and we're trying to make it fit just you know and it shows in the music where it's just like there's like some weirdness there it's like we very much have similar tastes and things you know yeah even on other tracks when we yeah we like the same sort of tracks as well like I'll be like listen to this track and he'll then he'll really like it or you know it'll play me a track if we dislike a track it's usually because of the same one thing yeah yeah so I mean I think that's how it should be you know I mean maybe it would be cool if we had this kind of like sort of sonic disparity or something like that but we don't Do you feel like the center of music is kind of changing as time goes on? Like, is it headed in a certain direction? It partly sometimes, I really, I meant for dance, there's some, I don't know where we are this year, too much, sometimes with dance music, but... I feel like, I think, I feel like just, man, I'm really returning to just being super mellow. That's what I feel the most. What do you mean, the trend? No, for the stuff that we're doing. Yeah, yeah, I mean, you guys specific. Oh, awesome. Okay, yeah. Yeah, we can do that one little track that... we were working on recently though sometimes you remember that one? Tropical Craftwork Tropical Craftwork track yeah and that's sort of like I think where I definitely feel the most like just mellow pretty relaxed tropical craft work that's sort of where we're going just yeah we did I mean again the album follows that follows that trend yeah sure tropical craft work style yeah I mean I guess I feel like the way you talk about the album or it seems like very special to both of you and everything, and that it kind of has nothing to do with club music. Sort of like, with this album coming out, or being finished or whatever, is that kind of like the metamorphosis is complete? Is that going to be a new Benoit and Sergio when we finally get there? I don't know, yeah. We sort of were even kicking around the idea of putting the album out under a different name even, because it's not like sort of what we've been doing the last couple of years or what we've been known for. Do you worry about, or do you think there's any kind of problem with being perceived as an electronic duo doing an indie pop thing, you know, versus just being an indie pop duo? Is that something you think about, or is that a problem? And I guess my question is kind of like... would you be happy to continue sort of being the poppier act at a party? Right. I would be okay to keep both, kind of. Yeah, it'd be fun to do that. I mean, to be able to sort of... be sort of, um, by Oceania, kicking sort of, go from one to the other. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Be fun. It'll create you up. Because I, I mean, I mean, I love, I mean, we love playing these parties. It's like, then sometimes we think it'd be fun to do this other thing too. you know it would be great to be able to have to have both and some gigs we do feel like we you know I mean there are gigs you know some okay gigs well not so good gigs where we kind of just okay maybe we should be you know yeah Our music is maybe too, you know, like, dreamy. Because it's still, I mean, it's still dreamy, trippy when we're playing in the club and sometimes we just maybe feel a little, like, Yeah. We're in a house between two chairs. Yeah. We had the show a couple days ago where I was, like, just between, like, two jacking, like, axlers jacking it, you know? And then we came on and it was, like, a little more like, you know, melodic or this or that. So those kinds of shows you think it might be nice to be elsewhere. She doesn't wash. She doesn't wash.
