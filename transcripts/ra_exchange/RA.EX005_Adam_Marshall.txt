Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Taddle Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Canadians have had a huge impact on the world of electronic music over the past decade, not least through the efforts of new Canada boss Adam Marshall. Hailing from Toronto, Marshall has always been a bit of an outsider among collab-friendly countrymen like Jeremy P. Caulfield and Mike Shannon. change in the past few years though as he's opened up his imprint on a more regular basis to outside contributors. It hasn't hurt that his productions have been heartily embraced by the UK-based community as well. We caught up with Adam earlier this month to chat about all of this and more. Tell me about growing up in Toronto. Toronto was a... Look, I like Toronto a lot. It was a really, really cool place to grow up. It was nice that it was such a big city. And it was nice that there were so many different influences in the city. Mostly to do with the multiculturalness of the city. Like, there was just so much different stuff for people, like... Growing up and kind of discovering things. It was pretty neat. I didn't really like it back then but looking looking back now I'm really it was nice to grow up there for sure I'm sure you didn't realize at the time how different it was compared to X yeah, no one growing up in it. Yeah, it was like so I think Toronto was really developing as like an international city at that time as well so All the people in the arts community always look towards either London or New York and it was like just because you saw all your peers doing this sort of you always kind of thought you were in a second-rate city and stuff but I think after all of us grew up and started doing our own things we realized that it was like it was quite an international place actually compared with a lot of places in the States and stuff and it was although we might not have loved all the influences we got It was really appreciated, like, at a later date. What were some of those influences that you're talking about? A good example would be, like, one of the big record stores. in Toronto was called Play the Record and it basically it got everything back then and like even for North America was a really good store but like we'd have to when we went and bought records like reggae and hip-hop ruled and stuff and like there was only one place to listen to the records and stuff so you'd run into a lot of different people from a lot of different cultures that were in a lot of stuff that maybe you didn't like or even know existed and that sort of melting pot thing was pretty neat like I might not like reggae or hip-hop that much back then but Now when I think back and stuff like sitting there and waiting to listen to my little house and techno records like I really took in a lot of different types of music that I wouldn't I wouldn't have access to even through like my peers and my friends and stuff and stuff like that that followed through and like like fashion and food and like everything some of you hated and some of you didn't but as a whole I think it was pretty good When did you first start buying records? I don't remember exactly, but probably like around like 1993. Back in like the big rave days in Toronto, sort of. You had already gone to parties. Yeah, I used to like... Yeah, I used to go out a lot. I was really into indie music, but then when I switched into electronic, I really jumped into that. And Toronto at that point was going crazy with parties and stuff. So after maybe going out for two years, then I started buying vinyl. which was kind of weird because I'm not sure I had a record player at that point. So you started buying records before you had a record player? Well, I think I quickly got a record player and stuff. But yeah, I was really into the idea of the vinyl and the packaging and stuff. And certainly at that point, that was the only way to get the... the records. Like, I remember I'd hear certain records out at parties, and then the next day, like, Sunday, go try to track them down and stuff, and, yeah, like... To even find them was good enough, but to find them in any format that wasn't vinyl? No, never. So I figured I'd buy them and wait. Just to go back a little bit, you talked about being into indie. Were you really heavily into that music? Or dance music? Or was it just sort of like, this is kind of the music I like? No, I was pretty into it. Like I'm not sure you indie would would denote but like all respect that it was indie rock that was in the early nineties and stuff Yeah, I was really into it. I was really into like dinosaur jank all the Seattle stuff And I was also really, and still am, into like, sort of like, I don't know if country stuff's the word, but like a lot of that like post-country sort of vibe. I always really connected with that, like the like lonesome songwriter thing. highway there's a beach there known for cancer waiting to happen when you're out across the county line news travels slower than a ten second bus And yeah, I was really into it before electronic for sure and like so much so that I didn't really understand or like electronic music and I certainly couldn't see myself liking it so it was a weird switch up when I was 15 about what what was the first party you went to and when I mean was there a moment or was it just the entire party that sort of changed your mind about it? It was mostly probably like certain albums that changed my mind the whole party thing was interesting to see this music that I discovered like in a proper environment sort of and It was really interesting to see it consumed in that way. But certainly it wasn't the parties themselves that got me, that switched my mind. Sometimes they reinforced it. But yeah, it was certain albums that I picked up and then things moved pretty quickly. What were some of those early albums? Probably similar to a lot of other people, like The Orb, Adventures Beyond the Ultra World. Those kind of like open me up to maybe possibilities that like dance music and electronic music aren't just like cheesy, like, whatever, like what I expected back then. But certainly, I think Screamadelica by Primal Scream, that was the one that really, I could see the potential of the depth and stuff with this sort of stuff. And before that, I didn't really have any reference points. That's clearly a very good bridge album. I think it was. It was produced by Andrew Weatherall, right? Yeah, I think he like, as far as I know, he seemed to have a big part in it. And I remember the reason I actually even got it was because I used to buy the NME. In Toronto we could get the NME like weekly or whatever. And I remember that was, the review was so amazing that I was like, I remember I went right out and spent like 35 bucks on the like import CD. And yeah, that thing really changed everything for sure. You said you went to a certain record store in Toronto. When you were first buying records, was that one of the only record stores that was selling dance music, house and techno? There was actually, there was two stores, well there was three stores actually. There was Play-D-Record and Trax, which were the real DJ stores. But as I said, although they got everything, especially Play-D-Record, they did tend to cater more towards the reggae and the hip-hop crowd. These are really chaotic stores like I've never encountered anything apart from maybe New York City But there was another store called The Record Peddler that was more UK imports and stuff and they were really into punk but they also, I guess all their, all the new stuff that was coming out was electronic based and they carried a lot of the really weird stuff and certainly as like an indie kid I felt a little more comfortable making the transition in through that store and paying. the big bucks for the import CDs and vinyl. But yeah, at a later date, definitely the Play-Doh record was the store in Toronto. When I was doing an oral history of Mutech, I remember people talking about Toronto having an enormous party scene, like almost unfathomable. In a way these days. Can you tell me a little bit about you know who was coming in and what kind of parties were happening where they were being held? They were basically, I think because Canada has such a close historical connection with the Commonwealth and like the UK, there was a lot of, a lot of, a lot of people from the UK moved to move to Toronto and stuff. And I think because of that, there was a relationship developed between London and Toronto. So like. We would get like basically everyone coming through sort of. Some of the more like cool underground DJs might not quite make it like they might only go to New York but I think it was fair to say like back in those days like anyone that hit New York would basically hit Toronto as well. So we got to see like everyone like Jungle was really really big in Toronto so I remember like I wasn't that into that scene, but it was neat to see like Kenny Cannon SS play to like 15,000 people basically. Wow. They were being held in big warehouses. When it got to like the biggest point, yeah, they were like airport hangars, like abandoned malls. It was really out of control at certain points. I look back on it now and... I don't know how they pulled some of the stuff off. I remember they did a party in the CN Tower up in the observation deck. And you're wondering how these, I don't know how somebody's palm needed to be greased for that, but the idea of doing that now would be insane. There's no way, but a lot of that stuff. Because it was the first time happening, there were a lot of really interesting venues used. And because the city was so big as well, there was like a lot of... a lot of different options. And a lot of ground to cover for the police. Yeah, yeah. Although when it got really, really big, like, it did implode on itself just because it did get too big and, like, it got too mainstream and the police were on it at that point. But yeah, at the beginning thing, there was a lot of freedom and stuff. Before that happened, though, you... Started DJing. Oh, yeah. Yeah, like when things were like really really really big I was deep definitely DJing a lot like I was playing a lot of those parties mm-hmm, but when I first got into it, it was really like It was it was quite small and there was like there was one club called 318 Richmond, which was like an after-hours club And there'd be little sporadic small raves that would go on, but on the Sunday afternoon, everyone would basically end up at this place. And at that point, it was like 200 people, basically. It was a really small group, but yeah, five years down the line, it really trimmed. So when did you start playing out in public? I mean, had you been practicing in your room for a couple of years? Yeah, when I was at university, I used to... Drive down. I bought records for a long time before I DJ. Because when I started university, I used to drive down to Detroit quite frequently to record time to buy records and stuff. How far is it from Toronto? It's like five hours. You would drive five hours just to buy records? Well, we go to parties down there too. But it was pretty, like, it was often very sketchy down there, like, in those early days. The parties were cool, but, like, it wouldn't... I wouldn't plan on staying there for the weekend sort of thing, so it would usually end up we'd go to the party, and then at night we'd get up and go meet Huckabee or something over at Record Time, because they were open on Sundays. And that became a bit of a tradition, and I met a few people at least at university that maybe weren't really into that music, but certainly were up for an experience like that. And now that I look back on it, that was quite a... Quite an experience sometimes for sure So you became close with Mike Huckabee? Like I knew him like I guess everyone did like we bought records off him and he ran record time so Every time I go to Detroit you'd have to go to record time and there yeah, there was We respected the guy a lot. I certainly didn't really get to know him until later. Did you remember when you first heard about record time? I mean, I'm sure you heard about the parties and everything. I think the first party I went to down there, I remember at the Packard plant, I remember we had to buy the tickets around. Okay. Like, on one of my first trips and stuff. And, yeah, like, coming from Toronto that was so big and so cheesy at some points, it was really interesting to see, like, how focused it was down there, sort of. Yeah. Who did you go see in Detroit? Like, what, the first time? Yeah. Well, it was, like, the artists that sort of drew you down there. It was one of Richie's Jack Parties, like I think the first one actually, in the Packard with all the black plastic. He, with the Jack Parties, he basically plastered the walls with black plastic so that it was completely dark, right? In a lot of, yeah, like I didn't go to a lot of them, or all of them, and in the later incarnations they became... little bigger so I'm not sure what they did but in the first ones in the Packard plant that I was familiar with and the ones that he did in Toronto for the Transcendence guys yeah there was a lot of plastic yeah. For sure. The first party I went to, I remember that we went down for, we went to record time, bought the tickets, and then went to the Packard building, which I don't know if you've been to, but it was abandoned and like in a weird part of town. And it was pretty edgy for sure. And I remembered about, I don't know when, like late in the, early in the morning, late at night, someone... dropped a pepper spray thing on the dance floor basically and because it was all black plastic there was no ventilation. You can imagine what chaos ensued. It was pretty memorable, first experience in Detroit. They do things differently down there. They certainly used to, yeah. That hooked me for sure. As far as DJing in Toronto, do you remember the first time you DJed in public? I think the first time I really played in public was actually at a party that... Jeff Milligan and I threw. Neither of us were promoters at all, but there was a lot of like, as things were getting really big in Toronto, there was a lot of shitty stuff going on, like a lot of bad music and like vibes and just like money, money, money sort of. So Jeff and I decided to throw this party. I remember it was like on like a five and a half inch discette or something. It was called Boot. Jeff was seasoned and he'd been playing for ages, but I think that was one of the first times that I DJed in public and stuff. Are you nervous? I think I was nervous but I recall everything went pretty well because what I was more nervous about was the space that we'd rented and what appeared to be the mafia that we were dealing with and what smelled like a meth processing plant downstairs and while the reality was opening up to us I think then I had to play. I thought Jeff probably had a gun pulled in the head in the back. So I was like, okay. So it went okay. But yeah, I'm sure I was stressed. What were you playing back then? I was playing like... I'd almost buy all my stuff down at record time. And not because I just knew it was the best stuff, but more... Because, at least in record time, I couldn't find the records I really liked in Toronto. Although I'm sure they came in, but they were just too hard to track down. So I really built up a collection of going to record time a lot. I don't know, like back then I remember like all the communique stuff. It's like early Derek Carter I was really into. I was really into a lot of like housey stuff, like acidic stuff and everything and a lot of the New York stuff I wasn't really into exactly but in Detroit I remember I would always find these weird records that I couldn't quite place the genre. I mean I certainly didn't know the artist but I know I like that mood a little better. But certainly a lot of the Midwest stuff that was coming out then. that wasn't too hard, I really, really, really liked. And certainly anything Derek Carter touched back then. In an interview with Little White Earbuds, Derek was the first DJ that you mentioned in terms of classic people sort of inspiring you. In a very long list of people, but he was the first one. I found that interesting. It was both his productions and his DJing that was really inspiring to you. Yeah, both. Like the early stuff he did on Organico. with Chris Nizuka and stuff out of Chicago, I thought was like, was awesome. Thank you. And I remember going out and seeing him and he'd rock like three, four decks. effortlessly though and it was fun it wasn't like a technical thing like there'd be mistakes but he was like leagues above anyone else that we saw apart from like some of the Detroit guys like D-Win and those guys they were they were good and I really liked them but Derek always when he'd come to Toronto he'd really and when I when I saw him in Chicago and Detroit he'd always yeah it'd be awesome like he was so confident with it and it was just so like With techno a lot of times there's always that everyone's trying to be perfect and he obviously didn't care about that. That was really neat to see. Had you seen a house DJ DJ like that before? No, not at all. And back then he was playing like a bit of a mixture of stuff. But his records were definitely more experimental, but when he played he played yeah like house and that was really That was nice to see someone that wasn't really like cheesy and wasn't like someone that I could not connect with playing the stuff because I always really liked house but Some forms of it, like in Toronto, got such a bad vibe for a while that I'd be embarrassed saying that, but Derek was someone who I could bring his name up and everyone would be like, I understand what you mean. Obviously there are people that we know very very well like Jeremy etc. Were there other people in Toronto that also sort of outside that immediate circle that were quite influential on you? Yeah, there definitely was a lot but I think two in particular that I think would influence me a lot and I think also like Jeremy and Jeff and Mike and everyone would agree. One guy was Murat and he was a guy who'd come up from New York City but and really like right at the beginning sort of thing when things were really a lot of bad music and he he was really into like a different form of like techno and house and he was he was really aggressive with the mixing and it was i think he really he led us into a new dimension with a lot of the dj skills sort of things like he came from hip-hop background and like he was really like aggressive and like without being stupid, but he definitely influenced that whole group of us that there was like a whole nother world that wasn't like like I don't bad trance music and like cheesy rave music and stuff and The music that he was into I remember Like he used to work at bunker in New York, I think so he He really had access to stuff that even though Toronto got it, I don't think we really understood it. But I remember he came up and he was playing like UR, Acid Rain back to back or like Luke Slater, like Seventh Plain stuff and like really hard, hard music. But he played it and appreciated it in a way that he really brought like a lot of the soul out. And before... we could see it in that context. I could only see it as like just really hard like almost European gabber sort of stuff but like I think he really opened the door to like appreciate some of the more like American forms of techno for for all of us for sure. He was really like a figure that I don't know he's like a father figure sort of like we're all friends with him but he was like awesomely better than a lot of us as well and it was pretty good. It seems like the way you talk you sort of continually reference this like aggressiveness with Marant and Derek Carter as well in the way that they're mixing and it's hip-hop sort of you know almost battle DJ in a way. Sort of yeah yeah like maybe aggressive isn't the word but I definitely like like when people are taking chances with stuff and like, again, some of the accidents that occur, like I remember some of the stuff that Marat used to do, it was like, I don't know, like there were five times where it was just an error, but like that sixth time it was like, wow, like I don't know what you just did there, but it's certainly a lot more exciting than... all the other CDJ perfection guys I've seen and stuff. I think that really did influence a lot of us, the whole aggressive sort of thing. Because in Toronto, a lot of the thing was, because it was so European influenced, everyone was really into that style of mixing that I like and do myself and respect, but we never saw the other side of it. apart from like when people like Carter or Murat came and like tore the place apart basically but it really back then when it was done it was really like yeah it was it really opened a lot of our eyes that like wow this is crazy and it wasn't just the turntable of stuff like hip-hop but it was more like a like true like house like I don't know Yeah, it definitely influenced the whole group I'd say. And certainly if we were talking about another guy who influenced, again, me and a lot of my friends from Toronto, I'd say Melvin Trax. That was a little later on, like when we had already, all of us were playing, but... I talk about an aggressive style of DJing. Yeah, it's just like he's so passionate and so different that it really like, I think he really showed a lot of us. Again, he came into town and we were like, whoa, like, this is crazy. I don't know if I understand it, but I certainly respect it. Yeah, we didn't know, like, whatever his world is, I didn't know it existed. But now... He's basically a man possessed. For those who haven't, you know, witnessed him in person, he's basically a man possessed. Yeah. You know, when he's playing. Yeah. And now we're like really close friends and we know each other but like he was a real big influence back in like the late 90s when we were bringing him up. He'd come up with music that like I would have no idea what it was and like but the way he would present it it really opened the possibility I think for all of us that like if you're really passionate about a certain type of music like you can work it in. Thank you. It seems like Chicago for you is just a really enormous city. Yeah, well Chicago, as typical as it sounds, there's certain parts of Chicago and certain parts of Detroit that, yeah, totally. Detroit has the emotional melancholy and Chicago has the jack. You mentioned Morant and obviously Jeff Milligan. Who else in Toronto, I guess people might still know, were around back then that you were really tight with? Jeremy Caulfield? Yeah, still around. Obviously, my close friends were Jeremy and Mike Shannon. Jeff and that would be the close group sort of but the end of the 90s Mike started his label Jeremy started Dumb Unit um I guess when the rave or like the party scene in Toronto sort of died down a little bit that some of you guys were like, okay, this is actually a good chance to go into the studio or this is a good chance to like start our own things. Yeah. You started Killer around the late 90s as well. Or in the mid 90s. Yeah. Killer came before like I think Dumb Unit and Cynosha and everything. Okay. Out of Speed, the record store, we had this little label called Blue. And I remember Wild Blue was ongoing I think in like '96 or something or yeah, I remember I started Killer and that was like definitely like heading out into the wilderness because I didn't really know anyone that did it and now that I look back on it I don't even know how it existed but yeah, yeah, Killer evolved for a while and certainly in North America no one knew about it, cared about it, anything but I'm... I'm continually surprised, like living over here now, how many people actually did know the label and how many people liked it, which is really cool, but... Surprising. Surprising, yeah, like for everyone involved, I'm sure. Were you the first among your group of friends that was making music? I might have been the first out of that group of friends that maybe technically released a record. But we were all sort of dabbling. We were all so much into DJing, though, that I think, like, and we really loved DJing, and we were all, like, we really based our personalities on that and stuff, that the production thing, I think I can speak for most of us, but, like... We were so into the DJing thing and we respected it so much that I think we all had the feeling that like if we were ever going to do the production thing, it better be at the exact same level. And yeah, so it took everyone like a while. Yeah. How, I guess compared to like Jeff and Mike and Jeremy, how would you say your DJ style differs? I mean was it kind of clear in the beginning like Mike does this a little bit differently? Yeah, Mike and I always kind of played like kind of similarly, I'd say. I'd say we all played a little differently, but we all obviously came from the same like the same seed. And that seed was basically being in Toronto, seeing... so many shitty DJs come through basically. Like, yeah. And I think a lot of our like really getting into the DJing thing was a bit of a reaction to like... Just dissatisfaction with everything else. Yeah, which I guess is normal. But yeah, like there was a lot of crazy stuff in Toronto for a while. And just because so much money was involved, it was like the quality level really suffered a lot of the time. And I think wherever we started from was definitely a reaction to that. But yeah, Jeremy's really smooth, Jeff does his crazy stuff, and I'd say Mike and I are both more in the like. party angle sort of but I've seen like all our tastes change and go back and forth and stuff but I think we would all agree on stuff technically yeah. How has your taste changed over the years? It's definitely broadened and gotten a lot bigger I think it incorporates a lot of different types of music. In the last five years, I really like with downloading and YouTube and stuff, I really quickly discovered a lot of other types of music that have no bearing on what I might DJ or what I might produce, but that I really, really appreciate and stuff. And I think that, yeah, I think lately my palate to kind of draw from has increased. I noticed in your two most recent DJ charts that I've seen Night Slugs and Pangea have been in there. Is that becoming a little bit more of an influence on you? Yeah, I'd say hugely. I'd say whatever that whole thing is, especially coming out of the UK, like the bass scene, yeah, I think it's really exciting. And I think it's exciting in some of the ways that techno used to be exciting as well. Are you finding places for it in your sets? Yeah, totally. Yeah, I play like a lot of that stuff, but I find a lot of like the dubstep stuff I really, really like, but a lot of that sometimes has different moods than what I play, but some of the like, again, I don't know what to call it, I guess bass music stuff, I find it's exactly like, again, it needs a little... You need to know what you're doing and stuff. You can't just throw it in but I find a lot of it works really really really well. Yeah, like I find literally half the records I buy now I guess might be considered like UK based records and some of it I hate but the ones that are on point I think are awesome and really really exciting. Are you pitching it down quite a bit? No, um... No, a little. But I play pretty fast usually too, so it's that far. Okay. But I find a lot of that stuff seems to sit at around like 133, 135 these days. And like, I do 128 anyway, so it's sort of all... I find it really like works effortlessly without me having to... Over the past few years, I remember a lot of the dubstep stuff coming out. I loved it, but... I found it was awkward to integrate into what I was doing, but lately I don't find that at all. Everything's different, but it all really fits together really well. At the same time, some of those people are caught into your music as well. I know I listened to a Scuba SCB set from Panorama Bar, and he played two of your tracks in like... you know, quick succession. Do you find that you're getting feedback from people that you didn't expect to be into your music? Yeah, I, again, lately in the last year, I really, I really am. And I'm kind of like really thankful for that for some reason, like, and when I think about it, and when I meet these people, it really makes sense. Because like, I I think a lot of people in that scene are quite open-minded, which I really, really like. So like, although I might not know them and think they just like, whatever. ever play certain records I'm pleasantly surprised by like especially a lot of the dubstep guys like been really really supportive and stuff especially even like with the label with New Canada but in particular a lot of the stuff I do which is really really really nice because they're probably currently the people that I would really like to be into it so What are the records that have been getting sort of the biggest response in that sector that you've found that you've done? Evil Jungle Prince, that was just really like a raw analog bass track and I've got a lot of response on that one from a wide variety of people that sort of surprised me. Like I'd love to hear some of them play it because it seems a little out of place but then again like a lot of them are really open-minded. Thank you. Thank you. I mean obviously when you're doing stuff in the studio you just... do it it's instinctive all of these things but do you find that it's seeping in can you hear it a little bit like here somehow that this genre of music is influencing what you're doing yeah your own production completely but i do really feel like i really feel a connection to i don't want to like put it just in a genre but whatever is going on in in the UK right now, I really feel a connection to in ways that I don't feel a connection currently to house or techno. So what it kind of feels like is suddenly something's developing that I can wholeheartedly sort of get behind, like, and the people like lots of different stuff and like, it's not all pigeonholed. So it seems a lot more comfortable in that respect. And I find when I'm in the studio, like. Now when I come up with something that isn't maybe that wouldn't be traditionally like house or techno it's not like I'm wondering like where Where's the place for this? It's like it's clear where the place for this is and I think I think I almost go in that direction a lot more now that I know there's a bit of an audience for it sort of. What were you doing early on with your production? I mean, I'm not as up to date on the very early like killer releases for example. What did those sound like would you say? The killer stuff was really really tracky and like we were really into like relief records and stuff back then. So Killer was up in that, really repetitive, really DJ oriented. But again, we were really into our DJing back then, so I just wanted to make tools that could be used. And they were mostly done, we didn't use computers back then at all. We had, or most of us had a lot of, I know I had a lot of hardware. So Killer was mostly all done like step sequencing, analog sort of vibe. And the computer scene, yeah, it was out of the picture at that point, sort of. So that was basic, I think. Killer went up to like number nine or something and that was the general vibe of the label like really really DJ friendly. It seems like at the same time though the more recent records that you've made have that similar feel in the sense that they're they feel very live. Has that always been pretty important to you? Yeah totally that was one of the things that I think always turned me off with electronic music in general. It was also perfect that I didn't see the life in it a lot of times but I yeah I think I actively try to like introduce a lot of I don't know. I think the raw stuff and just like, not randomness, but definitely like the happy accidents, I think are where the magic is for sure. And I like to try to make those happen as much as possible, yeah. How do you go about making an accident happen in the studio? I don't know. Probably... just doing stuff in ways that isn't the proper way of doing it or being ignorant with the proper way of doing it which in my case would happen a lot like... It seems funny though because you've used Ableton at least in a live setting to... I don't know if you've produced music since version one and you've been trying to figure out ways to mess it up in a way ever since. Well, yeah, there's a lot of there's definitely a lot of ways to mess it up within Ableton and I also use Ableton as like Basically the brain because I do use a lot of hardware now like I had a few years there There's just the computer. But now that I'm in Berlin, I've got a lot of a lot of hardware and stuff and I find the interplay between the hardware and and the Software that's where a lot of like happy mistakes can be made for sure I just, I continue to like sample stuff when I'm playing around and I usually tend to find it's when I'm just screwing around. It's those takes that I use and not the ones that I really like plan out and stuff. So there's a lot of jamming. There's tons of jamming, yeah. All about the jamming. Was that a root idea behind New Canada when you first started it, that there needed to be a different take? take on what you were doing? Yeah, well, when you can't right when you Canada started, there was a lot of like, minimal perfection coming out. This is 2004 2005 2005. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Some of which I liked, but it certainly there was like a grit and a rawness that was that was missing sort of And a lot of the Europeans really were ruling at that time, so I think the label was a little bit of a response to that. Like, there was other stuff going on in that vein, but yeah, it was like everything was too clean and too almost lifeless at that point. like so sort of a trying to be responsive that I'd say yeah and it's continued through like I still it's still that I don't know I don't know what to call it but it's I certainly still would strive for that with the label like Yeah, like the whole, just the raw vibe, I really quite like. Like, it doesn't, I find a lot of the old records I like are just like that too. Like, they might not be perfect, but there's a certain magic in them because of that. Yeah. On the Coogee. website or myspace which is sub-label of new canada i think the quote is we like it dark raw or something like that something like that yeah is acid a huge influence as well on you um well yeah but not like acid in the traditional like hard floor sort of vibe more like like In the mid 90s I think a lot of the stuff like Carter and all those guys they were using the 303s for bass lines and maybe it wasn't 303 but whatever that acid sound was and it was always so warm and I must say that's always stayed with me. What are some of the tracks you're thinking of? Like almost anything on the Communique label, like Woody McBride's label, in the early days was pretty cool. And yeah, I guess like Derek Carter's Red Nail Project, Blue Cucaracha, that kind of like, and the Prescription Records, that whole sort of like, a lot of that I would consider acid sort of, but it's not the... the 303 like madness sort of thing but yeah I'd say that the spooky kind of stuff always influenced me a lot and uh yeah obviously like I like the dark sort of moody vibe sort of but you mentioned dark and moody and then I immediately think of also the art on New Canada as well. Yeah. Something... It's a little ominous. It is ominous. That's exactly the word, I think. For those who are not familiar, I guess, I don't know if it's just recently or it's... the entire way through but it's basically these black and white pictures with this red dot that highlights something from every record. Yeah since like five I think I've kind of I've kept with the weird historical prints with the red dot sort of thing yeah. So you're doing all of the designing? Yeah yeah I come from like a background like that like I was Well, and I still am really into like graphic design and stuff and that's if it wasn't for music I think probably what I would be What I'd be pursuing for sure unlike like music like the art and the visual and like I wasn't into particular people or movements really but I really aesthetically know quite quickly what I'm into and what I'm not into and I was always really confident with that so like As long as it's uneasy. Well, yeah. I'm open to other things, but certainly my style tends towards that these days, yeah. But I enjoy doing the artwork a lot. That's one of the main bonus of the label, for sure. Killer was mostly an outlet for your own stuff? Mostly, yeah. And I feel like over the past... A couple of releases even more so than before you've really opened up the label to different artists. Yeah, I think it's just been that I've recently connected with some people who it just clicked and the tracks were perfect and like the latest release The Soil thing like Yeah, it was just, I wasn't outwardly planning to find new artists and stuff, but yeah, it came together quite with a little synergy in it. Yeah, it's perfect. Do you find that some of the artists that you're working with almost know to send you certain types of things that they do in a way? Like the experimental stuff, like maybe animal. Yeah, I think now I might have that. I've been talking to a lot of people recently that have been sending me stuff for the label, which is really cool because I'm still on the assumption. that it like nobody knows the label but a lot of like good producers have been sending me stuff and yeah like a lot of them definitely send me the weirder things which is good because usually when they send me like the i don't know the things with the weird like american samples in it or something yeah i don't usually go for those but um i guess that i have that name now okay So no preacher samples is what you're saying? No, no. But I do find a lot of, some people I work with like send me a bunch of stuff and I think they expect me to kind of go for, or maybe they expect the record label in general to go for the clear hit and stuff. So sometimes I kind of am a bit of a winner because I'm like, pick the black sheep that they probably like as well. Yeah, and it works from, it's usually pretty easy for me to lock tracks down, 'cause I'm not usually looking for the big mega hits, so that's nice. I always find like, yeah, touches of emotion sort of, they really work together really well. I don't know if that's just because, well a lot of the stuff the music coming out currently definitely is in that vein but going back five years and there wasn't there wasn't a lot there was the hard techno and then there was the really minimal like stuff that was just it it lacked a depth sort of like some of that I liked but I don't know, that's why some of the disco stuff just feels like there's a lot of emotion packed in there and stuff. In certain stuff, and yeah, I was really gravitated towards that. You also mentioned swing, which I find probably minimal techno doesn't have a ton of. These days it's losing a lot of, but certainly when it first started coming out, like... I'm talking like Mike Inc on like ProFan and stuff. It was almost like the lack of swing was really funky and stuff. But yeah, I tend to like New York style house, Todd Terry, that always, whatever the swing of that stuff is, I was always really attracted. to like I guess the MPC I like that and I like hip-hop a lot too and a lot of it is to do with the swing I find when techno gets a little too like mechanical I I'm not into it at all. Do you have I mean is it a struggle to get that into your own productions? Are you kind of not anymore? No, no now it's like really really natural at the beginning. It was a little hard because I was using all gear and stuff and obviously that inherently does have certain types of swing but I think I used to hear a lot of hip hop and a lot of stuff done on MPCs and that was always a little bit of a... I couldn't quite figure out how that was done but now I do. Is that why you moved to software? Because you felt like... you couldn't get exactly the sound that you were looking for. No, I moved to software. Like, I bought Live One when it came out, and it was because it was a solution to how to... Like I wanted to play live, I knew at that point I wanted to play live, but I knew the reality of me bringing all my shit out with me wasn't gonna happen. Especially not outside of Toronto. So yeah, when Ableton came out it was like basically a solution for people of Big Gear Studios that want to put everything in loops and just be able to jam. And that was basically it. It was a solution for how to jam without having all your stuff. And there wasn't really anyone else facilitating that at that point. It was all workstations where you really needed to know exactly what you were going for. And I always had no idea what I was going for. When did you finally... was there a breakthrough? Did you finally knew what you were going for? I guess there were different points and breakthroughs. I guess the biggest breakthrough was like when I really started playing a lot of my own stuff. Because before that I like I appreciated and I knew certain people liked it but I think I think deep down I was always waiting to like... I would play a lot of my own stuff and now I do and I don't think about it. I like doing it just as much as another good record I like and I think that was a big breakthrough. That's when I felt like I was like, I don't know. You were not that confident about your own work. Well, I was confident with Killer and stuff and the early New Canadas, they were tools and I really like tools and I won't like... disparage them but like I always felt like whenever I tried to move past that I wasn't as good as someone else I really liked. And because we had such like, we were really deeply into music and really like nerds and stuff. I just, I'd always be like, I'd always be comparing myself to that hot new record I bought this week. And that's, that's a tough comparison, but I guess everyone goes through that. And I, but I'd say one of the big milestones was when I finally didn't have to make that. comparison and think wow my stuff's not as good as this now it's at least I don't know now I'll at least play it which I think is like for me I think is pretty neat And it's you know, it's not just the functional stuff. Yeah. Yeah. No Yeah, now I feel like now I'm just really comfortable with like the production stuff. I think I have my own I guess having your own sound is like a whole that's definitely When you're trying to emulate other people's either successfully or unsuccessfully, but then when you're not trying to do that anymore, I think that's Yeah, it's a nice feeling. I don't remember exactly when that happened, but yeah. I wasn't used to that. It was always like, I felt like when I was playing my own record or something, I was like cheating. Do you have your own sound? Um, I don't, I have a bunch of sounds, but like, I'm, I'm pretty confident with like, yeah, yeah. I think I kind of do these days. Yeah. Like with some of the new Canada stuff. I couldn't really verbalize what it was, but I have a way of working now that I'm really comfortable with. and I'm pretty happy with so previous to that it was always like again like you kind of feel like you're a bit of a fake and you're not sure if you're doing it the right way now I don't really care I'm doing it the way I do it and um yeah and I'm not really worried about being a fake quite as much anymore yeah tell me about moving to Berlin You moved here a couple of years ago? Moved here like, yeah, two years ago, basically. That seems a little bit later than some of your friends. Yeah, I was like, I guess, of the people everyone knows, like I was probably the last, one of the last people to move here for sure. And it's weird because I have European citizenship, so it would have been really easy for me to, but... Yeah, I don't know. I'm really happy I'm here now and it's really, really nice having all my friends around. I don't think I'd still be here if that wasn't the case. But there's so many people here that I know that I'm close with that I feel way more at home than I do in Canada right now. But Toronto's a pretty cool place to be and like maybe even musically like North America wise, Toronto has a lot going on for sure. So it's an easy place to stay. And I'm not really regretful I didn't go earlier, but I think when I did leave, it was the right time for sure. Because there's been so much opportunity here since I've got here. that uh yeah i'm pretty happy i made the move logistically for a touring dj it just makes a lot more sense yeah it definitely does but the the quality of life and the pace of life here allows for a lot of a lot of possibility for sure like i think a lot of people figure it's just like party party party here but I often find the people at least involved in the industry like partying up on the weekends that day-to-day life here is actually quite I don't know like I go out to dinner a lot hang out with people's kids a lot and like it's like it's becoming a little more familiar and like honest sort of it's not just like chaos and when I came here I was expecting like I don't know just chaos and it hasn't at least in the weekdays it's not like that so i think it's pretty nice like everything Are you getting booked to do more live gigs or DJ gigs, or is it about the same? It's still about the same, but in the last year I've started playing live a lot. Is that a conscious decision on your part? Are you enjoying it a little bit more at the moment? Yeah. Again, with the live performance, maybe like a year or a year and a half ago, as with the production, I got to that point. where I'm pretty confident and I know what I'm doing and it's not like live is sometimes like it's like I don't know like deck like a house of cards like you're not quite sure what's going on but I feel a lot more comfortable with it and I feel I have a little more room to move around with live and I have enough material and stuff that I like yeah I like yeah I really I like playing live a lot these days for sure tell us all about how you're not checking your email when you're playing live? - Well, one of my big things with live is seeing I come from like a DJ background, I tend to play live aggressively like I DJ sort of. So a lot of the interface is with the mixer. And I split things and it's like a DJ mix or not. I don't use like a studio board So I have a lot of interaction with that I always like the EQ is much better on the DJ board. So I find like I find I always use those and I also recently have incorporated I bring an MPC out with me to trigger stuff live and that I think that brings me away from checking the email a lot for sure but And for bigger gigs I tend to bring some hardware as well, but sometimes that creates, unless it's a really well organized event, like when I played Fabric, I brought a bunch of stuff. If you're playing some warehouse party, it's a bit of a different, yeah, like, I don't know. I always kind of gauge it towards that and stuff, but. What kind of hardware are you taking out when you do? I have a M-Bass little kick module, which is really like. So simple, but on big systems it really makes a difference. And I have a really good sound card and stuff too, but that thing really opens everything up. I also usually bring a little analog synth with me by a Berlin manufacturer called MFB. And this is like one of the original ones and it's like, it's a real one trick pony, but it does like Moog style bass lines really, really, really well. And I find pairing those two with the computer and my RME sound card usually is enough for me for what I'm looking for. I sometimes have a Nord as well that I bring out, like a rack, but... Again, it's too big. Can't fly with it. It's funny that you talk about it being too big because I know you started playing. maybe never gave up playing almost exclusively vinyl. Yeah, no, no. I just play vinyl, yeah. Which, you know, is obviously a rarity these days, and one of the complaints that people, of course, always bring up is the fact that... don't want to be carrying this enormous bag through an airport. Yeah, that's a fair judgment call, certainly. I think my biggest gripe with the vinyl would be the fact that I scratch it up so much, and each record has a shelf life of about six months, but I think maybe that's also the draw secretly as well. You said earlier... that you know you're one of the things that you were drawn to with the vinyl is sort of the object you know having this big yeah big thing there's something there's something about it that the and i'm not like anti-digital or anything but there there is some difference and it's an important difference and i don't know exactly what it is i i think i well I think it sounds better, first of all. I won't get in an argument with people about that. I don't care. And I don't know. I'm not an expert on that. But I know from playing on big systems, or good systems, when I play after someone who's playing digitally, I have a bigger sound, for sure. And it tends to just make sense to me. So that really keeps me in that. But I do enjoy the object. I even secretly, I think, enjoy how the object breaks down. Like, you need to kind of use it in time or it'll start sounding shitty. And the way I play, stuff sounds like I'm pretty rough with my records, so there's things come and things go. And it kind of forces me. Like, I don't get stuck playing the same records that long because... After two years, the record... doesn't sound good anymore. So I think little things like that keep me with that. And I do like the fact too, with the vinyl culture, like not the elitist part of you having it and no one else having it, but I do like the discovery aspect of it. Like I like, I don't know, I find that sort of exciting. I remember when I first got into it, it was really neat that like these guys like hunted this down. found it or just randomly found it and now they're presenting it to me and for some reason to me it gives me a little more value than just being able to go to beatport and download it i i don't see that as a bad thing but there's some magic that's lost and uh i remember i think it was talking to jeremy caulfield once he said you were working in a record store together Yeah, I was like the buyer and we both ran a club together in those days called Blue and that's what we, so we DJ together every week. But Jerry was really, it was all a big family at the store basically. You mentioned that you would buy these records and you would get a copy of the record and he would get a copy of the record. It was a really small record store, yeah. Then you put out the rest to everyone else. Yeah, and the rest in those days were probably about two other units. We'd exclusively buy all our stuff from... from Dan Bell's distribution called 7 City down in Detroit. So again, we'd be driving down to Detroit once a week to illegally pick up this big carload of records and shuttle across the border illegally. Before 9-11 when they're checking the border quite carefully. I couldn't even imagine. It was pretty bad back then, but it would be worse now. But yeah, we would, because Dan's selection was so niche and like specific. yeah we'd and we wouldn't listen to stuff exactly beforehand i don't remember how we did it but i remember a lot of it was like i remember that label looks like it could be good i'm not sure about that one so you'd have to really buy conservatively but yeah we'd come back and then i remember we'd get back on wednesday night and all our friends would come down and we'd always like go through the whole box and those were magical times Definitely Jeremy and I got first pick and it went out from there. We drove down there, we deserved it. I remember one time we had been to Underground Resistance as well and we bought like a bunch of t-shirts to bring back up to the store and I remember it was me, my boss and like one other guy I think and I remember we had like five Underground Resistance t-shirts on over top of each other and then we had our sweater over top so I remember and it was in the winter so we thought we'd look like totally normal. And I remember this one time we got caught and I think the guy thought we had drugs or something. And they pulled us over and they searched the car. and they found all the records that were clearly brand new and like but at that point no one it was they didn't really clue in on it we were just like we collect records they were like okay but they thought we had drugs so i remember they took us into the interrogation room and uh they strip searched us which like unfortunately has happened a few times to me and i remember it was funny as and I'm sure we each had the same experience, but as we took off our main sweater, that we had this big puffy UR thing, and then we took it off five times in a row, and we got caught that time. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Bye.
