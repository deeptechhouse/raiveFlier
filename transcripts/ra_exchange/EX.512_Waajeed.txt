Bye. All right, world, welcome back to another edition of the Underground and Black Times Resident Advisor Exchange. This is Ash Lauren, and I have the pleasure of sitting in the studio today with Wajid. What up, though? What's up, Wajid? How are you? I'm well. How are you, Ash? I'm good, good. Glad to be back in Detroit. The sun is shining. Yeah, it's strange, right? Yeah, this is actually kind of great. People are out and about. Downtown Detroit, this is a fun science experiment. that we're watching. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Speaking of Detroit, I guess we can just start off a little bit about that. What are your current opinions on the state of Detroit right now? Are you a lifelong resident? Lifelong resident. I've been, I lived in New York for almost a decade and I spent most of my time in Brooklyn. And then, yeah, actually being in New York made me a better Detroiter, I would say. Because I started to miss ghetto tech. I started to miss, you know what I mean? Like the techno and, you know, like all the things. that are exports, I would say, I started to appreciate them on another level. When she left. When I left. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm sure you can identify. I can relate with that hardcore because when I lived here, I was like, fuck Detroit, I'm leaving. I'm done with it. Yeah, get me out of here. But that was also in like 2005. So, I mean, Detroit was obviously in a different state then. But how do you feel about the city now? Like how, you know, all the revitalization and whatnot? I think it's interesting. You know what I mean? Like it's, I hate the fact that what most people would consider growth be at. the expense of the natives yeah but you know like um you know i look at sometimes i look at detroit like you know like uh like your partner that you might be with you know i'm saying like sometimes you forget the value of your partner when somebody else starts hitting on them in a club yeah right you're like and you actually might be cute I forgot that you was fine. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, you know what I mean? And I forgot that you had, you know, all of this value that I can't get other places. Exactly. And so Detroit is very much that, you know. But just in terms of how I feel about it, you know, I have mixed feelings some days, you know what I'm saying? I'm excited to be able to go up the street and get a great coffee, you know, and then other days, you know what I'm saying? Like, I'm totally disgusted by, you know what I'm saying? People from the burbs putting Detroit on their record labels, you know what I'm saying? To exploit my city and my people. Yeah. So, you know, Luckily, I have my own music to be able to express those thoughts inside of. But, yeah, it's complicated. Do you think you'll remain in Detroit? You said you left and you were in New York. At this point, do you kind of see yourself here for the foreseeable future? That's tough to say. I mean, I'm a property owner. You know what I'm saying? I'm a proud native. I do feel a huge level of responsibility to be here and, you know, inspire those who don't see people that look like me. But just in terms of being, you know, like a... person, you know what I'm saying, a person that has had the privilege to be able to travel for the last 20 years, I can't really say. You know, I will say that now at this very moment, it's a good fit. It's the best fit on the planet for me right now. You know, no place feels like home, as Dorothy would say. I think also, like speaking about home, you can kind of appreciate your home more. I mean, I guess kind of like we said, when you go other places or even just traveling, because there's kind of nothing like your home base. You know, you can even travel the world and people think it's so amazing. But I think. Sometimes the most amazing thing is just being home because it's comfortable is where you're from. Yeah, you know it. Yeah. And, you know, it's like, you know, I mean, I don't know some shady areas if I'm in Lisbon, you know, Portugal. Yeah. But, you know, like it's something about that Detroit Spidey sense that applies across the board. You know, it's that feeling of like when something is not right. And, you know, it's something that. It's the best gift that the ghetto could give you. It's street smart. That's what it is. You're like, look, I'm good. People be like, oh, you're going so-and-so. Make sure you good. We've been navigating in the D. We good. You know what? I'm all right. You know what I'm saying? I mean, if anything, if somebody pops some shit off, it's going to be me. Yeah. You know what I mean? So I So, I mean, to speak on that a little bit, you're from Conan Gardens. That's Eastside, right? Yep, Eastside. So would you, I mean, I was born in Detroit. I grew up in Rochester Hills, but my family are Westsiders. So I guess me growing up, we look at the Eastside, like y'all are like about like, it was hood. Like Eastsiders was rough. Like, I didn't really know a lot of Eastside, like, people. You're from Rochester? Yeah. Wow. Yeah, yep. Respect. Your parents changed them zeros quick. Yeah, they, you know, my parents are from the city of Detroit. And, you know, they went to college, got good jobs. Understood. Moved us out to the suburbs. Lower insurance on the cars. Yeah, all that. But they definitely made sure we were. I mean, it's obviously not that far. Spend a lot of time in the city just so we're not all the way like suburbanite. Understood. But how was it for you growing up on the east side of Detroit? Do you think there's misconceptions about that side of town? Totally. I mean, you know, it's like, you know, like, I mean, we can sip wine and, you know, talk about, you know, like art that's inside of the Louvre like anybody else. Yeah. It's real. It's real over there. I came up in a time that was extremely complicated for black people. all over the United States, you know, in terms of the 80s. Yeah. You know, so. It wasn't just a Detroit thing. It was not just a Detroit thing. Crack cocaine destroyed. I mean, it was, you know, you can easily say that it was the genocide of our people at that moment. So, you know, so I came out, I was about 10 or 11 about the time that the epidemic hit. And I watched it destroy not just my community, but my home, you know, like all my personal relationships. So, yeah, I came up in a time that was very complicated. So asking me if I'm a little biased, it's just in terms of, you know what I'm saying? how I see the east side, but I think this was just, I think this happened all over the United States. You know what I mean? Like, I don't think it was any different in Compton or in Atlanta. You know what I mean? Like, I don't think it was much different, my experience at that particular time in the world. Growing up, you know, in Detroit on the east side, you know, obviously you got into music at a young age. Like, what are your early memories of music? Was it through, I mean, through most people, it's usually like a sibling or their parents or grandma, you know. That's exactly what mine was. Mine was my dad. Smoking the stuff that really smelled amazing. And the blue lights of hysteria reflecting and me being deeply terrified by the sounds of Parliament. You're like, what are they talking about? What is the... I'm about to get on the spaceship. What are these demonic voices, you know what I'm saying, that's coming in on the left side of the speaker? You know, and little did I know I was, you know, I was getting a little contact high from what was going on. So, you know, my experience was the same as my dad's. But, yeah, and particularly jazz, you know. Yeah, so it was like. just all over the board. I think that good stuff that he was smoking makes you kind of think in that space. There's no boundaries. Yeah, yeah, I know a little bit about that. So, all right. So, I mean, how did your whole musical journey begin? I feel like that's such a cliche question, but obviously everyone may not know. We know your roots were obviously in hip-hop first. So when did you start getting into DJ and production? Like around what age were you? I must have been about 12 or 13. Yeah, I mean, the great thing about my dad's record collection and all this... really bizarre stuff. What I looked at as being bizarre at the time, all the records that he was collecting, I inherited those records. Nice. So a lot of that stuff I was always listening to. So I was a DJ before production or... anything. So you're a DJ first? First. Cool. Yeah, I was Slum Village's first DJ. So, I mean, luckily, I mean, and that's kind of part of the story is how These really eclectic records and this kind of a different perspective in terms of music and just seeing the world made me different in my hood. And my brother was a gangster, so I was protected. I could very easily be the weird kid that could go grab the straps. They knew who your brother was. They're like, yeah, he good. Leave him alone. Let him roll, man. Do what he doing with his hair. You know what I'm saying? Like, let him wear them bright clothes. You know what I'm saying? Like, you know, let him have it. But luckily I was able to connect with another team of weirdos that lived inside of my neighborhood, which my closest friend at the time was Batim, rest in peace. He lived directly around the corner. So we kind of moved into this kind of hip-hop. hippie kind of thing together. And then we eventually connected with T3 and QD and then Dilla was a part of that fold as well. So that's how we eventually formed Slum Village. Almost as a pact and a way of, it was almost like a refuge. It served as a musical group, but first it served as an opportunity to create. protection inside of our neighborhood against all the craziness that was happening. Because you guys weren't necessarily involved in that. Do you think you guys kind of connected because you were kind of on the avant-garde, like artsy or, as you say, weirdo? To be fair, we dabbled. You know what I'm saying? We dabbled. I mean, you know, it's like, I mean, it started, a lot of these ideas kind of started sticking together. They started to compress in Aunt Phyllis' basement. Okay. You know, like, he lived directly across the street from the school that we were skipping from. Virgin High School. Dope boys. What up, though? Wait, what school is it? Persian. Oh, Persian. Okay. Yeah, dope boys. So we would skip school across the street in Amp's basement where he would kind of teach us about production and, you know, just the idea. I mean, he was another weirdo in the neighborhood. And I say that. He was kind of giving y'all the knowledge. He was giving us the rope. You know what I'm saying? You know, to be some of the first crabs that got out of the barrel. You know what I'm saying? Like he gave us the, I mean, you know, it's always this thing where it's just like somebody's going to give you something, you know, when you're coming up as a youngster. It's just a question is what they're giving you enough for you to not just survive the moment. is it going to destroy you? Is it going to survive you for the moment? Or is it going to survive you or give you the tools to survive for the rest of your life? So he gave us the tools that allowed us to survive for the rest of our lives. That's important. Big time, right? You know what I mean? So that's why my old... Like you know saying I mean amp is more than oh geez like an older brother Do you think I mean cuz I feel like I hear a lot of stories like that from people who are kind of like my age and above. But I wonder, like, for the youth now, like, I don't know, I feel like we need more mentorship. You know, it seems like it's, I mean, it's just so important to be, like you said, just someone to show you the ropes and be like, oh, this is cool. Or, you know, put you on music, you know, teach you how to use some type of equipment. or something. I just feel like we need more of that. I'm starting to see it pop up, but especially in the black community in terms of dance music, like I feel like there is somewhat of a disconnect in my opinion. So I am grateful to see situations like that. I mean, one I can say I've seen firsthand is like, With Kai Alce and Stefan, you know, Kai is like the OG to all of us in Atlanta. And even me, I don't produce, but if I just want to go over there and, hey. people walking by, if I just want to go over there and like play records and just like hear cool stories, you know, he's always like so accessible and such an open book. So we do, we do need more of that. Yeah. I totally agree with you. And you know, it's not, it's not enough of that. You know what I'm saying? If you see it, you can be it. Yeah. And that's what. offered us, you know, but, you know, like, and look at you now, you know what I mean? It wasn't in vain. Yo, like I'm in a position now, like, bro, you can sit down. Like I got you, you know what I'm saying? Like what you need, you know what I'm saying? So, um, and you know, I mean, AMP is not one of, I mean, AMP is not just, you know, all that same level of, uh, You know what I'm saying? Like teachers, school, like kind of relationship to like guys like Mike Banks. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Mike Banks is my OG. You know what I'm saying? And helped me understand like, yo, like I don't have to give it up in order to get in. You know, but, you know, and. it's funny how all of this relates to, you know what I'm saying, this genocide of crack cocaine and drugs and guns that's being placed inside our communities because my generation was the first generation where... black man was removed from the home. So ultimately, you know what I'm saying, this relationship and this separation that you're talking about is a direct result of men not being in the home to be able to carry on the tradition. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, they're like, I didn't have nobody, so why am I trying to be out here helping somebody? They don't even know what that is. Real talk. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? It's like a lot of the younger guys that I try to sit down with, you know what I'm saying? It's like, you know what I'm saying? Like, I feel a resistance because they ain't never been really in a position to kind of deal with somebody that don't want something from them. You know what I'm saying? So they're like skeptical or something. Yo, like, yo, my father failed What are you prepared to offer me? So, you know, there's a lot of healing and a lot of things that directly connect to all of this, this big circle. It's a bigger picture. It's a bigger picture. Absolutely. There's levels to this shit. Absolutely. And, you know, it's like our women, you know, y'all held us down. Yeah. Without y'all, man, we would have disappeared. You know what I mean? Hey, you see the shirt? Yo, I see the shirt. I was like, oh, I need that. Let's make it clear for those who can't see. It says black women are not your enemy. And I mean, I know you're deep into the production thing right now. Like, what inspired you to get into production? Was that that whole era of hanging out with Amp? Yeah, you know what? I mean, I always, you know, like, I guess my hood trauma always has kind of... taught me consciously and unconsciously that these candles is the first one to burn out you know the people that's always in the front you know I'm saying like the person that's always in the front of the group is always the biggest target. So I guess I internalized that in a way where it's just like, I want to be a part of this, but I don't necessarily want or need to be in front. You know what I'm saying? What do you mean a target? Like people hating on you or just trying to come at you sideways? Always. To judge you? All of that. You know what I'm saying? I mean, but you know, it's like, you know, in my hood, like the biggest to get murked you know so you know in in terms of a group it's almost the same scenario as well you know I'm saying because those are the dudes with the with the charges those are dudes that got a you know I'm saying or even women you know I'm saying that have to they they take the bullets first yeah you know I mean so it's like I guess I internalize that in a way it was just like I want to be a part of this but um Also, you know what I'm saying, I don't need that level of attention. You know what I'm saying? I'm not. You just love. the music or love the art of it it's really yeah that's that's first and foremost you know i'm saying and and not the scene that surrounds it so much you know yeah so i mean i fell in love with production after i saw the first results of what i did on the drum machine you know so um and i guess production was kind of like my second love because art was my first. - Just as a whole, and when you say art, do you just mean like how you're saying you're doing photography? - Yeah. - DJing? - Painting, I mean-- - Art can be considered a lot of-- - I mean, at heart, I'm a painter. - Oh, cool. Yeah, so it's like, you know, like I won a scholarship to be able to go to school for it, painting and designing and making jewelry and all of that. You know, I made some of Dilla's first jewelry, you know what I'm saying? And so, you know, all around just a creative, I guess. Yeah. You know, and then music was probably the biggest challenge. So, of course, that's the one that I. put all my energy in. So yeah, I was actually just reading. So you ended up dropping out of school like your third year, right? I did. I'm like, damn, you could have did it. It'd be like me. I dropped out the first year. You know what? My mom said that too. So like, you're going to drop out of school to run around the world with your friends? Yes, I am. Yes, I am. So no regrets, basically. Hell no. No regrets whatsoever. You know what I mean? Like, you know, a lot of my friends that, you know, went to school. You're probably doing way better than them. Yo, like, yo, I could give them a job. You know what I mean? So it's like, you know, you got to feed your need first. You know what I mean? That's, you know, if nothing else, I learned You just got to trust that gut and do what feels right. And what kind of led me on the road was there were some problems inside of Slum Village, the same problems that would eventually break the group up. And Dilla asked me. Like, look, man, like, you're the one that's charismatic in the group. You keep everybody together. You know, I would love for you to come on the road with us to, you know, like, help hold the ship down. And I was like, man, hell yeah, I'll go. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's real. you don't have to ask me twice. Right. You know what I mean? So, you know, I dropped out or I kind of left school and just after being on the road, I just never returned. Yeah. Yeah. You can't see, you can't see what I saw. And then undo that. Exactly. It's hard to go back, especially once you're kind of already doing your own thing. You had a similar situation, right? Where it's just like you touring and doing your thing and then needing to go to work. And it's like, what am I doing here? And, yeah, just, I mean, being in that environment, you know, the whole nine to five thing. I mean, sometimes I feel bad speaking about it because I know most people, that's what they do. For sure. So no disrespect. No. I mean, you got to do what you got to do to take care of yourself. family or yourself or whatever may have you. But I do also realize as someone who considers them a creative or a free spirit, it's, yeah, like, I feel like being in that environment can kind of limit you, you know, and from what I realize, a lot of the people I worked with, they're just comfortable. You know, I, co-workers, you know, I was in that department like a year. There's people who've been in the same job for 30 years. Real talk. And it's not like it's really their passion, because no one is in it. in the cubicle saying, this is my passion. They're just saying, oh. I was born to be in this cubicle. Yeah, they're like, oh, the benefits are good or whatever. But, you know, we would have mixers where we were trying to get to know the team and people would have, would struggle to say what their hobbies even were. So it's like your whole existence kind of just becomes this job, this whole security net. And I just can't fuck with that. I definitely, definitely believe in, especially. I wouldn't say, okay, if you don't have anything lined up or any plan, I think that's like being a little extra. But if you have a plan like you, you were about to go on tour, you had something lined up, you had talent, you had skill. You know, I think anyone in that position, I would definitely say go for it. Absolutely. You know what I mean? Because you never know. And what I'm realizing also is once you kind of put yourself in that creative space just to start flowing. The inspiration is there because you're like, it's just me now. I don't got this corporation paying me or the benefits to fall back on. I got to make it happen. Yeah. It's like a gut instinct that kind of happens that puts you in a position of what they call it, fight or flee. Exactly. Yeah, so I mean, no disrespect to people that have jobs. Yeah, exactly. I always want to make that clear. Like, I get it. Yo, respect. I mean, you know what I'm saying? Somebody's got to do it. And it's not like this. thing that we do is not work. Let's be clear about it, you know what I'm saying? And I know you can add on. This is not a vacation. Uh-uh. Whatsoever. You know what I'm saying? Like, I thought that, you know, like, by not being in front of the group that I would take less hits. But it comes to find out that the job... is being in a position to take those hits. Yeah. That's the job. The job is, you know what I'm saying, like being in a spot where most people couldn't imagine the level of critics that we have, you know what I'm saying, hate and love, which I see both as the same in terms of this business, you know what I'm saying? Because nobody's going to beat you down for your opinion at the cubicle. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? The world is not going to attack you, you know what I'm saying, and have an opinion about who you are and what you are and what you're about, you know what I'm saying, from the cubicle. People like us are in those positions to take. the hits from the people at the cubicle. Exactly. You know what I'm saying? The people that take a lunch break and see what's going on on Instagram or Lipstick. And then concoct an opinion and throw something out there, you know what I'm saying, that's harmful, something that we got to go to bed with. So it's like, you know, little did I notice, you know, it's like there's no hiding in this business. The level of responsibility that we have to take for the and the things that we own up to, it doesn't go away. Yeah, especially just with the Internet. You know, like everything is so public now. You know, you really have to be careful. I mean, yeah, I've even been in positions where I maybe said something on Twitter, and it was just in a moment you're not really thinking about the repercussions, but you're like, damn, really out here lurking. They're really paying attention. And like you said, when you're in a position of influence or an artist or whatever, it's like you're that much more available. for people to just, you know, come at you. It's like they're waiting. They're waiting. They're waiting to cancel you. This is the fine line that you walk on as a person in these positions, you know. And it's a coveted position, you know what I'm saying, but also it's a very complicated one as well. There are great days that come with it and there are also days that you don't want to look at your phone. or answer your email. So those people in those cubicles that are thinking about quitting their job, put that... Put that battery in your back and smoke on that, you know what I'm saying, before you jump off the cliff. Weigh it out first. Right. Before you jump off the cliff, make a wise decision. So, I mean, what would you say would be your favorite thing about being a creative or an artist? Like, what are the plus sides to it for you? I enjoy all of it to some degree. You know, they all have pros and cons. But a couple years ago, I was in L.A. with Black Milk, and he summed it up in a way that I couldn't put words to. I was just floored by what he said. What he said was, the safest place in the world for me is in between my two speakers. And I can identify with that. highest level. The genesis of the ideas that you create, that's the best space to be in in terms of a person like myself who's a producer DJ. Because it all starts from there. That's the core of all of it. You know what I'm saying? Like that connection between you and your ancestors. You know what I'm saying? Like there are days that I go down and I sit down and I set up everything to work. And it's almost like a blink and then something's in front of me. in the room I wouldn't have known how it materialized you know I mean that's the beauty of the being able to be in that space you know I'm saying if you true to it you know to be able to create and just make you know I'm saying it's magic it really is magic you know I'm saying especially when you're able to remove yourself from the process you know i'm saying and just be just one with the music just the vehicle for your ancestors you know i'm saying like for them to be able to really come through and and communicate what needs to be said and y'all like i didn't have nothing to do with that you know i'm saying yeah so you think it's bigger than you oh man that's some things in the universe that's an understatement You know what I'm saying? Like, you know, it's like a part of the part of the goal is to, you know, I'm saying like is to be the voice to be your ancestors dream. You know what I'm saying? For us to be in a position where we can say and manifest the things that they would have us do that. they not in a position to do so you know like with that that ain't that ain't no joke you know what I'm saying like yo you don't you don't play with that you know what I'm saying that's a real that's a real responsibility you know what I'm saying and then ultimately you got a responsibility to the people that buy your products as well you know what I'm saying I also feel like that yo like I can't if I'm gonna ask you to pay for it or even take the time out of your day to listen to what I'm doing, I got to muster up the best that I can give to you at this time. I got to give you my 500%, you know what I'm saying? So would you say that in terms of your work ethic, are you a 500% type of guy? I think that's another statement as well. I'm dedicated. I was going to say, because you'd be like, man, this guy be working. You're in the studio. It's like submerged, 6 a.m. You're like in there going out. I'm like, damn, okay. But that's cool. 5 a.m., 6 a.m. Oh, okay. So you had, like, you had one of those nights last night. I don't have on these sunglasses to try to look cool. You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm really trying to monitor this sun that's coming in here. But I will say that, you know what I'm saying, like, at this level, I feel like, you know what I'm saying, like, we are, people like us are, like, athletes. You know what I'm saying? Like what you put into your body or what you put into your diet in terms of your mind and what you're eating and who you're around directly affects what you manifest. And then ultimately, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I mean, I couldn't imagine that how I think. It's probably any different than how Kobe would have thought. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, what do I need to do in order for this, a greater level of mastery inside of what I'm doing? Exactly. Yeah. And what do I need to do to get there? And I definitely agree. Just like you said, I mean, it's kind of like a duty. to your ancestors, but it's also, to me, it's like a duty for those who come after us. You know what I mean? Like we said, there's not a lot of Wajids in the world. Ash Lawrence, for that matter. Yeah, for sure. So it is important because, I mean, I think we're positive figures and I think in the black community we need more of that, especially being in the realm of electronic music. Absolutely. I used to not really think about race as much when it came to dance music. I think just maybe because I was younger. wasn't as aware for sure but once I started DJing and just becoming aware and we're also living in the Trump era you know there's everything so many things yeah my way of you know just my motivation in life is is so different um but I think we do kind of have a duty just to like to be the best we can be for sure you know I know that sounds like typical and cheesy but yeah yeah You realize, though. It's not a party. Yeah, and then you realize how the small things you do actually do affect people. You know, I'm sure you've gotten an email or a message from someone just saying how much you inspire them or how one thing you said or did, you know, helped them change their life. And that's when you realize, like, yo, this shit is bigger than me. This is no joke. You know what I'm saying? And also what you realize in addition to what you said is that. you know, it's like the core of this job is a job of service. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, you know, you think that you, you know, that, you know, you're going out there and you're playing those records. You're not playing those records for you. Yeah. You're playing those jobs. You're playing those records for... the people that want to forget about how they had a shitty week. Exactly. Or you plan for those people, you know what I'm saying? That were in that cubicle all week. That were in that cubicle all week. You know what I mean? Like, yo, let me get out of here. Let me feel better about what's going on. And then you also plan for those people that don't have a community. You know what I'm saying? Those people that have been. you know what I'm saying, beat up and, you know, kicked out and they don't feel like they're a part of anything. Exactly. You know what I'm saying? So it's like. The job is, I won't say job, but the responsibility is greater than yourself. You know what I'm saying? It's greater than just a couple drinks and some drugs and everybody go home. It's like we're part of a community. Yeah, you're telling a story also. If you're good at it, yeah. Right. I don't know about everybody, but I am. You know what I'm saying? You know what I mean? Ditto. You know what I mean? So, yeah. But, yeah, it's some, you know, I don't mean to make it all heavy. Yeah, no. I mean, no, it's cool. Just live your, speak your truth. For sure. Yeah, I mean, I don't want people out there to be thinking like, you know what I'm saying? Like, it's I can't DJ tonight because I don't feel responsible. You know what I'm saying? It's not. I don't want to fail my ancestors. Yeah, true, true. So. Your name, Wajid, means finder or seeker? Revealer, yeah. Or revealer. Same. Does that play a role into your existence at all, like knowing that your name is that? Yeah, my full given name is El-Azim Wajid Abdullah. Okay. The mighty revealer, humble servant of the Most High. Okay. It's a lot, right? Yeah. I'm basic as hell, my name. You're good. You're good. But, you know, it's like, so with the attribute that was given to me, you know what I'm saying, it's like I always had the ability to kind of see things before they happened. And even as a kid, you know what I'm saying, I would tell my father, like, Daddy, you know, like, I started working in my father's truck when I was about eight or nine. I remember there was one time that I told him, don't drive down a street. And I was so convincing that I managed to make him believe, like, okay, I shouldn't drive down this street. Like something was about to go down. Yeah. And sure enough, you know what I'm saying, we were at home later on the news that day, and there was an explosion on that street about the time that we were driving. Wow. You know what I mean? And, you know, it's like I've had I've been given the ability to see things before they happen. And it also explains my transitions in music as well. You know what I'm saying? For me going from a person that was primarily making hip-hop to whatever I was making in between that and to dance music at this moment. You know what I'm saying? I've always been able to see things. before they manifest. Okay. So I was given that name by an elder in my community, and I would say he did all right. He did a pretty good job in terms of... Yeah, it worked out. I'm seeing stuff that I don't want to see. Thanks a lot. Well, let me know if you see anything negative. Let me know if I need to not go down this street. No, no, but you know it's not all negative. A lot of it's good. You know what I'm saying? And actually most of it is good. You know what I mean? But we'll talk later. Yeah, so. So you did speak on the transition a little bit, and I'm sure you get this question often, but you were a hip-hop guy. Your roots are Slum Village, official DJ. How did you get into dance music? When were you, I guess, properly well-versed? Like, oh, techno started in Detroit. This is the culture of my city. And how did you get an interest? You know, I was introduced to techno. And actually, oddly, it's the basis of my new LP. My new LPS car is a high-tech jazz. And my first memories of high-tech jazz was my father driving me to school down 75 Freeway South. And we would listen to Timeline. That was made by Matt Mike Banks. classic historical Detroit song. If you're from here, you know that song. You know that song like you know the back of your own hand. Sped up, of course, though, because they didn't play it slow on the radio. I never knew that. We didn't know that. We only knew the legit version. Right. The 140 or the 150 version. Yeah, yeah. EPMs. But my introduction, like most people's introduction who are from Detroit. to high-tech jazz or even jazz was that song. This genre was made by Matt Mike Banks from Underground Resistance. And they made Timeline. They made Galaxy to Galaxy. They made, I think it was three or four, I think he told me it was four albums that were considered to be high-tech jazz. Inside of high-tech jazz, as you know, is everything. It's jit music, it's techno, it's soulful, you know what I'm saying? It's jazz, it's all of these things. So I guess to answer your question is that I've always kind of been a student of the bastard styles of music. that you know the ones that don't the styles that don't have an origin or a father and i think my first manifestation of that is when i did a track called tron i made tron I think it was on my first LP that I put out on my label, which was probably about the time that you left Detroit, the mid-2000s. Yeah. So that was my first effort to kind of connect these bridges. And I mean... And what made you want to do that, just kind of being around it? And you're like, hey, let me try something. Try something else. I mean, you know, I get bored really quickly. But more importantly, it was something that I felt that was pushing my hand to be a person that was a connector, that connect these. Bridging those gaps. Bridging the gaps. You know what I'm saying? As my father would say, put some paint where it ain't. Yeah. You know what I mean? So, yeah, I always felt like. a greater need to like, I mean, music is not, music is, it's sound design, right? So it's like, what are you, what are you going to make that's not there? Exactly. You know what I'm saying? Like, you know, it's like, it's enough to, it's easy to copy and paste. But what are you going to create that actually is the next genre or something that connects genres together or something that is the seed to create something that will grow and become something else? So I've always had that term, that type of. Perspective in terms of you never wanted to be just one way never never you know I'm saying even active at the expense of my career You know I mean like a lot of a lot of guys. I know that still making hip-hop You know I'm saying they got a whole lot more money than me. You know I'm saying but in my opinion I feel like you know like What they're doing is fucking stagnant. You know what I'm saying? And it hasn't had any growth within the last 10 years. If we come to this planet, you know what I mean? We should graduate from baby food. Yeah. And a lot of them motherfuckers are still making baby food. Yeah. You know what I mean? So do you think they're just comfortable because they're making the money? And do you think it's just not, like, innovative anymore? I think that people, you know, sometimes, you know, like, when they take this responsibility of making music and they start thinking about, you know, like, they want their children to go to private schools and they want... you know, lower insurance and they want to move out of the city and you know what I'm saying, like they want their girlfriend to have Gucci belts and shit, you know what I'm saying? You know what I mean? I'm talking shit, but there ain't no disrespect. But it is at the same time. It's just like when people kind of normalize, when eccentric people become normalized, they start making normalized decisions. And then the first thing that suffers is the music. Yeah, the actual art. The actual art itself. The thing that you will... put on this planet to do is this thing that suffers the most. So, you know, and, you know, I mean, I can't knock the hustle, man. I mean, you know what I'm saying? Like, Gucci belts is cool if you in the Gucci belts. You know what I'm saying? But, you know, it's like, I'm not, man, fuck a Gucci belt. I'm not here for that. I can't sustain you. Yo, like, yo, like. And even, you know, you get one Gucci belt, now you need another. Because there's going to be another one that comes out next week. They're going to hit you with five iPhones in a year. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, okay, like, there needs to be a point where it's just like, what's going to prevail in my life in terms of how I'm thinking and where I want to be? So with that being said, it's just like it's our responsibility to push. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? And, you know, it's not an easy responsibility because, again, you know what I'm saying? Like I certainly have gotten a generation of haters, you know what I'm saying, that have said YG should not be moving. He should not be doing this. He should be making hip-hop or he shouldn't be making dance music. You know what I'm saying? I get that. almost daily. Well, I mean, yeah, I like being involved in dance music. I mean, I guess I'd say I like the community that it brings. It's definitely different from that hip-hop circle. I mean, I don't know what's hip-hop circle. I don't know the people specifically, but even me, when I first moved to Atlanta, I was just kind of hanging out on the Atlanta scene. I knew about House being from Detroit, but I couldn't even find a house. scene in Atlanta when I had first moved there. You couldn't. It wasn't there. Yeah, well, I mean, I think it was. there but it was also like that you know there wasn't Instagram there wasn't Facebook events like so you couldn't easily find it like Kai and there are some people doing stuff but it was still a smaller scene I was new I'm a little younger than that crew but basically just being in that hip-hop world and that trap music and hanging around my friends like and that scene like you said I just I can't really relate with them anymore you know what I mean and I actually hung out with a friend recently from, well, she's from Yaktown. She's from Yaktown. Yeah. What up, though, Yaktown? I mean, damn, I hope she doesn't listen to this, but I mean, it's nothing against her. She probably won't. But, you know, we were just kind of friends when we were on that trap music rap scene. And I just realized, you know, being involved in dance music and the culture, it just resonates with me more. I just like being around different types of people, people that are more open to things. I just feel like that hip-hop thing can get so close-minded, and it's all about brands and, you know, like, stunting for the gram. It can be, yes. Agreed. I guess any genre of music can be like that. Stagnant. Just overall, you know, I just like to be around people who, like you said, just want to push the envelope, don't want to get comfortable. are open to new things, you know. You just want to be innovative, not just a basic motherfucker doing the same shit that everyone else is, listening to the same stuff as everybody, you know, just, I don't know. Part of the school of progressive thought. Yeah. And that's just not, that progressive thought doesn't stop with just music. You know what I'm saying? It's how you think. It's who you... who you sit around. It's the books that you read. Exactly. It's the places that you chose to go, that you choose to go. The music you listen to. All of that, you know what I'm saying? So it's like no limitations. Yeah. I mean, I think being one way can limit you. I think also just listening to one type of music can limit you. You know, some of the music I listen to now, mainstream, it's just so negative. And I'm just like, fuck We'll see you next time. I don't want to hear that shit. I'm getting it now, though. I'm getting it because I'm like a real-ass adult now. And I'm just like, if I had kids, I wouldn't want them listening to this. There's no positive messages or images. But, you know, I think also to touch on your point, I think that there's a misconception about people that could even read the title card for your show. You know what I'm saying? Black underground. You know what I'm saying think that that a person that has a show like this is is is limited in terms of how you think or they would i think that would be a shock to to a lot of people that would even maybe even listen to what we're saying is in in all this conversation that we've had about being black being from detroit you know i'm saying i think that those conversations um are not things that are limiting you What they're actually doing is they're opening you up to your brilliance. And then ultimately, that allows you to see the brilliance of others. Exactly. That are not just black. Exactly. Oh, I mean, yeah, I've had people like, oh, I mean, I'm white, but I really love your show. Like, it's fine. Like, yeah. I mean, just because you're celebrating, you know, your culture obviously doesn't mean you're saying fuck everyone else's culture. And I think it's fine, you know, if you're a woman and you want to celebrate women, you know, wherever you're from or whatever you want to celebrate, I think we're all entitled to do that. Yeah. Especially people coming from marginalized communities. There it is. You know, it's our right. It's our right. And it's a reason why that position is being held, you know, and that point of view is being held. It's really adding to, we're really adding to what's not there. It's not just it's not just holding a position for the sake of holding a position to say like black, black, black, black, black. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? It's it's actually adding to the larger the larger culture that's not accepting to that at all. So, like you said, it's our right. And most of all, it's our responsibility. It definitely is. I mean, just educating people through a simple platform. I mean, I have family members. I definitely have family members that are familiar with dance music, you know, from Detroit. They know Jeff Mills, you know, things like that. But there's also family members who are from born and raised in Detroit of mine that don't know anything. It's crazy, right? They're like, oh, my God. you do you know they don't say shit and then they see your tour flyer and they're like in your wait what's going on i mean i mean at my last family event i was like kind of explaining um to one of my older cousins she's like a city council member in detroit and she didn't really know too much about uh dance music at all but She may probably know Timeline. You know what I mean? So, I mean, I think just the education, you know, educating people on, I mean, in my position on Detroit, on black people and dance music. I think it's important, even like these conversations we're having. It's been kind of mind-blowing to see that it's like the content isn't in vain. You know, sometimes you create something, you may make a song, and you're like, oh, whatever, they ain't going to like this shit. Yeah, that's what I was thinking about Shango. They ain't going to like this shit. Yeah, and then people go crazy. And people went ape shit over that. Exactly. Yeah, I thought to myself, like, man, like, you know, this is just for me and this is... You know, a lot of even making Shango, I'm not the author of it. You know what I'm saying? A lot of those were dreams that I had that was being sent to me from my ancestors like, yo, you need to do this. This needs to be there. This needs to sound like this. And, you know, you never know what people are going to connect to. You know what I'm saying? So it's your responsibility. to put everything that you got into that moment because you just never know. Or maybe they'll like it later, which is a lot of things that happens too. They don't like it, but 20 years from now, y'all going to be like, this is the conversation I've been having about Dilla, about Dilla, you know what I'm saying? About, you know, how people just didn't connect to it. It was otherworldly. Some people are like, you know, they're ahead of this shit I would consider myself one of those people. Spaceships don't look backwards. Exactly. They don't fly backwards. So, I mean, what have your experiences, you know, since we're on the whole black topic and this is Undergone in Black, you being a black man in electronic music, what has that experience been for you? I mean, does your blackness play into your experience being in dance music? I imagine so. But, you know, it's not it's just like, you know, it's not the first thing that I think about when I wake up in the morning. Yeah. You know what I mean? But that doesn't mean that other people are not thinking that are thinking that for me. Yeah. So. Yeah, I would definitely say that, you know, it's strange to be the only black man on the plane sometimes. Yeah. You know, it's strange to be the only black man that's in the club sometimes. Yeah. You know what I mean? Or even, you know, in some of these spaces that I go in. You know what I mean? And there's a responsibility that comes with, like, yo, like, I got to represent my mama because my mama going to be mad. the whole world when you're that one person if I if I use the wrong fork my mama gonna be mad at me you know I'm saying she gonna feel some way that you know I'm saying like I didn't you know I'm saying like I told you Right. Like I told you when I was raising you up, you know what I'm saying? That, you know, you're supposed to go on this side. So, you know, it's like a lot of that stuff is triggered and I have to remember quick, like, yo, like tighten up, you know what I'm saying? But, you know, but you also have to be yourself. So it's like, you know, it's, it's just, um. It's complicated. Yeah. It's complicated. And I always say things when it's good and it's bad, it's complicated. You know what I'm saying? Because there's no one way to see it. There's no one way to be it. And each experience is probably not just one way. You know, there's different experiences for every tour, every gig, every person you meet. I had to learn that firsthand. Like, yo, like, you just cannot blanket any one group. any particular situation. Yeah. It's case by case, which also makes you a lot more fucking paranoid. You know what I mean? So it's like, yo, like, yo, like, are they with me? Are they against me? You know what I'm saying? Like, is, is, Is my blackness being fetishized? Yeah, like are they using me? You know what I'm saying? Or are they just cool people that just want to get down with the rhythm? But in order to be in any space inside of this business, you have to click some boxes. That's just a fact. You know what I mean? So it's like we are in the business of exploitation. Yeah. There's no ways around that. You know what I'm saying? You can't, you know, you can put a pretty color of paint on that if you want to. But, you know, like the basis and the core of this business is exploitation. Because they're trying to make money off you. People are trying to make money off your talent, you know what I'm saying, or your vision or what you have to offer or, in this case, your skin. or, you know what I'm saying, like the fact that you're from Detroit. You know what I mean? So it's like you have to move in the best way that suits, you know, not just your needs, but the people that will come after you's needs. Exactly. Does that make sense? Yeah, because you don't want to exploit yourself to the point where you're going to fuck it up for everyone else and just make it cheap. Yo, that's it. That's it. And I see it happening There's several producers, you know what I'm saying? They're just giving it up. They're like, they tried. They all like, and you kind of want to pull them aside. And I even have, you know what I'm saying? I mean, my... my bluntness is probably you know i'm saying my my worst enemy sometimes it's like yo bro you're giving it up like you need to really reconsider that you know i'm saying there'll be another one of you next month you know i'm saying and there'll be another person to replace your spot next year so you got to make it hurt a little bit you know i'm saying you you got to leave a stain you know i'm saying that makes you irreplaceable and that's also part of being forward thinking you know I'm saying in terms of the musical space because you're always needed as the person that is going to see the next thing so you can't be replaced you know I'm saying like nobody can come along inside of the business and bump you out because you're just another name to self tickets you know i'm saying it has some goofballs in there you know i'm saying taking selfies with you and shit you know i'm saying like just like i would say that you have to be as and this is a quote from man mike banks you have to be as forward thinking with your strategy as you do with the music they are the same they are the same and i think I mean, I think we run into that. It seems like a lot of people don't have a strategy anymore. They're just like, whoever likes me, who's ever going to book me, who's ever just going to give me this clout. Yeah, and I think it does kind of just cheapen yourself and the brand and the city and just music as a whole when you are just so willing to hop on every opportunity. Just to be liked. Yeah, I'm like, it's okay to say no. You know what I mean? Don't be afraid to say fucking no. I've said no to shit, or I've even talked shit about people or publications or whatever, and they've actually reached out to me to work after that. Yeah, after saying no. Yeah, you don't have to be a yes man in this industry to anyone. Know your worth and build yourself up. to that level where you do get the respect. Agreed. That was important for me early on. I've only been DJing three years. And people will be like, oh, I thought you were DJing like 10 years. I'm like, I've been in the scene for 10 years. But I just, my strategy was like, yeah, I'm not going to be some punk ass bitch. I'm not going to be. I'm not going to be some punk. I'm not going to be some yes man. She's black. Let's just pick her for this. I don't know. Like anything. Some substance. Yeah. Yeah. Anything I do or any, you know, company I work with, there's always integrity. Absolutely. behind it and I think definitely people should pay more attention to that. We live in the world of the instant satisfaction and everybody wants that attention. Everybody wants to be loved. They want to be a superstar DJ but like you said, it's okay to even fall back a little bit. Maybe let some of those other people be the stars. Let them get fucked real quick. Take your moment, you know what I'm saying, and take your beating, you know what I'm saying, and I'll see you on the other side. But like you said, you mentioned something that's very crucial in terms of integrity. You know, it's like this business don't really make or break you in terms of it just shows you who you are. Yeah. And it shows you, you know what I'm saying, like what you built, how you built, what cloth are you cutting? from you know I'm saying so it's like I always you know like my uncle asked me he's like you know like what's it what's it like being on the road And I said to him, it's tougher than being on the street. And he's like, well, what do you mean? And I said, well, if a person approaches you with a gun and robs you in the street, that gun is a courtesy. It's like do this or else. But in this business, we're not offered that courtesy. We don't have that courtesy at all, actually. You know what I'm saying? It's kind of like. It's kind of like you could be robbed or be taken advantage of you or people could just be cutting a little bit off you every time that they see you. You would never even know until you ain't got no money left. Yeah, until you look up. Until you're like, yo, what happened? You know what I'm saying? Like, yo, how did I? I've been doing this for 20 years and I ain't got no assets. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, yeah, this business is complicated to say the least. It's, you know what I mean? How can I fault the homie, you know what I'm saying, for making the same shit, you know what I'm saying, so that they can keep their lights on? I can't really be mad, but, you know what I'm saying, that's also a dude that if we was in the street, he would be the first to tell. You know what I mean? So it's like I can't be mad at you because that's how you made, you know what I'm saying? The goal is to always just be looking for your tribe, indirectly be looking for your tribe. Who are the people that's going to be straight when the position is like, yo, everything laying on you. How are you going to handle that? How are you going to take them bullets? today you know i'm saying i guess lastly what uh what is some advice you would give um to some future artists getting involved in production or djing um i would suggest that you prepare yourself yeah anybody's gonna tell you you know i'm saying like you know like um You know, like think about your marketing skills. You know what I'm saying? Think about the social climbing aspect of the business. I'm not going to tell you that. What I am going to tell you is that you need to prepare your spirit for what you're about to deal with. Prepare your mind, your mental stability. Again, it's like if this business, the results you're going to get out of this business is the result of your character. of person that you built what are you built on what are your what are your bottom lines like you know I'm saying like how far are you willing to go you know I'm saying for the desired effect these are questions that you need to be having with yourself before you even get to that crossroad you know I'm saying so that you can actually handle it with a certain level of grace and a certain level of a greater level of responsibility. So I would say that to people, you know what I'm saying? I know that's a heavy thought, you know what I'm saying? And it could be considered heavy, but. that's the truth because you know it's like once you get what you asked for are you prepared to handle it yeah you know i mean like i got homies that say to me all the time like you know i'm saying like man you lucky and you know i'm saying like you know like you You know, like you're traveling all the time, but it's like you may not be built for that, bro. Yeah. You may not be built for it. You stand in front of 5,000 people and then you at the hotel alone. Are you prepared for that? You know what I'm saying? Like, how are you built? Stuck in the airport for hours, tired, hungry. You mix fatigue with fame and drugs and alcohol. and you imagine what you're going to get. Are you prepared for that part of it? You know what I mean? So it's like that's what I would suggest. Prepare your mental and your spiritual fortitude for what you're asking for. And make sure you want this shit. Make sure you want it. You know what I mean? Because, you know, like the business is built off people who crack and, you know, Lindsay Lohan. Yeah. Man, we're going to be shaving our heads off soon. Word up. Word up. Thank you for having me. Yeah, well. I know it took a little while for us to get here, but, you know. Yeah, no. Thank you so much for coming to speak to me. You know, Underground and Black for life. For life.

You know what I'm saying? Like is Mad Mike Banks. You know what I'm saying? And I'm grateful for his mentorship. But most of all, it's friendship. And also, the same applies for Aunt Fiddler. I want to give my brother and my friend, Aunt Fiddler, a big shout out. And I want to say that I know that your mentorship and your friendship kept me out of those prisons. And I'm grateful for it.
