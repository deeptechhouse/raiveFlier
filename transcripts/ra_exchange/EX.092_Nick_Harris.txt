Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Nick Harris just wants to run a label, and he did so for 15 years. NRK Music, though, will largely shut its doors soon, with the compilation release celebrating its lengthy run as one of the finest house labels to emerge from Bristol. Harris' work as a DJ, producer, and label manager will be replaced by his new job. of DJ, producer and label manager. Harris has three labels in the early stages of life and plenty on his mind as he winds NRK down. That's why we felt it important to grab him for a chat when he visited Berlin recently, as he starts a new chapter in his career in electronic music. So NRK is... it's over. It's done. It's ending. We ran a news piece on it and... It's not actually, it's a massive scam to sell more units and it's all a lie. No, it's... It's come to an eventual end. Is that right? It's come to its eventual end. Yeah, 15 years is a long time, you know? It is. And... It's been something that I have been thinking about, obviously, for a while. But, you know, to run a label, you've got to keep rolling out good music, you know, and projects and albums. So it seems to me, from the outside looking in, though, it seems... Obviously, I know the economic situation right now, but it seems like you have a lot of projects on the boil. Like there's a global back-in-the-box thing. Yeah, I mean, the last three years especially have probably been the busiest that it's ever been. And in the last three years, it's actually been myself on my own now because three years ago there was a change of... and you know little businessy things like that and ultimately I came forward running the company solo and in the last three years yeah the the lab series was launched with the Loka Dice CD back in the box had a was already around but there was the DJ sneak and obviously there were singles. So yeah, it's been a really busy three years. But I think I was sitting down to do this 15th anniversary album, and obviously when you've got a project like that. you are seriously digging in your that tape crates and you're kind of assessing all that you've got and you're thinking a lot more about, you know, the label and what it's put out. And I think it was, that was perhaps this album, the Forever Underground album was probably almost a tipping point to say, well, You've done a lot. A lot's been achieved in 15 years. And maybe now is the time to carry on with some other things, you know. And not close the label, not, you know. The label hasn't folded. It's not gone bust or anything like that. I just feel that it's done its thing. It's had some great successes and some not so great successes over 15 years. And, you know, just stop putting out music on NRK as a brand. You know, there are some negative facts. that creep into something like this. When you've been running 15 years, it's hard to keep people's interest in something. - One of the things that you said at the end of an interview in, I guess it was November, that I found really interesting is you kind of shouted out all of these labels like, drum code and peace frog and soma that you know have been at it for years and the media myself included sometimes it's just sort of like we forget yes in a way because you know you're always looking on the other hand yeah i mean i think more than ever that the industry has changed massively over the last few years and everybody knows it you know the physical sales the digital sales and a new generation of you know people making the music and buying the music you know it's it's almost two-tiered now you know it you know house music is now old enough to actually the scene still contains the original people who were playing and promoting and then it contains quite frankly what could be their children you know i mean it's that it is house music 25 years 30 years you know it's it's holding a lot of people in there now you know and so definitely i i look at other labels that are in my situation or in terms of years in the business. And, you know, I've got nothing but utmost respect for them because I know how hard it is to keep something running for a long time and to contain people's interests. And yes, you know, we... Not everyone can have a 15-year spotlight on them. Most record labels start up with a fanfare, with a slew of releases of buzzing stuff and everyone's on it, the media's onto it. You know, there's youthful exuberance, there's, you know, hunger, desire. And that's when a label has their honeymoon period, I call it. Now, after a couple of years, there's other record labels coming along, you know. And for labels like myself and Soma and Free Range and Drum Code and Peace Frog, we've all had our moments in the spot. and then you get your moments in the dark, you know. That's when the real hard work begins, you know. That's when, you know, running a label involves running a label. And something that I find nowadays is that, and it's probably because of the economics of the scene, but, you know, we used to run labels. That's what we did. run a record label. Didn't do anything else. I didn't have time because running a record label was full time, you know? You obviously have vinyl production, CD production, releases, sub labels, physical distribution. There was a lot to do. It was a full time job. Fast forward 15, 20 years. Now it's like people are running labels, making the music, doing their own artwork, doing their own PR, doing their own distribution. And it's not necessarily about playing up to what you're most skilled at, you know. And so, so yeah, I feel that. some of the older labels, they started out as proper record labels. I'm not sort of saying that new labels in this era are not proper record labels, but certainly it's a different dynamic. And so, yeah, I just felt 15 years, it's reached its thing. I've got other things happening anyway. I'm not folding or closing, you know. But I think that the time has come for the NRK brand to, you know, take its place in history, get on with some other stuff, you know. Going back to what you said, what are you most skilled at? What am I most skilled at? Out of all those things that you mentioned. I mean, I'd say... I like to think I'm a pretty organised person. And my skill was running a record label. And, you know, we could run it with our eyes closed sometimes. You know, we've had so many years of practice at it. It's being organized and juggling a lot, juggling people as well. I mean, artists, bless them. Yeah, they're not the most organized people. And 15 years later, problems are still there. Deadlines are never met. Compilation, track listings are changed at the 11th hour, licensing nightmare. But hey, my skill is dealing with that. making the finished products available and everything connected to it, the press, the distribution, all wrapped up. Now, 15 years later, I'm not just doing that. I'm obviously having a go at everything else now because that's how... the industry has changed um do you feel annoyed that you know you can't just do what you think you're best at run a record label it's just not economically feasible it's i mean i try not to get annoyed because you know i try and you know turn uh turn a negative two negatives into a positive or whatever it was alan Partridge said. Yeah, I mean, of course, we'd all like to have no change whatsoever. You know, I'd still want to sell 15,000 copies of a record, you know, spitting out 5,000 copies of a 12-inch on a sub-label, you know, just bang like that, you know. But times have changed. Running a record label, for me, has stopped. being necessarily a full-time thing. I did want to start writing my own music as well. I mean, this dates back to pre, my interest in house music. Before that, I was in bands. And so I've always had a creative side to me. You know, I've written music in the past. When I had a little bit more time, obviously, with running the company on my own and, you know, not really doing as much vinyl anymore and the albums were getting less and less, you know, spread out. So, yes, I had more time on my hands and I thought, well, you know, if you can't beat them, join them, you know, get a bit of kit together. indulge myself in in writing some music and um what kind of bands were you in back i was in i was in like a hardcore punk band in bristol in the late 80s okay we were called the garage mutants it's a good and uh solid we were yeah we were we were some gnarly brattish crusty punk vibes. We played in Bristol a lot. We actually had some good gigs. We used to play with bands like Fugazi. We had more hans like Napalm Death, which is obviously a world away from Frankie Knuckles. Stuff like that. Music is me. It's in me. I was in bands while still at school. We did the classic route of your first gig is at the house concert. It was shocking, all the teachers and parents, when we ran out doing our cover versions of Sex Pistols records. So, you know, I've done music ever since school and leaving school, went straight into setting up NRK, first as a DJ agency and then the label in 96. When you first heard electronic music, was it this energy is so similar to the same sort of energy I'm getting in a Fugazi show? It wasn't musically, it wasn't necessarily the energy. It was, I mean, my first taste of electronic music was probably when I moved up to London to go to Polytechnic in '92, I think. And... Hearing stuff like The Orb and Jar Wobble. I mean, being in London, you had Kiss FM, so you had Colin Dale, Colin Favour playing, you know, obviously techno. But also, I mean, I guess the first stuff I got into was more the mellow stuff, you know, Future Sound of London, Apex Twin, Selected Ambient Works, that thing. So that was my first taste of electronic music and added to the fact that I'd left Bristol and my band, all that had finished very quickly. It was a no-brainer. It was like, okay, no more being in a punk band. This is amazing. This is next level stuff. I found the philosophy of, obviously once I sort of researched it a bit more and got into it, I found the philosophy was very similar to how I was working with punk and bands, you know. I used to promote gigs as well. And obviously I could see that, you know, guys, girls similar to me were promoting parties, you know. Same ethos, you know, that DIY ethic, you know. And definitely that enabled myself and a guy called Reg who I set the company up with. You know, we definitely, everything was that DIY thing. It's like you wake up one day and you think, you know. we need to run a record label. It's like, yeah, let's do it. We need to, we want to see this DJ from America. Should we just ring him up and like say, look, you know, we'll fly you over and we'll make it happen. But when was like the, I find it so interesting that, you know, it started as a DJ agency because I like, it's, as I said, I'd moved up to London. And my best friend Reg was still in Bristol. Reg is half Canadian. And just randomly, bizarrely, his grandmother lived on the same road as John Aquaviva in Place A. And so Reg would... would go to Canada, you know, in the summer to visit his relatives. And he, you know, he was the same as me. We were both getting into electronic music. And so he'd be in Canada, Ontario, London, Ontario, and he'd go into a record store and he'd bring me up and he'd be like, hey, there's this record shop and there's all this electronic music. guess what? I met the guy who runs the record label plus eight, you know, because it was obviously a very small scene over there as well, you know? Um, and it was simply that connection and the, so in the idea of, you know, well, you've just met John from plus eight and they may well have had a conversation about the. UK you guys from the UK you know what you do in the UK so well we're promoters and we were promoting obviously sort of punk gigs prior to that but our love of electronic music it was a no-brainer was like well hold on a sec well then let's see if we can do what we did with promoting bands with this guy here And obviously it's a while ago now, so obviously the memory gets a bit hazy, but yes, John came over to London with Richie Horton and we organised some gigs for them, simple as. At that time, but we were so young, we had no fear. You would get on the phone, you would ring up a promoter. You didn't know who the hell this person was, but you'd have no fear. You'd ring up and you'd say, hi, we've got John and Richie in the country. What are you saying? Do you want to have them on your club? And through that, it very, very quickly started to develop from there because John and Richie ran the IntelliNet distribution P&D for labels like Derek Carter had a label run through them. Nick Holder's D&H was run through them. The Stickman, Stickman Records. So instantly we had... this network that we could pull. And John Aquaviva was most generous with his time and advice. And he'd be like, here's Derek Carr's number. I'm sure he'd love to chat with you guys. And it was as simple as that, you know. And so, yes, very quickly we put an agency roster together. And that was what we were doing then. You know, we were booking agents, you know. And it was, you know, they say it's a cliche, right time, right place. But it was a good time for us to set that up because all of a sudden we had, I mean, Richie had another agent anyway, so he wasn't technically on our books. But we did, you know, push a few things happening here and there. But, you know, so very quickly we had. the Canadian crew so John Stickman Nick Holder and then through those guys we had people like Mike Huckabee from Detroit we hooked up a few gigs for him and then we hooked up with Derek Carter in Chicago and through him we hooked up with the Casual Relief Lot and Gemini and all these guys So it was a great networking time, you know, and the music was definitely, I mean, obviously it wasn't house music's first wave, you know, this was, you know, 93, 94. So it was definitely that kind of renaissance period, you know, when obviously casual and relief was blowing up. So we would get all the Chicago guys and the plus eight thing was happening. And obviously in the UK as well, you know, there was, it was a good time for new clubs. You know, you had... Clubs like Hard Times in Leeds were opening up and obviously clubs like Back to Basics had been around. But, you know, they took our roster with open arms. They were like, right, we'll have these, these, you know. It seems like a lot of the DJs you're mentioning, I'm thinking Back to Basics must have been enormous. Yeah. And then obviously we had, you know, through John was Ian Pooley. in Germany and because Ian's used to do stuff with Definitive so we started to get a European network very quickly as well and you know me and Ian are still very very good friends to this day which is really nice you know because actually we're about one month apart in age so we've kind of we've come up through this together you know But it was great. The agency was very quick off the ground and it's very quick to build this real big roster of artists. And the club scene was ripe at the time. People were a bit more open to, you know, booking guest DJs. And, you know, we started to go even further to other genres. You know, we had like, you know, sort of New Jersey garage guys. You know, we'd have Kenny Carpenter on the roster, Lenny Fontana, you know, and then we'd have Claude Young, Shake. we had Larry Hurd, we had Carl Craig, you know, it was unstoppable, you know, and we definitely, NRK's reputation was definitely built on that time, you know, but funny enough, it was through the clubs, it was through promoters, you know, and I still meet people to this day that's like, I remember the NRK DJ agency, you know. And you booked us, you know, yeah, we had Larry Hurd play at Club 69 in Paisley or something crazy like that, you know. So that was how the company was first known and first started. You mentioned that the club scene was doing quite well at the time. What about in Bristol? In Bristol, well... Because, you know, house music is not... I mean, I've gone on record as saying this once, so I'll say it again. You know, house music wasn't necessarily big in Bristol. Yeah. And that's not a bad thing, you know. Hey, if every city had the same music scene, it'd be a... place you know but Bristol had its drum and bass thing going on and obviously has a long history of you know reggae and blues and bass bass sound but I've I certainly find that yes there were there were clubs they were promotes or house people but it wasn't really art where we were at The house would always tend to eek towards the handbag variety, say, or the slightly progressive, in my opinion. And then the techno was always, because the West Country is well-renowned for free party scene, you see, and Bath and Bristol were very big on the free party scene. So the techno was a bit to that side, a bit free party, a bit, you know. Krusty, if you would. And I actually used to bring some of the DJs to Bristol on the roster. So I'd put parties on with Gemini, Richie Horton, Ian Pooley, Derek. Carter and you know we'd have a couple of hundred people and you know it never really for me it never really was a house thing in Bristol you know I mean the hot spots for me were obviously London Birmingham was good Leeds Manchester Sheffield Nottingham was a really good place for for our roster and and so in my mind you know this very international internationally flavored house scene you know but bristol it had its other things going on you know which we weren't necessarily part of who was the most surprising dj i mean you brought him over you were like I did not expect this. Nobody really surprised. I mean, there were some funny encounters, you know, I mean, we'd have, I mean, I remember doing a few bookings for Carl Craig and Carl was. super super nice guy but effectively he retired from djing on our last date i remember sitting in a car with him at a service station he basically just said to me i'm just not into it and that was public at the time anyway so you know he he did retire from djing i think you know this would have been late 1990s you know he i think he probably had enough or wasn't super into doing the gigs he was doing. I don't know, but he effectively retired on me. The world at that time, not from production. And then you'd have like crazy stuff like we did some bookings for Steve Silk Hurley. And again, he was a super nice guy, but you kind of expected him to come over kind of knowing what to do. unfortunately came over with not many records and then asking me what should I play can you take me to a record store and like buy me some records to play and I was like damn we've we've got this one a bit wrong you know um so we had to quickly cobble Silk Hurley some a set together um for him to play Was there any surprises? What was Gemini like? Gemini was, and others have said it before, and I shall back them up, he was the best DJ. He was absolutely amazing. And I still take with, in what I do as a DJ, I have my little, you know. I have my little signature, you know, couple of records that Spencer used to mix together. I still do that myself, you know, because it's awesome. Gemini was amazing. And it's obviously been documented that, you know, he's decided to... you know, just leave the industry, leave, you know, society for whatever reason. But my time with him, it was just laughter all the way, you know. He was such a fun guy. Obviously, I understand he would have his downs as well as his ups. And I guess fortunately for me, he was always an uptime with him, you know. But he was an... Absolutely amazing DJ. How did he DJ? Like, what was it like that made it so... Well, I mean, at the time for me, I was... Because I was also looking after Derek Carter as well. So, obviously, they were best buddies. And I used to really love what both of them did. I could definitely kind of separate the two, you know. Spencer was just way more... I don't know whether daring is the word. Derek was technically out of this world and he'd be very groovy and he'd do some really clever stuff. But Spencer would just push it that one bit further. He'd ride an acid track over... a Steve Silk Hurley sort of vocal dub, a Kraftwerk track. He was all about just totally throwing loads of things into a melting pot. And obviously Derek was known for that as well. You know, Derek would kind of jack the acid with a vocal and, you know, do some double copies and all this. But Spencer's was way more edgier, I'd say. He'd be getting downright acidy and dirty and dark, and then he'd just be playing a sweet, sped-up garage house record. So it was the juxtaposition. And I guess for crowds on the dance floor... especially if it's late at night and you're refreshed or whatever, that can probably be quite brain melting. Just hearing those different things that you wouldn't normally put together. Spencer would do that. He'd really just slay the decks musically. He was quite daring. He was definitely, I would say, my favorite DJ. I've ever worked with. Were you already DJing when you were promoting? Did you start? Yeah, I mean, I've been DJing since it all began, really. But as I said earlier, I was running an agency. I was running a record label. So if there was an opportunity for me to do a gig, then fine, I'd do it. But yeah, I mean it wasn't really my main thing. I would do it because I loved it, you know. Plus, you know, I had the best teachers around. You know, Derek used to stay at my house and just spend hours in my room mixing and I'd just watch him, you know. And Spencer Kinsey stayed with me a lot and watched him, you know. So I had the best teachers, you know. But yeah, I mean, I wasn't, you know, a full-time DJ or anything. Unlike now. That's where we're trying to go. But yeah, the agency was a very good time and it ultimately paved way for the label. When did the agency stop? Did it stop from the label? No, the agency went all the way to probably the year 2000. And I think... Probably as NRK the label is now ending. A decision was made in 2000 that, you know, yeah, we could carry this on. We could book more DJs. We'd go through it, but... you know, sometimes, you know, you want to stop something, you know, and sort of do something else. And again, with the agency, I mean, it definitely went out on a high. I mean, I think the last few bookings we did were for Armand Van Helden, you know, five-figure sums at big Ibiza nightclubs, you know. So it wasn't as though the agency was dying a death or no one, you know, it was still solid. the label was definitely sort of off the ground and running by then. And yeah, again, maybe it's like, well, if you've got too much stuff on the go, then something's going to go wrong. You need to focus on something, you know. If you're going to run a record label, run it properly, focus on a label. And I mean, myself and Reg, I mean, we may well have employed one or two others, but we've always been a small company, you know. We've done it all ourselves and if you start juggling too many things, something goes wrong. So the agency, we just decided to wind up in 2000 and the label started, we started the label in 96, so I think technically the first release didn't come out until January 97. What was the first release? The first release was by a guy called Nelson Rosado, who used to be an A&R guy at King Street in New York. And he was one of our DJs on the agency. And he was a super nice guy. And it was just a no-brainer. It was like, we've got all these DJs. They all produce music. Let's set up a label called NRK. And let's ask Nelson to do some tracks for us. Let's ask Nick Holders to do tracks for us. So we had everybody anyway. It wasn't as though we had to sort of start with... you know, with a blank canvas, we had all these DJs that we were working with anyway. So was it a way of kind of saying, you know, through their releases, here's what you would expect? Yeah, it was definitely, it was, I mean, it wasn't consciously done like that. It was just, you know. As I say, memory always gets a bit hazy, but we didn't really think too deeply about those things. It was like, let's start a record label. And all these people, you know, so it wasn't intended to be, you know, the label of the agency because we weren't thinking like that. You know, we were just doing it. But yeah, and I've always said that the label definitely reflected what we were into, which wasn't one form of music. As the roster was, it was techno, it was... It was marriage, straight up house, it was Chicago, you know, jacking, groovy stuff. It was a lot of things, you know. And really when we set the label up, it wasn't like we are this kind of label and this is what we're going to do. It was like, it was very open A&R policy. You seem to get a reputation though, as a house label. Yeah, I mean, it's all house at the end of the day, isn't it? It all goes boom, boom, boom, boom. But yeah, I mean, we're a house label. I mean, certainly we never really put out techno records, but then there were techno artists on the label at some point. But yeah, a house label, deep house, you could say. But the first four releases were Nelson Rezard. Nick Holder, Gemini and Ian Pooley. And then the fifth one, I think, the fifth one was Freeform 5, his first production. And the sixth one was our first international license. And it was all new to us. But that was the Dimitri from Paris. Jazz in the House EP, which we licensed from King Street. Why did you need to license that or want to license it? Learning curve of a label. I mean, in those days, in the old days, it was like people, I guess people, yeah, people used to license more off other labels. I guess it was because, you know, distribution was still... a bit localized, you know. So we would, I mean, we obviously heard the track and, you know, we loved it. And business sense says, you know, Dimitri is, you know, bubbling, bubbling under. I think the saccharine blew up. was at the time. And yeah, probably definitely the King Streets in America, we're in UK. It was at a time when that was quite a sensible thing to do, you know. I think, well, that distribution might be a bit lame over here. Let's license the track, get some brand new remixes, boom, you know, and did very well. Was that a turning point, do you think? Was that sort of the first release where, okay, this label's really... Yeah, I think by that point, yeah, we were sort of well in our stride. You know, our original... records. We'd done our first kind of, you know, license from another label and getting a remix and all this. So yeah, by then we were well into our stride. And the international flavor kept on flowing. You know, I think after that there was releases by Kings of Tomorrow, who were most probably on the agency. I can't even remember. now and then a few releases after that another international license which was the Francois K time and space um again same the more I don't really think about these things anymore but yeah you know we that's what people used to do labels used to do used to license from a American label or you know well yeah always an American label because I can't remember any others But yes, you know, Francois Kay, he had his record out on WAVE, did very well. We licensed it, put a Farley and Helen remix on it, and it probably did just as well as what the WAVE release had done. So, and time and space, if anybody's not heard it, they should hear it. It's on the CD, by the way. I call it the quintessential deep house record of the 90s. I mean, it's so, it's large, you know. You know Francois has got this massive mixing desk. Forget Ableton out of the box on a Mac. FK was on his huge SSL desk. Joe Clausel was doing his bongos and it's just a massive piece of music that's definitely stood the test of time. So yeah, we were definitely flowing by this point and it was probably around this point it was like, okay, let's do albums, you know. What was the first album? The first album was a standard compilation of the first 10 releases, as you do. And then I think we very quickly were putting out a lot of stuff by Nick Holder, so Nick did. He seemed to become pretty associated with the label, I think. And the funny thing is, everybody used to think the Nick Holder run, because it was always like Nick at NRK. It was like, what, Nick Holder? Yeah. And then everybody thought that NRK was an American label. But yeah, Nick Holder was, and still is, a fine, fine man. Really, you know, talk. Talk about underground, you know. Nick is underground, you know. What was it about his sound that you thought was so conducive to the album format, specifically? I guess because he's just got that sort of mellow, mellow, deep sound, you know. But again, we probably didn't really think about it too much. But, I mean, you know, it was, you know, listening material as well as club material, you know. I mean, Nick is, you know, is great, was great at, you know, he was the sample king, you know. He'd just sample some crusty old, you know, jazz record. record and did you have to do a lot of clearing or did you clear no I've cleared one I've cleared one sample in my life and I wish I hadn't because it just cost loads of money and I bet you the original artist never got the money in the first place you know but yeah Nick Nick was Nick was great and and I don't know I'd like to think that you know nick had an influence on you know some of the other guys that were making that very deep sound you know even sort of stuff like moody man even though it's the same time but they were both they were both in that same ballpark making you know sample based sort of music for the heads and didn't really change an awful lot. It was just about getting that groove, you know, and riding it along. And, you know, Nick's albums were always good because we'd always have a couple of singles on each album. and as his work progressed, he'd start getting in vocalists, and he was growing as an artist. So Nick did about three albums for us. And then in around about 2000, that was when we first started doing compilation albums, which, you know, it wasn't as though no one else had done them before, you know, it was just, okay, let's do this now, you know, it's another, it's all. another little market we can get onto, you know. Again, because we were running the singles tidily, you know, every, you know, it might have been one or two, you know, duff releases, but we'd like to think that it was all consistent, you know. Everything was rolling along, then we'd have the albums that we'd do your singles from. remixes and then we did the Nightlife mix CD series in 2000 and they were great because from an A&R perspective it's almost like being sort of gifted loads of ideas from somebody else you know I mean the first Nightlife CD was John Marsh which was great but the second CD was by H Foundation And that track list alone was just like a world into a whole new area of producers from the West Coast scene. You hadn't known. That we hadn't known. you know so when we did that H Foundation compilation we were doing we were doing work with H Foundation anyway at the time but by just doing that compilation you know that kind of opened us up to you know tracking down you know I think I think that's how we probably got hold of people like Rocket, which is DJ Garth. And, you know, definitely that whole sound. And around that time, NRK then became known as, you know, that label that's got all that, you know, groovy, tribally, you know, West Coast vibes to it. That label that isn't, aren't they from the US? Yeah, this is always why people think, we did have a lot of American music on the label. But yeah, we were definitely championing that sound when it first hit and we had a good relationship with H Foundation. Did it feel like you were catching something at the right moment? It was at the time to just feel like, wow. this yeah yeah i mean i think we we always we always did right from the agency days you know going right back to what we were saying earlier we caught that at the right time even though we the label still wasn't going by then but in the agency we had uh we had the the french wave we used to do bookings for motorbass which is Philippe Zadar and Essien de Cressy, and we had Dimitri from Paris. So we were on to that French thing as well. And obviously we did the Dimitri record. But yeah, so by the time we had this H Foundation West Coast thing, again, we were on to that. So we always felt like we were catching trends nicely in succession. And definitely the label would kind of morph. It would move with where it was all going. And definitely, I think probably by around NRKO 40, 41, yeah, it was all very much that sound. And then I'm trying to think what was after that. Do you feel like, you know, you said you've been morphing, but you... Do you ever feel like you lost the thread of what it was? Or what, you know, people would be like, I'm not sure. I guess. You mentioned a Pete Rock remix. Yeah, I mean, you know, and this goes with what I say now about, you know, you're running something for a long time now. And I think probably by. There was probably a period, maybe around about NRKO, you know, into the 60s and 70s, that maybe we started to get put out tougher records, you know. Tech House was, you know, was in again, you know. And by our own desire, you know, we wanted to do it. to put out those kind of records you know and i think we we started working with peace division um by the nrko 80s i mean yeah there was there was basically dark sort of tribal you know pre-minimal if you will you know and yeah maybe some of the purists who might have you know loved their nick holder records may well have looked at you know what the oh and okay he's lost it a bit they've got a bit hard for me now But, you know, you can't keep a record label running with one sign to appease, you know, some early fans, you know. We were always morphing. We were going where our gut instincts were taking us. And, you know... With success, as things build up, yeah, sometimes you make decisions that are not so well thought out as you used to do them. You mentioned the Pete Rock remix. I mean, it was a Nick Holder single. And it was called No More Dainty DJs. And it was actually getting a real good buzz. And Trevor Nelson, for some reason, started playing it on his Radio 1 show. So we were like, oh, wow, you know, this could sort of blow up. And then we took advice from a very good friend in America who said, you know, we could hook you up with Pete Rock, do a Pete Rock remix. And obviously by that point we were like, Pete Rock, yeah, you know, great. You know, how much? It's like, you know, X thousand dollars. Oh, can we get him there? You know, decisions were made, you know, on the fly. And, you know. it didn't really enhance the project, you know. But, you know, when you're at that level, you know, in a label, obviously it's, you can get caught up in starting to make some decisions that, you know, are sending mixed messages to your fan base, you know. What were some other ones you feel like you maybe wish you could have had back? You know what, I'm going to be really boring and say that there probably isn't many at all. I don't think, no. I mean, we stand by what the label's put out over these years and that haters may come and say, oh, well, they went a bit downhill from that point. Every record was signed, sealed and delivered with love, as cheesy as that may sound. It was done. It was done with the right, you know, what we wanted to do, you know. And... As I said earlier, it's hard to maintain such a long career and, you know, for every record you put out to be a winner with everybody, you know, you can't have it all all the time, you know. And it's just unfortunate that, you know, as fickle as the scene can be sometimes, you know, people like to switch on and off. with their interest in things. And certainly NRK over these years have had those moments where everyone's talking about it, no one's talking about it. More people are talking. It kind of goes up and down. And maybe I've had enough of that. I haven't had enough of music or house music. let that be known but a 15 year label is a beast you know and i think there has to be some and i'm sure you thought about this when you decided to do this compilation you still have that name though you know nrk which is like it's got to be uh tantalizing to be like I can do whatever I still want to do. If I have this name, it has at least like a base from which I can work. It must be a little bit frightening to go out and be like, I'm going to start another label. It is, I mean, certainly the decision wasn't made lightly. And, you know, maybe there's other record labels of my age as well that, you know, might listen to this and think, well, you know, they probably have the same thoughts, you know. And it's like, at what stage do you give up on... on your baby, you know, on your brand, on what you've been for so long, you know. And it's probably for the fact that I run this company solo that obviously I've not really had to, you know, get permission off of anybody else, you know. I spoke to Reg and said, look, you know, he's doing other things anyway. So, you know, he was like, he understands how... how hard it can be, you know? I think that's one of the things that, you know, like the Rolling Stones continue on tour and they have to answer to the 60 people that go on tour with them. Yeah. They would lose their job if they stopped touring. Yeah. This is a situation where you're like, I don't have to talk to anyone. Yeah, I mean, essentially, you know, the... the name the brand I mean it's mine you know and yes it is frightening to basically say you know I'm no longer going to continue with this brand but then again you know I want to try other things you know and you know maybe it's you know I could big myself up and say well yeah you know it's a bold move you know but hey I'm gonna I'm gonna take it by the horns you know and move on without you know and obviously my name will probably be forever associated with nrk anyway you know that's that's that's a given but um There's other projects I want to get off the ground. And, I mean, simply, NRK is actually, you know, today it's still going. You know, as I said, it's not closing. It's not folding. The catalogue will still be there. You know, there's albums that have just come out in the last, you know, couple of months. You know, we've got Ed Davenport's new album, which I'm still... working on we're still releasing uh some singles off of it you know still working it the lab be released in June from Paul Warford. But the news is that the NRK is no longer going to release records after the summer. The Lab CD series may well still continue. If I decide I want to continue that, then I can still roll that out. Seems like mixed compilations would be the last thing as a label. Well, yeah. Well, they are and they aren't because, as I said... I run record labels and magically I can still make a mix album work. Even though compared to the old days, the sales are nowhere near what they were. But they still work from a financial point of view. You know, little labels get little advances, new producers get their name, you know, people like it, you know. And, you know, maybe it is a dying format and, you know. the whole podcast thing and mixes and sang Clyde and everything. So all these mixes are right. It's funny though. I was listening to Dixon mix CD last night and I was, I was thinking to myself, actually like 60, 75 minutes is like somehow in amazing format. for him and other a lot of other djs it's like that limitation is actually yeah free there are people who really benefit from limitations in a way well i mean you know in terms of yeah having having one cd or two cd to basically you know maybe you're refining what your selection is going to be you know I mean, obviously, I know every DJ who compiles a lab or a back in the box or any of the previous compilation CDs we've run. Yeah, they think about it. They don't want to let themselves... dying on it you know they want to make it the best and they they do you know toil over you know their track listings why did you the lab i mean the series itself you started at what two The lab started in 2009. Basically, because I felt that the scene was massively refreshed around that time. Something else that 15 years gives you is, you know... a bit more of an understanding as to, you know, you're in it for the long haul, you know. So, yeah, sometimes the music scene goes flat. Sometimes, you know, you don't really feel like putting anything out and it's all a bit crap out there. But around that time, you know, there was, the music scene was healthier than it had been in a few years. And the good thing about have had NRK for, I mean, it's probably about 12 years old at that point, was that, you know, we could then go to an artist like Loka Dice and he'd instantly say, I love your label. I grew up with your label. We were already that old by that point. That Loka Dice would be like, I'd love to do the mixing on NRK because that record label was there for me when I first started buying records. and his compilation did very, very well, and we're very happy with it. So the lab was definitely set up to carry this new wave of artists forward. Why Paul Walford for the next one? Why Paul Walford? He's a good mate. He's a good DJ. And he's pushing the envelopes out a bit as to people's perception of him as a DJ and as an artist. And he's exploring now, you know, other... sub-genres and micro-genres, whatever you want to call them. He's really getting into this new sound. He's obviously doing a lot of gigs with the Boiler Room and I think he plays with people like Ben UFO and that kind of scene. which is a bit more looser, you know, it's not so rigidly. So, you know, this is not Paul doing, you know, sort of two CDs worth of, you know, techno or house. This is, you know, there's definitely some different vibes on there, you know. And I mean, I started talking to Paul about this kind of when I knew that he'd started to, you know, morph himself, you know, it's all about morphing, you know, as labels and artists, it's good to morph, you know, keep people on their toes. And definitely, you know, I could see Paul was making some good, good choices for him, both as an artist and... And I like the music that he likes, you know. And it was just, do you want to do a lap? Let's do it, you know. And let's do a double disc that's, you know, that, yeah, it's going to. what's going to surprise people and i think it will surprise people you know the other guy you've been working most recently with in a major way is at davenport and i wonder what it is about his music that's been so compelling to you again with with with ed's music it was a breath it was almost a breath of fresh air for me you know i've i i listen to a lot of music you know you you get you hear about these people like oh you know i work with house but i don't listen to house you know at home i don't listen to electronic music and the car you know so I listen to all the time you know because I do it you know and so you know steering a label and making choices you know what to sign which direction to go as I've said previously in this interview Sometimes the levels drop, you know, and you can't really find what you really want to put out and you get a little bit disheartened and disinterested. And Ed came along a couple of years ago and, you know, by our own admission, it was perhaps sort of embryonic in his musical style. It was quite... It was quite just, you know, techie, clubby, nothing necessarily out of the ordinary. So we did a single. a couple of years ago and then but you could hear something no i couldn't well i could i don't think i could hear the album through that single of truth be told i just liked that single and i liked ed okay that's that's something that you know always with with me you know yes i i want to put out good music but i also want to get on with the people whose music i'm putting out you know And so you'll probably hear me say, well, I like him. That's why I did it. That's why I put his record out, because I like him. That's just me. I have to have a relationship there. But Ed, all of a sudden, he said, I'm working on an album. Do you think you'd be interested in an album? And I said, well, you know, let me hear. Obviously, by that point, I was probably a bit jaded. Oh, album, go on then, you know, let me hear it. And he sent me a zip folder of a few tracks and I was just blown away. I was like, I couldn't stop playing it. Because it was a surprise for me. It was almost as though Ed had sort of overnight, he'd kind of, his skill levels had quadrupled even more. It was sophisticated. It was dense. It was all my favorite elements of techno and early techno. There's bits of breakbeat in there. And it was just very sophisticated. Strangely enough, one album that came to mind, even though it's probably nothing like it, but I was reminded of Talk Talk for some reason. When they made these very sort of expansive albums in the 80s, there was the Spirit of Eden and another album. Laughing Stuck. And, you know, those albums, you know, Spirit of Eden was quite instrumental as well. So I just remember it being really sort of expansive and, you know, very textured. And with Ed's stuff that he was suddenly coming through, I could just, that was where it was coming from for me. It was very accomplished, you know. I mean, it's not as, you know, you get some albums by artists and every track's like sounds different. You know, this sounds as though it was like not part of the same thing. Whereas Ed's Counter Change album is like from start to finish, you know, it's Counter Change, you know, every track, you know, it's just got that stamp on it. And that really excited me, you know, and. I actually haven't put out an artist album in quite a long time but when I heard even the demos of it I was like this is really really good you know I had like little ravey qualities and it was just it just reminded me and I tell you another point for that album was I'd just come off the back of working the global communication back in the box which was again you know that was a retrospective but it was very early techno and early electronica. And obviously hearing Ed's stuff straight after that was like, it was like the line had gone from that to that, you know. Ed's sound is very classic, you know, doffs his cap to the past, but it's up there with this, you know, some of the new producers in, you know. dubstep-y realms and, you know, electronic-y, you know. Let's talk about Back in the Box. I love it. I love this series. I love Back in the Box, but it's a pain in the backside, to be honest. Back in the Box was... It was an idea between myself, Reg, and Dave Lee, Joey Negro. I always wanted to do one of these... Because obviously there are many compilations out there that's like influences. You know, there's countless ones we can mention, but I won't. But I always got those albums and thought... Okay, I'm cool with knowing somebody's sort of influence, but for example, you know, I think there was a Jeff Mills album, a Choice album, and all the track lists was superb music, but it was like old disco and funk. And I thought, I'm a Jeff Mills fan. I want to know, you know, I don't want to hear Jeff playing old disco records, really. I want to hear Jeff playing like... the records that are associated with his genre that were groundbreaking for him, you know, or influenced him. So Back in the Box was like, you know, we don't want an influences mix, but we want the records that you... started to play within your genre mix if that makes sense yeah yeah so dave lee's back in the box you know yeah i don't want dave lee putting old disco records on there or funk records i want i want those early house records and techno records that you know have shaped you know dave lee as a dj an artist and i want him to put them all on on his mix And his mix was terrific. Again, some surprises, you know, Underground Resistance was on there. There was, you know, classic Daphne, which was, I think, a Danny Tenaglia production. LFO by LFO was on there, which again is like, you know, Dave the Disco King, you know, coming up with his bleep influences, you know. And... We were very happy with that album and obviously that then set the course for, I mean, the series has only, it's only been four mixes in that series. Louis Vega? Louis Vega did the second one. DJ Sneak and... Oh, Dave Clark, it's been five. Dave Clark did the third one. DJ Sneak did the fourth one and Global Communication did the fifth one. And I really like those compilations because, you know, we all like to look back. to the past, we all like to be a bit retrospective and these compilations are just that. This is the kind of the crate digging, the going back to the formative years. I emailed you once and I was like, you know who's next like i was really like oh come on and you were like yeah we had some ideas but it's just so hard to find the right yeah person to do it right in the way that you want why is that because i mean back in the box we we want we want djs of stature if that makes sense you know and I didn't really feel comfortable just going up to, you know, any old DJ who might be having a bit of a current run, you know, of exposure and saying, you know, let's hear your back-in-the-box selection. I wanted... I wanted kind of pivotal members of the different scenes, you know. So for me, you know, Joey Negro, Dave Lee, you know, he was practically one of the first UK guys on the house scene, you know, running Republic Records, I think it was, and all that. And then Louis Vega, I mean, that's a no-brainer. It's Louis Vega, massive work. Dave Clark, you know. So I guess we've always gone for the DJs that kind of help shape the history as well. And obviously the CDs musically are history, but we try and pick the names that in turn have helped shape the history as well. And then obviously, you know, being a label, yeah, you need names that sell units. And from a personal level, you need somebody who's going to cooperate as well. You know, and obviously we've spoken to many other DJs in the past and, you know, you quickly, we've had the run around from a few people that, you know, you just say, well, stuff you, you know, we won't bother doing this then because, you know, you're not taking this as seriously as we are, you know, and there have been situations. that on back in the box particular well-known djs that just well forget it then you know because they've just been arsey about money and release dates and everything they just made it unsavory for me to want to continue with it you know the licensing must be the licensing's hard work on it um but fun i that's that's what i love to do you know i feel like a private detective Yeah, it is. It is. It is. Definitely. Yeah, the licensing takes a long time. long time that's why they only come out you know every kind of year year and a half you know because they do take a long time to um to put together what was the most satisfying i found you i tracked you down to get this uh license um i mean definitely for me the the global communication back in the box i mean there's some crackers on there And just unearthing the original artists, you know, like Anthony Shake Shakir, Matt Cogger. You know, he probably hasn't made a record in like 15 years. And, you know, you suddenly tracked him down and he's like, hello, you know, you want to license my old Jesus? Does anybody still care? You know, so it's good. It's good when you kind of, yeah, you're really picking out people that. probably have no connection with the scene anymore and they're just really chuffed that somebody's rung them up 15 years later and said can we use your track on a compilation you know um but yeah the global communication was good because that was taking me i was on you know i was definitely speaking to a lot of you know early detroit guys and you know for me that was That's what I got into, you know, from an early age. So it was definitely for me, that compilation. The Dave Clark one was fun as well because that was, you know, tracking down, you know, Farley, Jackmaster, Funk, Bam Bam and all these super old guys, you know, again, who would just be like... You want to license it? Just send me the money now. Western Union. Just proper ghetto style. But those compilations, yeah, they're a joy to work on. Unfortunately, compared to The Lab, which is obviously Seth Troxler, Steve Berg, Wooly, which is a bit more aimed, a bit more at the... younger market. I don't know. That sounds really awful. But, you know, the current thing that's going on back in the box is a very niche product, you know. So, again, from a business perspective, it's becoming a labor of love. It's like, why am I doing this now? If it's going to lose money, then there's no point, you know. But, you know, again, I urge people to go out and listen to them. You can probably listen to them for free on Spotify. I don't care. But listen to them because this is where I still stand by what a record label can do and should do. You know, putting together a package that's been thought out. that's got decent artwork, that's got some linear notes that are of interest. It's been put together by people who care, you know. And definitely those back-in-the-boxes are put together with care, you know. And a lot of research goes into them. It's like a project, you know. And on the Global Common, we've got... needs to write linear notes. He wrote so much good stuff we did an 18 page booklet you know because it's just this is good stuff you know and if anyone's interested in tracing where the music comes from which really you know if people have truly got a love for the music then I think everybody should pay respect and you know retrace the line back. These comps are good for finding out where a lot of the music came from, learning a bit more about it. Tell me about the upcoming projects. You have already started another label. Yeah, I've started two new labels. I've started three new labels, but one of them I don't talk about. Because everyone needs to have a secret label. And so that's that. That'd be kept secret. And it's fun for me because it keeps me interested in, you know, doing something that no one else knows about. I've got two new labels at the moment, which are very much in early stages. Stoned Immaculate is... essentially my label now for what I produce, which is fairly housey. It's not really deviating from the house route. It's just good. For me, it's stuff that... I like to play when I DJ because I've been producing for nearly a couple of years now. I was getting to the stage where I wasn't actually playing any of the stuff that I produced and I was kind of thinking it's a bit weird you know and I'd be DJing with everybody else's records and but not mine. So when I set Stoned Immaculate up, I just found a nice little logo and I thought, you know, that's going to look cool. And, you know, I went in and wrote a bunch of tracks and they were very much with a nod to, you know, your Kerry Chandlers and your sort of masters at works of the world, you know. not sort of, I guess you could call it sort of 90s sounding, but not blatantly, you know. But it's my own thing, you know. It's my own influence of house music put into this new label. So I've got two releases on that so far, which are doing really well. It's a digital-only label. I've conceded that, you know. Most house music doesn't sell on vinyl anymore, so that's out the window. But the tracks are getting really good support from people like Sneak. and loads of others. What's the deal with dance music's fascination with the Doors? I feel like it's much higher than I would... I don't really know, because the reason why I called the label Stoned Immaculate is because there's a dub syndicate song called Stoned Immaculate. which has obviously come from the Jim Morrison quote. But I just always like, I just thought stoned immaculate. That's a cool phrase. And then obviously when I was, when I was, you know, turned into my designer role and had to design my own logo because you've got to do it all yourself nowadays. Yeah, I found this just, you know, cool image of Jim Morrison that was a silhouette. And I thought, yeah, you know, that looks a good logo. But yeah, I don't really know the dance affiliation. I mean, maybe Jim Morrison was house, proto-house. I don't know. And then the other label is Leviathan Sounds, which, again, is digital only. It's really stripping it all right back now. But three releases in. We've just put one out from Dan Curtin, which is really, really good. And I'm very happy to work with Dan because he's somebody, again, who I... got a lot of time and respect for. He's done some amazing early works and he's still delivering the goods, you know. And so Leviathan Sounds is probably a bit more trippy, techy, weirder. You know, it's hard nowadays to kind of, you know, be different from everything else because there's so many record labels out there, you know. But, you know, I'm just taking these two very new projects on and going to see where they go, you know. Yes, it's daunting that, you know, NRK, The Beast. has kind of kept me going and now, you know, I'm sort of in this new world of, you know, digital only labels that probably aren't going to sell, you know, huge amounts of copies, you know. But, hey, it's another challenge, you know. that's what keeps me going, you know. Can, I want to just go back briefly. You said that, you know, you found yourself not playing your own records. Yeah. was that about like why was that a conscious I don't want to play my own stuff well I don't know because I've only been writing music for a couple of years really so it's probably you know a lot of it's probably to do with yeah just kind of not really feeling confident enough you know to to play play my own records but also I think that I think that it can be easy sometimes if you're not regularly DJing, you're not regularly clubbing. I think that there's no like a separation of artists. There's kind of those artists who write music with clubs and DJing in mind. And there's those artists who just write music. And they're not taking that club influence with them. They're just writing music that they like, you know. And I think that, you know, already in my short production career, yeah, maybe I've, you know, I've written some stuff that's not necessarily... coming from where I would be playing it as a DJ. It's come more from the head. As I say, I listen to a lot of electronic music, a lot of house music all the time. And I'm not necessarily always in clubs or DJing. So yeah, I think that some of my early productions have probably not cut the mustard for me as a... you know, to DJ with, but they've cut the mustard in my head for what I like from house music and from electronic music, you know. Did you feel like you needed to produce? You need to put your name out there? Well... Look, first of all, I wanted to do it because I had more time on my hands running a record label as much as you can try and fill your time up. It's not really a full-time thing anymore unless you've obviously got tons and tons and tons of projects. For me, it wasn't. So I had more time on my hands and I wanted to have a go at it. But to say... that right now, and it's something that I've chatted to some friends about recently, and obviously it's definitely out there in conversation, is this whole thing about DJing, writing music, and how you've got to now write music to DJ. This really bugs me, massively. and it's not the reason why I started to write music. I'll let that known now. I enjoy sitting there and getting my beats together and sampling this. It's fun. I like writing music. But what I don't like is the pressure now for somebody or anyone, an artist, to have to write the music. get gigs that ultimately keep you afloat, you know? - Yep. - As I say, call me old school, I don't know. I've been DJing since the early 90s. And I love DJing and I wanna DJ more. I wanna pursue my DJ career and I've got more time on my hands. And I think I'm a pretty good DJ. And I've got a pretty big record collection. And okay, you know, size matters and all that. But, you know, I've invested a lot of time and a lot of money and sweat and tears into having a really good record collection that's helped me through the label and all the other projects I've worked on. And that is what I want to, you know, use. And I enjoy DJing. I enjoy clubs. And I love playing music to people. And I'm glad and blessed that I've got all this great music that I've collected over the years. And I want to move forward with that. But it just bugs me that, you know, that doesn't really account for anything anymore. And what account? is that you need to have a track and, you know, a deep house chart for one of the leading digital download stores. It seems like... It seems that's what's driving the promoters. There are a couple of exceptions. Yeah, for sure. I mean, obviously, it's easy to generalize on these things. But the other thing I've been thinking of recently is that a lot of the power now in the industry is actually in the promoters' hands again. It's sort of shifted back, which is great for promoters and for clubs. maybe for the alcohol industry, but definitely the music industry is almost in the hands of promoters now, you know, because they're the ones who decide who plays. And for how much. And for how much. And ultimately, you know, promoters look to each other, who are you booking? You know, it's that kind of domino effect, you know. And I definitely feel that the industry is kind of shifting. massively over the years obviously with sales and products and all that all that's cool you know but it just really irks me nowadays that you know that everything's kind of so led towards people having to write music in order to sustain themselves within the music industry because we all know there's no money to be made from sales anymore really I mean of course there are labels that you know probably get by comfortably because they're in the top regions of the charts and they keep selling and it keeps printing money and you know that's that's cool you know but you gotta understand there's a lot of record labels out there and there's a lot of people that want to get involved in music But definitely, it's being, I just feel it's all being shunted down this, you know, this path for people to have, you've got to have records out to get gigs. But it's only the gigs that actually pay the money. Because no one pays artists advances anymore. And if they do, it's for small amounts of money. And then sales are... can be pretty much for most labels and artists, zilch, you know. The promoter idea that you just mentioned is striking to me. It's an obvious one if you think about it, but I haven't really thought about it. The power's in the promoter's hands. They're holding the deck of cards at the moment. Is that a cyclical thing? Has that been the case 10, 15 years ago? Or is this a new thing in your mind? Well, maybe it's just in my mind because, you know, I've... Is it a new thing? I mean, maybe labels used to have a lot more power. People used to want to write music to be on a label and have records out. And the gigs were almost, people weren't writing music to get gigs. They were writing music because they wanted to have a record out. They want people to hear their music. I guess maybe it was just more equidistant. Everyone had an amount of power. And now it's kind of. of like this thing is shrunk quite a bit while the other one yeah gets vastly more important because of that i just think that labels are you know are having a tough time of it now maybe that's that's another factor for me thinking well you know okay you know let's put this one to bed and see what else you know we can do with with the music that i like and friends who you know still want to release music with me on other labels but even though there's this there's a bit of doom and gloom you seem quite optimistic you have these new projects it seems like you're at this point where you're like let's see what happens well definitely i think i think i you know i have to do that you know because it could it can be very easy to get gloomy and you know look around you and see you know successes happening in other you know groups of people But actually, the funny thing of being in Berlin this weekend, I mean, obviously, for the fact that I'm at Panorama Bar, I mean, that fills me with enough optimism to think, well, you know, maybe it's definitely worth me going forward, you know, because I'm playing at, you know, one of the best clubs in the world. The other thing that I've noticed just from being here this weekend is that, and it's something else that I've been thinking of, is the idea of age in the industry, how old you are. All the DJs playing at Berghain Panorama this weekend, we're all in our 40s. I've just come back from the hotel and there's Kirk DiGiorgio. Ben Sims. And I was out with Dan Curtin last night and some other guys, you know, well, I'm still in my thirties actually. You started early. I started early. And that fills me with optimism because I think, well, yeah, you know, I mean, there have been elements of doubt over the last, you know, maybe year or so. I think, well, maybe it is a young man's or young woman's game now, you know. But there's a lot to be said for that maturity in a DJ or an artist. And it's probably what I was trying to say with, you know, me wanting to DJ and I've got this record collection I've amassed over the years. You know, there's something to be said about having experience. and and having spent a long time understanding music and and what it's about and it's it's obviously fills me with optimism being here in berlin with some of the older guys and you know who seem to be having their their own little renaissance as well you know and you gotta think kirk de georgia and ben sims are playing some pretty heavy heavyweight techno you know yeah it's And they've been around many, many years. I think the most exciting thing is their concept of the night that they do, which is we, I think it's like we don't play any records that are more than six months old. Like, not only is it a... a challenge for them but it's also like exciting for the audience to know that like here are these two guys who are still just gonna be absolutely 100% on it yeah a front you know there's no there's no nostalgia here. True, true. But I have been thinking about age, as I say, is there ageism in this industry, you know? And does it hold people back? I'm not so sure, but it's... I've been feeling good these last few weeks about going forward and of having had this history now, you know? It's almost like closing the book on NR. okay, it's setting me up now a bit to sort of move forward, you know. Whereas if I'd have kept the label going, maybe I'll forever be kind of, you know, treading in this sort of no man's land of, you know, is this label still relevant or do people still want it, you know. Because that happens all the time, you know. You start to think, you know. Do people need the label anymore? Do people care about the label? There's other labels. There's other artists. There's so much going on in this music industry. I just felt the time was right. Close the chapter on the label, but I'm still around. I'm not closing or retiring. I got plenty of ideas and works in the pipeline, you know, and that's going to move forward. And yeah, you have to be optimistic in this industry. Otherwise, you know. slip down pretty quickly and you know I can't get a proper job which is what my dad always says to me when are you going to get a proper job I'm like not yet not yet Thank you. Thank you.
