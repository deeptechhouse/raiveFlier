♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resonant Advisor. Gernot Bronzer and Sebastian Zari first met in primary school in the early 80s. More than 30 years later, they live only walking distance from each other. This closeness is central to their success as mode selector, one of the most popular and original acts to emerge from the Berlin techno underground. Their knack for balancing mass appeal with underground credibility has been key to their success, and their last two decades have been a blur of crossover albums, global tours, cult labels, and high-profile collaborations. Earlier this week, Bronzer and Zari swung by RA's Berlin office to discuss all of the above. Their new album, Who Else?, and what it's like to be back on the road as Mode Selector after seven years away. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Mode Selector is up next. So yeah, in terms of the scale of touring, I mean, what's so different about it being with a band? I mean, when we were in the age of like 25, we toured the whole year and we played around 130, 160 shows every year. And that's not possible anymore because we have too much other stuff to do. We have so many projects, children and stuff like this. So it's totally different. When I discovered FIARC, almost 10 years ago. It's already almost 10. It's not, it's eight years ago, seven years. It was, it was in 2014. 14. So we released the first, oh man, you see when you are touring so much, you totally mess up the time. So you don't see how, how, how, how fast time passes by or how slow. Anyway, so when we discovered them for the first time, so when we signed them for 50 Weapons back then, and when we met them, they were living in one little apartment in one room, and they were exactly like us. when we were in their age and they do now the same we did 10 years 15 years ago so they play and play and play and play and now i don't know when we when we play a show now it's different now it's like a kind of like theater visual artists and light artists and us and so we try to create a piece I feel like I went to see your show at Halle and Bergheim that was a weird one yeah how come It was so early and it was at nine and it was still, you know, when you make a tour, when you start doing a tour, like you make a new record and then the tour starts, you play several shows to get warm, to rehearsal. So it doesn't make really too much sense to rehearsal the whole show again and again. for yourself in a rented place so you have to play like at least 10 or 15 shows to get into it and when we played at in Berlin we were still checking the set lists and switching and adding new stuff so it was still pretty much in the progress both Berghain shows were also different I don't know what Berghain show you have I went to the one on the Monday okay the second And yeah, that was different to the first one because on the first one we had the catnap as a guest, also another support. And then we changed. I think Catnap came out. Yeah. And for the second show, we had the dance system. And yeah, we made a little thing different. And also the audience was different. Really interesting. Because it was a firetag, you know, a bank holiday on the Friday. So I guess people... I think the Friday show was the first one we announced and it got sold out pretty quick. So I think all the hard... core fans were on there on the friday and and when we added the another date the other date um i don't know some of the people came twice but it was i don't know i think i think for for me it was a very interesting experience because i like the room pretty much the room is beautiful and um but we had this um sound issue so we had to start early It was just because of the noise that we had to stop at at least 10.30 or 10. We had to stop at 10. So, I mean, you know, it's not like the coolest lot, but it was like, hello, here we are. That's what we do now. I thought one of the nicest moments was the tribute to Keith Flint of the Prodigy. Oh yeah, that was sad. It was very sad. Yeah, he died that week. And it was interesting because I went with my girlfriend and she's not super familiar with your music, but she was there. Actually, she just turned to me during the show and said, it kind of reminds me a bit of the Prodigy. And then like two minutes later, you did the whole Prodigy tribute. So I mean, what did the Prodigy and Keith Flint mean to you? Oh, man. I mean, the Prodigy, they're like heroes. They were like superheroes for me. I mean, I saw many bands in my life and many concerts and I got... scared during a concert twice in my life. One of them was Slipknot. And I saw Slipknot on the festival. I really shit my pants because I really had to escape from the pit because I was just like trying to play the cool guy in the middle of the dance floor, like in the field. And I got super scared because it was so much violence in the air. And I had the same with Prodigy when I think they played at Lowlands or Pukkelpop. I don't remember exactly, but it's eight years ago. I'm not bad. numbers it's a while ago and they came on stage and they had to like five minutes intro war sirens you know yeah they did that for like a couple of minutes like in super loud and I was just standing there and waiting and I saw how the energy was growing in the crowd and the people started like screaming like many people started screaming without even hearing a tone from the music and when they came on stage it was just like explosion and I really I was really I was impressed so much that I really couldn't like I really couldn't believe how much energy they can generate with only their music. And it was not easy to concentrate because, you know, Gernot was talking about the long intro. It's like heating up a fire. And then in the end you have an explosion. I think they started with... Firestarter and it's not just Keith you know it's the whole thing you know it's like the for me they were like the pop version of DKLF a little bit so just a little bit kind of like this corner of my little music world but I remember the first records on XL I bought Charlie and stuff like this and then they started having hits with Outer Space and then they became superstars and they really gave a fuck. They were like really our idols in terms of being an electronic music band. And when he died for like, when was it? It's already a couple of months ago. I was really in shock about that because it's like, you know, several things, when several things happen, like Prince is dying or it's, you know, some stuff. which is not supposed to happen, you know. So that reminds you that nothing is forever and things are changing and stuff. So I think it's one of the worst things that could happen to me that Keith Flint dies. Or it's, you know, or for example, imagine Hardwax will close. Yeah, just the idea to think about that. can destroy my whole day you know so it so but you know it remembers you nothing is forever nothing is forever and similar situation few years ago mark bell of lfo when he died was like we arrived and we met him in iceland and i think one month later he Was it a disease or an operation? No, he died during a surgery, I think. And it was, I don't know, not necessary. It's interesting you talk about being scared because I think everyone... Especially in the UK of a certain age, I'm kind of 30. I would have been six when Firestarter came out, roughly five or six. And you just remember hearing that, seeing that video on top of the pops, like the Firestarter thing and just being like, you know, this is well scary. And I think they had to take it off the TV because parents. That was the one. It's just when he's in the tunnel. Yeah. He's wearing the kind of like. But this Smack My Bitch Up clip was more weird. Yeah, that was more weird. I think that was also one of the first bands who made like really popular, weird, scary shit, you know. I mean, that was the same time when Come to Daddy came out, you know, when I remember seeing the Come to Daddy clip the first time of my life. So that was kind of like this. That was when electronic music was scary. Now it's not too scary anymore, but back then it was kind of like a... I liked this kind of language, you know? You know, you obviously have experienced the kind of band thing with Moderat. You know, if Mode Selector was to have a couple of kind of huge hits, like, you know, prodigy level hits and the band was to grow even bigger, I mean, is that something you'd like? Would you like kind of to become a bigger act or are you happy also having that kind of one foot in the underground and doing the more DIY? It's like this is what we talked about on our way to this interview today. And we talked about how to combine your nerd projects. with the bigger projects, the more popular ones. And that's a very interesting question. And it's also a very interesting time. These days, everything changes so much in the music industry, even more, since the discussion is really cooking right now, since Beatport announced. the streaming service as well and you know we are running record labels at the same time and you know we really like underground music we always did but we have also another site so this combining these two things is sometimes a big challenge because you can lose a lot of money and a lot of What you lose most is when you invest a lot of power and energy in projects and the payback of it or the attention of it, it's not worth it, you know. So when I grew up in Berlin. in the electronic music scene so when i'm when i um left my parents house i i started working at hardwax records and um i my my heroes back then were when guys like error smith and soundtag and dj pete you know when i was little that this is for me all the nerd genre you know this is nerd music this is music you have to work for to know about you know and and and i think um this was back then a very small field a little bit too small and now you have festivals like atonal who present music like this more and more you know like more experimental stuff. And for example, I just found out last week that Rose is Zootek. I didn't know that Zootek and Rose, the techno artist, is the same person. And so you have still people from the old days playing more experimental game. So I think it's a very interesting progression and time right now for experimental music more than it was 15 years ago, maybe. So you have more younger people more interested in this. Maybe I'm wrong, I don't know, but this is how it feels. You're totally right, Gernot. When you see it as a scale, you know, like a measuring. Today, you don't have that simple thing. Techno, house, hip-hop. Drum and bass. It's so fine. Kind of fluid. Yeah, it's fluid. There's no borders in between. You have a lot of crossover points. And so that makes it not easy to put it in genre. And you have to, I think the modern technologies or modern. technologies the technologies everyone is using it's yeah it's easy to find it's also you have a lot of surprising moments so ah look here I found an artist he never released and I mean releasing a record is a little bit It's old school. But we love records, real vinyl. But for the next generation, the way to discover music, it's amazing. You have the wide cosmos, but you have to go into it deep. Looking into the sky at night. Telescope. Telescope, exactly. And then so, ah, I found a star I've never seen before. It's true. You have so much more music at your disposal and there's everything and you can, you know, listen to anything ever recorded, but you still have to work hard to find the stuff. There was no resident advisor back then. There was no, I mean, there was one. But it was small and it was not like an information database, a big blog like today. And it was all niche. It was a little bit like metal, you know. So you had a few fanzines and stuff. But we were always very interested in electronic experimental music. we wanted to bring it into more listenable and more danceable fields. That was, we liked the sounds, we liked noise. It was when I saw Mick Harris the first time in my life, a.k.a. Scorn. He's releasing now music, luckily, on Long Island. Is it Lies? Yeah, he releases music on Lies Records, but he, like Mick Harris. used to be the drummer of Napalm Death. And when I saw him the first time as Scorn performing, that was the first time that I really enjoyed pain in my ears because it had to be like this. So I destroyed my hearing already. when I was 21 years old. And it was just because I really enjoyed the moment and then seeing these people still doing almost the same stuff and they're still impressing, you know? I mean, techno is like... electronic music or especially music which is based on noise you know like techno is doesn't have to be sequenced synthesizer techno you know i mean the techno we all like and we all then like to dance to is music where you don't know where the sound is from you know so we are sharing studio with marcel detman and he never um plays a note He looks for the most ugly sounding noise and looks for the best bits of it and makes a track out of it. That's it. And this is how Shet is doing music. This is kind of like a little bit music which is influenced by the idea of industrial music. This is what we both loved pretty much. So we like different genres of music, but we try to bring it together. And this is actually how we make music. So I like the new PopCon single pretty much. I also like some weird electronic stuff that I'm listening to at the moment. Nasty noise, whatever. And sometimes you just cover things. Last week I went to the ballet at Staatsoper and there was a three-part piece. First was music by Tchaikovsky, second by Tom Willems. It's a Netherlands componist. And last one was Alva Noto. And the second one, the music was like, what is this? So never heard before. It's from 1989. And then they changed it in 1992. Sounds a little bit general MIDI sounds. A little bit futuristic, but it was nothing to, you know, there was no definition for me at the moment. It was fascinating. So, and when we make music, it's like we don't take the sound like it is. We put a lot of energy to change it, to transform it. to have a recital in the end, you can't reconstruct, you know, you don't, that's the aim. Sure. Yeah, so in the 90s, you're listening to all sorts of different stuff, but you kind of... you know, you had the very nerdy kind of saying noise techno, but you also wanted to do something that was kind of a bit more accessible. I guess you bring in elements of hip hop and stuff. I mean, where does that kind of, where does that begin? Where does that come from? I think when we saw the first time framers manuals, you know them. So that was a big table with 10 guys and 12 laptops probably. From Austria. From Austria, they released music on Mego and Fat Cat and stuff. And that was like seeing a bunch of guys having an internet conference and making the biggest noise. And we liked the noise. but we never liked the performance. So when we started playing the live shows a long time ago, we always used two laptops and the Maximus P patch and two MIDI controller and a mixer and a few effects. And we always really had to take care that we are not being this type of... email checking laptop artists so we tried to do everything to not look like this. So we added visuals to the whole thing and we used MIDI controller and one day we got rid of the laptops and we had only the controllers and the laptops are under the table or on the side of the stage. Because the way to perform electronic music with software is for us, it's our way to perform. So we were never hardware guys on stage. So we have all our friends are using all these. MIDI machines but we grew up with MIDI and when I mean I the first time I programmed the 808 was when I was 17 years old and I was really done with it so I'm happy that I have now other opportunities so in the studio I just have the stuff there because of the sound and the Actually, in terms of being nerdy, we have some friends who start producing music with Atari again just to arrange the tracks like 20 years ago, 25 years ago. It's just for the vibe, you know. That's nerdy shit. that's really nerdy and i really appreciate that so i i like it when people want to keep their studios flow fresh it's a little bit driving a car from the 70s from the early 70s you know when you started to put the engine on you have to regulate the choke and waiting if it It's warm and then you can drive. But not the new hardware. It's divided, yeah? The electronic nerd scene is divided in two parts. It's in some of them. want to make the people dance and some of them are like diving deep into the sound and probably make also the people dance but on a different way on it we we when we grew up in berlin that you know in berlin you had a lot of different camps like musically camps and we were part of We weren't part of one of them, but we knew them all and we played with them on their parties and together we released music from artists from this camp. We played on the party. Back in the days it was pretty much divided and now it's kind of like it's pretty pretty different now in Berlin you know so you have these big club in the middle yeah which is kind of like the eye of the storm yeah. And then this, like 20 years or 15 years ago, you had like at least three clubs in this size with this impact. So you had more various music and scenes and stuff like this. Was it tribal back then? You had like, you know. The people that are into this music, the people that are into that music, the people, or was it kind of fluid? It was fluid, but it was the DJs were following, the people were following the DJs pretty much. So you had like fans. So you had fans of DJ Woody, you had fans of DJ Alien, you had fans of Tarnet. So these DJ superhero thing. was back in the days had more impact. So yeah, some of them are still there. So Ellen Arian is still touring and she's maybe the hardest working person I know. And she's still holding the... slack up and looking good and releasing albums and playing parties and she's like she's like a she's like a machine so you guys were keen kind of not to do a straight house and techno thing or a straight techno thing i mean there were always people who were better you know i mean when you know sound tech You are not willing to make a house record. For what reason? So he made already the best shit, you know. So we were always looking to make something different to the others, you know. And that was not the nerdy side. So we tried to combine everything. I mean, did you know other people in your circle that were doing a similar thing to you that were taking influences from so many places or did it feel like something that no one else was doing? I mean, we know, of course, a lot of musicians. Most of our friends are musicians. I think we were a little bit too much into some hip hop than other electronic music producer would ever try to do. So for us, it was always about the tunes. So I found out about the Neptunes when I worked at Hardwax because everyone working in the store was so much into Neptunes and Timberland. Okay, right. And not about Final Frontier or 909. So it was only about cars and drag star race and stuff. So that was also, you know, for me, for me was techno or still is the, it's, it's like watching Game of Thrones. You know, I really, I'm really into stuff and into this music. I, uh, this is, this is my life. I love this shit, you know? I mean, you ask what, what music I was listening to recently. I really liked the new, uh, Karen record. Oh yeah. That's my favorite track. I mean, if I would play this to my mom, she wouldn't understand, you know, but it's about the details and stuff. And that's good. Yeah, you have that inspiring moment still. I think that's the most important thing, to have inspiration. You have all the tools. All the tools are open. You can do it with a little synthesizer. You can do it with a really nice software or with the lower version. Or you can do it online or you can record with your mobile device and then cut it and make sounds of it. So everything is open. And the inspiration for us, it's still very important. You know, you go into a record store and listen to contemporary hip hop beats and then you think, oh, that. beats how can you bring it into the another context so that's the that's the that's the idea this is it i think it's just about being open-minded i think you guys throughout your careers have always been very open-minded very open to yeah i think this is so important for example when all these gender discussion started yeah about um female artists getting not enough credit and respect in a scene and stuff like this I was really surprised because I thought we are over it already so I wasn't really expecting that discussion and there is a problem obviously But it was just because we grew up always surrounded by strong women, you know. So one of our first supporters was Ellen Ehren and Miss Kitten. And these two women, they were like their boss woman, you know. So we never had this. We never had this in mind. And the same is, it's the same with electronic music. So we were, we are always super open-minded and there was, we have no, no-go areas, you know. I mean, Volksmusik, maybe not. But especially German and Austrian Volksmusik, maybe not. So if you want to discover it, Google Volksmusik. It's a nightmare. But this is a no-go area. But there are a few good samples in that. There's not even one. But, you know, it's like we like metal, you know, and we like everything. It's about music and it's about the idea. You know, for example, Shari told you it's not the gear you use. It's the idea. And it is. It is true. I mean, you cannot go and say, ah, yeah, you. you have a modular system and you record nothing with your modular system you make some music with it or whatever this is not right because it's about the idea you can you can make music with an iphone or you can music with a 24 square foot size modular system you know when you press record it's just about the idea and how you use it it's still the skills you know and i think when hip-hop beats for example MPC, J Dilla School, you hear the skills and you see and you hear the ideas, you know, so it's in the end, it's all about the ideas. And yeah, that makes it not very easy sometimes. But I mean, it's also about staying humble, you know, because you're, you know, many years into a successful career, you could just. For this album, you could have just locked yourselves away and be like, you know, we've been touring, we know the score, let's make another Motor Selector album. But instead you started DJing for a year and a half because you felt out of touch with club culture and you wanted to get to know what people were listening to. You know, you felt, I mean, you can explain it yourselves, but... Yeah, I mean, touring as a DJ for one and a half years was a very interesting experience because we are not kind of like professional DJs like Marcel, for example, our studio mate. He's like playing 12 times a month and he's doing this every weekend. And for us, I mean, for me especially, it got very boring after a while. And it's still the same. When I remember when I was little, it's still the same. Bass out, bass in, hi-hat, you. And a good DJ is a good DJ and a good tune is a good tune. So it was not enough for us and we wanted to create again. And we felt a little bit out of touch. We saw really good parties. We had really, really good parties, but we also played on festivals or parties where we had different experiences. And we saw and heard or experienced stuff we didn't really appreciate. But it was not too much. But I saw that the idea... of techno during the generations didn't change too much because every generation says our generation is the most craziest one. And we take the weirdest drugs and we made the weirdest sex and we have the strangest outfits and we stay more awake than you ever will. But I heard that many times and I think, yeah. It's repeating. It's repeating. Sure. So, I mean, in terms of the new album, how did you approach it? I mean, it's short, which seemed like an interesting message. Yeah. I mean, how did you decide on... who to get involved and how did it come together? How we start. So about the shortness, the first draft for the album had about 12 tracks. So, and you know, when you're making music and you make a bounce and then you put it into a playlist and then you feel, okay, cool. And then after listening 5,000 times. it feels like it's too much as we skip the song take this song or this track as a leftover or as a bonus or and then in the end we had eight tracks and then so wow for physical product it's a single lp that's great so sounds easy but um I wish to love to change the perspective into a human being, to a listener who never heard about Mode Selector before. Maybe I need some drugs or something. I don't know. There's only one kind of deeper track on it. It's called WMF Love Song, which is a homage on one of the clubs in Berlin we grew up with. But I think we just needed to make this record after Moderat because all the songs were full of details and deep and they had all these big gestures and pathos. And so we had to make something really clear, something you can barely grab. like a comic, you know, like a Disney comic book, like you open it and you know what you have, you know, and this is what we wanted to make with this new record. And, you know, I like the fact that it's short because I know a lot of good punk records who are very short because you cannot. stand it longer but the tracks are good and you love it and it's just right you know and we I think that is this is part of the concept that we wanted to make a kind of like message actually we are working on a mixtape right now because we thought okay 34 minutes it's not it's not long enough And we have, Shari told you, so much leftover material and so much beats who are not finished. You know, in the hip hop scene, you have mixtapes or grime or all these broken stuff. You have these kind of like album mixtape thing going on. It's not like a DJ mix, but it's like an album with unreleased stuff. in mix format. So this is what we do right now. Because we have so much stuff there we didn't use and we wanted to use at one point but we couldn't because of the album because it is like it is. So this is what we do right now. and this will contain a lot of more music because when you mix it you can just show it for like one and a half minutes two minutes that's why I like zombie for example zombies tracks are very short they start they end they have no breaks So it's just about the tune, you know. He should mix them. Yeah, of course. Well, you know, going, I don't want to go back, but The Residents, you know The Residents? They made an album in the 80s. It's called a commercial album. It's, I think, 20 tracks on the album, but only the essential intro, first verse. chorus, the end, about one minute each song. It's just a draft to show, okay, that could be commercial music. But for the mixtape, there's so much really nice leftovers and it's time to show. Sure. Does this stuff make it into the live show? The extras? I hope so. I mean, we work on some stuff. You know, the actual live show was like a presentation of the new album with some old stuff. Because we did once the mistake to play only new tracks, which doesn't work, obviously. So you have to play the old stuff too, of course. But I hope so that there will be some stuff of it ending in the live show, I think, of course. How do you feel about playing old records? you mean? Yeah, I mean, just kind of listening to them again. How do you feel about those records from 2007? So some of the tracks, of all the tracks, when we play just a bunch of them, but if we play, for example, some more mode selector, cliche banging stuff, then I'm still surprised that it still works and that's what the people wait for all the time and yeah this is kind of like a paradox for me yeah I think you guys are in an interesting kind of grey area where People could go to your show, not know your music at all, have a great time, rave. But there are also big fans there who do want to hear the hits. And you guys kind of need to sit in there and work out who you're going to please. It's a little bit confused all the time, but I like it. I mean, you don't have to explain everything. And techno or experience of a techno moment. doesn't need to be explained by anybody because it's a sub it's it's your it's your own thing you know it's a subject and um i think we we both uh grew up together we know each other since primary school and um yeah i didn't I never did anything else. You know, when I was buying my first turntables from money I made with really hard work on the weekends and I had these two turntables in my room and the walls were full of posters and flyers from parties and stuff. I was just staying there like I was a little kid. and playing strictly rhythm records and was imagining that I'm playing in front of many people and it came true, you know. And then on some point I wanted to make a live concert like an electronic band and it came true. And now we were on the point, okay, what's the next thing? What should come true? And this is kind of like a retrospective moment for us. So the Who Else record itself, the whole design is... kind of like a homage on the like idm graphic designers like designers republic and stuff like this so we only used typo in the way we would use it in the 90s or in the early 2000s you know and that was the that was the idea to make it a little bit retro but also advanced at the same time it's the same with the music because you cannot make new techno music that's impossible you can make fresh Techno music, but not new techno music. Yeah, this is what we tried. And we have the collaborations on the album. The first track on the album, One United Power, is a collaboration with Lorenzo Senni. So we made this track with him together and then we found Flo Hajo through funny ways. I know the booker of Skepta and I talked to the booker and asked him, how realistic is it? to make a track with Skepta. And she said, hmm, I have a better option for you. So, I mean, at least I tried, you know. So, and then we, yeah, we met Flo Hajo and she is a super talented, nice person. And we made a track with her. we recorded several more which are maybe ending up on the mixtape because we haven't used them for the album the same with tommy cash we have a few recordings with him laying on a hard drive And same with Otto von Schirach. He came OVS. He came again to Berlin for Europe Tour and he spent also about one week together with us. The plan was totally different. The plan was to make sound design, but it ended up on a microphone. But we also made sound design. We learned a lot about a special software synthesizer. And yeah, with each artist, we had about one or two weeks quality time. So for the recording session. And we recorded, I think we spent two weeks with Fjark in the studio. But smoking weed, man, I don't smoke weed myself. But if you are with them in the studio, you have to because you can't you can't escape. So, I mean, we have an air condition in the studio. But it didn't help too much. So I was very quick stoned without smoking. Just being in a room with them was enough. And there were still three at this time. So they were like constantly smoking. And all their cliche and all their bullshit they do on the internet, it's true. I wait how long they will do it like this. So let's see. There was no plan to link back up with Tom York for this record? Actually, we asked him, but he was super busy finishing his stuff. And we just actually, when I was talking about it with him, I was, while talking to him, I found out that's not a good idea this time. So we both, I was just asking myself why and for what. And you just have to feel it, you know. And so when we made the music with him back then for the last album, it was like a super excitement in the air. So he came to Berlin, we went to party. We recorded the music in the studio together. We created the stuff together. And this time a lot of stuff happened on both sides. And it was not just the right time to do it. Exactly. Yeah, I just wanted to mention, you know, he, well, you said that he said that you're the reason that he started DJing and got into electronic music, which is a pretty amazing, of all the things you've kind of achieved, that's quite a mad one. Yeah, I mean, when we played the first time in Manchester in our life, it was on a scam party, scam the record label, they made parties and they booked us and we played there. And the same day we played in Manchester, for the first time outside of Germany, by the way, Radiohead came to our studio and were knocking the door and our friends were opening the door and they died because they were just in front of Radiohead. And it was just bad timing for us. So I was in Manchester for the first time, super excited, playing on a scam party and I was just IDM king back then, so scam was the shit. And then I was really in a conflict because Radiohead was in Berlin at the same time. Bad timing. So they turned up at your studio hoping to... Yeah, because we had our studio right next door to the label B-Pitch Control and they went to the office, visiting the office, and they wanted to see us and say hello. And that was the time when... they talked about us in interviews and stuff and it was I didn't even had Radiohead on my schedule then yeah but that was when they released Kid A they're for me one of their best records sure definitely you mentioned WMF Club there I personally hadn't heard of it before do you want to kind of just paint the picture of what the club was like where was it the energy the concept of wmf club was like to use contemporary empty spaces so um the situation i think the first club was in two 1991 or 1992 in a very small basement or something really fucked up building so every most of the buildings were not renovated or still destroyed after second world war mostly in the east part the west part of Berlin is totally different developed you have another architecture and structure, sometimes it remains a little bit un-Brussels. Anyway, WMF, the government of Berlin, they were still very open. They gave them the places before they were grabbed by real estate or renovated or deconstructed. About two years. Every club was about for two years. How many WMF clubs? Many. Seven? I don't know. But it was the spot. So you had Ewerk back then, Tresor and WMF. So what period are we talking when you guys were? End of 90s. 99, 98, 99. That was the time we... May or earlier. So there was every Saturday audio-video disco with an unknown DJ. called DJ Dixon opening up every night. So he started, he played the first four hours and he was the first house DJ I saw who was pitching down the tempo a little bit after each mix. And I thought this guy is the coolest because, you know, usually the DJs make it faster. and make it louder and he was always like pitching it back a little bit just not too yeah and um this is how we grew up i think that was mid 90s 96 95 that was the first wmfs that was and we went always to see audio video disco It was Dixon and Mijia Prince. And sometimes they had guests. And you had also the concept, you have a Friday and you have a Saturday, sometimes a Thursday. Later, the Sonar Collective guys and us. We had always the Thursday. Monthly. Not every Thursday, so it changed so that you have every second or every third Thursday another night. Yeah, and WMF was known for very good sound all the time. They had really good sound systems. They had different taste and they were kind of like... It always felt a little bit more grown up going there. But it was super underground. And Shari told you that it was in old buildings, like really dirty old ruins. But the crazy thing is they had always really good interior designer. And they turned the club inside. The buildings looked from the outside really shit, but inside it was a different world. So super stylish. They had like old retro wooden walls everywhere. And it was super stylish. And it was state of the art. So it was also not easy to get in. So it was kind of like the same door policy like Berghain has today. So you had to like never go with all your mates, bring always a bunch of girls, stuff like classic, you know. And so that was a really good way of clubbing because it was about the music, but also about the vibe of the whole place. And it was deep and not too cheesy musically. And it was always, I constantly had the feeling, I don't know this record. I don't know this record. What record is this? I don't know this record. And I didn't have that in other clubs. When you went to Tresor, it was sure that they played some Red Planet records you have for sure and stuff like this. So it was always you. Tresor is Tresor, E-Werk is E-Werk, depends on the DJ. But WMF was its own world. It was the first very Berlin thing, which was a little bit newer. It was generation two of the clubs. It was a playground, definitely a playground for to combine and to connect, to show the eclectic Berlin. You mean a playground as an artist or in terms of the crowd or the whole thing kind of? For artists and also the crowd. That's the reason why the crowd or the audience thought let's go to WMF because you really don't know what's going to happen. They had also a nice cocktail culture. So they had always a good bar, a very good bar with good drinks. And when you were inside, it was the coolest thing ever. You've been in this club and the music was always not too... easy for the people sometimes but it was no one I mean the the the impact the whole situation had inside the club was stronger than um having a strong opinion about the music from when you when you came sometimes it was like really strange stuff I saw Panasonic at WMF playing one whole night was like almost violating everyone because it was so much bass and but It was still kind of like glam, you know. Or Killa-san sound system from Japan. They brought their sound system. That was the Killa-san connection. And they played on a Friday at WMF Japanese Dance Hall with Jamaican vocal artists. And it was really never heard before. That was so massive. Wow. So they bought kind of fresh sounds. Always. That was not just like booking all the known artists. It was all about, not all about, but it was also about bringing new people. For example, when Nathan Fake started touring, he played WMF first time in Berlin. But you had also masters at work. Many, many, many, many. The Friday was always drum and bass. It was a crew called Hard Edged. And they split it up and opened up their own place called Watergate. You might have heard of it. And then there were the other drum and bass crew called Exponenz. Then you had several camps, as I told you. You had Weekend Club, you had all the gay parties, 90 Grad, WMF, Gay MF. You know the party, Gay MF? No. And it was the Sundays at the WMF. They turned the club into Gay MF. In terms of the atmosphere inside, was it... was it loose and lawless you know just anything goes like you can just yeah you can do whatever you like yeah exactly it was yeah absolutely so you had a lot of arty people you had a lot of People looking for sex, of course. But it was also a lot about dancing and the sound. And of course, weird stuff happened everywhere. But this place was the place where we grew up. We went there as a guest first and we ended up as residents. But it took years. It was just years. And then when the club... closed down the people who were running the place decided not to run another club because it's super exhausting when you build a club and you have it only for two or three years and then you move again and again so there was a lot of idealism included and on some point it was over and I think the track WMF loves song on our album shows pretty much exactly the vibe of this place. I mean, are you surprised that, um, Berlin clubs still have that same atmosphere? That's still saying loose fiber. You can still go partying and feel free and do whatever you want. And cause I mean, you know, I come from London and it's a completely different thing. Like, you know, London is for head for me. Always. You actually, the first place we played in London was plastic people. When we, when we played the first time ever in London, it was plastic people. And we thought, okay, this is London. But we found out very quick it's not. Because Plastic People was the coolest place in London. It was the best sound and it was small and cozy and good music. And it had a different approach. And when we got booked again and again in London, we found out. that it's more like an industry. And in Berlin, it's also an industry, but they hide it more. And I like to go out in Berlin because of the people, because you have so many different people all the time here. When I remember back in the days at WMF Club, that we are always the same people. And I still see them on the streets sometimes. And I remember, oh my God, this girl. I know her from back then. It's crazy, huh? You know, you have almost 4 million people in that city in Berlin. And then you just cross the street and then you see the people from yesterday. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah.
