♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Welcome to Resident Advisor's exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Matt Unicombe and I'm a staff writer here at Resident Advisor. Since its inception in 2004, Future Classic has risen to become one of Australia's most prominent dance music labels. But releasing music is not all that the outfit does. They also operate successful touring and design agencies and a music licensing arm, all while promoting their own weekly adult disco parties at Sydney's Civic. The Future Classic label, with its steady mix of international and Australian artists, has become a big hit. renowned for its consistency and its status as a musical link between Australia and the rest of the world. As a touring agency, they're responsible for bringing some of the world's foremost house and disco DJs to Australian shores on a regular basis. While on the design front, their refined style has become a regular to the Sydney art and graphic design scene. A few weeks ago, I caught up with founder Nathan McClay, design head Jay Rives, and label and touring all-rounder Chad Gillard to learn a little more about the future classic story and along the way out about the Sydney dance music scene through the eyes of a local promoter. Okay, so first of all, I think it might be good just to sort of, to, I guess, find out about each of your sort of backgrounds. Teacher classic. Maybe we'll start with Nathan. Five years to do my degree because I was a... sound engineering diploma in the middle of it and then I was doing an Internet with Townby which was like a stream like guide to all the live streams happening around the world. Inertia asked me, I set up their digital department and worked there for four years looking after all their labels getting all their music up onto platforms and also doing like some of the sponsorship stuff. for their artists. I guess that would have been an interesting time to be in digital. Yeah, it was kind of all new and interesting. Paul and me lived there for a few months and there was interesting conversations. A lot was changing. All the physical sales were starting to like, nailed. For it to touch more and independents were... Yeah, I see. Do you think, um, played out like... Like a hundred all selling. Well, more than that even. This perception that there'd be lots and lots of... stores like there are record stores or were record stores, physical stores. In the end it still remained like, you know, there's five or less the majority of sales come from on iTunes. That's pretty much. There's some other great stores, you know, obviously Dilly and Bonica and there's realistically still the majority of digital sales happening with a smaller group of what was originally in Visage. But at the same time there's lots of good stuff. It's interesting that you're doing internet radio as well. I guess that's first became... Well, yeah, we didn't have enough to download stuff, so it was all streaming, like, super low-res, and it was the college stations and the BBC and all of those, like, the early... ...out of San Francisco and their German equivalent, Club Radio out of Germany, who were doing broadcasts from, like, Maria and... clubs in Berlin. Interesting way to meet a lot of interesting people and BatchNet Radio went away. Yeah, I think it was the opposite. Yeah, I mean, I guess I was thinking about Machine, I guess, is kind of like what Town B was. It was quite a lot smaller. That was the broad concept of sort of a pure thing. And Jay, what's your kind of design? I was at art school doing photography and I was putting on parties and doing town bay and kept needing things designed so photography turned into design and took digital media at Sydney College of the Arts as a subject and I think I was first and only student pretty much, I think there were about three of us. Yeah, then I graduated, was running first draft gap. decided I didn't think photographers anymore and ended up landing in their design studio. So that was pretty much it and I just worked a lot and then I went and was still doing all Nathan's stuff on the site the whole way through of course and ended up working at the MCA for more than five years. So the MCA just for people aware is? The Museum of Contemporary Art. It's pretty much the biggest. Contemporary Art Museum in Sydney. cool place to work. When I worked there was no money and you know that was what like a 22 year old graduate with no design experience to run their design studio. But that was cool and by the time I left I was the only and they replaced me with three. But then I went and worked at Penguin Books for quite a few years and did lots of them. By that stage Nathan had Future Classic on the go in our living room and I would come home from Penguin every day to see Chad and Nathan and Hauka and whoever else was there working and they would have a list of stuff to design so I'd leave one office and get home to another office. I was in Chippendale and then eventually the job had Future Classic take over. And when did you start, Chad? It's almost six to start, yeah. I was, like, working various horrible administrative office jobs, which I wasn't in. Eventually I decided I'd had enough. So I took the sabbatical with university friends. Which was bad. Something. Yeah, because the musician was the... But I was jay pestering. I started sort of helping out a couple days a week. First of all, like, PR stuff. For us, it's like promoting flies around. And yeah, that's how I got involved. But then Chad was more hours than I was. Yeah, at the start, it was his house all day. Nathan and Jay weren't. It was me and the cat. Because Future Classic is kind of like a family business because Chad's sister's brother is your... Chad's sister is Jay's best friend. Chad's sister went to school with me. I see, I remember Chad telling me once. I was at Chad's school. It's definitely... So what sort of parties were you putting on while you were still at 5th Street? We started with um... You were putting parties on before then even. The first time I met Nathan was at my sister's 21st birthday party. I was DJ Food's version of The Crow. That would have been what? 1998? 99? But an excellent song. First interaction Nathan joined Ninja Chain. We did all the first tours for Fat Freddy's Drop in Australia. I heard... 12 inch Midnight Marauders, which Best 7 put out and spoke to those guys and they came over and did their first small, well first show was at the Gaelic Club, then they kind of went nuts after that and we worked with James Browning who was working with Future Classic. And what else did we do back then? So when was this? When did it start? This was like 2005, I think. Yeah, it would have been about then. And then we did the first compilation, ended in 2004, which was like... No, started 2005. First release was Deep Child, What's Going Wrong. What's with all this fighting going on? Oh Lord, what's going wrong? And that was really just because I was at Inertia traveling and some of the Euro distributors that I got talking with, we were talking about music and us to do a label and Inertia were... fine with that so we ended up using that as a platform to get the Australian artists that we were working with in the clubs here getting their music released. So Inertia is a distributor? Yeah, Inertia is a distributor. They're like one of the independent distributors in Australia. They look after Warp and Beggars Group and all those guys. And yeah, I guess it sort of went from there to being like, you know, getting remixes of some of the artists that we're touring or interested in. What sort of projects were you working on at Inertia Digital? I did all the first deals with them for iTunes. iTunes was just launching and we were working out how much they should pay us and trying to convince them and decide that we had an option to Controversation. by and large. Also we did some of the early broadcasts from the basement was streaming online so we set up broadcasts from the basement in combination with WorkWarp when they launched and we were conversing with them all about that sort of stuff. We built our own digital web store for Inertia. which was like a massive project back then. Which is still up and running. Which is still running. And like we had to integrate it with these super old school database DOS systems. So I was like geeking out majorly in that digital space. Things happen. But it was interesting. I guess technology has always been, or database technology has always sort of been. Yeah. To the physical, as soon as it was. The digital market has always been something that we've been intrigued. I think it's interesting, like, regardless of the commercial side of it, it's been interesting to see how the industry and everything's changed. And I don't think it was necessarily right before, so it's good to... It's not bad that it's changed, necessarily. It's just, I think, made it challenging for a lot of people who've been working in music for... I guess you would have seen those sort of challenges. challenges that these labels were facing when issuing, I guess, physical sales. Yeah, I mean, I think Australia has always been not their priority for a lot of the European labels, so when they saw an Australian buyer come over and say, let's talk about Australia, they were like, yeah, let's talk about Australia. And I kind of wasn't really like, a lot of the people were like DJs running labels, and quite a few of them did do well, a lot of the sort of labels. Australia was their second biggest or biggest market back then. But yeah, the larger labels like your Warps and your Ninja Tunes have just evolved and been really clever in surviving. So it's always been a pleasure. It was a pleasure working with those guys and seeing how they adapt. How much do you think has that experience into Future Classic? Well, I guess all of it in a sense because that's where we're coming from. So now we're still making physical records, but it's not something that we're doing without because we like it. Getting the business going more about doing the event. Looking after the artist's intellectual rights in the music as opposed to physical product is more what our business is built on. But the artists still like to have records and we still like to make records so. And I definitely like at the start when we were putting out artist albums as well. Like the experience was definitely so much better for us rather than just 12 inches. I mean at the start there was one artist album in just a year. We went from having a full length Jamie Lloyd, Stick Figures, Kidz N. So 2006? I'd say so yeah. I think it was the second year that I was on board that we did that. It Yeah, the Kid's End record was those things which you do once in your life. It was a very indulgent record. We had like, we were vibraphone to two inch tape and stuff. It was amazing. It was a good experience. Just not the most savvy business. That's really kind of surprised. Yeah, it was an important record out. Andy, who's the main brains behind the... He was the composer behind the project. He was our Australian Jazz Musician of the Year. He was working... recording for like 4 Hero and Seiji and doing or working with Mark DiClavolo and really in that compete space and so it was interesting to have him collaborate with a whole lot of Australian heavy jazz musicians like Carl Dewhurst and Simon Barker and all those guys and they're still around the corner from us in Chippendales so we just made heaps of friends. Future Classics is always visual, back to where design goes. That's because Jay is the oracle. I don't know, how did it come about fusing design and music? Like, we started dating. Nathan's really bossy and has all these big ideas, like, we're going to start a label, but we need some stuff designed. And then I'm really bossy, so I go, OK, well, you have to let me do whatever I want. We've learnt that Kaine's role as designer and all things visual is something that she looks after and we try to stay out of each other's way and let her freedom over that and we do what we want with the music so it's useful to have that socialisation. Were there many labels, I guess one like Ghostly International sort of comes to mind, like were there many labels... I guess pushing that aesthetics as well back in, that you were looking at in the early 2000s? No, we just wanted to do cover shoots, didn't we? And like do things. We wanted to do photography where we could, where we had enough. We made it just to do visual projects and had a lot of friends working in the resort. We wanted to work with people to make, and you know what? I had no shortage of really nice creative work in my day job. It was good, but we'd kind of always had this idea that it would be fun to work together and not have jobs and not just make things we wanted to make. But it is. So when did Future Classic become full-time? I think I was first full-time. So I was working out of Jay and Nathan's house. Pretty much, I couldn't be like, I could get done today. in our fridge. Everything would be like steady dishes. Still got some scars. But you were probably only working part-time at a national then, is that right? I managed to, they were very good to me, they managed to be pretty flexible. I was sort of spending a lot of time there, but I was able to get out. And you worked from home, it was a bit of a mixture. It was set up. And Jay was the last to join the ranks. Yeah, I probably left my job a year or so. Nathan and Chad were both. So when was that? What years were? So Chad probably started in 2005. And then gradually it became more and more days. Nathan probably, was it 2006 or something? No, it was... Well, I wasn't full-time until 2008. I forgot a whole chapter. After a night of show, I left. A big distributor in the US employed me to set up their Australian office. IOTA. So they're like the biggest independent. That was when we moved into the offices in Redfern. Yeah, so we got the office in Redfern. And it was also when I quit my job. So that was 2007. Was it? So I did that for a year and then IOTA got bought by Sony and things kind of changed. Australia wasn't really. for them they had like a hundred staff in the US and one in Australia which was me. So what were you doing? Tracks. The plan was to set up a fully fledged thing and services didn't really come in the end so I went to another genocide distribution. I guess that would have been a pretty exciting time. A little bit stressful. I mean it's a challenge to because we don't do things which... I guess it was around that time that we started doing regular sort of club events as well, but there was no set timeline to them. It was sort of like, okay, we can get estate, we can get recluse, we can get... But after that, we were like, okay, now that there's three, we need to have an... On the civic bookings and that was like a full-time... We started... serious engagement for them at that time. But before that you didn't really... Yeah, we've always been booking venues and yeah, there's lots of places so that's always been like a job to support these things. I suppose yeah, in the most recent sort of 2000 at the Civic like TA 2008 that was the first show here. First of our... No, we did them at MELP before that. Before that we did them at MELP. is all the local releases. Bill and Toby's as well. Did you find a Sydney sub-comp? It's that you're reared about, then it's fine. It's just when you're, if you get stuck, if something falls through and you're having to then that's really difficult. But the music started to see, then I think it sort of translates to people around us. Even though now I'm a senior member of the Statesman. Yeah, like I mean it's not a club full of our friends like it was once. Some people might. There's a handful of stay instead of, most of them are. Just our friends I guess. Well yeah, it's Saturdays and it's called Adult Disco. We started about a month ago almost. Yeah, coming up. Starting a weekly was a lot of discussion about that in the office, whether it was the right way we'd go about it. Kind of did it out of necessity because we were booking the Civic There was not enough consistency, basically. And so we were stuck being booking agents, having promoters come and sort of second a lot of the time. So we were like, we know how to do it. And not only sometimes just the wrong, it was so out of date. It was really inconsistent. Sometimes you'd have a really good act, but then the next week you'd have no one in town. And the good promoters felt let down by that as well. Because there wasn't a roof, like you had to start that sort of just, like you say, people just come to that? Well, it tends to be warehouses or, like, illegal things that happen. Not weekly, maybe more like... No, it's sporadic. No, there wasn't anywhere that you could, where do I go, I want to go out into. But we could comfortably say, go here. That was sort of what Adult Disco was about, trying to really consist. Something weekly that... And also bringing together the other people in Sydney who we've put who don't know necessarily the difference between all of the act and come along and check that it's nice. Going back to what you said before, Chad, about there's no, well, I guess prior to Adult Disco, there was a sort of essay. What do you think it is about Sydney? The least, I haven't travelled as much as Nathan. I know that that's what Sydney is like, but I can't talk on other cities as well. I've been a fair bit and I see that they seem to have I guess in other cities in the world is like you get this in different venues are quite expensive licensing or venues aren't necessary in some cities in the world so therefore music people can afford music policy which yeah I guess they're that real estate is super expensive tends to be people that own the majority of spaces so ownership is really controlled it's also a good reason it's true there's a long way to bring people like if you're in Europe and you're in Gent, Hamburg, you can have guests, you can do jet flights. It's like foreign resident international airfares. It's, you know, expensive. If you buy the books, which are sort of really expensive, if at the end of the day you're still the same as you would, it's still pretty niche. And there's so many festivals here, I guess there's another festival in one. We'll save for that, see all their friends. I think there's a lot of clubs. Now Adult Disco feels, and it's just as good as pubs I've been to, Comfort in Zurich and Londa in LA and some of the awesome, it feels like it's got that energy. It's really have international guests. Like they get a good club night, they have an amazing sound system. I assume that like that's what's it. So that's kind of, I don't know, it's exciting for us, but at the same time, a lot of effort to make that work. Like I guess that's the thing with it, there's a lot more riding on the parties that yes, in terms of tour, the airfare, the taxes, you know, as opposed to somewhere where like you're on an easy jet flight. Yeah, I mean like one of the artists, because there's a million different artists around the world, last week one of them was saying he just got booked yesterday to London, last minute. Last minute for us is about two months. So I mean we generally like influence each other in that we which is if sometimes we're just getting to see how the rest of Australia, like, there's some parties in me checking out recently as well. It's in Australia. It's, like, it's pretty unique. Like, I don't think it is. It's, sure, I have an American tour. It's really interesting seeing between the first time an artist comes here and the second time. First time, they want to expand a lot on where they've been. If they come to and they play with us, high expectation of like, or for instance, at one of the smaller cities, which is often, they're often a lot harder, especially the kind of acts that we, by the time they do end up getting like, wow, the second time, it's just so much more. It's really like on the ground that then there's actually like up to Australia, the second that much easier. In terms of we work a lot with festivals, like a lot of the artists for the first doing the touring stuff first tour like it's sort of sort of has that track which a lot of it there'll be four promoters who even just went big online maybe but all the passionate about the acts they're also in what that act will translate to they say is what that act is it's from the acts perspective it's good and awesome see for tourists who are traveling here is it they're able to be multi-weight twings during in koalas and seeing the hover bridge Once they've done that. We like good artists. We've done stuff like that previously. Like the first time they went into the studio with James, things like that, like when he was here the first time. It's really cool when that sort of collaboration. I don't know, it's just artists Australia for the most two weeks. So there's that week in between, which doesn't seem to happen that way. The idea for the future classic... Come on, Val. So the real part about, because we wanted something to have a design studio and we wanted to tell all of my design that there's more to us you know because I was working for all these you know still working for lots of galleries and doing all sorts of other people designing their brochures and their printed material signage ads and lots and lots of books for all the publishers for them didn't even know that future classic as in the music side existed because that world and they're not music people then with the music side you know sometimes we're pretty limited with our budgets and so we have to you know make flyers as cheap and cheerful as we can and we kind of wanted to show the music world that we do other design stuff as well so it was kind of partly just for fun and partly as a way to something that we could all leave with people that we met to go here's an interesting bit of editorial that so we could just It demystified a lot of what we were doing for people because even a lot of the people that are like, oh yeah, come back to us a month later and like, oh, you did this? When it's like nicely and it's like... We're working on so many objects. It's always been pretty hard for us to reach a classic in a line or two. Lots of our friends criticise us in the design studio or like, what is it? So, you know, we've always had this like fantasy that getting people to understand that. We just thought that by having the review we could all work on, which is really what we really like. Berlin Sessions that we worked on last year with Bex was a really good example because that was a project that touring for we could put on club nights and promote them and market them the way that we like and make the event a complete package with all the production values that we care about. and we could also have a bit of fun and do design and so it used all of our skills and it kept us all. The review is kind of about trying to get more people on board that maybe weren't entirely self-generated, maybe just to open us up to working with more partners and more as well as being so self-generated and, you know, how are we going to make this work, which kind of worked. Definitely if we wanted to be in the space we're heading in. working for those. I have cool ideas as well so you know collaborating is pretty fun and sometimes it'd be good for us to restrict our time to set a time when which things can happen. Then we lock off that certain time jack and it opens up something else which was more flexible that we can put on at another time so. I guess I mean the review is pretty broad and you know. It's a massive undertaking. thing to really understand you know at least then it's there and it is a document for those who choose to engage with us Thank you. A future classic review for people that haven't seen it. It's essentially a magazine with the whole interviews. We try to sort of blast. We try to make it interesting. Like Jay said, it knows us for our... And they don't know who Henrik Schwartz is. We want to sort of say this is who Henrik Schwartz is and this is why he's interested. It puts it in context for... We tried to bring things together. Like in one issue we had... We'd just done Christine Manfield's cook And, you know, we had a great relationship with her. So we wanted to put something in there that featured the book without putting a picture of the book going, here's the book we designed. So we used to make a menu of recipes from her book that she would feed to her friends before they went out to the disco, like that. So just start with creative ways of putting an interesting angle on different types of projects. Did Matt Moran... Pat Moran fed a hungry reggae band. What else have we had? Some interesting ones. We had Jenny Key talking about design processes from her fashion world to working with me on her book. Some counterfeit passports. Yeah, the most recent of those ones. To some of the booking agents in Europe and I gave them and they opened it up and they were just freaking out. I was like, yeah, we changed the numbers. Who was it? It was Jacques. We did Jacques, you know, Kim, and Tate. Chad just had the copies of their passports and the photos. We figured it'd take too long to send us a photo anyway. We touched with all of the artists that we took, but we get something from them. It's often deadline time. Yeah. It's so hard. When we're visiting them in their hometowns, they look after us, they take us out. It's always taking our photos. We've always tried to go deeper than a one-off event with an artist. It's more about an ongoing relationship. We're not artist managers as such, but end up doing a lot of things which are about... that artist, at least in this part of the world that is media. So we'll invite them down to a show of directors, film directors, to check out acts, you know, with the hope that they might be interested in licensing some music for them. So it's quite a sort of cohesive thing that we're trying to build around the artists. So the new licensing is called Stylus. Yep. How's it going? It's been, we've had quite a few things, from some tele-ads to quite a lot of online licensing, done some original composition projects. And, yeah, I mean, I think it's definitely something that we'll be putting a lot of effort into. It's something that I'm spending a lot of my time on at the moment. It's a fun thing to be doing as well. This scenario to fit with these visuals, like it's a, I think a lot of it's kind of like a little sort of, you know, it's like, here's, okay, what have we got here? And then we'll sort of huddle around the office and get our head nice to see who can get there. It seems like a pretty natural extension to what, and it's, you know, music supervision goes beyond club music. of interested in music that's not artists who are doing club music and also doing other things so it gives us that scope to be able to consider ways for those artists to reach that are often much wider than would be even like so in that sense it's really exciting on the label front I guess so I remember reading an interesting quote from, I can't remember if it was, I think it might have been a joint in, speaking about someone asked you in Australia to making music and geographically isolated, but our artists are irrelevant as anywhere. There's a lot of Australian music and it's Australian, but I think that's completely irrelevant. It's good music because it's good music. Yeah, while it's good to have a supportive local scene and... people who can educate and teach other people about things I don't think it's relevant in a sense it is great I mean it is interesting as well the awareness for some of the music that we're often a lot of the artists on the ground here especially in the kind of music where we're they end up getting their listeners are probably there's a base overseas for them yeah I remember reading a stat where you said 90% of your records are sold overseas yeah so it's for instance like records. A Melbourne artist, Francis Inferno Orchestra, doing some really great stuff. Radio station emailed me yesterday saying, oh, I just saw this because we represent one of your stylists. I asked to add on, like, he's actually from Melbourne. Like, it's your city. Like, you should know, you should be on this kind of thing. So it is interesting in that a lot of it sort of filters down. They find that people seem to find out that they're local artists after. I find... I think there's an incredibly healthy, like there's some amazing Australian producers, Wallace, Loin Brothers. The list goes on, so many people, all styles, doing great stuff. So we're right, they are local. There's a difference between liking them because they're local and liking them because they're me. I would definitely like to see audiences support those local artists more, the shows. Just talking about artists versus international artists, doing a weekly Saturday in terms of events. Sydney feels very much like an international artist people will turn out for that. When you put on a local artist there's not always that same support. I think there is but not if that artist is also playing like five in the next two weeks. We're starting to see with adult disco that the local nights are starting to work a lot better as well. Yeah it's a pretty local line the number of people nights that we're doing. It's really cool and like people from overseas. aren't here to play they're just international guests that are clued in and know their music that come down they see that it definitely helps like we've mentioned that they're they're familiar with adult disco they have things like that just to see that i don't know that a weekly saturday night can be working with locals as well as international do you feel like you have a responsibility to a local artist as a sort of bridge to or to act as a bridge when we started that was the started but it was more It was more artists who were just making cool music alongside all the other stuff. It was placeless, came in natural, presenting. It's like any time new records or local stuff is excited about on Saturday or something like that, it's pretty cool when you're playing. Oh, what's that? It's so responsive. I think we see it as a... She said, put those two shoes on, let's go dance another day. She said, Future Dotsie has never just been... But also there's been quite a load of work for us. There's been lots of people who've been doing Hauka with production. There's been already interns, current interns, past interns. Lots of young designers. Send illustrations our way and go, can you use them for something? Photographers, stylists. Holding all the copies of the reviews in our office while we eat pizza and drink. A lot of our CDs that we make of them, like a lot of them are done. Like we do, like a few check-ups with people that just... At companies that, you know, working in advertising that want us, that we represent, but those people are invaluable means for us to... There's actually lots of future. I guess that's one of the nicest things I've seen. I get the feeling it's more of a destination festival. It's not as niche-y. Some of the old cliches are starting to... Yeah, exactly. What were the cliches? Well, just there's no venues and there's more producers who are stuck in Melbourne and Berlin. Now in Berlin everyone's like, too many designers, too many DJs, too many Australians. Where? Maybe. ♪♪♪ Thank you. Bye.
