*whistling* so Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Dorian Paik, a bona fide Frankfurt veteran with links to key institutions like Robert Johnson, Cocoon and Freebase Records. He also runs Round Music, a label that's clocked up around 100 releases from the likes of Ricardo Villalobos and Christian Burkhart. Paik's seen a lot of trends come and go over the years, and in conversation with Matt Unicombe, he recounts his formative experiences at the Dorian Gray Club, before offering an illuminating take on today's dance music climate. As always, you can hear our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Dorian Paik is up next. So were you actually from Frankfurt? I am from Frankfurt. I was born in Frankfurt, born and raised in Frankfurt. That's where I grew up. Because I guess it seems like most people, well, a lot of people associated with the Frankfurt scene had moved there from surrounding cities. From surrounding cities or they were living in... Yeah, in suburbs or smaller cities close to Frankfurt. And so, of course, they started going out in Frankfurt because it was like the... biggest city around and yeah of course at that time also a lot of things and stuff was happening in Frankfurt yeah back then was a pretty special time for Frankfurt yeah for the Frankfurt nightlife I mean basically it was I think the end of the really good period in Frankfurt nightlife was the beginning of the 90s. By this time, it ended. So you think that, so the 80s are even more special than the 90s? I think so, yeah. Like when my parents were going out, I think this was really like the... peak of Frankfurt nightlife because you had this club called Dorian Gray in Frankfurt airport and at this time people were really like flying in from all over Europe just to be able to go to this club and then later by the late 80s early 90s definitely early 90s I think this period was over So what happened? Like, was there a reason? I don't know. I think, let's say, on a national level, still Frankfurt was very attractive and people from all over Germany would come to Frankfurt for the weekend to go out, at least from the cities that were like, let's say, in a two-hour range of Frankfurt by car. Let's say from Cologne to... to stuttgart to manheim and i don't know every all these cities uh people on the weekends they just got into their car and they they went to frankfurt and and also in the early 90s you had like three or four clubs playing electronic music And this was for a very, very long period until the late 90s, I would say. So like for a period of at least 10 years, you had at least three to five top-notch DJs in Frankfurt. every weekend more or less so the clubs everyone probably knows is dorian gray dorian gray omen omen exactly and xs also also you should count in and another one that may be for people internationally talking is not known so well but was also quite important at that time was the music hall in frankfurt it was another club because also they had a really really amazing sound system for that period of time and also like a big laser show and light show which still was quite important at at that time and uh so yeah this club was also quite famous and um actually was i think also the club where i had my first dj gig ever i think really yeah how did that go I got invited because at that time I was working at a record shop already that was in 1992. It was located in the Dorian Gray Club. There was like a little store and it was just like the very beginning of club wear and club fashion. So you could get all these fancy label shirts or from this club wear. companies like jive or shoot which was a german brand or or i don't know all kinds of of different companies that were selling a spiral or I think, I don't know, there was many, many different companies at that time. When you said clubwear, I was imagining a fluoro, like a rave. Yeah, yeah, like proper baggy stuff, huge XXL shirts and beanies and caps and I don't know what. Because at that time, especially in Frankfurt, you know. It was quite different. You need to dress in a certain way. And it was definitely not so easy to enter a club with sneakers and stuff like that because people were dressing up quite differently before. So with this kicking in of the... techno house club culture uh also this this um way of dressing changed a lot you know and then you could you could at least like from the look could tell ah okay this is this is also like a like-minded person you know because they were just like all dressing in this funny really funny clothes so yeah do you have any clothes left from that uh era some t-shirts in the basement. You should wear them again someday. Yeah, maybe. If I fit in there. No, but actually at that time I was a bit more bigger or heavy than now. So I think most of them, if I would wear them, they would be quite big. Even extra value. I think so, yeah. So... What clubs did you start? What clubs were you going to? Dorian Gray, obviously. Dorian Gray, because I was working there. But Dorian Gray was more like an after-hour club at that time because it was the only club that was allowed to open until noon. So actually, the right time to go there would be Sunday morning. So in the night from Saturday to Sunday, but Sunday morning around four or five o'clock because before it was only like suit and tie. And it was also really hard to get in if you were not wearing suit and tie. But of course, if the... If the door staff would know you, then yeah, they would let you in. Then from four or five, there was like a complete change of the audience. And then like all the people in those funny clothes. started to arrive, you know, and then it was completely changing again. And like from, let's say, the people that were working in all the bars and in the nightlife and, of course, people from other jobs, you know, like nightlife related, from the red light district or whatever, they were all going there after their work. So you had like a really interesting mix of people from all different kinds of social levels, which I think anyway is always the best for a good party in the end, you know. And what kind of music would they play the after hours? Was it still like pretty pumping? It was. It was not, okay, trippy in a different way. It was the music at that time, basically in Frankfurt was trance, you know, more or less we're talking about like IQ, Hardhouse, these kind of labels, you know, a lot of German productions, tempo wise, very fast. all above 130 so you'd be going there to dance not to kind of like uh well i mean okay it was it was a bit dreamy floaty also sound wise but this was then more like coming from the melodies or from the stuff going on around the beats but all the beats were pretty full-on progressive forward banging beats i would say yeah and do you think uh i don't know is there any club that you've been to since or that is around today that reminds you of dorian gray like does anything come close to that kind of maybe from let's say from the first time When I started going to Ibiza, which was in 95, I went there for the first time in 95. Some of those clubs there, maybe let's say a club like Pasha, they reminded me of these kind of clubs like the Dorian Gray like a proper proper nightclub I think it was also partly built by or some part of the sound system was also built by Steve Dash which as I know was also building the sound for I think Studio 54 And so coming from this really like proper old school of clubbing or going out, yeah, I think it's a different approach. And I just, what really still is in my memory is that both clubs, because you had two or even three clubs inside the door in grade, like three different floors. I remember the first time entering the main room, the big, so-called big club, which was located on the right side in the very end of the club. It was sounding so perfect and so... amazing i i still have this memory in my mind that it's like it's yeah i i hardly heard anything again in my life after that apart from maybe a handful of clubs worldwide that ever came close to to this sound in the very beginning then over the years it was changing because then they were Sometimes they were using different mixers. Sometimes they were using different record players because at that time also the standard record players in that club, they were the torrents and not the techniques. And they had like a little knob. They didn't have a pitch. They have like a little knob. where you turn and there you change the speed. So you don't have like a pitch on the side, but it's just like a little... like a little knob that you turn just a bit. So it's very, very, it takes a lot of feeling to really make them work and to cue the tempo in the same tempo. But then once they were running, they were quite stable, you know. And also they were not standing solid. they were hanging. So they were very, very sensible to any touching or nothing because sometimes you know when you're mixing a record or something and it's only like a tiny, tiny bit off beat and then you just do a little turn with your hand and stuff like this. This could be quite hard sometimes to do this because one wrong move and the needle was just flying off, you know. Or you touch it with your knees because some of the DJs, they were sitting, which I was never able to do. I could never sit while I was... playing but some of the like the older guys at that time they were like only sitting and djing while they were sitting and then also one wrong movement with your knee and you touch it like because it was hanging as i said but they were they were open from from the bottom And so you could easily touch the hanging record player with your knee, you know. So that was also another thing. Music stops. Yeah, exactly. Or the needle just flies completely off until the very end of the record in the middle of the track, which is quite annoying at that volume, you know. So I witnessed a couple of those from different people. I was always like super aware of never touching those record players in the wrong way. Well, now I guess it's a good habit, I guess. Now maybe you're also really careful around techniques when you play. I am. Yeah, I am. Definitely. But I mean, with the techniques, it's like after a while you get so used to them. So you really know like every inch. of the scale. Nowadays, more or less, it really depends of the monitoring how my set goes you know because all the rest is just like okay you know okay now it sounds like this i just need to pull it a little bit more down and i'll be fine for the next couple of bars or i lower the speed a bit then it's gonna click in and and then i'll be fine you know and most of the times i try not to touch the record at all if it's possible you know and just do everything with the pitch more or less so when did you get turntables turntables I got in 1992. So were you in high school then or had finished? I was about to finish high school. I finished also high school when I was 18 or 19 to be honest. And in 92, yeah, so I was 18. 18 I think and I think I remember you telling me that you've just had music jobs is that right yeah more or less I mean okay before I was working also in my first job was when I was 16 I was working like in some department store for sports clothes and besides that More or less, most of my jobs were always music related. The first one was in this record shop that I mentioned before, which was called Air Embargo in the Dorian Gray. Then afterwards, I was working for several record shops in Frankfurt. One a bit more famous one was called Boy Records, because also some people that later worked in Delirium or that were running other shops, or one of the founders from Noiton Distribution, all of these guys were working at Boy records at some point. Later in 2001, I started working at Freebass Records, where then I worked for seven years almost until 2008. I was working at Freebass Records. I see. So going back to this time, like in the early 90s, I think I remember reading, I can't remember where, maybe it was the Robert Johnson book, but it was talking about how if you weren't like a big DJ, it was hard to get records. Is this true? It is true until, I think, until the first record shops, or I mean the very first one. which was not even my period, but of course I still remember it from seeing it and also from hearing stories about this. It was called City Beat Records, I think, or City Records or something. It was located in the train station and it was run by Tala, this guy, that was founder of the Techno Club. And they started bringing the first imports or import records to Frankfurt, which was at that time stuff like coming, like all this music from Belgium, like Knitzer App and Front 242 and this. ebm music like the first blueprint of electronic music and it was quite popular this was even a bit before the actual techno kicked off and you had bands like pile or bigot 20 where zip also was a part of releasing on labels from this guy called Talla. They were already making music and doing stuff around this time. But this was a bit ahead of my time, maybe like two or three years. And some of the guys like Ricardo or Zyp, they witnessed this period. Ricardo was also playing at that time, some others as well. But then me, I started a bit later, around 92. So I didn't experience this period so much. Straight into house and techno. Yeah. Pretty much. Nice. Pretty much. So how did you get the job at Freebase? How did this happen? At Freebase, they knew me. And in the beginning, they were joking all the time and said, hey, man, you can't work for us because you are our best customer. So how can our best customer work for us and this and that? But then, of course, they knew that I was a reliable person and that I like music a lot. I also know a lot. And yeah, so then they decided to give me this job. And at the same time, I also started working for Raw Music, which was existing for almost three years at that time. One of the owners from Freebase, his name is Olaf. He was also one of the two founders from Raum Musik and his partner had left him. And so he asked me if I want to first work for him. And then after a couple of months, he asked me if I want to become his partner. like taking care over the A&R part, because I was a DJ, I had a lot of knowledge about music in general, and so if I wanted to take over this part and become his partner for the label, which I did, and which I am still today, and it's still the two of us running. this label we are nearly our 100th release which will happen beginning of next year unfortunately my partner will leave me because he just does not have the time anymore because he's very busy with his other daytime job and so i think This will be like the last year where we will do it together because we said until catalog number 100, we will do it together and then he will step out from it, I think. That's the idea at the moment. I see. And you had released on Realm before working there, right? I started working for it and then he was kind of like encouraging me because of course I was not like, okay, I'm the A&R now, so first thing we do is we do a release of myself. This would have been a bit the wrong approach, I guess. But yeah, so he was encouraging me. And at that time, I was already like doing my first experiments, like working on some tracks with my friends and stuff, because at that time I didn't have any knowledge about how to make a track or how to use any computer or sequencer or any drum machine or whatever. And so over the years, I was in the very beginning always like doing music only with friends. And then later on, I also decided to get my own equipment and to do like a small setup at home where I can also work on stuff myself. And then besides that, to work in projects with other friends that have much better and more professional studios than myself. And then just do my stuff at home and the other stuff just used the studios of the friends. So how much were you DJing in Frankfurt in the 90s, like before Freebase? Long time. Were you like one of the main local DJs? Well, one of the main in the beginning, maybe not. But then after nearly 10 years of constant work, I think I could say that I was one of the main Frankfurt DJs. And were you playing a lot of this? Because the 90s was also pretty good. for music in Frankfurt, right? Yeah. Playhouse, Perlon. Yeah, exactly. Were you playing a lot of this stuff? Were people in Frankfurt excited by this wave of Frankfurt music? Because looking back, it seems like it was really big, but I wonder if at the time it felt like something big or... Well, for us, it was just like the new release from a local label, which, of course, some of the stuff I like. Not everything was my cup of tea, but of course I was always checking the records and at least from Playhouse. Anyway, I got promos most of the time because I had a friend working there at that time. Or we got them from Freebase as well. Heiko always brought like a couple of spare copies from the latest releases. So I was always pretty much up to date with those records. Perlon not so much, but Perlon I also, I bought them. Or Perlon was in the same distribution like Raum was in the very beginning, which was called Noitone. And so, of course, we would always get the releases from Perlon as well or from other... local labels because a lot of really nice stuff was coming from the Frankfurt area already at that time. All this stuff from C-Rock, for example, or other artists as well. Yeah, there's some labels back then that people might not know about. that you think are really good? Do you know any off the top of your head that are worth checking? Well, yeah, I mean, maybe not so much, but there were other labels like this label called Research that had a few, like this famous release by Ricardo Bosch or MDMA. And there was another one with the Ricardo remix. There was a... Low Soul record, I think there is a Low Soul record as well, but under a different name, maybe Don Disco. Another C-Rock record, as I remember, then some of the Stir 15 stuff, the old stuff on C-Rock's label or from his Dubstar. project um so there's quite a few things yeah there's lots to dig into exactly from from this from this period yeah plus a lot of the old playhouse stuff klang ongaku which are all labels that have been related to to this group of of friends that was running playhouse and klang ongaku at that time which was basically ata heiko human fluegel and johan ellingwood the guy from alter ego it was these four guys running those labels that i just mentioned and i guess you knew most of these guys from working at freebase also i guess you saw them pretty often more or less yes i mean not that they were like super close friends but over the years i got to know them better and then yeah after a while yeah after a while yes in the beginning not so much I was definitely more connected to the to the Freebase crew in the beginning and more hanging out with them because Carsten was like a close friend of mine and we've also been DJing together a lot is Carsten meat exactly and Chris Wood is Chris German last name yeah Holz which means wood in German, so he decided to call himself Chris Wood. If you've been working at a record shop from '92 to the 2000s, you would have seen a lot of changes. Yeah, changes in music, first of all, because of course in the beginning it was very hard, like in '92 when I started in this shop in Dorian Gray Club. It was pretty full on techno, like even hardcore, hardcore, partly Gabba, you know, because the guys that were running this shop, they were part of this crew called PCP, Planet Core Productions. And their main producer was Mark Trauner called The Mover. which at that time was quite established as a producer. I mean, he had releases on R&S and a lot of other labels, and he was a very talented producer, or still is, but... Then he decided to go into another direction musically and he still is producing a lot of this hardcore and gabba stuff but he also did a lot of commercial productions even releasing a track, believe it or not, with Scooter. So, yeah. And he was the first one ever to give me a pile of records and say like, hey, these are your first records, 30 or 40 records coming all from their distribution because they were all already also doing a distribution at that time. And so he said like, yeah, this is your first record. and now you are a DJ and from here you can start collecting. I mean, I was buying records before, but other stuff, but these were like my first 30 or 40. records of electronic club music or of electronic music in general and besides hip-hop which which i was buying before which is also electronic music in some way but for me i never referred to hip-hop as electronic music even though it is you know but for me electronic music when i say this then it starts like with house and techno and and rave and going to clubs and stuff like that And were you traveling outside Frankfurt much? You mean as a DJ or as a raver? Both, I guess. As a DJ, of course, in the beginning, not so much. I mean, still, I was lucky because working at record shops was helping quite well at that time. So every now and then when people from other cities were coming and they liked my choice of records or what I gave them. Every now and then someone was like, hey, I like the stuff that you give me. I think you're a nice chap. And do you want to play at my party? So already after a couple of months, I got my first gig in Switzerland, for example. Not bad. To play in Basel, for example. So that was helping a bit. Besides that, yes, as a raver and clubber myself, I was traveling a lot at that time. At least from the early 90s, at least for 10 years, even a bit longer. I was going, I was, I mean, I mentioned before in 95, I was going to Ibiza for the first time. Besides that, I went to Amsterdam many, many times because I had a close friend living in Amsterdam. So I witnessed a really nice part of the Amsterdam clubbing culture as well, of which until now one club called Roxy is, I think, one of my top three, top five clubbing experiences ever. It was an old cinema. in the center of Amsterdam. And I don't know, I've heard it was like also the favorite club of Madonna, for example. So when she went out in Amsterdam, she always used to go there. And it was an amazing location, really, really nice sound system. And I still remember until today that Dimitri, not Dimitri from Amsterdam, but this guy called Dimitri Kneppers that is still DJing. Nowadays, I witnessed a couple of sets from him there. And I have to say, until today, it's some of the best DJ sets I ever heard or witnessed in person. Definitely my top five DJ experience ever until now. I would say what I witnessed in that particular club. Besides that, I was going to Belgium. and traveling to Berlin for the Love Parade, 92, 93, 95. Yeah, all these kinds of things. So how would it work? Would you catch the train to a party? Oh, it was pretty... They made it even more easy for us because, for example, the first time I went to the Love Parade... It was a cooperation with Deutsche Bahn, with the German train company. And they were offering like this train going to Berlin. And it was a train from Frankfurt going to Berlin with Sven playing on the train. And I think DJ Duck and a few other DJs as well. And you could get like a combi ticket and you just had to get like on the train, have like a full on party until your arrival in Berlin. Then you would have your pre-booked hotel that was already included in the package, you know, and you just had to attend the parade, attend some of the parties and then just make sure you're back on time to go to catch your train back to Frankfurt. So a lot of things at this, I mean, it was very popular, you have to imagine. They even, I mean, this I didn't do, but they were offering the same thing with a plane, with a boat, with pretty much everything at that time. There was Raven Cruise, which was with a boat. It was organized by Die Partisanen, which is this... this brand or this company originally hailing from Munich. I think now they're also based here in Berlin and they still do stuff like tie break, for example, things like this. Or they also brought to us Rave on Snow or stuff like that. And then also there was like the camel air rave at that time. And then it would be like the same concept, but with a plane, you know, so you would get like these full on careless packages. You don't have to worry about anything packages and just pay a certain amount of money and then they would they would take. But with Ibiza, for example, when I when I went for the first time in 95. I just went with a friend. He knew about Ibiza and he was also like my mentor, DJ wise at that time. And so he said, hey, you know, I think we should go there. We should check it out. And then we just bought like plane tickets and went there and we asked some friends if we can stay with them. Or we rented like a cheap hotel in the beginning. And you play in Ibiza now pretty often. Since 10 years now. Since 10 years, more than 10 years, 11 years now. My first DJ gig in Ibiza professionally where I was going just to play was in 2005. I was on the terrace of Amnesia for Cocoon. where I'm still a resident. And this year I'm playing even four times in total for Cocoon at Amnesia. So playing Ibiza, is it different to playing in Europe? Do people want big sounds? How is it going from Frankfurt? Yes, yes. I mean, when I went for the first time, Again, this was really like a turning point in my DJ career also and also for my perception of music because until that time, I came more from like a techno background. I mean, in the beginning, as I told you, I was pretty full on techno, even like hardcore in some way then. changing a bit into this trancy kind of sound, which was very popular at that time in Frankfurt, like the other stuff that I mentioned before, like IQ, Hardhouse, all these kind of like very trancy and melodic and emotionally big sounding records. And then going to Ibiza in 95, I discovered something else, namely house music, you know, which was not so popular in Frankfurt at that time. And of course, then when this club that I mentioned before called DXS started inviting other DJs. all of a sudden you would see like hey wow there's also something else there was like all of a sudden like the merc boys playing or laurent gagne or carl cox or andrew weatherall all these kind of djs you would find on a on a wednesday night playing in frankfurt yeah which was working pretty good because some of these nights you had like 1000 people coming to this club Just to see, for example, Laurent Gagné playing. I remember the first time when he came, there was maybe 200 people, it was not so packed. Next time he came, there was a queue outside the club, you cannot imagine, and it was maybe in the turnover like 1,000 people attending this club on a Wednesday night. That just all came to hear him play. And so this was a good school for myself because at that time I was going out every possible occasion. And of course, to check out all these DJs that some of them I heard about it, some of them I got recommended by friends or I knew some of their productions. And all of a sudden you have the possibility to go there and see them in person and listen to them. which was great, you know. I'm really happy that a lot of people that I really liked or that I discovered or their productions, I was able to witness them or to hear them in person in a club. It's hard to imagine. Well, I guess the scene is very different. now you can't imagine those kind of DJs drawing those kind of crowds now like I wonder what changed like maybe festival all these kids are going to festivals now like yeah maybe I mean I mean it depends the heavyweights will always be the heavyweights you know but still there are a lot of DJs from that time that actually yeah that actually are either maybe a bit out of fashion or I think they also um they lost a bit to the connection of of what is currently happening you know in in electronic music and I mean it's hard you know also in some way When you're traveling like every week and every weekend and you've got all the routine and you are a big name. And of course, people get lazy at some point. I mean, not lazy, but they get used to certain routines, I think. And so then maybe they think it's not so important anymore that they buy the music themselves. which you can see then as if you're running a label and you get these nice feedback sheets, you know, like downloaded for. I won't mention any name, but I mean, what's that downloaded for? And then the name of the DJ, meaning like the DJ is not even able to download his own music anymore. Or what's the point of this? But okay, that's something everyone has to decide for himself. But I think it's really, really important if you want to be on top of your game to at least find three to five records. I'm just mentioning a number now. Of course, it can be more, but sometimes there is not more than three to five good records in one week. But at least you should discover three to five. records every week if you can find more of course you can find more but after a certain time and with a certain experience I doubt that you will really find more than 10 to maximum 15 records that are really really really exceptional and very good So always try to find something just for the fact to be able to excite yourself because only if you can excite yourself and keep it interesting for yourself, you will be able to do this for others as well. I think. So have your record buying habits changed as you get more experience as a DJ? Yes. Like now you say it's harder to find. Yes, definitely. I mean, if you work in a record shop for more than 10 years, which I did, and then I'm running a label and then I'm a DJ myself now since 24 years. So imagine if... Imagine the amount of records and stuff that I was listening to over the last years. And still, besides that, I get stuff for the label to listen to. I get stuff from all my friends that are producing because they want like a feedback or they want me to have the stuff or they want me to play it. Plus all the promos that I get for myself being a DJ. related artists, related labels, other labels that also want me particularly to play their tracks or to have their tracks. So that's quite an amount of stuff that I need to listen every week. And besides that, I'm still more or less every week checking the lists of hardwags, checking the lists of Rush Hour. other record shops as well just to get an idea what's there and then in case there is something that i see i will go online or i go to one of the record shops here in berlin that i'm used that i'm visiting frequently like space hall or hardwax and then i try to find it there So what does a track these days need to have to get your attention? Is it like a weird little melody or like nice drums or a combination of things? I wouldn't nail it down on a particular element inside the track. It's more about the feeling of the track. It's more about the feeling of the track and if I have the impression. Okay, I mean, there are some stuff that you really just buy for playing, which I would consider as your tools, you know, like you're a craftsman and you need certain tools, you know. Of course, these are records that can play maybe for a shorter... period of time or maybe only for one season or for a couple of months but of course the goal should always be that they are as timeless or as out of fashion as possible so you can play them in a couple of still play them in a couple of years and not like when the fashion's over or the sound of the moment has changed to, to the next big thing, you know, then, uh, you cannot take all your records and just, uh, throw them in the, in the gutter. Basically. I guess you've seen a lot of trends come and go. Yeah. And, and always something where I'm referring to, uh, when people are asking me about this is like, And I think it's pretty true. I don't know if one has read the book by Laurent Gagné called Electroshock. And there he is referring to a quote by Jeff Mills or there's an actual quote by Jeff Mills inside the book. I cannot remember quite precisely, to be honest. But he's saying that everything is coming in circles. Why there's always there's also a record by Jeff Mills that it's called Cycle 30. everything is coming in not circles in cycles cycles meaning that it's just like a wheel rotating with the with a certain amount of time so At some point, disco will be super hot. The year after, everybody will be so tired of disco that then everybody wants something reduced and nobody wants to listen to melodies and funky beats anymore. Then it will be minimal. Then after Minimal, everybody will discover again that it's really nice to have some vocals and something super warm sounding. So then there's the huge house revival that we have also been witnessing a couple of years ago. And then after the house revival, everybody is back into really dark. sounding drone techno you know and and it's always these cycles and they just keep on repeating you know over and over again because nobody will come up with something completely new nowadays it's just like about combining certain elements from different music directions and just make them sound fresh and make them sound 2016 and that's it, I think. Do you still see DJs and people making music that don't get caught up in trends? Well... Apart from the ones that I've been following for many, many years and where I have a lot of records of, that always have been doing their thing, more or less, which is also the reason why I follow these artists. I think a lot of people... too much in trends. And also, it's ridiculous. I mean, of course, you have to go with certain movements or with certain developments. Otherwise, you would make something wrong, you know. But I think it's also good to try to stick to your own sound in case you have your own sound, which I think is the most important thing as a DJ. your own sound otherwise you will always be just like a copycat you know of something and especially what I don't like at all is like these people that told you like five years ago that minimal is super cool and that's the really big thing and two years later they tell you the same thing about house music and that they always have been deep house heads from the core of their heart you know and then now like now they tell you like that this dark, banging, crafty, reduced sound that maybe you would find in Berghain, that this is really like the stuff that they dig, then I think it's a bit too much, at least for someone with my experience and with my perception of music over all those years. Because it's a funny thing, like when you're younger, You read in interviews or you hear people talking, saying, like, you hear people say things like, oh, yeah, it's just hype. Like, this DJ, this person is just following hype. And when you're younger and haven't seen these cycles, it just seems like this. that people just say when they want to complain. But once you've been around for a little while, it's a real thing, these trends. For me, it was exactly the same. I was also thinking, I don't understand this so much with the cycles and this and that. But now, with a bit more age... more of experience and like really like watching the development from the early 90s until now which is like 24 years i have to say it's 100 true and jeff mills knew exactly what he was talking about and laurent gagne as well and this is pretty much the reason why he was referring with this quote inside his book And so I think these guys, they know what they are talking about. They are even older than me. They are even maybe a bit more wiser and experienced than me. I think that's pretty much the deal. And they pretty much nailed it down with these quotes. So what trend do you hope comes next? At the moment we have breaks. Yeah, breaky, experimental, not straight, not dance floor aiming. I don't know. What's next? Loopy house? That would be good for Realm. Maybe. No, I think at the moment I'm on the, exactly on the, on the, on the other side of the hype, like super out of fashion. But yeah, I don't mind. I just really try to, to do what I feel and to do what I like. and still try to be a bit different than from what most of the others are doing. I think it's okay because the label is still alive. We are doing quite well still after all those years with nearly 100 releases. So, yeah, I think we're doing something right. That's the thing. What other labels, what German labels in this kind of scene or whatever you want to call it, this kind of area, were around when Realm started? From the ones that are still active, the only one that I can think of is Perlon. And maybe then, I don't know about Kanzleramt, but they were off the map also for some time. I think now that Heiko started releasing again, Heiko Lauchs I'm talking about, I've seen some recent stuff again. And there are a few others, but... The only one that always keeps popping straight into my head because they started more or less around the same time, also coming from the same area, is Perlon. Yeah. So what, that makes Realm almost 10 years? Perlon is 97, right? No, no, no. Realm is now, it was founded in 1998. Okay. It makes this 18 years. Oh, yeah. I need to go back to high school. 18. So that's 18, but I'm running it. I'm running it since 2001. I'm in charge of the A&R and everything. So I'm running it now basically for 15 years. So what's your take in this? this vinyl resurgence. It's funny, like, I don't know if you saw it. We just published this small interview with the Freebase guys. No, I haven't seen it yet. Yeah, it just went up this morning. Anyway, we asked the same thing, like, oh, what do you think of this so-called vinyl comeback? And they said, yeah, we've kind of seen it, but it would be really nice if all the DJs and producers and label owners pressing vinyl would also play it. So it seems like a lot of people are actually a bit annoyed at the situation. That is also true what they say. Okay, from one side, but I think you have to divide this into several aspects. One aspect is from the label side, it is really annoying because it takes so long at the pressing plants at the moment. It's just ridiculous. But this is not because of electronic music. This is because of rock. And all these other genres that now have discovered after all those years of selling CDs like crazy that it's really cool to have a vinyl that comes with a fancy cover and an inlay and a booklet and a poster because they can sell it for much more than just like a piece of plastic, you know, like which the CD basically was. So they are causing this super long waiting period for, at the moment it takes like nearly three months from when you send the tracks for mastering until you receive the white label. How long would it used to take? The white label, sometimes you got it after 10 days. And nowadays it's like six weeks to receive the white label and then another eight to even 10, 12 weeks until you get the finished product. And this is still fast. Some labels, they wait even longer. So imagine the amount of time that you would need to plan this in advance. So that is one aspect from referring, from going back to your question. The other aspect, I think what Carson and Chris meant with their statement is like, yeah. Vinyl is back and kids and younger DJs are more keen on buying vinyl and rare vinyl and to dig and to find special stuff. A lot of the people, like I said before, they get a bit caught up in their routine and they all run labels and a sub-label for house and this and that and another label for breaks and blah, blah, blah, blah. But none of these guys is playing vinyl anymore. They just arrive to the gig, they plug in their USB. They play the last 25 promos that they received from their friends and that's it. And that's their DJ set. I think... The truth lies somewhere in between, as with a lot of things in life. You need to have a bit of both, you know, not only the top 20 from your friends, but also the top 20 from stuff that is currently out in the record shop. So therefore, I think it's really important that as much as your schedule allows it, but at least like every two weeks, at least. you should be able to drag yourself into the record shop and to look for some new stuff for some exciting music and of course if you live in a bigger city like berlin i'm also aware of the fact that it's not possible to attend like three record shops in one day but then do it like weekly This is how I'm doing it myself. It's like one week I'm going there, another week I'm going to another shop. When I'm traveling a bit more in summer, then maybe it can also be two or three weeks where I can't make it. But then again, I make sure that I'm visiting the tool. record shops where I'm going frequently here in Berlin or three record shops. So you're still finding lots of new music to buy? As I said before, it depends of the week. To be honest... here at Space Hall in Berlin I was quite happy all the last times that I went there I found a lot and sometimes was even more that I actually wanted to take you know or that I was able to take in the very end you know because I said that's a bit already like over the budget you know okay well then okay these two maybe I don't need them so much but then I take the other 10 And sometimes at Hardwix also, but Hardwix, their selection is already quite tight. So from their selection, I just find a few that I can use. Hardwix, from my perception, is more like really special stuff, stuff for listening. But to me, to play in the club. there is not so much but still I think it's one of the best record shops here in Berlin by far together with Space Hall maybe it's interesting because with this new Discogs hype it seems like there's a lot of people not playing so much new music Yeah, this also became a fashion. But then I really have to question, what's the point? What's the purpose of this? Yeah, it's cool. But in the end, you're just repeating history. Something that has been done already, something that has been said already. And from my perception, then you are also an oldie DJ in some way. then you are like a foxtrot DJ or like a rock DJ or something like this like totally caught in his niche and only repeating over and over and over. Of course, there's lots of stuff to discover and some crazy B-sides and this and that, but I think it's always an aspect of techno or of electronic music has been to find new stuff and to deliver new stuff. And so also there, like I said before... a bit of both worlds, you know? When do you think the shift happened? Because now it seems like if you go see... Lots of DJs from your kind of world. It's 80% old music. Yeah, it has gone a bit out of hand because some of these DJs, they just took it to another level with digging. How special can you be? It's not about being special. It's just about doing what you feel. and do this with a lot of passion, and then it comes from the heart, and not for a certain purpose, or to fulfill any ideology, or a certain, yeah, or just a certain fashion, you know, it's like, if you have a certain taste, you will not play any shitty music, and so what's the point of like, knowing everything from all the labels from A to B and C and then at some point it's like okay guys what are you going to discover you know then this is not like statistics buying records is not like doing statistics you know this is like This is like a math approach in some way a bit, you know, like this. Oh, yeah, I know the complete back catalog from this label and from this artist. I know every track. And yeah, it's cool, but it's good to know. And knowledge is always important, you know. But at some point you're making the whole thing a bit hard for yourself, I think. And I remember in the past. it always was like this, that to discover certain records, you would need years before all this world of instant information with Google and with... DJ lists and with certain forums like totally analyzing every set that you can find from every like top-notch DJ in the internet let's say Zip, Ricardo blah blah blah blah and then it's ridiculous it even happens with my own sets you know I post a new set online then I go a couple of weeks later or I do a podcast and then I see these forums and there's like some geeks at home, like analyzing, trying to find out every single track from the set. You know, I mean, what's your approach? I don't have any problem with sharing my information. And whenever someone comes and steps up to me and asks me like, hey, what's this track? that's playing, he will receive the information. But I think the big, big turning point of all this thing was the internet and just the sudden and direct access to all this information with one mouse click. You listen to a set or you find a video on YouTube, then one guy is like... putting under it track ID. Two minutes later, the next guy tells him what it is. And an hour later, he's in the record shop already buying the record or ordering it online somewhere. Well, that's the sad thing. It's most of the time old music. It would be really cool if it was new tracks getting ID'd and helping the labels out. Exactly. But of course, everybody just focusing on these things. To be honest, I also, I mean, not like 300, but I also paid even up to 80, 90, 100 euros. But that's like the maximum, maximum of what I was. I would ever spend on music. And I have to say, nowadays, from my point of view, I'm not willing to spend this amount of money anymore on any record. It's not worth it. It's not worth it. It's just... a fashion prize of the moment because certain people are playing this record or because some people were clever enough to buy all the records or all the releases that have been listed on Discogs. And then they make their business out of this. You know, they wait until the record gets in fashion, until some crazy fantasy prizes start coming up. and then they will sell these records you know and i think this is totally ridiculous to spend 300 euros or 250 euros on one record no matter what it is when you can go to a record shop with the same amount of money and you can go home with maybe 10 old records and 50 new records then what's the point of spending this amount of money on one record it's absolutely No point. It's just a cry for attention. Nothing else. Do you think it's easier to be a DJ these days? Like with the internet and with CDJs, like going back to the mid- It's very easy to being able to call yourself a DJ, I think, but... To really make your living from it and to establish yourself in the scene, it's very, very hard. If you are not part of one crew or one group or if you are an outstanding producer where people will automatically be linked to your person or to you as a DJ by your productions, it's nearly impossible. without productions. Nearly. This is two hands full of DJs that were capable of doing this by other things, like we just said, by excessive digging and also creating their own... sound and moment in a special way but besides that I think it's nearly impossible I don't wanna I don't wanna yeah Be negative. Yeah, be negative or scare young people, you know. I mean, if you want to do it and if you really like it, just do it, you know. Don't think too much about it. Just follow the music, buy music, buy records. first of all and most important as I said before already is try to find your own sound and anyway if you want to do it the right way this will take you at least 10 years at least some maybe a bit faster but that's the minimum amount I think like 6 to 8 years until you can say, okay, I know exactly what I want and I want to play it like this and this is me and this is my sound. Ten years into a DJ career, you've already known how to beatmatch for a long time. What does the experience teach you? How do you go from being okay to professional standard? In the end... even more experience because the more situations you will find yourself in you will discover the variety of situations that you can be in and then it's just like okay this is a situation like this i have to do this now and and and just like to to be able to analyze the situation and to analyze also the solution to the problem or to think of the solution to the problem. I mean, not problem, but to the situation. But with many, many situations or different situations, there are always different problems connected to it, you know, like in terms of the sound, in terms of the... surrounding in in terms of the set time in terms of the situation on the dance floor there's so many tiny little aspects that can influence a DJ set, I think. So how many gigs for you now will go smoothly, where you look back and say there were no problems, like I was able to just play my set and it went well? Unfortunately, not too many. Again, it just happened to me last weekend, and it's very frustrating, but I still do it. is I take one or sometimes even two days or afternoons where I completely just go through my shelves, try to dig out some other stuff or to pull out some other stuff from my collection, trying to create like a nice set. So then I invest some time. I arrive to the club. Then I see, okay, it's not possible to play any vinyl. So let's say from 10 times, 5 or 6 times, I can only play from the stick or from CD, which then is really frustrating because I'm playing from stick or CD a lot. But to be honest, and this is a message to all the club owners. The situation in the club does not allow it to play vinyl and digital on an equal level. And many, many times you are forced as a DJ just to play from your CD and USB or hard drive again because the vinyl setup is shit and it doesn't allow you to play one record without any feedback. jumping off the needle, et cetera, et cetera. So when you're preparing for two afternoons, like Vera said the same thing, that she's also spending like a long time preparing. Are you pulling out records and thinking what fits together? Like what takes so long? Yeah, no, it's about first... Yeah, Vera and me, I think we have the same approach somehow, you know. I think what she does the same is like we, first of all, we think, okay, what's the situation where I'm playing in? Because many, many times, you know, already, okay, sometimes you don't know anything. So then you have to be prepared even a bit better. But okay, you will know, okay, this is this and this kind of party. playing at this and this time so okay i'm playing more in the peak time so of course i need more stuff that is driving a bit banging not too deep not too special just like the kids gets the people going on the on the dance floor also with a certain size of the club And then there are some other parties where you know you will have a very good crowd. People are open-minded. You are playing because it's you playing and people want you to play the stuff that you play. You have like an idea in your mind, a concept of a certain sound and then you try. to pull out new stuff old stuff unreleased stuff but all referring to this concept or idea of a certain sound you want to play for this party i think that's that's the approach so you
