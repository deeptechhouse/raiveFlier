Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Will Lynch, and I write the news at Resident Advisor. Over the past 10 years, few techno labels have drawn as much attention as mine has, the Berlin-based crew of expatriates led by Ritchie Houghton. Among the label's most essential members are Magda and Mark Huell. From their teenage years playing parties in Detroit to their stadium-sized gigs during the Contact tour, these two artists helped define the lean and punchy sound of Minimal. Both are currently on tour together promoting their new albums. The day before they shipped out, I talked to them about video games, communist Poland, and why sometimes it feels uncool to be Magda and Mark Huell. you What was your life like pre-Detroit? You know, growing up, coming to Detroit, first finding out about, you know, the music scene. and everything. How did all that happen? Well, I came over with my family to America, to Texas, when I was nine. So that was my first impression of the U.S. And then two years later, we moved to Detroit, which is completely the opposite. So when I arrived in Detroit, I cried because it was very ugly. It was the middle of winter. really not like sunny Houston at all. So you liked Houston? I mean as a child sure you know you come from a communist country and then you have everything and it's sunny swimming every day it was paradise it was really nice. And so how old were you when you left Poland? I was nine so this was at nine and then 11 we I moved to Detroit Yeah, it was really, really rough. Really a rough place. And I didn't actually start enjoying it until later in high school. I started finding out about all the... the things happening all the strange things happening around but so you were old enough that you like remember the difference between oh yeah being in a communist country and being yeah no definitely i mean i wasn't thinking oh my god i'm in the communist country no that's all i knew so it's fine i just remembered there wasn't anything to buy at the stores people had money but nothing to spend it on So, and you had to wait like 10 years to get a phone approved for your flat and weird stuff like that. But Detroit was still depressing after Poland. Oh yeah. I mean, Poland was nice still. Not that it was ugly. But you had grass to play on. Yes. I ran around in some grass. In Detroit it was... I mean, we moved into a rough area and it was really... Yeah, glass. We replaced grass with glass. Broken glass. So yeah, that was definitely a tough... transition but then I learned. Then you met me? Yes, then I met Mark and my whole life changed. How did you guys meet? We met in Windsor actually through some friends. Yeah. At 13 Below. Oh yeah, okay. Was it already then? That was earlier. Yeah, so Rich had a club. A small one that fit about 50 people. And you were doing a night there, right? Yeah, Wednesday at Darnay. Okay, and then I was doing a different night. Friday Funk? Something. Disco Funky House night? Possibly, I think so. Yeah, so that's how we met. What was, can you tell me about your night? I heard that it was video game related. Yeah, it was Atari night with Scott, Scott Sawyer. And we had in each corner of the room, there was like a TV with like a video game system. So we had like Intellivision, Coleco, Atari, Palm. And so people would just go sit, like while we were DJing, people would come and play all the games. It was fun. And then like instead of requesting songs, they'd come up and say, hey, can I change Mr. Do for like some other game, like Zaxxon? And so we had a big crate of video games behind the DJ booth and we'd like swap them out. That was fun. So how'd you get involved in that? Like how'd you first meet Rich? get that night at the club? It was through Scott that I did that night. Well, he also lived around the corner, which is funny. Yeah. Rich is actually my neighbor in Windsor, so I'd see him all the time and stuff like that. Like, I'd go to a music store and then get, like, an old vintage drum machine and I'd be driving home and go, hey, Rich, look what I got. And we'd talk about drum machines for a little bit. You guys just knew each other as neighbors? Yeah, but not so much. I mean, like, he was always gone. Like, he was gone already, so I didn't see him too much around town. But everyone knew that he's the guy who knew about synthesizers and Kraftwerk. So whenever I had synthesizer and Kraftwerk questions, like, pre-internet, I'd ask him, because he usually knew. I remember I got my first Lindrum and I saw him on the street so I pulled over. Oh really? That's great. you So what was it like for you kind of shuffling between Windsor and Detroit? Like, were there a lot of kids, you know, your age or something that did that? Yeah, for sure. It was really easy. To go from Windsor to Detroit took like five... No. about two minutes from my house to downtown Detroit was about two minutes before the whole 9-11 crazy border people thing like they would just when you'd pull up through the border there'd just be a hand saying like go ahead keep going so we'd meet our friends for coffee downtown like downtown Detroit just as easy as we'd meet friends downtown Windsor so it was like a second downtown for us. So it's really basically like you lived in Detroit. Yeah, but I can't say that. It's quite different when you cross the river. The two sides. It's like night and day, but they were easy to access. So it did feel like... Yeah, like I was in Windsor where everyone's nice. and giving you money for no reason. Shut up. Giving you free food. Throwing money at you. No, but you guys did leave your doors open at night, which was super crazy for us. If we left, we'd leave our doors open in case our friends came by. or even if a thief came by, you know, an open door, he wouldn't go in there because obviously there's somebody home. But we'd leave Windsor where it's all safe and everyone's like, hello, thank you. And then go to downtown Detroit where you'd have to not stop your car ever. No, you can't stop at night. You can't stop at lights. You can't stop at stop signs. You just have to keep moving your car. Like you can never stop. That was at night only cast and stuff there's always crazy stuff because people would carjack you like dude if you stopped remember yeah she got carjacked yeah so it's it's such a extremely dangerous place like gunshots all the time and you know roll up your windows and never stop and but we'd go to parties like three times a week there just party party underground party And then we'd go back to safe Canada, you know, work on music or something. And then it's like, what year is that? I think like 90 to 98. Was it that late? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Yeah. 97 started getting a little weird. So it was mostly like illegal parties and stuff like that, like warehouse stuff. Yeah, warehouse parties. Back then. And then everything shifted to clubs. But that was around, I guess, 96, 97. Yeah, it started getting commercial. And it changed a lot, yeah. When Trans invaded. Trans invasion. Transvasion. Yes. So what DJs would you be seeing when you would go to these parties in the early 90s at warehouses in Detroit? Everything from LaCarre and Ektamorf to Moody Mad, Theo Parrish. Remember the hotbox parties? Hotbox? No. Is that the Red Door? No, that's Red Door. Oh, the Red Door. No, wait, the hotbox. Too much to remember. Seriously, every week there was three parties. It was so insane. And it just seemed normal. Yeah, we're just going to a party every day. What was the vibe like? How many people were there? It was like normal people. Not ravers. That's not true. It depends where you went. Detroit parties and stuff, it was all normal people. Not wearing rave clothes and stuff. At first, I think. Yeah, at first. And then it, like around 96, it really went rave-er. Yeah, 96. Candy rave-er, extreme. Yeah, that was bad. People with Pokemon dolls on sticks. Yeah, your parties. It's crazy, yeah. The one party. Oh yeah, we were just... I used to go with her all the time to the parties, like just as a friend. So I'd be the one like carrying her records or driving. And so we'd go to these parties like... There was one party and this was really the last rave I ever played there. Because it was... really the end of it all. Anyway, it was put on by the Russian mafia and so they had guns at the door. Yeah, so like in the early days there was no mafia or anything. It was just like normal nerd party kids throwing parties in warehouses with a generator and one light and a sound system. But then when all the people started saying... Yeah, when the... Okay, sorry. Racial Mafia, go. No, and I mean, I've never seen anything like it. Happy hardcore music. 180 BPM probably, or... No, faster than that. Faster. Yeah, that's it. And yeah, they all had these dolls on sticks waving up in the air. It was really weird. Yeah, it was scary. Very scary. Why were the dolls on sticks scary? I have no idea. Oh, why were they scary? It's like Lord of the Flies kind of scary, you know? Like a pig on a stick. Yeah. Kill, kill. And then there was the naked lady dancing on the dance floor. Oh, yeah. The dirty, hippie, naked, siren-looking lady. She was just rolling around on the ground on the dirty warehouse floor. And love and life. I said, okay, no, this is not right. Russian guys trying to push nightdress balloons on you. Balloons. 50 cents. Yeah. But before that, there were great times. So how did you get involved in DJing and stuff like that in Detroit? What was your entryway into the scene? I didn't really want to start DJing. I just did it for fun because I couldn't find the tracks I heard at parties. anything but vinyl so I bought a few records bought this really shitty belt driven turntable mixer combo and and just played with those four records. And then I had a friend who had a record store. Yeah, he was throwing parties at the time as well. So he was like, "Oh, I want you to play." I said, "No, you're crazy. I can't play. I can't play out." And then he told me, "10 o'clock." In the back room. I said okay fine for an hour Then something went wrong at the party and the DJ didn't show up or something and he put me in the main room at 1:00 a.m So I was shitting my pants literally it was horrible the worst that ever ever like I never played with the monitor or on a system, but so embarrassing Just did shots of whiskey and I had to leave immediately. I was really wrong. That was my first gig. And yours? My first DJ gig. Like I was doing the new wave thing where you fade, like when the song's done, you just fade it out. Yeah. But one time at 13 Below, they asked me to fill in for like... I remember that. Someone couldn't make it on a house music night, and I had no clue about, like, modern house music. I only knew, like, a couple Chicago tracks, like, dumb things. So I called Magda. I'm like, Magda, I need some records to play because I have to DJ. And I didn't know how to beatmatch either. So she gave me a whole bunch of records, and then I just, all night, just, I was, like, kind of sweating almost, like, trying And like people come up and talk to me and I'm like "No don't talk to me!" And all I would do is play, I think I had like ten records and I just played every track from all ten records. Just went after them like mixing them all together. How stressful. But that was actually the only time I ever DJ'd like dance music. When did you start playing live? Playing live? Or just producing in general, I guess. I don't know, when I was little. But I was in a band before, too. But you never made it through the electronic music. Well, new wave. No, I used to Cassie all the time. Okay, fair enough. But not techno, I guess. No, not techno. Yes. Until I moved in. Yeah, how did you guys end up living together? I don't know. I don't know either. I think it just happened. I just took my stuff, put it in the trunk of a car, and went to his house. Ended up staying there for two years. Because when you have all the friends in Windsor, it was just a hassle for her to go over the border all the time. Because I think because the whole border thing is getting crazy, right? Also, I started working for Minus, which was around the corner. So that's why. Yeah, I lived next door to Minus. That was easy for her. And how did that happen? How did I live next door to Minus? No, no, no. How did the kind of Minus crew, as it is today with you guys, how did that come together? Just mutual friends and stuff. Yeah, just mutual friends. Us running into each other. Quite easy. Pretty random. Yeah. Oh, here's some tracks my friend did. Yeah. I think back then, like, if someone was a producer, automatically you would talk to them about gear and stuff. Because it's not like everyone was a producer back then. Right? No. So similar interests? Mm-hmm. Well, just like you said about how you knew Rich just because... Because he's the neighborhood synth guy. And so why'd you leave Detroit? Did you both move to New York or was it just you? No, I'm... Actually, he lived in New York after me. I lived there two times. And... But by then, her DJ career was already going, so she had to get out of Windsor if she wanted to start taking it up a notch. And I had nothing to take up professionally yet, so it was good that you came. Thanks. I support your decision. I'm glad. How did your DJ gigs get going? Basically, how did you get from this timid young DJ to getting international gigs or whatever? Well, obviously a lot has to do with Rich taking me on tour. He really pushed me and he brought me to Europe and really put me in. Difficult and awkward situations and maybe learn how to deal with it and how to adjust to different countries and different sounds and what they're into. Play in Spain. Yeah, it was really tough and I was sweating at every gig. It was really, really stressful. But it was great. I learned a lot, that's for sure. Why do you think he did that? Or why did he take you under his wing like that? I really don't know. Because it's funny? Stick him up in front of... Just to make fun of me. 10,000 Spanish people who want pounding techno. Go. I don't know. He gave me a night at his club early on in 98. He said he heard me play, but I don't know. I guess he liked it, even though I don't think I was playing very well back then. But you always play different music, which matters, I think. Maybe. You play different music from Rich? No, from the norm. No, but I think I've always played different than him, that's for sure. Different than him and different from everyone else, too. Even back then, I don't know. I think I was playing... I don't know. Maybe you remember better. So when did, I mean, was there a point where you kind of realized that, like, this is what you were going to do? Yeah. Like, how did it turn from a hobby to something you were really pursuing? I don't know. There was a period between 96, 98, where I wasn't sure. what to do and I was trying to get bookings and I was just trying to make these mixtapes for promoters to get booked putting all kinds of songs they might like to book me and then I don't know In '98 I started discovering other music. Some labels like Studio One, Playhouse, Klang, a lot of the German stuff. so It really blew my mind, so I thought, oh my god. But also I still had those other records, old Moody Mad stuff and all the good Dark Electro. So I don't know, I just really felt that was the moment I'm like, okay, now there's something really fresh I like. And I'm gonna try and go with it. So it's kind of like when you started hearing the European stuff rather than just the Detroit stuff or something that was... I mean, there was always good Detroit stuff, which I love. And actually, my friend Brendan, we always used to go to his house in Detroit. He's an amazing record collection. And he taught me a lot, really, about rare, electro, disco, things like that. Ultra rare, electro, disco. Yeah, he's crazy. So I was already very proud to be from Detroit and know that all this music came from there. But then I heard another sound, really fresh, coming from overseas. And it was exciting. I don't know, I was just really excited. And so what about you, Mark? I wasn't excited. I was going to say, I mean, you said you were always, you were in bands and you were playing music when you were a little kid. But how did you end up being like a techno producer? I was just like a new wave producer for a long time. time and then she would always be when she lived with me she would listen to the stuff I'm making and then she would think hey I could totally play this out if it wasn't for all that those like seven layers of synthesizers that he has on top so she would she'd work with me and say okay get rid of that get rid of that get rid of that get rid of that get rid of that get rid of And then whatever was left, she'd play that. No, there was basic stuff left, but that's what she wanted to play out. So after doing that, it got to a point where I would make two versions of every song. I'd make one for me, the good version, and the dumb one for Magda, which was missing all the good synth lines. And then eventually I just only made those ones. And from there it was release, the first release. So you guys have had kind of a symbiotic relationship for a long time. I think we work really well together. He's very fast. And what am I? I'm not fast, but I'm very meticulous. And you're not at all. It's very simple, but it's a good dynamic. If I'm going way too fast on something, she's like, hey, come on, take an extra five minutes and fix that. I'm like, okay, fine. And or if I go to her studio and she's doing something I can say hey come on. That's good enough good enough good enough Yeah, yeah, instead of her spending six hours fixing if he's stuck I come over and I help and if I'm stuck he comes over it's like No, this is come on. Just do it. Shut up fast faster It's really good. I sound like the Russian guys Yeah, but together we can... Like, we work really well, yeah. So what was New York like? What made you move out there and how did it go? I just felt I needed a change from Detroit. It's a cool place to grow up in, but when you reach a certain point, I mean, either you settle down or you move away, I feel like. So I just... But also at the same time, remember, all the good clubs were closing. Motor was closing. Yeah, no. It was a big problem. Yeah. The scene was definitely declining. So... And not much work as a DJ also. So, yeah, I moved out to New York and started a night. Very small. 200 people. But it was really fun. And I had a chance to bring over the... guys from Perlon and Playhouse, all the people I really looked up to and that was cool because I never did a night before and especially that kind of music was quite new back then to New York so we had some fun times there. In exchange they brought me here and that was my first show and first introduction to Berlin which was great. And what was the party? It was actually a Perlan party at the old Panorama Bar and I also played a Playhouse party. You mean the Panorama Bar in Osgut? Yeah. And it was through Zip he brought me over. I like that guy. Yeah, he's great. And I just remember being in shock because, okay, I was asking, when are we going to go to the club? He's like, oh, 5 a.m. we'll go. 5 a.m.? My God, I mean, that's unheard of. I said, okay, so we're at 5. I'm like, okay, what time do I play? Oh, you play at 11. Like, this is insane. Okay, no one's going to be there. They're going to be sweeping the floor. And 11 o'clock, it gets even more packed. And I think the party ended at 4 p.m., something like that. And I just didn't even know what to make of it. I was in shock. And I just knew this was the next chapter. So after that, you pretty much had your heart set on it. Yeah, when I came back to New York, I said to Rich, okay, six months, I'm moving to Berlin. And he's like, no way, I'm moving to Berlin. I'm like, no, I am. So I guess he had a similar experience and decided, okay. So he was in New York too at the time. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, we were all there for one year. Everybody was there. Mark too. No, except for you. I came later. Yeah, he went later. But we all lived in the same building, which is quite funny. Yeah, Troy, you, Rich. Some other people that you don't know Kevin went to New York too. Yeah, Kevin Jesse yes, Jesse. All of us. That was fun. Jesse Hartthrob. Yes. And who's Kevin? And Bill Lent. And Bill Lent, yeah. So what were you up to when you first got to Berlin? Like did you have any residencies or how did it work out? I I joined Cocoon, so I was actually in good hands. When I came here, I had some shows lined up and was able to make some money. Because Rich was on Cocoon too? Yes. So... And then I went on tour with him when I could. But I didn't do anything on my own. I didn't have a night. I heard you were DJing these Beat Street parties. Oh, yeah. So... That was incredible, these parties. I'll never forget them. That was my first party, too. Was it really? They were crazy. Yeah, retarded. Like really crazy. Intense. It was like a TV show. No, like a fake movie or something. People were jumping off the walls and hanging from the ceiling. The walls were dripping. It was insane. Yeah, it was so hot. Especially coming from Detroit. Playing shows in Detroit and New York where everyone just kind of stands around. And everyone's talking about like... work and how much their apartment costs just standing around talking and you're like background noise and then you go play beat street and then it's like insanity insanity where was it um it was in different spots every time But it really gave us all the feeling of the first parties we experienced in Detroit. So for us, it was really special to move here at that time and be able to experience these parties. I mean, it was so hot and you couldn't see anything. Everyone's dying, sweating, but... No attitude. People were there for the music. Yeah. They'd open the windows and cold air would come in for a second. The music would go down. Windows closed. Bass back up. I was freaking out. Crazy. It was crazy. I mean, definitely. Who put them on? Or was it anyone that's still around? Angela and Guido. They do the Beat Street label now. And I think they do some other events as well. Yeah, I see her all over the place. Yeah, they're great. I wish they would do Meat Street again. But anyway. So how'd you end up coming over here? That was back when Minus was still a little under. That's true. When we were allowed to play at cool parties. What do you mean by that? No, just now it's like Minus is too commercial for everyone to like, you know, that kind of feel. So you mean you feel like you have trouble getting like, um... No, I think other people have trouble getting over the fact that, you know, like, maybe I shouldn't go to the gig. Up to you. Up to you. Am I gonna get in trouble? No. No, like, if there's like a really cool underground party and, you know, someone says, hey, maybe you should get Mark to play, they'll go, no, he's on my YouTube commercial. It's like, what? Which Didn't you live with me for a while? What? Yeah. I did live with you for a while. You have very bad memory. No, I remember I played one show in New York. And then I think Rich got me a show at Beat Street. And so he said, come to Berlin and play. And then I was like, really? For free? I mean, like, you'll fly me out there and I don't have to pay for it? He's like, yeah, of course, idiot. So he flew me out and I played a Beat Street party. And while I was here, Katrin said, hey Mark, do you want to play another party next week? Who's Katrin? I'm booking it. And she wasn't my booking agent at the time. She's like, hey Mark, if you want to play, we can get you some more shows. I'm like, yeah. So then one show turned into another, into another. And then all of a sudden I had enough bookings where I just called Hey honey. Hey, not coming home. I'm gonna be a little late. Got some shows to play. So then I just stayed here and played shows and yeah. For a little while and then I went back. And then for a couple years I was back and forth. But then when you finally decided to come back, because when you really got settled and really got into living in Berlin, I think. Once my synthesizers came, then my whole mind was here, you know? Otherwise I was only on vacation here. But then once the studio got settled here, I was like, okay, here we go. Do you think living in Berlin permanently, does that really affect you creatively? No. I think so. Really? I don't see it. I think so because you live in such close proximity to other people also working. Well, maybe not you. Your whole world is right here. When I lived in Windsor, I made thousands of songs just by myself. Not interacting with techno people or anything. Not playing shows. But you made New Wave back then. Yeah, but I also made loads of techno stuff, too. So you're saying that for you, it's not as important to be exposed to other people. Uh-uh. Actually, it's more of a distraction. Actually, you like to stay home. I love to stay home. There were times in Windsor you didn't leave the house. There were weeks. For a long time. I was yelling at him to get sun, because he's looking green. Great. I like doing things to extremes. I like staying in the studio and not leaving for four days and making a thousand songs. And then I like not going in the studio and making for a couple months. Because then you want to come back and you want to do something new. Extremes are good. Like when you go camping and you don't shower for four days. And when you come back and you take a shower and it's such a good shower. But if you just took a shower every day, you would never really appreciate the showers. You know what I mean? You don't know what I mean. It's a funny choice of analogy. Burning man. Yeah, like that. That's another reason why I won't go there. Anyway, Magda, you said... You thought that living in Berlin did change the way did it change the way you DJed or it changed your look? Oh, yeah, I mean not just Berlin Germany in general especially places like Frankfurt. I think Frankfurt has a very special scene as well and The Rojo? Yeah, the Robert Johnson You had a residency there, right? Yes. And I definitely changed the way I DJ because I think I was playing... I think the things that were popular in the US at that time, the tastes were much different than what people were used to hear. And it didn't really work when I first... playing out here. I didn't think. - The speeds? Was it different speeds to tempos? - I don't think so. - No? What were you playing? - I think I learned how to be, how to build a groove better. Yeah, that's what I do recall. I think I was really all over the place before. Schizophrenic. Well there's like Detroit style, ghetto style, which is like record, record, record, drop it, record, record. Like what we hear on the radio. Yeah. WJLB. Yeah, those are great. Yeah, they used to sing. And then here... Ricardo puts a record on, like, 12 minutes later, another record starts. Like, they let records play out till the end here. But in Detroit, it's like ADD. Like, 20 seconds. 20 seconds. 20 seconds. Do you think that's probably because the party's gone so long and everything that kind of, like, gradually building a groove is more of a... I think so for sure. Yes. I've never had a chance to play... four hours before I moved here. It was always hour, hour and a half. I mean... So that's why they play records quicker? No. Not quicker, but I'm just saying it's a different mentality. Here you have time, you feel like you can breathe and you can play a record for 12 minutes because you know you have tons of time. Alright. Well, and just since you said that you learned, one of the things you learned was how to build a groove. And so you think that's kind of a part It's kind of particular to Germany? I'm not sure if it's particular to Germany. I just noticed that in particular in Germany. I just say the same thing. I think that goes anywhere you go, really. I definitely didn't have that before. you So did you feel like there was a point or was it just super gradual where you started to feel like Minus was kind of like this outfit that you were a part of and that it was becoming this sort of exceptional group or was it kind of like Was there a certain party or something where you were like, huh, this is getting pretty interesting? Or was it just like this gradual, like you couldn't really pinpoint what happened? It was pretty gradual. We didn't really think about it too much. We just kind of made some tracks and Rich put them out. And we played parties together. It was casual. It's only like retrospect when you realize how many years you've been doing it. Then you realize, hey, wow, this is actually something worthwhile because it's been going on for so long. But do you think there was like, I mean, if you think about the idea of a bunch of friends all playing parties together, it's fundamentally quite different from, say, a contact tour or something like that. Well, Rich has his ideas, and he's a marketing genius, and he has his vision. We don't, mine is not our label, it's his baby. We are a part of it, we make music for it. And now we're also doing our own side projects. But he's always been a businessman in a way when we're not really like that. Yeah, I would never come up with a contact show. There's no way I would come up with half the stuff he comes up with. But at the same time, I don't want to, though. I'd rather... I'm happy just staying in the studio, making music, playing shows, and you're the same way. Like, I don't want to be a businessman and come up and have meetings and stuff. But... You guys have meetings? No. We're supposed to, but we don't. But we should. But, like, I don't want to do that to I mean I know that's great but when so when Rich presents something like that to you like it seems appealing and you want to do it and everything though right well I don't know I never even think about that I just like I have so much trust yeah and what he does like he's the one who says like like from the beginning like Mark you should release these tracks "Mark, you should put those tracks out. You should do this." Like "Bay of Figs." I thought it was the dumbest song in the world, but he's like, "No, you should put that out." And I'm like, "What?" And then after a while, when everything he touches kind of turns to gold, you realize, hey, he's kind of good at this stuff. So if he says, "Hey, Mark, you should start wearing orange wizard hats," I'm not going to dismiss But to be fair, we've had our differences, that's for sure. And it hasn't been a perfect road. But I feel in the last year, things really came together again and Everyone feels strongly with how things are going. What happened in the past year that made it, that gave you that feeling? Well, everything was changing with the music industry and record stores are going under and record labels are having a hard time also staying in business. We had to figure out either Minus is going to be dissolved or we change things and... Reinvent. Reinvent what we want to do individually and what our goals are. So I feel now we all kind of work together much more. And it's better. And I feel more relaxed and know more what's going to happen. It's better. It's a better model. You're better. You're the best. So I guess, are you saying it's more like back to more of a conventional label or something? Or what exactly was the change? It's like a multi-front change. It's hard to explain. But, I mean, everyone's contributing to the label and everyone's getting something back from the label. It's much more... collaborative than we're going to do this and this and this and that's how it goes so to make it more democratic yeah and We had a big discussion at the end of the year and everybody laid all their cards out on the table and said everything. It was a really good meeting and Rich really presented a great structure. Everyone felt good with it and I think it's been running really well since then. Doing more special projects like the ghost store thing in Barcelona and the contact. Tour thing together, like more of a unified approach. Let's hug. So what was the contact tour like? I mean, to be, you know, what was it like to be in such a collaborative project like that? It was interesting and definitely taught me a lot. It was a great learning experience for sure, but it was very difficult. Sometimes it worked really well and other times I really thought it just doesn't make any sense. So I think it's difficult to put that many artists on stage and expect them to rock the crowd for so many hours in that context. Rock the crowd. Exactly. Mr. Hool, MC. I like playing with all the technology stuff. The technological aspect of it all. That was great. Pushing envelopes, trying weird stuff. I think we were all really exhausted afterwards, emotionally and physically. But yeah, I think it gave us good groundwork for something in the future. And also at that time, we were all playing so many shows every week and we were all going to different cities and not seeing each other so much, maybe just during the week here and there for some food. This was like a whole unified... Community. I felt like the contact tour almost made Minus look like a band or something. It was definitely more concert-based, that's for sure. But I like it because that's how we are. We're all friends first, and then we're musicians... We're label mates second. And I think the contact show kind of brought up both. I think it's a challenge to... not really play completely your style full on and have to adjust to other people and really think about what will work in that moment as a whole. That was the hard part. Yeah, Mark, something you said, you liked the technological aspect of it, or you liked nerding out. I mean, that's kind of been a little bit. you know, something that both of you have been sort of dabbled in or whatever. And I think Maya's in general is kind of at the forefront of like trying out new stuff on stage. I don't know. I guess, do you feel like, I might be answering that question, but do you feel like new stuff technologically, do you think that's kind of like part of your art form or do you see it that way? Or do you feel like that's something you feel creative about? Or is it just a necessity? This is one of those questions that Rich should answer. He loves talking about technology and techno. How they go hand in hand. I need help on this question. I definitely like new gadgets, new possibilities, testing them out, but at the same time, I'm not so crazy about it. I think Rich is definitely one for this question. Yeah, yeah. Like, he's the guy who just, every weekend has a new DJ set up. It's insane. And half the stuff I use now, like I'll come across some, let's say the Monom. I was like, hey, this is a cool little Monom. It's a cool MIDI controller. And then Richard's like, oh yeah, I had lunch with the couple that makes them last year and I have one right here and you can use it. I'm like, oh, okay. Like anything I discover, he's already had lunch with the owner, the CEO or something and it's already in with some new version of it or something. It's insane the amount of time he has to do all this stuff, but that's one of the things he loves to do the most is hooking this up to that, like his dad. Why? His dad's a crazy electrician. Robotics engineer. Robotics, yeah. So he's always building little kits and stuff, like clocks and stuff. Well, and it just seems like he has a lot of, I don't know, I guess entrepreneurial ideas or something. Like, he had Richly Hotten. He's got this thing with Byrne Studios or whatever. Yeah. But yeah, and so I guess you guys were saying you... pretty much would rather just like well he loves innovating and he loves pushing things so he's always looking for something to help push the whole scene forward or his music ideas forward or push any idea he has in his head forward so if there's always like a new technology that's being invented he'll like see if that can help with his visions for me I'm kind of happy with like old technology like Juno 60 or like 70s keyboards or something. I don't need... You like it all, come on. Well yeah, I guess we should talk about your new albums. Magda, I guess we'll start with you since it's your debut album. Can I go get coffee while you ask? Yes, you can. So what was it like to... I mean obviously you've produced and everything, but when did you start the album and what was the process like for you? Very slow, but I started working on the album over two years ago. I didn't have a deadline. But I definitely wanted to put something together that was personal, meant something to me. I always look for a fine line between disco and dark stuff. That's my ongoing search. And then I came across Goblin, a band that I really love, and they were so psychedelic and weird and they have this dark disco thing happening, not in everything, but some tracks really blew me away. And then I thought, okay, this is sort of my direction. And so I kept recording and recording. And eventually I ended up with tons of recording and not really knowing how to piece it together into one concept. And finally this year it all made sense and... Yeah, actually definitely changed directions from what I first envisioned to now, which I think now definitely draws more on my time in Detroit, my years growing up there. Like Prince Funky, Rick James. Just like that. Why do you think Goblin and... of sound that's psychedelic and also like a little horror filmy or campy or something. Why do you think that appeals to you so much? I don't know. I just feel it's weird, but at the same time it's warm. It's not cold and dark and scary. It is in a way, but not too far. Because then you have that disco element which brings that back. So together, I don't know, I just like that combination. I've always liked spooky sounds and Halloween type stuff. I like Godwin. No mid-range. That's true. I hate all music with midranges. Because all music has midranges. Yeah, and your album kind of has, at least to my ears, kind of has a similar tone to it sometimes. That's sort of like the creepy sound a little bit. My album? You don't think so? Yeah, it's dark. But I don't think it's so much like Goblin Disco at all. No. What would you say the difference is? Funk? No. I think yours is more... It sounds more pretty, indie. Droney guitars. His is simple and pretty and the sounds really stand out. I think it flows well together. So tell me a little bit about, like, I mean, I read your album, it's like, inspired by the dreariness of winter and everything. Can you tell me a little bit about that? Yeah, last winter was so insane that it was all gray. The sun didn't come out. It was cold. The snow came and never went away. Usually it melts for a little while and then snows again. Then it melts and then you have the sun for a couple days. Or even if there's snow out there's at least sun like here and there but last winter was just gray relentless gray for like three or four months, so During one of these cold winter days. I went to the music store down here. I got that guitar with the whammy bar Yeah, and I just sat in here and just recorded like I had a whole bunch of rough drum beats and stuff some bass lines that working on and I just went went one after another just like playing along with it with the guitar and then after I'd finished I kind of listened to it all I was like wow this is very interesting because it's like a very different and it was encapsulating the whole feeling that was going on outside like this gray ambient feel so I think I asked you and Troy I said hey I have some songs maybe we could do like uh Run Stop Restore album. But you guys were all so busy, I remember. So I just said, okay, fine, I'll just keep working on it myself. So I just took all the songs and like dwindled it down to like seven or eight that I really liked and that were different enough from each other. And then just expanded on them and made like an album. Not to be released as an album, but just for like a personal album. Yeah. But then Rich listened to it and he said, hey, this is actually, like, this is really good. We could actually release this. I was like, what? Oh, okay, cool. So then... So it was pretty much just you, like, enjoying yourself or whatever. You weren't thinking of it as next Mark Hule album necessarily. No, I never make music as a release. I just make music for fun. And then it happens to be... But these were all together. It's like one... Like I had made them all in the same period. Yeah, yeah. The same feeling. So they all went together really well. Yeah, and you said you had thought of it as more just like a personal album. So do you have like a lot of music that you've recorded that you just like to listen to? Oh, I'd like to interject here. He makes about 100 songs a day. So he can literally play live for I don't know 10 hours. You could Okay Yeah, like most of the stuff I make I I don't approach it like some people make a song and they polish it up and make it all nice and Then make another song Like do it like that. I assume that most of my songs are not good so I make like a hundred songs and then like four out of those hundreds are gonna be really good. The law of averages kind of thing. So I prefer to make a whole bunch of songs and then see which ones kind of stick. as opposed to just making one song and polishing it and spending a week making one song. To me, that's insane. Crazy. No, but why would you do that? Because maybe the song sucks. Isn't it better to do 50 songs and then say, hey, these three are really good. Excellent. Okay. See, my brain is different than yours. I love it. Yeah, I mean, you guys are both kind of like... It seems to me like you're kind of different sides of the same coin or something, where she's primarily a DJ, he's primarily a producer and live act. She's a DJ, he's a live act. Together! Double trouble! It seems that way. Yeah, but she's a crazy good producer, though. And I'm not a good DJ at all. That's not true. Let's test that tomorrow. New DJ? Barcelona. Yes. The match house beats. Bring all those house records. The ones from that. Yes. So when you play live, you basically just have like this enormous amount of material to draw from? No. A lot of it doesn't. I should. You do. Well, I do, but not as much as I should. You have a lot. Yeah, I guess so. Do your live sets sound really different one night to the next for that reason? Yeah, unless like sometimes I have to go into autopilot. Like if I'm playing a place where when I first start, I usually try to throw some feeler tracks out there to see which direction the people want to go. Like, hey, here's a crazy weird one. And if they go, yeah, then I can go weirder and weirder. But if I go, here's a crazy weird one, I might as well play the standards, like the hits and then I just, then it's not fun for me anymore and then I just, but that's like a small portion that I have to do. But nothing makes me happier than to start going and playing weird stuff that, like sometimes playing some clips of tracks that I don't even know what titles are. Like, hey, what's this one? Camera. Like, oh, cool. And it's like exploring my own music. That's really fun. That's much more fun. Yeah, it's Why do you think you're so much more drawn to producing and playing live whenever all your friends are DJs and everything? Because I don't listen to modern techno. He stopped at 83 or 84. Yeah, about 84. Yeah, that's about it. With a couple exceptions here and there. But I don't listen to modern music, so I could never DJ because I don't know anything. Yeah, it's funny because when I came over, you were like, oh, so you listen to modern house and techno? That's the first thing you asked. I thought it was a funny question. Like, I do hear, I mean, every night or every weekend when I go play, I'm listening to modern techno. Get ready. Three months of that with me. Oh yeah. Yeah, but the stuff he plays is good. It's not like modern techno that everyone else plays. Let's see what you say a month into the tour. No, I like your music. Your music has melody, the stuff you play. There's actual bass lines, there's actual melodies. Like 10 minutes later, you can say, that's a song that goes, hey, or something. But like most techno now, it's a song that goes, it's like, really? I don't know. People are playing songs without music. melodies or bass lines or anything or hooks. It sounds like you think that she's playing actual songs. She's playing actual music. But I'm not playing actual songs. Yes, you are. There's songs you can hum to and sing. Okay, I'd like to test that tomorrow. I'm going to ask you five songs to hum. We can go on and listen to the top ten techno songs that are being played right now. And I bet you there's no synthesizers at all. It's just more like, okay, maybe a sub-bass synthesizer with some beat. Okay, then Liz, what's the next song? Every song is like that now. So when you go to clubs and you hear other DJs playing, it's like, really? How are they... There's no fun in techno right now. So that's why I think everyone's going and playing house music because there's much more melody, there's much more excitement. But obviously it's not the right answer. To me that kind of sounds like what Magda was saying about why you like Goblin. It's even though it's kind of sinister or whatever it still has a kind of like warmth to it. I mean to me it sounds like That's what you're missing is techno sound but with some action. Anything, anything give me a bleep give me a One vocal sample. Like, I'll take a vocal sample. Just give me anything other than sub-bass and shuffle toms. That's all it is. No wonder everyone's saying minimal sucks, because listen to it, it does. But how is that minimal? But it gives you a bad name, because the stuff you play is so good. I paid him to say that. Do you agree or disagree? No, I agree. I agree. I mean, when I think of minimal, it's actually minimal. Strip down music, good stuff. I was listening to old Playhouse records yesterday. and Klang and Profan so good it's well produced and it's yes it's stripped down but it has feeling it does something feeling and I don't know it's just so easy also to produce I think that there's a lot of stuff out there Earlier on you kind of said you feel like it's hard to get the gigs that you want or whatever in Berlin from being on Minus. No, no, no, not at all. I'm just saying like if there's a cool small little special show, someone from Minus probably wouldn't be the first pick because they're not, it's not cool to like Minus. Right? Is that fair to say? In my opinion. How's that? Yeah, I guess so. I think if someone says like, oh yeah, like Minus and people are like, oh yeah, it's commercial or something. But that happens with any label that becomes a bigger label, you know? I guess so. And it's also, yeah, you're right. I guess my question is, so obviously being part of Minus has been extremely helpful and you know, you guys are kind of part of this group that, I don't know. a lot of amazing creative osmosis going on it seems like but um do you think it um also ends up being like a distraction or um does it like hold you back in some way no for me no it doesn't hold me i mean like i said like some people think that way but if some people think that way then then and for like to say oh minus is is not cool because they're commercial is equally as bad as saying minus is cool because they are commercial like judging us just on our popularity is is idiotic and they should just listen to the music so anyone who can't just listen to the music independently of of what everyone thinks and evaluate it like that i think there's something wrong i don't really care what they think Why do you think that is? Like, what is it about? But why do you think? People just like hating and they need reasons to hate all the time. Why did it happen in the first place? Yeah, or I mean, I feel like. Well, you have the whole. minimal genre as we can call it got really popular but it morphed into something totally generic and lifeless and it took over everywhere that was the sound everyone was pushing and playing but I don't know I just I don't identify with that sound and I feel like I've been pigeonholed into that as well unfairly Whatever happens, but it's okay. It happens with every genre happened with house happened with electro. It's okay. There's always It's okay when that happens because The music will go back into the underground and producers will still be making quality stuff. It just won't be out there as viewed as minimal this music minimal music does that make any sense yeah totally I would be very excited if this went back to underground when house when house got really huge yeah when everyone mentioned house people only thought of all this cheesy commercial stuff I'm gonna feel case I mean there's tons of cool stuff coming out you know but it was definitely went back underground so it just all goes in waves through the years okay so next I think wait now it's back to house Then it's hard techno again, right? I think so. And then it slows down to minimal. Then people get sick of that and it goes house again. So we have to go through a hard techno phase first before we get to... Are you ready for that? No. No. Just like a knight's seat If she outran the room I've done Things are way different, turns upside down
