This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Olly Ashley, the founder of London's Radar Radio. When Ashley started the station near the end of 2014, his aim was to create the next generation of radio. He wanted to focus on new talent by opening the station up to aspiring DJs and giving them access to Radar's facilities. Him and the Radar team also wanted to create an environment where DJs could express themselves and they encouraged presenters to have fun on the air. These days Ashley affectionately describes Radar as a youth club where people can come, hang out and absorb themselves in music. There's been a fair bit of discussion online about where Radar gets its money from for all of this. So we talked about this when Ashley stopped by a London studio last week, as well as discussing Radar's ongoing development as a hub for new UK music. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Radar Radio's Oli Ashley is up next. Probably black is my cat facts. Switch up the style and relax. Tax. I like a ho get the Mac wax black. Tap, tap, hit him in the back. Got to the face. That's Snapchat. Now you a bitch like cat sex. Damn. I don't talk no shit. Too much honor. Now I'm in a minute. Go in this person. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right, Ollie, how are you doing today? Yeah, good. How's it going? Good, good. Happy New Year. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You made any resolutions? Maybe a few I don't want to say on my RxChange, but I'm trying to lead a healthier lifestyle for 2018. I'm trying to actually get into an early routine, so I'm trying to get into the office for like eight in the morning, but I've like only succeeded at once. in the past couple weeks eight in the morning as opposed to like 10 11 okay so you're more of a night person yeah definitely 100 yeah okay you're on a healthy eating tip as well again like that was the plan for 2018 i mean it's a bit healthier than the end of last year but um Not quinoa salads just yet. You'll get there. You'll get there. Hope so. Hope so. Okay. So you're the founder, chief, leader, however you want to term it, of Radar. But I was interested to know what your job is. What's your day-to-day? What are you doing on a daily basis? Day-to-day at Radar is really, I think, now about kind of pushing where we can go. I think in 2018, with a platform like Radar, especially for one being so youth-focused, you can't just do audio, I feel now. I feel like it doesn't matter how well we program things or kind of like what we do, just the audio aspect of things, I feel, isn't enough to kind of like... excite young people nowadays so definitely moving forward doing more video content doing more events and so we've opened a recording studio at Radar from the start of last year so now kind of in the process of kind of like recording music not myself personally but kind of getting projects like underway and kind of like taking that next step what always kind of excited me with radio especially kind of like underground radio like your stations like your rinses and ntss is the idea that it's kind of like you could be hearing music first there and like you know and radio has always been this amazing place where people can be experimenting and playing dub plates for the first time and kind of like playing like demos of tracks and it's like it's very much if you're like if you want to go that step further with music like listening to radio especially like exciting well put together shows where they play a lot of new music you're going to hear stuff first and that really excites me and even the fact of like working at radio stations it's like you know you're in that room it could be seven seconds before the person listening at home listen to it but you know you're like the first person to hear a track like that and I think that's always really really exciting so now kind of we want to take it to the next step further is kind of like a call we want to be a position where we're kind of recording the music and release the music that's going to get played on the radio so so to be in the room and through the process of people kind of like come up with these ideas and putting songs together is really exciting so that's kind of like um the next things really i mean like we've got such a strong team now radar especially in terms of the radio team that it's kind of like right now it's like right i'm leaving you to it and we're seeing where else we can go with things so yeah yeah so when you say releasing music do you mean in sort of the traditional record label sense or do you just mean getting it out there We have started like an in-house label. It's not, I didn't want to call it Radar Records. I just felt like I didn't want what we were kind of doing creatively with the radio station to kind of like have an impact or an effect of kind of like what type of music we wanted to release. Technically it's two, but so we have an in-house label called Pressure, which is going to be more focused on releasing more vocal driven stuff. So a lot more like. rap and drill and kind of like grime coming out of the UK and more focused on like London based stuff which is really exciting we're kind of wrapping up a project Kenny Allstar's first mixtape which is going to be really really exciting we've got the likes of like k trap and six seven and heady one and rv and what i feel is like some of the most exciting talent come out of london right now vocally there and then we're also got like an in-house um label which is more focused on like the weird electronic side of things which we're still kind of put together which is still kind of a work in progress but really really exciting for them and we have no music plan yet like we've basically designed the website but we yet to kind of find the music we want to put out yet but we're we've got some exciting things kind of like in the pipeline so yeah it's um it's exciting it's cool so what are you working on predominantly yourself I mean, I'm assuming you do a bit of everything, but like... Right, so I started a radio station with this really novel idea that, yeah, if I start a radio station, I'll be in a position where I can work and listen to music all day. But effectively, I just spend all day in meetings effectively now, which is cool, which is fun. But it's like, it's now about, okay, cool. Like, where can we take radar and who can we work with? All that, really typical planning meeting would be okay we've got this thing under consideration what does everybody think about it everybody's feeding into the process and things of that nature just deciding what's what's cool for the station I mean is that how you would sort of characterize it not really i feel like i always want to work with people that i feel like are better than me if that makes any sense like i always like i'm always looking to find people to work with me that are smarter than me or have a stronger skill set in that area so a lot of times it's kind of like taking people's ideas in and seeing like okay cool like how can we expand on this how can we kind of take it further it's kind of gone from me having this kind of obsessive vision of what the future radio to be to kind of now working with a team to being like okay cool how can we do video content that other people aren't doing like what type of events can we put on that we feel like london is missing like i mean how can we program like a festival stage and i feel that's going to give you more kind of like exciting interesting results at no point time like I feel what we're doing is reinventing the wheel it's just like how can we put our little twist on things essentially you know I mean so that's so that's fun and that's exciting and it's definitely kind of pushing me into all different realms but you know I think also it's like I'm like a main focus for me is just like okay cool like is everyone at work like happy it's like I like you know we've got like a team like it's a big team now so like 20, 25 people now. So it's just like, okay, like how can we make sure that, you know, people are progressing in the careers that they want to, you know what I mean? I kind of, to say kind of like I was like a reluctant CEO would be an understatement. You know, I started radio station because I wanted to listen to music, but now you've got to take in like, okay, cool. Like, you know, where people's careers want to expand, like, okay I know what you mean if you've got a team of people under you and you know people have professional ambitions and you know they're looking to develop and just be in a great workplace you know I guess a connected question would be is it has it been difficult being boss yeah it has uh i don't know i feel like naturally like throughout my kind of starting radio and everything like i kind of prefer working by myself so like kind of like being like a boss for me is someone's quite like quite like a like a strange feeling and it's just like I was like never of a fan of like, I just thought like a false hierarchy. You know what I mean? I like the idea that we're a team and everyone's a part of the team and everyone's got a position to play, especially with things like music and like how to do an event. There's so many different ways and things to do it. So it's all about, I think, taking people's opinion and seeing like, okay, cool. What do we feel is best for? radar what's best for the station yeah i mean what kind of like our listenership and our audience is going to appreciate for sure i saw that you described your sort of mission with things when you were starting out as aspiring to create kind of a next generation of radio what did that idea mean to you to begin with i think that idea is fully focused on internet radio and I think kind of like I think like the next generation of radio is one that is going to be uncensored for me personally with radio I've more specifically with the UK like the axe I have to grind is kind of with FM radio it is controlled by Ofcom which is a government board and so you're very restricted with what you can say and can't say very restricted with what you can play and you can't play you know putting those restrictions just leads to quite often quite boring radio like i'm a huge hip-hop and rap fan so hearing censored hip-hop and like hearing like i don't know a censored future track just always to me just sounds just strange like you know just like gaps of silence yeah i mean so i've always hated that and i feel like you know, with all the pirates back in the day, especially like you look at like Kiss and you look at Rinse, what was so amazing about them was it was like, look, 100% could be illegal. They had this real like devil make hair out of Tudors. Like we're going to play what we want. We're going to say we want, and that's it. And like, I love that. And I love that kind of like creative freedom it's holds. And I feel like, you know. just do not feel like the future of radio is going to be FM. Like I look, it's 2018 now we'll, we'll live in a world of cars that can drive themselves. You know what I mean? I don't feel like in the future you'll be in a car, you'll be in a Tesla that can drive itself, trying to tune into a crackly AM FM radio, trying to listen to five live. Like, I just don't think that's the future. I might be wrong. But I just, I feel like it's just important to people to be given platforms where they can be uncensored and they can really give their full honest opinion. You know what I mean? And especially when it comes to like music and comes to art, like I love the fact that, you know, things can be uncensored and people can present things how it should be presented. You know, that's why I feel like, I don't know, you listen to like. Grime sets, for example, kind of like, you know, people kind of like coming and doing freestyles. I feel like they're always going to give you a better version of that on platforms like Radar because we are uncensored. I mean, when you listen, they go on the BBC and it's censored and things like that. It's just not the same. And it's just like, for me, I... just don't feel that kids are as authentic well the thing is of course it comes down to like that you know that freedom of full expression and stuff but the thing that strikes me about radar is that like in the presenters you almost have this like stream of consciousness thing going on where everybody's just speaking their minds like Just even listening, I know it might sound like a strange example, but even just listening to Shoa's breakfast show yesterday. So you've got a situation where there's a problem with an aux cable and rather than like in a traditional radio, like turning the mics off and going, we've got to sort this out. You know, they're saying on air. fuck we've got a problem with the aux cable we're not going to be able to play this track oh that's a fuck up you know it's like that kind of thing so I'm wondering like is that something that you encourage your DJs to do yeah because it's real like you know I like so much about it it's just like you can have a conversation with someone the same you would if you were just like mates like having a few drinks and like and that's what I really enjoy like you know we're not trying to be super glossy and super pristine. Like, I think we're just... I think we're just trying to just be as real as possible, really. And just like sometimes when things go wrong, that's when I feel you get the best entertainment. And I feel like people get confused sometimes. It's like with things like radio, it's like you're there to entertain people. You know what I mean? You're like, you're there to make people's kind of like, I don't know, like mornings or kind of like just, you know, doing boring emails in the office, just a little And also what I love about radio, it's a live medium. Like there's not that many things that are 100% completely live. So, you know, when things go wrong, they can go really wrong. And when they go well, they can go really well. But it's like you never know what's going to happen. And I feel like, you know. that always kind of like keeps things exciting and keeps everyone on their toes. Yeah. I mean, I can't think of too many stations where you've got like, you know, the, the wake and bake show with Amy Becker. You've got like three shots, you know, you got, um, DJs under the. influence and just kind of going for it yeah talk about those like how do you how do you come up with these ideas and what you're trying to sort of say with them i'd be lying to say if like i've come up with the ideas it's more kind of like people come and then i kind of push and be like well what about this and how about this and how do you push that Radar is kind of like when you went to college and like all the naughty kids, it's kind of like we've all kind of come together from all different parts of London, like northeast, southwest, and we'll get together just to kind of just chat shit on a regular basis, really. I was thinking about it today, like, okay, I have to kind of like chat about Radar and how we've got here. And like most of the people that are on Radar, like I do not remember like first meeting them they just seem to be on there, you know what I mean? And most of the time it's like, it's friends of friends or people coming with recommendations or people coming on as guests for a certain show and then really liking what was around them. Like, oh, can I come and do my own thing? I think it's great because it's like, especially like with the young presenters now, it's like you see like their view in radio can be... differently they're not coming into it be like okay i can't say this i can't do that i can't play that they're like okay cool like okay there are no rules that's the only rules and just some of the stuff that gets said is fucking wild. I'm not going to lie. Like even sometimes I'm like, yo, okay, this is interesting, but it's cool because it's, it's other people's opinions on things. Yeah. I mean, like, you know, I think it's great to have a platform where you can have such different opinions and different views. Like, yeah, I mean, and like sometimes leads to a, you know, confrontation, which makes for great radio. But with all those shows somehow they got in the building and like they just they just seem to still be here you know i mean i suppose this extends to what i sort of observed as your i don't know just demo policy new talent policy like you've got a bit on the website that's just like get involved essentially why was it important to you to sort of create this kind of sense among the community Because, I mean, it seems like, I don't know, outside looking in, it just seems to be, look, if you're doing something cool, then we're going to give you a shot. Yeah. I don't know if that would be accurate. Well, the thing is, for me, that comes from, like, personal experience. So, like, for me, getting into radio, like, first and foremost, like, I got into radio because I wanted to be a DJ. Like, I think, like a lot of people i want to get to radio it's just like cool i want to dj i want to get more gigs okay cool if i get a slot on a good radio station then hopefully that'll raise my profile and i can get a few more gigs so So that kind of all started for me when I started working at Rinse in 2010. And like, you know, I originally came in there because, you know, I thought, OK, cool, if I intern a bit and then do a few shifts, then eventually I'll get a show. And I did have a show for a short period of time. I used to do three to five in the mornings on a Friday. So I used to work like Sunday night, Monday night, Tuesday night, Wednesday night, Thursday night. And in like the West End at some horrible clubs that I don't really want to mention or kind of have closed down because they've been up to some really dodgy things. And then I would come like Friday night to kind of come DJ three to five. And I loved it. Like, and that kind of feeling of. kind of like okay cool like you're live like you're in control like you know you've got people from all over the world tuning in and like oh you're playing this track oh oh this is really cool oh you're playing Prince you know da da da da all sort of things it's getting it goes to that live thing and feeling really connected to people and we connect to the music and I felt that was just so exciting and then well after that there was um there was a bit of politics because it was like at the time I was like And I got brought in by G and Sarah and we had a meeting and there was like a new policy was like, right, you're either a DJ or a producer. I was like, okay. And they were like, all right, so pick. And I was like, no, like I've worked like nights for like over a year and all this other things there and like to build it up. And, you know, it just. I'm quite a maths based person. So I was like, right, if I'm a producer, I can be a four year hours a week. If I DJ, I can be a two hours a week. So break it down. Okay, cool. It probably makes more sense to carry on being a producer. So for me, that was kind of like the end of kind of like that dream, which was like for me at the time, heartbreaking as probably the. closest I've ever come to like crying in a meeting because I was just like no I've worked so hard the shows are really good like yeah I mean I'm getting like exclusives and this that whatever but it's one of those things since starting my own things some of my own companies like you realize okay cool there are rules and there are policies and you know you have to make it work and you know and like you can't do everything to make everyone happy you got to do what's right for you know the company you know I mean but had a journey to kind of like and you know gone through a lot to kind of dj at three to five in the morning in studio in brick lane like on a friday night and i just thought afterwards i was like it shouldn't be this hard to have the chance to dj on a decent radio station yeah i mean so that was definitely like a big inspiration for kind of like me kind of like starting my own thing was like okay cool I've I got this great opportunity to kind of like work at this amazing radio station like Rinse like you know what I mean without well put it flat out like without Rinse FM like there would not be a Radar Radio like end of story but I just kind of felt like okay cool like I've gone through this journey I've kind of gone through this I just don't feel like people have to go through like in all honesty like all this bullshit to kind of like to just have like a two-hour radio show to play tunes they like yeah I mean like I just kind of felt with Radar, like, you know, with getting people on it, it's just one of those things where it's kind of like, okay, cool. Like I didn't start the station to kind of like, all right, well, I want to get my DJ career cracking. All right, let's start a radio station. But I just kind of felt like I'd been there before being like a young, passionate, unknown DJ that no one had ever heard before. obsessed with music and all just wanted I just wanted a platform just to be able to play and present the music I wanted so you know like getting people on board like you know the policy when we first started was like look as long as you've got good tasty music and you're not a dickhead like I'm sure we can find a place for you on the station and like that still rings true so We've had like a lot of people just like, you know, it could be the fact that like, you know, I remember when we first started, we were pride ourselves on the fact that look, someone could send like a mix via like SoundCloud or... Twitter on Monday would listen to it get back to them on Tuesday have a meeting with them on Wednesday then like you know have them come in for like a practice room session like on a Thursday and then by Friday we're working out what their regular slot's going to be and having that quick turnaround of the fact like in the space of one week okay cool we can find you a show you know and be like okay cool we can come and like get involved and I felt like that was just great because it's just like you know very quickly like what first two months was just like it was just the wild west like you know i mean you'd have like 15 year old kids like pretending to be able to dj and be like yeah yeah i can dj yeah yeah like yeah my friends are mcs and then coming in like not being able to like live on air not be able to dj and their friends like trying to do like most death style conscious bars it was just horrendous it was awful the worst thing was it was live Maybe I was a bit too nice, but I would never be like during the show, be like, no, no, no, we've got to cut this. You would let it roll for the full two hours. So there was a lot of pain. But after we got through that, the initial barrier. I don't know. It just kind of like, it really snowballed really quickly because it's very much like friends of friends of friends. So I remember like, I don't know, like the Nervous Horizon guys coming and doing a show. Like they came and like did a show on radio like first week. And then like they brought down like the likes of like Akito. And then like they brought down like the likes of like Seamstress and Queer. And like, you know. It would just be like friends of friends and it would just build and build and build. And just like, you know, I was hearing like so many great DJs and so much great music. I then like, I remember like there'd be like a solid like two, three month period, like every day after a guest show, I'd be like, hey, do you want to come and do your own thing? Do you want to come and do your own thing? And it just felt like very natural and very organic. I know a social thing really you know what I mean I just like you know just like for me it was just hey the music's good it's all working alright cool let's keep it rolling and see where it can go really do you think you've got a music policy at Radar as long as it's good like and then what do you define as good like you know like I've had to be less of a control freak and like I have to understand that okay cool there's some things that maybe I'm not like maybe I don't fully get right now at this moment in time but someone's like no this is really they're really pushing things forward giving a bit more time but you know the reason why I wanted to start a radio station is because like I like all different types of music I was born like 1990 so like I feel like I was part of like the LimeWire Bear Share generation where like we didn't have to pick what music we wanted we could just download everything like illegally you know what I mean so it would be like okay cool we would listen to like hip-hop and rap and we would listen to like a new metal and like all different styles different types of things so even when we started like The first regular show we got going was an ambient show by an artist called Makona, a friend of mine from Amsterdam. The first show on radar was an ambient show. But, you know, like very quickly, we gained a reputation for really pushing grime. That was like a big... part of Radar especially at the start I just felt like from a radio perspective like especially from my time during a rinse like I was a grime fan before working at rinse but it was when I got to see the sets live, that's when I was like, okay, there's extra element to it because it's taking that live thing into a different level. And like, you know, these guys are coming in and it's like, they're performing live and like every set is unique. Like, you know what I mean? Like no sets the same. And like, you never know when someone's going to come in and they're going to want to clash this person. You know what I mean? You never know it's very very very much kind of keeps you in your toes and just like it made it very interesting and i like i remember starting the station being like okay cool we launched like Halloween 2014 at the time Novelist was getting a lot of love because he had that take time track with Mum Dance Stormzy was getting a lot of attention as well and I saw that and was like okay like they're really excited they're doing a lot of cool stuff but that can't be it there has to be more MCs at the time people were very much talking about like Grime 2.0, Grime Resurgence. You had your artists like Slack and Mr. Mitch and Mum Dance. And, you know, these people that were kind of like, they were having like their interpretation of Grime and kind of what they felt like pushing things forward. You know, you even had artists like Rabbit who were like from like Texas doing their version of Grime. And it felt like... people were injecting something new and exciting to it. And I felt like, okay, you're getting all these new producers, getting all these instrumentals, but... where are the new MCs and you had Novice and Stormzy so I was like there has to be more there has to be more so I remember starting like early on it was like we would do a grime show like 8 to 10 like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday I'd be like build it and they will come so you know we we would do these sets and then more and more MCs would come I remember meeting dj argue who's our like head of grime at the moment like we're ahead of urban music if you want to say that like literally that was like through soundcloud like he just sent a message Suzanne Cloud, he came in and his first track was just like a dub play. It was like DJ Argue, like dub play. And I'm like, you got the job. Don't worry. Come on board. And he, like his first set when he came on board, he brought down Jams and Mike Tai and it was fucking sick. And then I think after that happened and Jams and Mike Tai was like, yeah, Radar, like scopes it all out, like got to meet me. He was like And I think like a week later you had like AJ Tracy coming down. You had like Big Zoo coming down. You had like. YGG then you had like Capo Lee and Nico Lindsay and Rox and then very quickly it was like okay cool like there is this whole new wave of MCs and then at the time like it was well it still is but it was really exciting because there's just so much amazing young talent that was just like growing and developing like you know especially seeing artists like AJ Tracy and Rox like they'll be coming at one point they were coming like two three times a week for them it was like almost like them doing sets was like like them in a dojo, it was just like them just like sharpening their skills, getting better and better and better. It's like every week. And I felt there was this real, there's always going to be this competitive element to grime. People want to, you know, be getting the rewind and people want to kind of like, you know, be there to impress. But there was, felt like a real sense of camaraderie between like the young MCs coming through because none of them have made it. None But, you know, but still it was, it was really friendly. So it's like those sets, like I remember like the original. original studio before we got air conditioning in there like it used to get so hot in there it was just insane like remember there was that crazy heat wave in 2015 yeah vaguely yeah it was getting hot like it was just like it was just it was horrendous but we got the air conditioning like literally like the day before the heat wave came in thankfully but i remember just like how just hot and just kind of like messy kind of like the sets used to be like you know it was just we had quite like an open door policy with things. It was like, again the policy still stands as long as you've got good taste in music and you're not a dickhead then cool like yeah i mean we've had a few people we've had to ask to leave and stuff like that but it rarely happens because you know people come down friends of friends it kind of felt like there was definitely like a new wave of like talent coming through and like now like i don't know you look at like aj now like the guy's huge you know i mean this guy's doing tours all over the world and huge tracks with like denzel curry and jme and huge artists and it's like it was only like a few years ago that he was coming on a regular basis just to do grime sets yeah i mean and like you know i felt like with our whole ethos was just like i could call we wanted it to be like a new exciting way of doing radio like internet focus uncensored with like new talent as well And yeah, it's just, I don't know, like, I feel like with us, like, that just felt like something... Sort of natural? No, like, it kind of felt like, okay, we had a goal, we had a mission, I had an idea, and like, it happened, it came true. Like, you know, there is this, there were this whole new wave of MCs and talent coming through, and it was... it was really, really exciting to see that kind of like grow and develop. And I just feel like, you know, now kind of like we're seeing where like, where the new exciting arts coming through, like it's definitely, I feel more coming through from like the road wrap and drill side of things. So you like, you know, you've got your RV and your heady ones and your SLs and your Emma Hunt shows. then also like on the flip side of things you kind of like with your afro bashman like afro swing whatever people want to call it so your kojo funds and your notes like coming through with that style as well like i feel like right now like the most exciting music coming through is definitely more vocal driven And like, you know, and I feel like we as Radar were definitely like right place, right time in terms of kind of like having, just having like the right people there really. I remember like, so we have the likes of like Kenny Allstar on the station and like, you know, we were like one of the first people to have like six, seven, like do a radio set and like, you know, to really kind of like see where that talent is kind of like, is like going. I just feel like and same as well like having the likes of like P Montana on the station where we're really pushing like you know all this like new talent coming through and it just seems like you know just the talent emerging everywhere now and it's just great that we're kind of like we're there just kind of like in the middle of it really I wanted to pick up on this sort of open door policy thing a little bit because I guess when we spoke for the real scenes London film You're kind of describing a situation in the radar building where if not 24-7, then, you know, something approaching that where you've constantly got people coming through recording and, you know, you're doing workshops and you're allowing people to use the facilities and stuff like that. Why is that important to you? You know, it seems like, you know, this idea of community and, you know, giving people that start and sort of going beyond even the people who are appearing on the stations. seems to become like a really important facet. Yeah. I think that's kind of like the amazing thing about radio is it's a hub and like it's a physical hub as well, as well where people can come and hang out. But it's important because it's one of those things it's like I'm always obsessed with like, okay, what's next? Who's coming through next? Like who's going to be like the next AJ Tracy? Like, you know what I mean? Like who's going to be the next Ben UFO? Like, you know what I mean? Who's going to be the next Amy Becker? Like, you know what I mean? I'm always interested to be like, okay, cool. Again, it's that obsession of the more open, the more like, it's just maths. It's just like, we're more likely to have, you know, these people come through our doors and kind of like to get things involved. Like, you know, and you do like workshops and stuff like that. Yeah. So, um, from end of last year, we kind of like been doing workshops like every week, which has been really exciting. So what workshops kind of like focused on like production workshops, focused on DJ and workshops focused on presenting and then like And like we did like a partnership with Link Up TV and like did like a workshop on video production, which was really exciting. Again, it's kind of those things. It's like with Radar, it was like it's definitely like something I wish I would have had. kind of like coming up as a DJ in London and kind of like and someone who's like who wanted to kind of get involved in the scene that kind of like wasn't like naturally part of it like you know I'm like I'm originally from like Barnet like North London like top of the northern line so just in London but like I never felt like I could call like I could never pick up the pirates like where I was based, for example. Like, you know what I mean? Like I came in through Rince from like listening to the podcast and things like that. And I just felt like I wasn't like growing up like in East London, for example, when like Grime and Garage, all those things were kind of like going. Like, you know, I very much felt like I had like a outside view of things. You know what I mean? And I just felt like with Radar, it's kind of like I just wanted to be something like open for everyone to kind of come through. And I feel like with the open door policy, it's like you never know like who's who's going to be the like the next superstar. You never know who's going to be end up being like someone you work with very closely for like the next few years. You never know who the next person to come through is going to be like an amazing DJ. or like an amazing producer. It's also like radio has taught me, it's like you have to be nice to everyone because you never know who's going to be big next. Like, you know what I mean? It's like... If you're only nice to people that you like, you feel like are big now, like, yeah, I mean, like, and you're like a dickhead to people that you don't know, like in a few years, a few years time, like they're going to be the next superstar and they're going to remember you treating like a dickhead. Yeah. I mean, so I know what you mean. It's like the attitude of, okay, I can extract some work from you and therefore I will be nice to we've had kind of people kind of at Radar start off like not being able to DJ. And now they're like going around playing all over the world, be able to DJ. So I feel the open door policy, it's kind of like, I don't have a crystal ball. I don't know what the future holds. I just feel like, right, if we're open as much as possible, if we're doing as many shows as possible, if we're filling out every, all 168 hours in the week with as much original content as possible and pushing things forward as possible, then we should get some exciting, interesting results. I mean, it's just frustrating things where I can't tell you, okay, in six months we're going to have this, in a year's time that's going to be opinions and think things are going to go there but you know my guess is kind of as good as yours really Do you think there's a sort of social or political aspect to what you do in the, you know, I guess you're increasingly doing like talk shows and, you know, you're giving people kind of an open mic situation to, you know, just talk about the issues of the day. I mean, is that sort of an important aspect of what you do, do you think? Yeah. You know, and is there those sorts of conversations take place a lot within? your community. Yeah, definitely. I mean, like it's a building full of really opinionated young people. Like, you know, the, the debates are never over. Like, you know, we're constantly chatting shit and like, you know, trying to work out, you know, where everything's going on. But I think like for me, it's, I really believe in free speech. Like I really believe that people should have a platform to kind of like say what they want. you know i mean it's like whether people are gonna like agree with you or not and i think that like that leads to interesting conversations interesting debates which you know you don't tend to get so much on like regular commercial FM radio. Like, yeah, I mean, it's very much like, you know, we've got toe the line rather like BBC where it's government funded and you know, people don't really want to be pushed the boat out too far with that. Or you've got your commercial stations, like your capitals and your kisses and they bought, you know, they've got advertised and they've got brands on board. So they very much are quite scared to talk about certain look if it's important to people kind of like let's let's talk about let's have a conversation about it yeah i mean i think well that's i feel that's important with the station like you know i feel like a big question with radar is people go like okay cool like you got the radio station you got these practice rooms you have to do these workshops and like you know i mean people come ask the question like okay cool like where does the funding come from and like you know i was quite happy to kind of have a conversation with you topic we're going to talk about and I'm pleased to say it because My dad is Mike Ashley, so he's the founder of Sports Direct. And that's where, starting the station, that's where kind of like we were able to start it. And that's where we were able to keep things going and be able to pay people's wages and, you know, be able to kind of keep these things going. But I remember with Scratcher, he wanted to bring on like Inga Copeland to come on and do like a guest slot on Radar. And she was just kind of like, oh and I met her in the club, and I was like, please come, please come on the station, you are more than welcome to say whatever you want, I really back and believe, like, you know, be able to say what you want, like, yeah, I mean, this isn't some sort of, just a platform just to appease me, and like, I remember she found it quite funny, and I was just like, for me, it's just like, I don't care if it's, if it's attached to me personally, I don't care if people feel like they're going to be offended. I feel like if you want to talk about it, you should have the freedom to talk about it. You know what I mean? If, you know, people get offended, we'll tune into another station. I mean, but how do you communicate it to people? How do you talk? to you know how do you have that conversation with people if someone's like well you know sports direct or like where's the money coming from or something what's your response usually well like it's one of those things it's like those people those opinions I don't think they've set foot in the building because once you set foot in there and you kind of see like okay cool like wow like you know you've got like 10, 15 young people like, you know, who are able to have like a proper job in music. Like you'll be able to focus on like interesting, exciting music where like, you know. they were able to kind of like work a full job in music that kind of again like i wish i was able to kind of do when i was younger like you know when i was working at rinse like you know like i loved it and it was a real commitment but like i had to like i was dj a lot on the side just to kind of like to make it work money-wise like you know with this it's like okay cool we're allowing when we're giving like you know young people opportunity to be able to work in music very frustrating because like you know it's endless series of unpaid internships and all these things there and it's just like no we're really here offering like okay people opportunities to start careers in music like you know we're kind of like you know even with our facilities like you know we've never charged anyone to do a radio show like you know pirate radio stations like famously known for you have to pay to play you gotta pay subs to play and like you know stations also like nts like that's the foundation of how they started you know i mean but if we wanted that younger dj audience we knew that okay cool i don't know if you're 18 year old kid and you got come to the end of the month you got 20 quid to your name are you gonna pay subs you're gonna go out with your friends you're probably gonna pay go out with your friends you're not gonna pay subs and you're gonna lose your show so with this it's like i've much felt like right if we're gonna focus on like the next generation of radio and like young djs and mcs like we don't we're not gonna charge subs so we never charge subs we've never charged people do these amazing workshops where we're giving like allowing people to kind of dip their toe into the music thing get get wrong understanding of it and it's like you know without that there like we wouldn't be able to do it because it's just like what are we what we're supposed to get government funding for this it's like what would the government we have right now you think like you know closing youth centers left right and center like they would put money into something like this a community project like this like were we supposed to like wait around and wait for a brand to kind of come and sponsor it and take all creative control away from us it's like no like I'm someone of extremely privileged position extremely privileged background I kind of felt like why should it be so hard to get on a decent radio station why should it be so difficult to get a full-time job in music you know so I kind of felt all right I have the ability to do it Let's do it. Let's give it a go. But was that like very much in your thinking at the beginning? So, I mean, I know you've had like personal radio ambitions and, you know, the idea of starting a station must have been like large in your mind since you were young. But were you also thinking, look, I do have this privileged position, but along with this, I can help tons of people. Not really. Like, I'll be lying to you. If I said like my ambition was always to start a radio station, my ambition was like, I just wanted to do something in music. And then I started DJing when I was 17. I was like, okay, cool. This is, you know, I'm not particularly musically talented. Like, you know, I'm not a pretty good producer. I can't sing. Definitely can't rap. DJing kind of like allowed me to be like, okay, cool. Like, I'm able to do music kind of like Like, I just wanted to do it because I loved it. Like, you know, when I was working at Rinse, I just wanted to DJ on there. Like, you know what I mean? Like, and apart from that, it was like, I just wanted to be involved and working with other people who are really pushing great music. It was one of those things where, so I worked for Rinse for two years. And then after that, I got the opportunity to work at NTS as a studio manager there. At And I was there for nine months and I loved it. Like I thought I really feel they were the first internet station to really gain traction. But then I felt like, okay, cool. Like there is only like any jobs going there. And if I want to carry on radio, it would have to be like for a really big commercial station. And I just felt like I don't want to do that. And I just felt like, you know, from working at these stations, I always felt like. so many of my friends were just kind of like looking to kind of like get on stations or looking to get on board with things but they just weren't the opportunities there so I was like okay cool let's give this a go let's give this okay I kind of felt like right I'm either gonna have to start my own station or I'm gonna let this dream die and it's like it's my it's my favorite thing in the world just you know just being involved in radio and being in a live studio so I was like okay cool let's give this a go for me it was like it was quite a conscious thing starting the station and then kind of like It was a bit of a weird one where it was just kind of like, because before then, like, I don't know, like working on the jobs, like I just wanted just to get on with it. And I would, I wouldn't be very upfront about that type of things. And there have been like times where I've had to flat out lie about those type of things, because I just felt like people are going to view me because of that. People are going to view me on kind of like what I'm. trying to do all oh sorry you mean you were disguising the fact that you're in the position you're in yeah yeah yeah because I just wanted to crack on with it and get on with it and then I think we're like with Radar it was like At first, I think we were able to kind of like, I don't know, come up with some stories here, there and everywhere to how it got going. And then it got to a point where I was like, okay, cool. Like, I'm either going to live my truth and kind of like make the most of it and kind of like, okay, cool. Like, you know, when we first started, like it was me doing everything. I was like sleeping on the sofa in the studio three nights a week. But then once I realized that, oh, cool, there's something there and we can be in a position where we can have a team and employ people and really build these great studios and have these practice room facilities and now be in a position where we're doing workshops. I had to be like, okay, cool. Some people are going to have some things to say, which they are fully entitled to say. This is the type of thing I really want to get. you can not be a fan of my dad or my family or this, that, or whatever, and still be a fan of, of, of radar and what we're doing. Yeah. I mean, I felt like the one thing I kind of difficulty I kind of have with it is I think when people want to make people who are DJ at radar or involved at radar feel guilty about it. And it's just kind of like, where else were they gonna go like yeah i mean like why should you make like like a bunch of kids or like young adults kind of like feel bad for trying to make the most of their career like yeah i mean and kind of like you know whether it's doing a show or kind of working involved with it just like why should there be any feeling of like guilt or shame you know i mean i feel like A lot of people, when they meet me in person, I feel like I'm a lot different to how they think I'm going to be if you've never met me or spoken to me. There shouldn't be this need to hide who I am or be in shame of who I am because I feel like, look, I'm in this great privileged position, but I feel the work we're doing is so great. You know what I mean? And so many people are benefiting from it. What I love so much. about radio and DJ culture when we started, like 2014 to now, you look at technology, it's gone are the days where you need a huge record collection or even a laptop with Serato or Traktor, all you need is a USB and you can go out there and DJ and that can be a way for a lot of young people to make a living. It's great and I think it's so cool with Radar that some people have come along. didn't even know how to DJ and now they're going off to the network they're supporting themselves financially from there and I feel like you know it's a really positive thing. It's a really good thing, you know, but then at the same time, people can have their views and their opinions on it. And like, and for me, just have to accept, like, that's fine. And I think the worst thing you can do is try to appease everyone. Yeah. I mean, sure. I mean, do you think about it in terms of the conversations that people have surrounding brands and music, for example? you know, where you've got the two sides of this argument where people will just take exception, you know, no matter what, to like, you know, big global company being involved in music for seemingly illegitimate reasons versus the other side of the argument where basically that project or that thing wouldn't exist without this brand's involvement and this money. Simple truth of the matter is there's not really, as you were alluding to, much money in this thing. No. I think with a view of the brand, it's like if you're in a position where you can work with these brands and sit able to support you financially and like it's allowing you to fully focus on music and be able to do i think really exciting creative things and i i see it as a as a good thing i think even now it's like look you look like electronic music producers you look at what happens spotify like these are the people that are going to be affected worse by streaming like you know because For example, you look at the Jungle Days or the Garage of the Grime Days, you could print up a few thousand white labels and you're going to make a decent amount of money. Now if you make a good tune, what are you going to do? You do a vinyl release, but it's always going to be in a very small quantity. We'll just about cover your costs. If you go to streaming... you're not going to get any money from it. You know what I mean? So I feel, you look at that side of things, it's quite sad. You know what I mean? That it's like back in the jungle days, there were people that would just produce tunes or wouldn't even DJ and they can make a living just from making music and gone are those days. And I think like now, like you look at the DJ and if you have the opportunity to work with a brand and that's going to pay your rent I think more power to you, really. I feel it's just like a sign of the times now, really. I think kind of like working with brands is kind of like part of the game to an extent. I mean, we're talking about a market here where despite all the challenges that we're talking about, there's a very, very rich, deep well of radio here. You know, you've been talking about some of the independents, but just, you know. from the commercial stations to the BBC stuff, FM, however you want to term it. Like, there is so much radio here, you know, mostly in London, but, you know, throughout the UK. Have you thought much about just why people seem to love it so much? You know, in this city, but then also in this country. I can't really speak on behalf of like the country. Yeah. The British population. I'm not even British to be honest with you. I've got a Swedish passport, so I can't even speak on behalf of British people. I just feel like with radio, you feel connected, like especially with live radio, like, you know, you could be at home listening to music, but you kind of like, you feel connected to something like, you know, you feel like, you know. Even with like stupid things like sending in like a text, like, you know what I mean? Or like sending like a shout out and someone like doing a shout out like live on air. Like it feels like there's like a call and response to it. And I just feel like, you know, that's why I feel radio still has got a place in the music industry because we can't lose that human element of music. It can't all just be algorithms. You know what I mean? There has to be. like a more human side to it and that's what i think what's so great about radio it's that combination of like music and people you know when you start listening to a show like on a regular basis you start to really trust the djs and presenters that's when you're going to hear music you haven't heard before that's when you're going to like oh like you know first time kind of like hearing a whole new genre and style and be like oh wow like this is something really exciting really interesting i probably wouldn't have heard otherwise yeah i mean i mean you touched on elements of this but i assume in the time that you guys have been on the air like the sort of face of what you do has changed quite a bit you know you were talking about focusing on video and you're talking about developing features and stuff like Do you think in the next like three years, for example, you're going to have to continually like revise what you do and how you approach it and, you know, the mediums that you're going to use and, you know, what do you think the future of that might be? I think with music, but media, like you have to be in a position to constantly want to reinvent yourself and constantly be trying to like approach new things. I feel like we've had these like false starts of things we think are going to be like, it's not so much about reinventing the wheel. It's just about like, okay, cool. I think just like fine tuning things and, you know, and knowing your audience. Yeah. I mean, I just feel like, you know, especially like developing video content, like stuff like Shai's content like it like the more we do this year like it seems to get better and better and better because I feel like she knows what she's doing we know what kind of like what the audience want and kind of like you know I feel like we're really putting out stuff that people like excited about and want to kind of watch and want to listen to but I don't really I don't really know in terms of kind of like where the future is and where the future is going. I just feel like, you know, people want to listen to good radio. So we'll put out, okay, how we make the shows radio shows better. You know what I mean? People want to be entertained with video content. People want to kind of like go to like a regular party. So it's all about like, you know. We started like a weekly party called Radar at East Block. And my real policy with this was like, you know, because there's so many kids at Radar, like who never went to plastic people and someone who worked at like Rinse and like Winter Forward on like a weekly basis. Like the idea of there just being like a really dark room with a loud sound system. and a really good DJ. Like it was great because it was just so simple and so minimal. So like we start this party now and it's like we make it as like dark as possible, loud as possible, like really try to vary things up with who we book. road rap and grime and hip hop to interesting out there electronic stuff and house and techno and bring it all together and I just feel it's just about giving something like a little bit different you know what I mean but it's just like it's not reinvent the wheel because it's like you know I've had it before but you know for kids come up now maybe the idea of like okay cool like having this like weekly dark space where it's so dark you can't see someone two feet in front of you so you're probably going to dance less self-consciously. You might see them and say something like, oh, this is quite new and exciting and interesting and different. It's just about taking bits and pieces of things that I've seen and I've liked and I've enjoyed and being like, okay, cool, how can we recontextualise this and put a radar spin on it and, you know. move things kind of forward really what about your own tastes I listen to a lot of ambient nowadays yeah for the first time no I kind of like I don't know like it definitely comes from like growing up and like playing a lot of video games stuff like that and like hearing this music like on like save menus and loading screens and not realising it was ambient but yeah I think like as of recent like it's very otherworldly and it's like it's very relaxing and I feel like doing this it's important to have But then on the flip side, I'm really getting into finding old jungle records and listening to a lot of drill. So it seems my music taste is becoming more and more kind of extreme. There seems to be less of a middle ground to it. Is there anything you wouldn't put on the station? Someone pitched you a metal show or something? If you wear a fedora... You know what I mean? You've got a lot less chance of getting a slot on Radar or being asked to come back. I just feel that's a telltale sign of just someone who's going to play music I'm not really interested in. If you're like 30 plus and white and possibly wearing a fedora, I don't know for you, man. I don't really know if we're really going to see eye to eye when it comes to music. But I'm at a point where I can't waste time no more So every second is important Years when I was dormant, could've more years I see, I see more shit Sometimes I get vexed, but then I just ask Jams, are you really gonna forfeit? Well you know what the score is, so I Try and rewrite this pantomime These cards in these hands of mine Who lack the omen in this talk of the urinate? I'm a half-ass, so would you give me the time I got my face in a few magazines and I'm fucking up souls and fucks Jams never got girls in school but now they holler like how come you ain't fuck me I remember when no school flipped round they said they loved me But I ain't comfy, you guys wanna try and rush me I just wanna grow, tell me why they wanna stunt me Niggas tell me nobody nigga who was just me Sitting with a pen and some headphones and paper Everyday writing, couldn't get rusty And I had drag then, I was in I never had to try. I could turn back the hands of time. Try and rewrite this. I'm playing these cards in this hand to my purpose. Trust me. Sometimes you gotta sacrifice. But get me long game and now.
