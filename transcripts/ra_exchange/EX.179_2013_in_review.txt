Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. We've just about wrapped up our end of year poll season, but we're not through with looking back just yet. Each year we invite a small group of RA staff members to discuss the topics and trends that define the last 12 months. This roundtable talk is based loosely on the format of the polls we publish on the site, which include the top DJs, albums and tracks of the year, but we allow everyone the freedom to mention anything and anyone they were feeling. We tend to go pretty in-depth during these conversations, but we hope you'll agree that even 90 minutes is barely enough time to assess the year that was. So it's December and in our world this means polls, lists and generally taking stock of the year that was and to help look back over what went down in 2013 I'm joined in Berlin this evening by three RA staff members the first of which is Andrew Rice. Andrew, you're over from Vancouver at the moment in Europe. How's the trip been so far? Well, I've only been here two days and I spent most of it on planes. I've been in Berlin for about six hours and I've had four meals, one of which was slightly above average ramen. And I'm also joined by our associate editor, Will Lynch. Will, we're in the middle of poll season at the moment, which means blurb writing. What's your emotional state like right now? My emotional state is decent. Blurbing has been, I guess it's something I sort of have a hang of by now. It's my third or fourth year doing it. And yeah, after a while you just sort of figure out how to come up with a really enthusiastic way of saying, ex-DJ did it. even if it, you know, no matter who it is, basically. And also join. by RA's music tech editor, Jordan Rothlein. Jordan, how's the blurb season been for you thus far? - It's been good. This is blurb season number two for me. And I feel like this year is maybe a little easier than last year, kind of getting the hang of it. And I've also seen a lot more music, a lot more of these DJs I'm blurbing about in person. So I think I have more to say. Sounds good. So for the end of year Critics Roundtable, we go through the same polls that we publish on the site. So we're going to talk about some of the things that have stood out to us this year. So over the course of the next hour or so, we'll be discussing some of our top DJs, live acts, albums, labels, commercially released mixes, compilations and online mixes. To set us up, we began 2013 with a breaking through feature on a Berlin DJ who had been playing out a lot in the city over the last few years, but started to slowly gain some international fame. Jordan, it was you who chose Redhead. as someone you wanted to discuss. Do you feel as though this was the year that he kind of broke through? I mean, I would have to say so. Just when you look at the places where he's played this year, it'd be hard to peg him as like a local Berlin DJ anymore. He's definitely still got quite a following here. If you want to see Redhead in Berlin, you have to work sort of hard to do it. He tends to play... very very late on Sunday at Berghain so there's the issue of getting into Berghain there's the issue of like staying awake to see most of his set so he was always kind of one for the heads but now if you don't live in Berlin you have the chance to see him and I mean he's absolutely fantastic for me I just don't know that there's like kind of a better young techno DJ who's playing right now. Will, when we were in Amsterdam at the RA party at Trou during ADE, and I remember you turning to me at one point, and I think I said something like, you know, is there a better guy playing techno right now? And you kind of made the point that like, well, he's on top of his game like you know you just you don't always get to see djs at the top of their game and that's obviously what's going on here and yeah he just strikes me as being someone who's kind of like you know he's in the groove right now he's sort of unstoppable and i i love what he's been playing and i love the way he plays it was that the best that you saw him this year at the ra party i think so if only because the other times that i've seen him this know, it was after being inside of Berkheim for like 12 or 16 hours or something. You really do, there is like kind of a stamina element to making it through his set. But at the, at the trial party, the RA party, I mean, he was just playing really weird records that absolutely worked. And he has kind of this way of selling music as, you know, great dance. music, like dance music you can't ignore, that kind of goes against how strange some of it is. And do we think the fact that he came 38th in our DJ poll this year is kind of a fair reflection of the year that he's had? I think so, yeah. I mean, he's definitely rising through the ranks of techno, I would have to say. I was thrilled to see him there just because I, I mean, I think he's so talented. Um, I think I put him at number two on my list and he could have very easily been number one. Um, something that kind of came up in the feature that Matt Unicone wrote was that he was kind of classifying himself for, he was certainly being thought of as a good closing DJ. Um, are there particular like characteristics of what he does? You think that. kind of make him a good closing act? Well, I guess, I don't know, not to bring everything back to a baseball analogy all the time, but like, you know, in baseball, there's like, you know, there's the closing pitcher. whose whole job is just to come in and be incredible so that, you know, the team will just win the game without question. And he kind of has that element, you know, the party's been going on for ages. People are getting a little bit tired. He gets up to the decks and just brings this incredible energy to the proceedings. Yeah, he could probably work at any point. But if you are looking to keep your party going for a while, he's probably the guy you want in the booth, you know? Will, did you see him this year much? Yeah, I saw him at the same party as Jordan, the Trout Party. I think a couple of the times at Perkine. Also, there was a video of him playing at Concrete in Paris that's an hour long or something. You get a pretty good feel for how he rolls. Actually, if you watch that video, it's pretty similar in style to how he played at Trow and, in my opinion, what he did. sounds like when he's doing a good job that wasn't the one that he had no shirt on yeah he has no shirt on okay um but uh yeah uh i think jordan said about the or that when he said about the closing dj thing um uh i also think part of what would make him a good closing dj is that um even though he's quite like full-on it sounds really serious um it's also kind of uh um generous to the audience. Like he plays songs that have, um, you know, what pass for hooks in techno and like, um, it's not super tracky, like they're sort of standout tunes and, um, it's sort of like fun in a way, you know, as opposed to something like someone like Ben clock or, um, you know, a lot of, a lot of DJs sort of in redheads world of techno are a lot more like. stripped down and super serious. And yeah, he kind of delivers in sort of like a, I don't know, just like engaging way. makes him a good choice for the end of the party. Yeah, I mean, there is like a certain like joy in the way he plays, not to sound cheesy, but there's also a lightness to it. You know, he can play very, very fast. He can play pretty, pretty hard, but it never really feels that heavy. There's definitely a sensitivity to the sort of music that he's playing. Well, actually, like a good example of this, I think the first time I ever heard him was some podcast but it's like pretty heavy, um, you know, really, uh, really pummeling techno. But then the last track is some, uh, still very heavy remix, but it's a good life. But the only part from good life is just, um, like the chords sort of pop in occasionally. Um, which in a way is sort of like, you know, what I was getting at before, like it follows suit with, you know, he's not compromising the seriousness of the set, but he'll throw in some, like, you know, he'll throw the audience a bone kind of, which makes a big difference if you've been hearing a pretty purist text. for a number of hours you know that stuff really stands out i think it's also pretty impressive that he's done this mainly off the strength of his djing there haven't been these kind of um transcendent records that have helped um bring people to him maybe in the way that someone like ben or marcel have had in the past um kind of on the opposite end of things um andrew someone you wanted to talk about uh who impressed you this year was ryan hemsworth What was it about his sets this year that kind of compelled you to big him up in this way? Well, I think Ryan is really representative of this big trend in North America that kind of gets ignored with all the EDM stuff happening at the same time, is that a lot of producers, especially in LA, have taken kind of mainstream hip-hop as their basis and made a lot of bootleg remixes or tracks that just go with the tempo and have kind of made this fusion of mainstream hip-hop and their own beats, which might be a little more ethereal or a little weird, and mixed it all with this big sense of humor that's really appealing to a lot of... kids who aren't quite raver kids maybe they're like they're more internet savvy kids uh it's a very specific crowd it's a very big crowd in north america and so and i think ryan hemsworth is kind of at the top of this pile um and i think that's why he said such a great year he released an album this year um he's been touring non-stop he did this huge tour with cyril han who's another guy who's in a similar vein except he does house rather than hip-hop but What really impresses me about Ryan's DJ sets, he's not the best DJ in the world. He's not that skilled. I'm pretty sure he leans too heavily on controllers and Ableton. But he has this knack for blending songs on the fly into maybe some acapella on top of a beat or just blending a pop song with his own beats in a way that shouldn't really work. I think his fact mix from last year had some really good examples of this. Every time I've seen him, it's just been really different, really surprising. And he's kind of the DJ who plays all your favorite songs, even if not ones you don't usually think of, like maybe an old R. Kelly track or some old girl group track. And he's really good at crowd dynamics. well and there's kind of a cult of personality growing around him as well which i find really interesting because he's a really humble like shy dude do you feel as though this um scene that you talk about um do these people think of them as dance music fans or is it something different um i think more and more yes i i think at the beginning maybe it wasn't which is why uh they had this whole new fan base growing was because these weren't people who were interested in dance music per se But this hip-hop-influenced music kind of brought them into it. And I do think that with the advent of these artists, they're getting introduced to more forms of music. Like, even Ryan Hemesworth will dip into house and dubstep, maybe, or, like, dubstep-ish music. yeah i think it was interesting in the uh favorite dj feature that we ran where he was um highlighting sam tiba um he said he's someone that thinks uh first and foremost about like moods and feelings and it's something he kind of aspires to in his djing would you kind of go along with that do you get that same sense yourself well yeah i mean again there's a whole layer of irony over everything ryan does and everything his friends do which kind of makes it hard to figure out what what's genuine and what's not, but emotion is the number one thing in Ryan's music. He loves sad music, and that comes through in his sets too. He'll maybe stop everything to play this really slow, sad song. And he's definitely driven by mood more than rhythm. I mean, his sets, again, they can just break down into almost ambient or really slow all of a sudden. But his sets are more about the mood they set than about the tempo. I mean, are you quite surprised that he hasn't maybe taken off in Europe in the way that he's kind of done so in the States? I do think it's a very specifically American thing. And when I say American, I mean North American, because Ryan is Canadian, of course. It's just, I feel like in North America, hip hop is the basis of popular music. And so when you combine that with like dance music with references to video games, other easily accessible stuff, it really just strikes a chord with an audience of a younger generation. And I don't know if Europe has the same thing. I mean, it doesn't seem like they do. Actually, the guy that I wanted to kind of flag up was... or is I guess coming from kind of a hip hop background also it was Arca he was someone he was one of many kind of mind blowing sets I caught on the Saturday night of Unsound I think the thing with him, people talk a lot about range at the moment, and there was quite a striking range of music that he was playing, lots of which I probably couldn't describe or put in genre terms. But I think the thing that really blew me away was just how he was putting music together. conventional mixing kind of completely went out the window. There was not really any beat matching. The tempos of the records were kind of fluctuating. But he was doing this really interesting thing with Pioneer DJ gear, where he would get to the place that he wanted to finish playing what he was doing, and then he would... kind of echo or delay the record and create a big kind of effect and then spin back. And it would create this kind of like big bloom of... delay and then he would bring the next record in it was kind of i guess in a way you could think of like dub djs and that kind of thing and like the and the delay and um you know stuff in of that ilk but um what that created overall was just this very very um kind of mushed up slidey kind of sludgy effect where he wasn't necessarily even respecting the measures of the music. So things were coming in seemingly from the side or from the top because you never really knew where you were or what your place was. And I think this mixing style, which I've never really seen anybody pull off before or quite in that manner, because, I mean, you see people doing spinbacks and stuff on CDJs, but... have that as your principal mixing technique. It was just like kind of mind blowing at the time. And then I caught him actually at Corsica Studios a couple of weeks ago. And I was... kind of a little less enthused because I think the people around me were a little less enthused. It strikes me as a style of DJing and putting music together that if people are kind of going into it, not really knowing what to expect, and it's just kind of a, let's say just a regular crowd or something, it could seriously catch you off guard. I think the people that were there that night, Evian Kreis had just played live and kind of he's doing more trap influence stuff and I think it was kind of hitting people with some immediacy um But then coming on after that and just these very, very seasick kind of rhythm sliding in and just the stars going all over the place, it just led to confusion. I could see people almost scratching their heads, which totally led me to believe that something really pretty amazing was happening. I think as well, I mean on the production front it kind of, you know, if you listen to the stuff he did on Luno this year or the ampersand mixtape that he bought out it was kind of a really nice reflection of what he does in the production realm the unpredictability that's kind of rooted in hip-hop in a tempo but it's just coming completely out of left field there are also a couple of Bjork records that he played in there because he's apparently doing some work on the new Bjork record. And the rumour was that some of the stuff that he was playing was off her new album that's coming out next year, which kind of lent it another air of specialness. Will, you wanted to talk about Helena Hauf, who's a DJ I also saw smash it at Unsound. What was it about her this year that was kind of doing it for you? Well, it was kind of, first of all, it was just sort of like a cool, the way it came together was kind of cool, which was that. We had just gotten her podcast submission earlier that week, and none of us knew who she was, but the emails specified that she was. you know, a resident golden poodle. And then I went to Hamburg to write the article about golden poodle. And I went with Christian, the photographer and graphic designer here. And, um, we were just going to stay for Friday. Um, what was it? I guess Thursday and Friday night, then come back. And then when we were there, all the crew at golden poodle told us that, uh, Helena half was going to play on Saturday. And, um, that we should really stick around. And so we just decided to like stay an extra night in a hostel and, and see it. And, um, I don't know, it kind of ended up just being one of these really special nights. Basically, a combination of, A, it was the kind of thing where seeing a resident DJ so fully in her element, you got the feeling that there's no way it could possibly be this good at pretty much any other club. And also, it was just amazing. she's pretty young. Like I guess she's in her twenties or whatever. But, um, if you heard a recording of it, of this set like you would certainly assume that i don't know she was some like lifelong record collector well into her 40s or something like it was just her and um one other guy the whole night this guy that runs the label looks wreck but um anyway um you know went from nobody in the in the club which or you know sort of like a bar i guess um she was playing like a really droney kind of tangerine dream style stuff and um just so perfectly step by step like built it up into um you know like full-on um club set but even though it's clubbious it was still just like new wave um seemed like virtually everything had verses and choruses and um i don't know yeah it was it was just uh totally unlike anything else i heard this year and and also um just kind of like how competently she moved through this range um and everything in that range was like really really unusual to hear in a club um and it was kind of like me Christian went through a phase of like trying to train spot a lot. And then we were just like, well, fuck it. Like every single thing that we're hearing is, you know, it's just, just like, just got silly after a while. Um, and it was kind of interesting to me too, because this was just on the, you know, just the next few weeks, I guess she became like this thing almost to the point of like, over saturation. Like the, at one point the term half gate was getting thrown around on Twitter for a second there. And, uh, it was so silly, but, um, anyway, uh, yeah, it was, you know, at this point, it's interesting to remember that, um, when we saw her then it was, uh, uh, distinctly pre hype and it was kind of like, spontaneous like funny decision to stick around for an extra night to see this girl that we only knew her podcast submission and um yeah we were both like we were both just totally floored by it like I mean um Christian would certainly agree it was you know like probably the best DJ set either of us heard this year maybe longer I mean, do you think in a way that she's, that what she does could go a bit further than the music journalist baiting like skill set that she does have? Well, one thing is that, I mean, After seeing her play that time, it was interesting to see how sort of she fell into the mold of like a pan-ish kind of artist with this sort of outsider house-y EP. Anyway, which was all pretty solid, but I did think it kind of like... uh, didn't do justice to, I don't know how good she was as a DJ. Um, and she didn't even, I mean, when she DJ, she didn't play anything that sounded like any of that stuff. It all sounded like, um, uh, yeah, pretty like old used record store kind of, kind of track anyway. So yeah, I guess, um, especially in light of the sort of, um, you know, I'm so wary of using the word hype, but with her ensuing popularity, I thought it just made it worthwhile to note. that Helena Half's the DJ is very different and in my opinion, like a lot more special than Helena Half as a producer. So would you say that it's definitely worth going to see her in Hamburg? Would that in your mind be the best place, absolutely best place? Yeah, absolutely. And I guess it's also just worth like noting that kind of the special detail of Golden Poodle is like... the way the room is, the way the sound system is, it's much easier to play. If you just play upbeat music of whatever kind, whether it's rock, hip-hop, like crazy jazz, anything, it'll work. Like people will be dancing and stuff, like you don't have to rely on, you know, well-mastered drums or any shit like that. So yeah, this set that I'm describing, like I said, it was hard to imagine it working many other places. Someone else that I happened to catch this year on the sound was Panther du Prince's Bell Laboratory. It was one of the two times I saw it this year. But Andrew, this is an act that you wanted to discuss. Well, Panther has always been one of my favorite techno producers. And when the Bell Orchestra album came out, I was a little disappointed. It was maybe the pacing or just the sound of it. The album just didn't impress me that much compared to his previous work. But the idea of seeing it in a live setting, which I'm assuming it was designed for in the first place, was really appealing. And so I saw him at Mutech. It was the final night of Mutech. And it was in this beautiful concert hall called the Maison Symphonique, probably one of the most beautiful venues I've ever been to. Like giant ceilings, beautiful wooden furniture, a very stuffy atmosphere, which is interesting for what is basically a techno show. And when it started out, it was a little bit cheesy. There was some fog on the stage. They all came out dressed in like overalls. moving very slowly and very dramatically. And then once the beat came in, I think on the third track, it had this real power to it because it was after 20 minutes of chiming bells and silence. And people were pretty into it. And then once the beat dropped for a second time, which I think is in the fourth movement, everyone in the hall got up at the same time. Kind of like this... weird synchronized breaking of the rules of this stuffy concert hall venue. And it was just like, it was just such a powerful moment because like everyone literally stood up at the exact same time. It wasn't planned or anything. There was maybe one person sitting down. A lot of old people like getting up and clapping. It was really cute. But it just felt like this intense surge of excitement that you don't really feel at a nightclub, either because people are on drugs or everyone's just doing their own thing. This was like one unified moment. And then when he came out again to do an encore where he did some tracks from Black Noise with the Bell Orchestra, it just really drove home the point of how he's combining these two traditions. So interestingly, like his music is kind of like classical in its own way, but with this with this techno beat and the way that he did it without sounding cheesy or like gimmicky was just amazing to me. Like I just I left that feeling so positive. And I'm not usually the kind of person to be like moved by something that much. But come on. If we had have had this discussion six months ago, I would have completely disappeared. agreed with you um towards the start of the year i caught the show in the queen elizabeth hall uh in the south bank center in london and i just thought it was the most twee polished kind of safe sounding thing that i'd heard in a while and i must add at this point that i was probably the only person in the entire hall that felt that way but afterwards my friend said I was visibly squirming in my chair. But I think what it was at that time was that the venue was just too clinical. What I was seeing and what I was hearing, compounded by the cleanliness of the venue and the safety of the environment, just led me to think it was too safe. And because they do that thing where they come out into the audience and it was just kind of sickly sweet. But I went into the Unsound gig kind of knowing that they have become a really big deal this year. And there's a kind of spectacle behind them that you don't really... get in most live dance music shows that I think really has resonated with people so I wanted to kind of get it and I wanted to get something from it and seeing them in the engineering museum that unsound uses for some of its bigger concerts it did kind of click into place for me Musically, I think it can be a little busy at times. I think with that number or that volume of instruments around the same frequency range, I think it can get a little muddy in certain frequencies and it's kind of hard to pick out the melodies and stuff among all of those chimes. just the spectacle of it, I think really, really stood out. And the bit where they came through the crowd was actually really wicked because it wasn't, there were no steps. It wasn't an auditorium. So they were moving through a crowd level. So you could hear the kind of chimes coming towards you, but you didn't exactly know where they were until they were right on. top of you um and yeah it's just like i've never seen something like that um but it just goes to show that the context um really plays a big part in these things um jordan uh the hacks and cloak i guess is someone you form quite a close relationship with this year after your exchange talk and uh your experience at um club to club Yeah, I mean, it's always like a treat. I think probably most people don't get to have this when you get to like sit down with someone for half an hour and talk to them about their music and then go see them play. Like it probably makes you something less of an objective observer of the show because you have a little bit of insight and you kind of get to know the person who's, you know. who's making this thing. But I remember before going to do that talk and before going to Club to Club, I remember thinking like, how am I going to talk to this guy? Because I had the hardest time getting into that album actually, Excavation. You know, I would listen to the first track and a half and I would just be like, I don't know what to do. Like you could you I couldn't listen to it while I was doing work. Couldn't listen to it before bed because it was too creepy. You know, I couldn't think of the right time to listen to this music. And I but what we kind of talked about in the exchange and this was after I was sort of coming around on the album. I think I got to listen to it on the or a couple of airplanes. But he kind of made this point in the exchange, and I think it's true, which is that really seeing him live is like the time to see him. He's very specific about how loud the sound system in the venue needs to be able to go. I think it's like 120 decibels sustained, which is like pretty crazy. He's really specific about how low the sound system needs to be able to go. I think he said like 30 hertz, which is like... approaching the lowest level that our ears can hear. Yeah, yeah, 20 hertz is the lowest. So 30 is like pretty deep. And yeah, seeing him live was just kind of, it really brought it all together for me. It's extremely powerful. It's very abstract, but it's really, really physical. You would never dance to it. You know, you still, there really isn't anything you can do to it except kind of stand there and just be moved by it. you know, your pants legs are flapping and you're kind of like nodding your head like, oh, this is amazing. And yeah, I found his performance at Club to Club to just be extremely moving. And listening to the album since then to Excavation has been kind of a treat. I think I'm able to like kind of go back in my mind to that to that performance. Did he do his kind of crescendo of bass thing? I caught him at Plastic People earlier in the year. Oh, no. no, it's maybe the end of last year supporting Laurel Halo. And his set kind of climaxed with just this like wall of base, just where you feel like you're inside to kind of. imploding yeah yeah was that a trick that you pulled a club to club yeah yeah yeah i mean i i definitely felt a lot of like swells in the set i mean there isn't you know there isn't a lot of rhythm behind what he's doing so it's it's kind of cool you know so much of the music that we hear when we go out has very little in the way of dynamics um which is to say you know quiet parts and loud parts But because he doesn't have much beats or even really much in the way of melody, he doesn't have a whole lot to work with other than dynamics. So that kind of, yeah, it's a really special experience. Kind of also on the extreme end of things, Will, you've highlighted Karen as one of your favorite live acts this year. Where did they wreck your ears? Free Rotation Festival. Um, but yeah, I guess the thing that I liked about, uh, Karen was, um, I wasn't really that excited to see them cause overall the, uh, sort of like new wave of industrial and like industrial influence techno didn't really strike a chord with me. Um, and their stuff on she works was, you know, pretty brutal. Um, and you know, on that side of things, um, But the thing at Furiotation was kind of like, compared to the records, or compared to what I'd heard at least, sounded quite like kind of sleek and smooth. It was still really hard though. But overall, I thought, I guess, sort of just the simple fact that, you know, there's these two guys playing really fast, hard techno without very much at all, aside from the drum sounds. and everybody walked out of there just like in total agreement that it was extremely, extremely good. Um, you know, it was like a universal highlight of the festival. Pretty much everybody liked it except for Steven. Yeah. Yeah. Tim has hated it. But, um, but even he even like, um, I don't know. I mean, he, uh, sort of frames himself as the only guy for your rotation that didn't like Karen. Um, But it was almost like one of these times where it almost makes you wonder, like, what makes one thing good and another bad or something. Like, it was really hard to, you'd be hard-pressed to point out exactly what made it so great. I mean, at one point I remember thinking, like, the snares sounded, you know, really killer. But, um, but yeah, like there's, there aren't particular moments that like really blew up or, um, it was, it just something about it was, um, really tight and really effective and kind of, um, left everyone in a daze. I really wish that I had, I was at free rotation, but I missed that performance. And I really wish that I had seen it because I've probably seen Karen maybe two or three times at other points this year. And yeah, just, it hasn't clicked for me. I see these guys on stage and they've got all of this gear and I'm always like, and that. That's what you're making with it. You know, it's like, it's so brutal. There's not a whole lot going on. This could be a context thing. I, I was actually going to raise this point because most of the feedback I've had from people has been pretty negative. But I realized that the time I was also blown away from them was free rotation. And it did come after Shackleton, an object where when you'd been in that night, sorry, in that room for the entire night. having those different shades and textures and music and then being presented with this like 90 minutes at the end just to like bring us home. You know, we were all very, very ready to go with the thrash kind of thing. Yeah, everything else has been Object and Shackleton are both kind of like approaching it, you know, from kind of like an odd angle or like you don't get these. you know, straight on pummeling beats or whatever. Also the fact that the room itself looks like a sort of demented bar mitzvah party or something like as, as opposed to a bear kind or whatever, where like, like if you were hearing such a straight, not that it's necessarily straightforward, but if you're into straight up techno in like a bonafide techno club, it might feel a little bit less. interesting than being in this weird you know carpeted room and a fucking whatever it is hall yeah somebody was um complaining about their um bear kind set in that coming on after surgeon um it's just it felt a little mono and a little flat and maybe like the dynamic range just wasn't there Keep moving around to show them If you can't make it, you need to stop Baby, look at me, look at me Be the first child, be the first child, baby The first child, be the first child, baby The first child, be the first child, baby So someone else we pended breaking through on this year was Jesse Lanza, whose album I'm assuming you've been enjoying greatly this year, Andrew, as soon as you want to talk about it. Yeah, I mean, it's funny. Jesse Lanza, the first time I heard of her was an email from a PR agent who I had also never heard of, maybe four weeks before the album was announced, with the video for Kathie Lee out of nowhere. I didn't listen to it, but I just never seen her name. I thought, oh, it's just some indie pop singer, not really interested. And then she was on the Iconica album. And again, I thought, oh, okay, here's just some random singer going on a hyperdub track. But then when the album was announced, I got the album stream and I was just really blown away by it. It's funny because it's not like a traditionally impressive album. It's very quiet. It's very simple. But everything is done so perfectly without being pristine. It's still a little bit raw, a little bit underground. It sounds like it was done in a bedroom studio or a house studio instead of a pop studio. I think a lot of that comes down to Jeremy Greenspan, who produced it. For me, it does kind of sound like a Junior Boys album with a really good female singer, which is not to discredit her, because having talked to her about the album's process, she had a huge input in it as well. But yeah, and I have another thing I liked about the album too was just it really balanced these really big pop songs like Keep Moving or to a lesser extent Kathie Lee, which is more of a ballad, with these really, really weird songs like Fuck Diamonds, leaving the title alone. or Against the Wall, which were just a little more off-kilter, not quite as accessible, which is kind of brave, because you could have had a really killer, just straight-up pop-up, but you didn't quite do that. And yeah, I was also really impressed by just the way she seemed to snowball so naturally. In the lead-up to the album, I got so many emails about her, I read so much about her, it was like, everyone loved the album universally, it really felt like a And while I don't like to buy into hype, I feel like in this case it was kind of genuine. She's a thing because she deserves it. One thing I found really striking, too, was after my interview went up with her, I got an email from a Sony BMG executive who wanted to inquire with her about songwriting for Sony. Interesting. maybe she's going places. Yeah. It's funny the way that you, uh, mentioned the first contact and kind of the, the effect that has on your impression because, um, of the, of the artists. Cause, um, when I, I think, I did click that link to the Kathy B video and the fact that it was kind of like a well thought out and like slightly imaginative and like pretty slick video was just instantly like okay this is this is kind of going somewhere um and it was also one of my favorite albums of the year for sure um And I've kind of put this down to the fact that I just wanted to listen to it all the time. There wasn't really a time that I wouldn't put that album on. It's kind of quiet enough so you can do things or you kind of have it on in the background and do other things. Or if you were to turn it up a bit, it can kind of get you moving in quite acute. kind of disco-y way um and her voice was very kind of it was you know it's soft it's slightly unassuming but it's never like in your face and um i'm sure if i was to go into my itunes that was like the record i played the most this year um on the kind of opposite end of the scale jordan donato dozzi plays beemask yeah i mean this is the album that really floored me this year kind of more than anything else. You know, if you work in a music magazine, you end up listening to a lot of music. So many things you end up just listening to once. and you have to kind of make yourself return to it. I remember when this came into the office, I think I just took it home. I was going to listen to it when I got home that night or something. And I remember putting it on and like lying in my bed and just being like, holy shit, I know I'm going to play this again the minute that it's over. It's cool. I mean, it's such a different record. In a way, it seems like it would be kind of a minor work. It's like seven remixes of the same track. I mean, granted, the source material is incredibly complex. It's like 14 minutes long. There's a lot going on in it. There's a lot to pull from. But you kind of hear the same melody over and over again. But it's wild how much range Dazi is able to get out of this. I mean, it's Dazi, so it sounds fantastic. There are a lot of different textures. You really feel like you're able to swim around in this music. But there's everything from like... incredibly, you know, obviously pretty moments on the record. Like the first track is just kind of the little arpeggiating melody with like kind of a rain field recording thrown on in the background. But then there are other cuts throughout that have more beats. And then there are some that are just like kind of almost pulverizing drone tracks or something. But I think almost every time I listened to it, I was like, okay, Vaporware 4, that's my favorite. No, Vaporware 2, that's the one that I like the most. It really stands alone as its own work. I mean, the original track that it was sampled from is maybe kind of better as a whole or something, but... It's a really overlooked track. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And when that came out in 2012, I mean, I think I was going through a period where I just wasn't listening to much out there stuff. I was listening to it. I think a lot of just like house music with vocals. And so I kind of missed it. Is that when you were reviewing more singles? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so. And so I actually heard the Dazzy reworks before I heard the original and then heard the original and was like, wow, like this whole thing is great. There's a story that he commissioned a single remix and then he just got so inspired that he just continued. I can't remember what the original like request or context was. Yeah, I think that that is the context as far as I know. But yeah, you can sort of sense that. he was just on this kind of ultimate creative quest and he couldn't stop. But I'm glad they all came out. Jordan, well, I've got you. An album review you wrote this year of the latest Omar S record. It'd be kind of fair to say it ruffled a few feathers. Would that be the case? Yeah, yeah, I think it... I think it did. I mean, I mean, unintentionally. So I'm always a little surprised if I write a review that's like, you know, positive paragraph, positive paragraph, a few little things in there that maybe I'm not so crazy about, you know, positive ending. People are always like, how could you possibly have panned that record? You know, Yeah, exactly. The reason I bring it up because Will wanted to highlight it as kind of one of his favorites this year. Will, did you kind of fundamentally disagree with what Jordan did? No. I guess the reason I wanted to highlight it was because maybe I remembered the review differently. I don't know if this is necessarily a fair representation of Jordan's review. It might have been my conversations with Jordan around the time we were listening to the album. I remember you were telling me that you found it a hard nut to crack writing that review, probably because Omar S. kind of just always does the same thing. It's neither good nor bad, but he just keeps... making the same stuff. And, um, and I feel like if you're in the situation of reviewing his new album, um, that will sort of tarnish your feeling toward it. Um, and I wasn't necessarily crazy about it, but then, um, he released it, you know, in. typically like arrogant fashion the vinyl version was like two parts each pretty exorbitantly priced it was three parts might have been yeah maybe all told it ended up being like 40 euros yeah right anyway so i bought one one half of it and um uh it's kind of funny how this works too like having it on vinyl which is primarily the way i listen to stuff in my apartment versus listening to the promos here in the office once i had half you know one part of the album on vinyl um i started to really really like um everything that was on it and um and also kind of made me reflect on just how like crazy um just like wildly consistent omar s is um like i'm he's really a rare breed in the sense that He's, you know, he puts out, he's fairly prolific and he's been putting stuff out for a while. And the quality has never really like dipped or anything. Like it's, he's, I think pretty much mostly everything in his catalog is really, really strong. And, and just, this is also compounded by like, I saw him play in a deck Manzel part in Amsterdam. He was really, really good and he was really heavy on his own stuff. It just kind of made me reflect on his overall, you know, oeuvre, if you will. But anyway, he has these kind of funny quirks where like, even though his songs are quite like tracky, they also have like pretty strong element of songwriting with like lots of melodies and stuff. And like the titles, like some of them sound like it would be like a Samuel Jackson quote from like a Quentin Tarantino movie. Like, you heard what the man said, motherfucker. And then another one is, the further you look, the less you see. Or thank you for letting me be myself. you know it's like I don't know like he's sort of just like a fascinating character to me in general and for whatever reason are kind of ambivalence about that album and then my sort of like evolving opinion on it Yeah, sort of drove that home for me. It's just how interesting he is. I mean, I think most of my, like my major complaint about the album was just that it, for me, and I stand by this, like didn't really work as one record. I mean, I think the fact that he released it as a number of 12 inches, like that's the way I would have wanted to consume that album. Some really, really great club tracks, but to listen to it front to back. um just did get a little i mean i i had a difficult time with it but i guess on the cd version there were no considerations made to the uh homeless and necessary necessarily um no the intros remained intact in the way that they would on the vinyl uh the outros were the same it was it was still built for djs yeah right but definitely one of the i mean one of the tracks on that record um it's money in the D yeah I mean is what definitely I mean it made it made my top 10 tracks this year yeah it's one of the best ones he ever did I think um which is kind of silly to say because the list of Omar S's best tracks would be very long um the record I wanted to talk about briefly was the um DJ Kotze um release he kind of does emotion in a way that no other producer does And it's kind of in a way that could be considered in quite poor taste in a way, just his like very, very goofy kind of. cartoonish way of doing things could be a real turn off but I'm just staggered at this point how he's managed to weave all of these elements and seemingly what is his oddball personality into his music and just had it be just totally convincing like as well just it's a real cliche that I hate but It is one of those albums that the closer you listen, the more it reveals. Just taking like, as an example, Magical Boy on the album, which I think was probably the standout for me, the one with Matthew Deere doing this kind of like... robot um pitch down vocal thing um there's like a fucking mandolin in that track and like strings and bass there was like a theater organ or something and then something only realized um six months after playing it quite a bit was that one of the central elements was like this cartoon kind of pinging up and down noise that was kind of going bang bang bang bang all through the intro and I was like how is this guy getting away with it I think all of the guest vocalists on it kind of worked as well the Matthew Deer stuff in particular was really cool but I think something like 8 of the 13 tracks had guest vocalists and I wouldn't say that any of them were kind of standout performers necessarily but the way that they were kind of weaved into the one Wonderful World of Kotsa, I think just really gave it something. I think that part of the reason his sense of whimsy works so well on that album is because to me it kind of feels like it was inspired by 1967 and psychedelic albums, especially Sgt. Pepper's. And it almost sounds to me like a... That was kind of stated, I think, wasn't it? Yeah. I think the press release kind of... Yeah, well, the press release... And there's like a Simon and Garfunkel cover on the record. But I think he really nails that. To me, it kind of sounds like a late 60s psychedelic pop record done with production volumes of today. Like a lot of those silly sounds, little effects probably would have been done by those artists if they had... the ability to and i know if you just look at a kind of pure musical level um the amount of hooks on the record is incredible like what you go away from kind of uh still humming and some of the like just very very uh classic approaches to like chord progressions and those kind of things um you know the vocal deliveries and stuff like really really gets under your skin um you know there could almost be like a a refined version of that album that was produced by some like wild pop guy in collaboration and that would be like a worldwide smash maybe I'm just dreaming there Well, and not to like keep, you know, harping on this Omar S record, but the DJ Kutsa record was definitely like kind of a wonder of pacing as well. I mean, there would be sections that were all songs. There would be like these kind of weird like beat journeys that he would go on. It was a pleasure to listen to you from front to back. It's also one of those albums that you get kind of two thirds into it and you're still saying to yourself, oh yeah, that track's on here. Oh yeah, there's that one as well, which I think is always a sign of a fantastic record. Bye. Let's move on and talk about some of the labels we're into this year. Andrew, Keysound Recordings. I guess the latest thing you've written about them was the Logos album. I assume you've been a fan of the label for quite a few years now. Yeah, it's funny because I have a pretty personal relationship with Keysound. So Martin Clark, through his writings, was probably my introduction to dubstep after I discovered Burial in 2006. And then the label was one of the first labels I really got into because they were really doing the whole kind of like colorful grime, like stuff like Starkey in with straight up dubstep. And it was all done pretty well. Like I liked almost all the releases. And I guess when dubstep kind of became unfashionable, and moved into garage and house, Keysound kind of lost its footing for a little bit because suddenly the music they were making was maybe a little bit uncool or a little bit niche because no one cared about dubstep anymore. But I think in the last two years, they've really hit a second wind. It's kind of a whole new sound. It's like an amalgam of grime, a little bit of UK funky, whatever the hell Beneath makes, and elements of dubstep. And it's just gotten more and And I think the Logos album really cinches the year for them. It's kind of like the culmination of everything they've been building up to. Because for me, that album, while it sounds a lot like Jam City, I know, I think that Logos puts it together in a really unique way. The first time I heard it, I was just floored. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, and it seemed so alien, but so familiar at the same time, because those tracks are still structured somewhat traditionally. The week I got the promo of that album I went on my friend's radio show and I played one of the tracks and the radio studio had a pretty good system and my friend's face when the drop hit and I think Menace His face was just like hilarious. He couldn't believe what he was hearing. And then I ended up playing two more tracks on the album on that radio show because we just couldn't stop listening to it. I think it's really testament to the quality of the label that if you look back at what they've released over the past three or four years, there have been numerous acts that have come along and made that kind of impact. Like there's the LHF stuff. There was the LV album in 2011. Some of the stuff that was brought together on the This Is How We Roll. uh compilation which even kind of even with a little bit of time now um looking back on the kind of year that someone like um ven and visionist and beneath is continuing to have like they just seem to be continually ahead of the curve in a way in a way that i actually think that um i i can never see key sound catching on in the way maybe a Hassel Audio would. Part of me thinks, and I absolutely love the label, but part of me thinks that what we're kind of dealing with here is um it's pretty uk concern it's pretty uk centric music um there are kind of uh allusions to just like you know london life and stuff and it's and it's artwork and the way i mean it's um it's catalog numbers as well it's like yeah ldn isn't it well the funny thing about key sound is i i talked about this just is that in that time period, maybe 2010, when they weren't the hottest label in the world and they were releasing really niche-y, dubstep-ish kind of stuff, they were supporting all these same producers. I mean, Logos has been around since 2010, but it's not until now that they've gotten attention for this being interesting music as opposed to music no one cared about because it sounded a bit like dubstep. So I think it's just the rest of the scene is kind of looking back towards them now, but they've been kind of doing the same thing the whole time. It's just, like you said, they're ahead of the game, but they're so far ahead of the game that people don't want to pay attention at first. Jordan, Mr. Saturday Night, someone wanted you to talk about. Yeah, I mean... This is a label that I guess I've been lucky to follow since the beginning when they first started putting out records. I was living in New York and going to Mr. Saturday Night parties more or less religiously. They were the best parties, in my opinion, well, some of the best parties to go out to in New York. One of the great things about it was it never mattered who was playing. As the party went on longer and longer, they started having fewer and fewer guests, and it was just... Justin Carter and Eamon Harkin playing records all night. And yeah, I mean, if you started going a lot, you would hear a lot of the same records over and over again. But it didn't matter. The vibe was always great. There was a warmth to the party and inclusiveness to the party. And so yeah, the label started in 2012 with Anthony Naples. put out the Archie Pelico record a little bit later, but it really seems like this year, um, with people like Hank Jackson, um, this new Boya record that just came out, they've kind of moved into kind of a little more of this weird outsider house thing for like lack of a better term for it. It's in a way I feel like to people who haven't been to the party in New York, there's maybe like a little bit of context that's missing from this label. If you go to this party, you're not going to hear like Will Bankhead jams all night. I mean, you're going to hear a lot of like disco records and you, you know, you will hear some like kind of weird dusty techno. But I think that. Justin and Eamon are, for the most part, I think what excites them is young people who are as excited about music as they are and who really, really want to get creative. And this label has been a fantastic showcase for that. I think probably other than Dark Sky, there really hasn't been a producer on the label who was well-known or had... done much releasing before releasing something on on this label and um i i think that that's they would probably say that that that's by design will when we were uh kind of discussing this section uh before the talk um you mentioned that you wanted to chat about lies and i kind of went oh really lies is there anything left to say and you assure me that there was um i Has 2013 been as big a year for Liesers? It basically made me think of last year. It was at the end of the year when, I mean, Lies has been popular all year, but it sort of culminated at the end of 2012 as Lies really being like a thing. And Ron Morelli did one of our final podcasts. Yeah, I think it was the penultimate one. him you know lies sort of taking off uh in the past 12 months and he made some typical like ron morelli statement where he was like yeah let's just see if the phone's still ringing this time next year like smell me on that or some shit like that and um anyway uh which you know sort of a point being like um let's see if this is a flash in the pan or not and um I don't know. I think this year sort of solidified, well, in a way solidified, like the labels sort of place in this whole scene. But I think the most interesting thing about it to me is how much people like to argue about lies or like, like just, you know, that it ends up being so divisive. And the interesting thing to me is like, I guess I sort of have a background like, you know, I grew up in Boston and went when I was a teenager, went to like indie rock, punk and metal and hardcore shows and stuff like that. Um, bands like. brothers and converge and that sort of shit. Um, and, uh, I guess sort of, so to me, the whole lies thing doesn't really seem that, um, crazy, but, um, I've had people, you know, with like strictly dance music backgrounds, uh, like friends of mine say like, yeah, I feel like some of it's maybe meant to be a joke or like, I can't imagine why you would want it to sound like that unless you were intentionally fucking with the listener. And, um, to me, like this whole idea of like creating this effect of listening to it and like not knowing if that's how it's supposed to sound. Um, I don't know. That doesn't like that never, that sort of rings true to me or that that's, that's not so odd. But, um, but I guess like in, you know, the world of, uh, DJs and clubs and stuff, it is pretty strange. But, um, but in general, I think, uh, in a weird way, like as esoteric as lies is, um, they kind of have something for everyone. Like, like I don't have any feeling about probably at least half what they put out. but the things that I like, I really, really like like the Florian Kupfer record and, um, Tarek, Tariq, however you say his name. Um, the recent one from Voisky, like those are huge, huge records. And, um, bowls of steel thing as well. Yeah. That one was cool. And, um, anyway, I guess I think, uh, it's basically, it's interesting to me that, um, they can have the label can have such a sort of singular identity, but at the same time, like they're really kind of doing a bunch of different things. And, um, I don't know, I guess like I sort of tend to like the more, um, mellow kind of trippy side of it. I'm sort of like melancholic stuff. Um, but, um, Different people can find different things that they like in it. But also, in a way, it was weird. Sometime earlier in the year, I started reading Portrait of Dorian Gray. In the beginning, Oscar Wilde lays out these little maxims about art. One of them was like, if... like knowledgeable if a piece of art comes out and knowledgeable people are fiercely opposed on it like people that appreciate art all the time are in like fierce disagreement about this um that's a really good sign and um not to open a can of worms, but it was sort of the same thing with the Daft Punk album and with the lies albums. Like when something comes out and everyone is just like, um, pissed off about it somehow, even though it's just music with no social or political content or whatever, people can actually have like long arguments about it. Um, I find that kind of noteworthy on its own, I guess. Well, yeah, and even as like a fan of the label, I mean, whenever I would go to the record shop this year, there was invariably like, you know, I don't know, five or six new Lies records in there. You'd always grab them because you'd be like, I'm going to like three of these. And then you'd listen, it'd be like. okay, I love this record. I have to buy it almost more than I would feel about other things that I was getting in the, in the shop. And then the one I'd put something on and, you know, within three seconds, I'd just be like, Oh, absolutely not. You know, but, but I, I would never be like, man, what's Ron thinking, you know? Yeah, even when you hate it, you're like, yeah, okay, fine, that's that thing. But it never strikes you as limp or uninspired or anything. So do we think Ron's phone is going to be ringing this time next year? who knows? Seems likely, I guess. Andrew, you look like you're going to say something. Oh, I think so. I mean, I think if anything, this year they proved that they're more than just hype or excitement or a trend. Even if people stop paying attention, I think Ron is still going to put out 20 records a year. And he moved to Paris, which I think is a really good sign that he's kind of being serious about this now. He's not working at the record shop anymore. Yeah, I feel like it'll still be the same next year. When I've seen him DJ this year... I mean, he's way slicker than he used to be as a DJ. And I don't mean that in a bad way. I just mean, I think he kind of knows what he's doing. He kind of understands that he kind of occupies this place. And instead of being like, you know, oh, fuck it. You know, he's kind of owning it. Well, I do wonder if maybe like in two or three years, it'll be like a tech house label. You never know. Yeah. This year in putting together our lists for the official meet or commercially released mixes, if you like. We experienced some problems in that I got everybody's lists back and they were partially empty. Last year we had mixes like Ben Clark and LaVon Vincent Fabric and Zip as well. We were talking about the Slow to Speak compilation last year and Andrew Weatherall's masterpiece. It just seems like there was a little bit of energy lacking in that market this year. Is that something you guys would agree with? And did you have kind of a problem coming up with your list this year? I mean, I absolutely did. I felt like at the end of last year, like all the mixes you mentioned, also Tika's nonstop mix. I mean, I really was like, wow, like the commercial mix is back. compilations are back. There was a great mix that kind of kicked off the year, the DJ Sprinkles mix. And, you know, I was like, okay, we're still going. But as yeah. As the year went on, I don't think we played a whole lot of commercial mixes in the office, at least not more than once. And yeah, it just sort of felt like if there was any energy there, maybe it went away. Yeah, I think like halfway through the year, there was the Carl Craig masterpiece, which looked amazing, should have been amazing. And when I got it, it was just so boring. I didn't want to listen to it more than once. And that really, you know, that kind of sends a message, especially after talking about last year's Masterpiece with Andrew Weatherall. There's a big difference there. And then I feel like after the DJ Sprinkles and Ben UofO mixes, it just kind of fell off. I guess as well at this point, the idea of a label starting a new mix series must be pretty daunting. Our end of year lists are mostly populated by the long running Fabric and Bosket ones and maybe the Balance and the DJ Kicks and those type of things. One mixer you mentioned, Jordan, though, that we all seem to agree on as being pretty kiddo is the DJ Sprinkles. Will, you wrote this review. kind of what was it about his approach that really did it for you? Well, I guess on a personal level, it was just that I really, really like DJ Sprinkles productions. I've been a fan of him for a while, but I'd never seen him DJ and wouldn't really have been able to imagine what a mix from him would sound like. And it was kind of cool how. uh, the mix, um, even though I don't think it had any of his own tracks or, um, basically with other people's records, he, uh, really managed to, um, stick to his sort of signature sound, this kind of like pillowy, um, like nice melodic kind of subdued house thing. And I guess to me, it's just sort of, you know, he has an unusually distinct signature sound. It was kind of cool to see and be able to recreate it with other people's records. But also there was sort of like, as far as mix CDs go. It had some nice little like twists that sort of made it a little more special, like the way he's really heavy on these filter effects and this kind of echo effect sort of ties the whole thing together and reminds you that like the DJ is, you know, they're doing stuff. I also like how he sometimes does these transitions that are like. he pretty much just starts a new record, but in a well-placed way. Sort of reminds me of like, you know, what I sort of imagined to be this really old school style of mixing, like before it was taken for granted that you would do blends, but you know, you still had to sequence things well and bring them in in some kind of clever way. Anyway, yeah, so that combined with sort of the effects thing, I don't know, just sort of made it seem like he was sort of involved on an artistic level that you don't see too much on commercial mixes these days. I mean, I almost think that, I mean, I agree with everything you're saying there but I almost even think that that's an over complication of it somehow I just think that there just wasn't a duff track on the thing and like the sort of range or the years that he kind of spanned with his selections and I think everything on there is a timeless piece of quality house music Andrew, you did manage to populate your list with something, which was the Token introspective mix. It's not something that I would have assigned to you necessarily as being one of your favorites. What was it about this? Well, Token really struck me this year. I feel like since, you know, Barricade became the big thing, techno has really moved in a direction that's much harder and darker, whether it's just like... straight balls-to-the-wall techno or stuff that's a lot moodier and dronier. But I feel like Token, I took more notice of them this year than in past years. They have this thing about them that's a little more, not quite melodic, but they have, the records have sounds in them that are really striking and beyond just the monochromatic techno sounds. Kind of reminds me a little bit of Delson records and their ability to be a little bit atmospheric. But that mix just really hit home for me. And the fact that it's called Token Introspective instead of Retrospective kind of says a lot too because it's definitely, it's a pretty banging mix, but it doesn't feel like a club mix. Like I think Matt, who reviewed it for RA, really put it well when he said that the mixing gives each record a chance to breathe and really show itself off. So it's like you're listening to a collection of tracks that are mixed together, but not a way that a club DJ would. And the amount of variety on that 70-minute mix is just amazing. But it never feels like there's a left turn. Everything is just straight ahead with all these interesting melodies and sounds and so many great producers. It's just amazing, easy to listen to techno mix. It's never too hard, never too soft. It's just fantastic. It really stuck with me more than any other Technomix, I think, this year. Will, you reviewed a jazz record this year. Yeah. How did that end up happening? Yeah, well, I guess that's sort of... speaks to the, you know, state of commercial mixes in a way that basically, yeah, so it's the Theo Parrish Black Jazz signature. When I was reviewing that, I was thinking about how, you know, sort of like in a way you would think the original idea of a mix would be just sort of like... educate the listener in a way or like introduce you to a lot of stuff you haven't heard of. Um, maybe that was the, to some extent, the purpose they served at some time. Um, but now there's not really a need for that. Um, Anyone that's really interested can find out about music a million different ways. But especially to people like us, I have a lot of time for a jazz mix. I like jazz. I don't know that much jazz. The idea of having someone like Theo Parrish show me a bunch of killer jazz records, that sounds fucking great. I really have a use for that in a way, precisely the way that I don't. for a house mix or techno mix in many cases. Um, actually there's kind of a funny story with that mix. When I was like emailing with the guy that works the label, I'm snow dog. Um, he said like, uh, when he got Theo Parrish to agree to do the mix, um, he was like, uh, so a lot of these records are really hard to find. Um, And, uh, Theo Parrish said like, okay, um, I'll do the mix, but I want these records and I want them all on vinyl. Um, And it seemed, you know, it kind of seems like maybe he was like using this opportunity to just score himself a bunch of like rare vinyl. And anyway, the guy from the label was like buying them on eBay and shit like that. Like it was like really difficult to get them. Shit, it's no wonder we've managed to get a podcast out of him. This is what it takes. Um, but yeah, anyway, in a way, you know, I guess byline is like me and I'm probably not alone among Theo Parrish fans and being like, um, like a jazz lightweight. Um, And so, yeah, that mix felt very worthwhile. Like I was really happy to learn about like kind of an essential label and hear a bunch of great stuff that I didn't know about already. Yeah, I'm definitely in that boat. I mean, Theo Parrish is one of these people where somebody's like asks me like, you know, say I'm going to go with some friends who don't know Theo Parrish to a Theo Parrish night. They're like, what does Theo Parrish play? I'd be like, I don't know. You just have to trust me on this. He's one of these DJs and I guess producers as well, who you do kind of place implicit trust in them. Like the music that they're playing is totally legit and it's going to blow your mind. I'm like Will. I like jazz, but I don't know nearly enough about it. And in a way, that made me feel a little uncomfortable listening to this mix. I felt like it asked me to go out on a limb with Theo Parrish more than you sort of normally do. But I enjoyed it when I kind of... listened to it as Theo Parrish playing me records. I really enjoyed it. And then when I kind of separated myself from it and just said... Like, I'm just going to listen to this as music. It doesn't matter who's presenting it. I also enjoyed it. But yeah, I mean, it's definitely the odd man out on my list this year. I didn't listen to any other music really that sounded like this this year, other than when I maybe saw Theo Parrish play. Andrew, the compilation that you picked out was from a Parisian label. click, click, boom. Do you feel in a way that they've kind of got the recognition they deserve for what they've been doing out of Paris? Is that kind of another side of Paris that people haven't really been picking up on or seeing? I think yes and no. I do think that they are another side of the Paris club scene that people don't really think about. I don't think they're getting the recognition they deserve. I do think they are more so this year, but still not quite the amount of respect they should be getting. And for me, it's kind of a conditional love because I have a lot of problems with... Europeans appropriating the sounds of like black America. It's just really problematic for me. But I do think that they do it well and honestly enough that it's really interesting because their music is really powerful in a very physical but clean way that really appeals to me. Sorry, just to go back, are you talking specifically about hip-hop? Hip-hop, ghetto tech, like that kind of stuff. Something feels not right about it, especially coming from some white producers. Not everyone involved in Collected Glee was white, so I won't get into the race thing. Yeah, and the compilation really drove it home for me because I feel like with their singles before, I was kind of hit or miss on them. Some of them felt a bit like novelty records to me, like the French Fries, Yo Vogue thing, which I still don't really like. And French Fries is an amazing producer otherwise. But that compilation just presented everything so neatly. And even some tracks that I kind of ignored before, I heard on the compilation, I thought, like, holy shit, this sounds so good. And even with maybe about 10 producers, they all sound very different. There's something... unified about them that's hard that's hard to put my finger on but it's just this very clean physical powerful sound and i especially love the way they do bass because their bass lines just feel really really heavy but there's almost no mid-range whatsoever yeah i mean there definitely for me seems to be um some momentum and energy behind what they're doing um i think i've read in the press release for that compilation that these are all kind of 90s kids And they really want to make the point that these are young guys and they're bringing it to Paris in maybe a way that people weren't used to or something. I don't know if they're gaining any traction in the club circuit. haven't partied in Paris in that way but certainly what they were doing seemed to it kind of seemed to continue a little bit later or a couple of years after what was going in on in London in a way there was definitely some like Pearson sound influence in what they were doing and I think while they do have a kind of global ear in the way that you were talking about and they are absorbing a lot of kind of ghetto styles of music from around the world it definitely seemed to me like they knew what was going on in modern bass music but having said that, I still think that the execution of some of those ideas, while not necessarily original, have been like extremely hard hitting. I think there was one that we definitely agreed on this year was the, was it Authority? Authority. Authority, yeah. Record that just kind of played with like broken beats and silence and kind of impact in a way that you'd maybe associate with a label like Castle Audio. Yeah, it was, very like 2010 era bass music but it didn't it didn't feel old like it was in a style that might not be considered like in vogue anymore but the record did it so well and when uniquely as well Something that we were kind of having a debate about whether to classify it as an album or a compilation was the Liberty Sound record. I think we announced it as an album and reviewed it as something in between. It's a label and a collective we were... discussing earlier in the year when we were talking about critics around table but I guess they hadn't released that record at that point I think we will be in agreement they've been one of our favorite labels this year Andrew why do you think that they've kind of captured the imagination in the way that they have I think they kind of just tie together all these loose ends that are in the industrial techno movements, the remnants of bass music. and even a little bit of House and Techno with Asusu, one of the members of the collective. And just this really intuitive, but also really strongly connected way between all three of them. And I also think the fact that Cowton has really risen from kind of a nobody to a major somebody in the past year and a half has really helped contribute to that as well, because you have someone like Peverlist. who's been making this amazing music that doesn't sound like anyone else since the mid-2000s is finally getting recognition for it. Teaming up with someone like Cowden, who mixes all these different styles of music together into something that's really, like, creaky and old-sounding, and then you have Isuzu, who brings in this really, like, almost, like, svelte techno sound, and you have it all come together, and it shouldn't really work, but it does. And I think you could Except maybe some of the Asusi records, which are basically straight techno. You could take the names off the tracks and you might not be able to guess who's doing what. Yeah, I mean, we were kind of talking, I guess, in the last Critics Roundtable just about how strong the aesthetic is with this label. And so to compile it and make an album out of it, I mean, whatever you want to call it. Absolutely makes sense. It's interesting. I mean, it's such an encapsulation of a sound and you kind of have to wonder, like, what are they going to do next? I guess, you know, Andrew, you were talking about Peverlist and I wouldn't have necessarily like seen this coming out of Peverlist. It totally makes sense, but it is different from the stuff he was doing three or four years ago. So it kind of makes me, I don't know, I feel like if he's involved in These other guys, you know, are really kind of probably just at the beginning of what they're doing as producers. I'm not concerned about it. You know, there will be something interesting coming out of this, this camp for years, whether it's called Liberty sound or not. Yeah. I think it's interesting. Like if you compare the stuff that's come out on Liberty sound to stuff on punch drunk, because it sort of brings to light, like what, I don't know. It is exactly what Liberty sound does, which. basically I thought of it before as sort of like Obviously, the music is very stripped down in terms of like what sounds are there, but it also seems kind of stripped down. And it's kind of like a hard point to make. But like in terms of what like sensibilities are there or something like it seems very like just thoroughly, thoroughly un-cliched. And, you know, it's a bit. cliche to say like forward thinking or something, but it does seem sort of motivated by this, I don't know, objective of sort of of presenting sort of an audio design that is somehow as modern as it could possibly get. And like Pev's other stuff on Punchdrunk, even though it still is very singular, is a little bit more like, it'll just be like a really nice techno track, really nice bass track or something. It doesn't seem to have quite the same impetus of like... presenting something that's, that's just utterly new. Um, and I think the combination of like utterly new and, and totally, um, pared down to, to the most basic essentials. Um, is sort of what makes the label so potent, I guess, makes it so powerful. Yeah, I mean, I think for me, they're still doing something that I was getting from a lot of labels kind of circa 2010, 11, where the sort of spirit of innovation in the UK seemed to be so rampant. I still think that there are like new mutations and new spins that they're putting on these established forms. I think for me it was a disappointing turn of events when bass music guys just started producing house and techno. For me, someone who has a background in those styles, that seemed like a cop-out somehow. And I think that there's been many interesting angles and fresh lights that's been thrown on these quite conservative and quite formulaic styles as a result of that. but these guys still seem to be producing really in the spirit of what goes back to dubstep and the early days of dubstep where there's a lot of emphasis on the low end and those kind of things they're thinking very much about the sound system and like filling out the frequency range and the way the vinyl is pressed and those kind of things. And it just comes from a place, I think, of... I know a lot of them listen to... I don't know about Susu, but I know Pev and Joe are very much, like, dub guys and, you know, sound system culture to them is, like, a big part of their identity. And I think that's just, like, really, really nicely reflected in the music and the kind of overall aesthetic of the label. So moving on to online mixes, in the end of year poll we presented a bunch of mixes from other sites and as you may know we do our own podcast series which we haven't included. in the interest of fairness um but i think what we'll do to finish is just go around and have everybody talk about their favorite ro podcast this year perhaps starting with Jordan. Yeah, I picked the Pearson Sound podcast. You know, it's kind of funny, like, I think everyone would probably agree that this was sort of Ben UFO's year. For a guy who continues to play just extremely interesting, relatively uncompromising, strange music, he's... playing like festivals and doing an essential mix and just rising ever and ever higher like on our own DJ pole. Pearson Sound kind of had a massive year in 2010, I guess. That was kind of like the height of Pearson Sound. Every record he was putting out was better than the last. And sort of since... Instead of, I think, maybe feeling the pressure, feeling compelled to figure out how to keep getting bigger and bigger, he's really kind of honed in on this one thing and is just following it. And you don't really sense a lot of concern about what other people think about it. He thinks that this is... This is the kind of music that he wants to be making. He's going to make it. So I was just going to say, what is that kind of music? It's very sort of... It almost sounds like beats made in a laboratory or something. You know, it sounds like experiments. The records that he's put out on, you know, on Hessel Audio and then on his own self-titled label have really felt pretty experimental. He's throwing some beats into a centrifuge and spinning them around and seeing what comes out. And I felt like that was really reflected in the RA podcast. It was just this sound that he's kind of putting forward. without a whole lot else. It was the first time that I had heard, I guess, one of my favorite Pearson soundtracks in forever, Lola. And that just came out recently. Still sounds great. It was just a podcast I kind of kept listening to. It crept up on me in the way that his productions have. It definitely was several shades darker, I think, than anything we'd heard from Pearson's silent until that point. Well... So my favorite was Marcellus. I guess sort of the simple reason I thought it was so good was just because it kind of took advantage of the fact that you could play whatever you want in the mix. And, you know, it had Paul Simon in there and it was just some kind of like nice curve ball started out really quiet, really slow and slowly built up. sort of take advantage of, you know, the full range of what you can do in a mix while keeping it, you know, sort of a coherent, you know, vaguely house-related kind of thing. Um, I think also it just sort of had a certain spark that was, um, like those kinds of results of Marcellus having just recently decided to really make a plunge into being an artist. Um, he's, you know, put out a few records and has, uh, has been sort of doing stuff under that name for like a decade or something, but, um, it was right when we asked him to do the mix. I think he actually said this in the email back that, um, it was good timing for him because he had, he was just now sort of, um, making it like, like a real push of, you know, um, getting his name out there, um, getting more involved in this thing. And I think he's been, uh, he's been DJing since like the eighties, hasn't he? Yeah. Really, really long time. Um, But, yeah, I mean, I don't know what else was going on in his life. He just had a regular life, regular job, et cetera. But I think when you're, especially from the standpoint of curating mixes, sort of the most important thing maybe, you know, it's obviously DJs. Are almost by definition hit or miss like they do something different every time and it's kind of just a matter of you know Whether it's in a mix or in a club It's sort of a matter of when you happen to catch them like are they in the right frame of mind? Are they going into this gig with a certain amount of respect or is it more like they're gonna phone it in because it's the fourth one in a row and maybe they just don't give a shit anymore in general, blah, blah, blah. Um, kind of what we were saying earlier about redhead where it's like, he's kind of in a moment where it's like, it's really kicking off for him and it's really kicking off like, you know, um, within him or something like, like he's at a time where he's taking it really seriously, doing really well. Anyway, with Marcellus, I think we kind of caught him in a similar moment, um, a bit earlier in that process, but a similar thing where it was, um, he was at a point where he was going to take the opportunity of making a RA podcast really, really seriously. Um, which, you know, depending on where you're at in your career, where you're at as an artist, you'll respond to that kind of thing differently. So yeah, I think that kind of hit the nail on the head in terms of timing. And yeah, he just did a really good job. And we're probably obligated to mention that his mother painted a really incredible podcast image. Yeah, actually, the first thing he wanted to send in was like a gif of a... guy in a monkey mask wearing a fedora with a feather in it, like riding a bike. And, um, and he's, but he said like, listen, I know this is weird, but is there any way we could have this? And, um, it was just like totally not possible, but, um, it would have been like, if you have this gift just open while you listen to the mix, um, yeah, it works out amazingly. It was, it was really a tragedy that we, that we couldn Andrew, who are you feeling this year? I chose Samuel Carriage, and I think that was a podcast that was also really well-timed because when his first release came out, I think it was last year, it was very much techno, and it was an interesting form of techno. It was very dark, which would become a huge trend in 2013. But the podcast kind of... almost laid out the course for what his career would take this year where with each release he kind of took apart his technique a little more and made it more spacious and more atmospheric and more scary even kind of culminating with the album which is almost like sounds like the metal band Sun in some parts these really heavy heaving drone passages. And I thought that the podcast really, really laid out why he was special. Maybe before a lot of people realized he was special just because of the, of the way it mixed together straight up techno with darker ambient stuff and like really left field stuff. And in this really amazing way where he can go from, from a techno track, something almost beatless and not have it feel like it was a mess. And it just. I may be more excited about him as an artist because at first I wasn't sure if it was just like the buzz around him or if it was actually worth it. But that podcast really made me realize he was kind of someone to watch, to use a cliched phrase. And I think it was just, it's done so well too that it's kind of surprising to me that he's not recognized as a DJ because he's more of a live act. but I think he could be a really killer DJ as well. Yeah, actually I saw him warm up at a blueprint party in London, a thing that Hydra did. He was playing before, I think, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills and James Ruskin. He pretty surprisingly did something that wasn't a million miles away from that podcast. I think the beautiful thing about it was that the first hour or something I was in there, it was these very sludgy textures. There were beats, but it wasn't necessarily like a four to the floor pulse. But the result of that was that, you know, when you were there or something and you were getting into it, when the straight kick drums actually did hit, like the reward was like absolutely immense. And I think what that did was set me up for the night in a way that otherwise wouldn't because just I think my tolerance for just the straight. techno dripping tap kick drum at that point just would have been you know so low or something um i wanted to select uh black coffee as my podcast choice and it's not even because i think it's such a great mix um i think there are probably better black coffee mixes out there but um I think what the mix represented for me was a bit of like a combination of a passion project, which started with the filming of our Real Scenes Johannesburg film last year. And seeing, kind of being out there and seeing what an enormous star he is and kind of what he means to people in South Africa who are into house music, which is pretty much everybody. And it was just like a real honor to get that mix and to be able to put that out and present a style of music that I think is very, very much on the downside of a trend. Like, I don't know anybody who's listening to that style of music, which is very percussive. It's very melodic. It's very summery. It's very good time. and I think anybody that knows me well know that I have a bit of a soft spot for that strand of kind of late 90s house music but to present it in a way that okay it's all of those things and it could have just been a head candy night or something but to bring that to the table on a global stage with these kind of very African rhythms and featuring producers like Black Motion, who's someone that we featured in the film. And, you know, just having their, just kind of the unique African sensibility and, you know, presenting that style of production. percussion or those sort of rhythm tracks in a very genuine way. Because I think when I was listening to stars of house music that would incorporate those elements, like back in the day, it was always through a European lens or something. I think it was very revealing to me to go to South Africa and actually see this firsthand where these rhythms actually mean something to people, you know, on a very, very inherent level. It's not just kind of this like quick fix appropriation that kind of Andrew was talking about earlier. It's also really pleasing as well. You know, if we had a hand in this, great, but he is gaining a little bit of international recognition now. By all accounts, his set at DC10 went down. pretty well and people seem to be excited about the whole thing um he played at panorama bar recently on a friday and i'm not sure how that went down but um he seems to be um at least getting towards a place where his popularity in south africa is mirrored on kind of a global level and i just think he deserves it um you know he's uh he's kind of looked up to and is um politically engaged in a way that like no european house act would even dream of like he's involved in like charity work and areas of just like everyday life that we just wouldn't expect of someone in europe it's like you're a freaking house producer like you know what's this place for you know you don't have a place here but um you know it just speaks to the way that um these people are kind of seen in south africa and kind of how important it is so i think next year i'm just hoping that um yeah he continues on that upward trend Thank you. It's only the sound of the phone ringing It's only your sad voice singing It's only the darkness bringing memories of you
