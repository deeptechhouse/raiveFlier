Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Aaron Coulte and I'm the news editor at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is John Hassel. Anyone with an interest in ambient or experimental music will likely have heard of John Hassel. Since the 1970s, he's been putting out records that transport listeners to imaginary worlds. Hassel uses the phrase fourth world to describe his music, an East meets West fusion that's often marked by his singular trumpet playing and evocative track. When he visited London recently, we took the opportunity to discuss his upbringing in Memphis, his years studying under Stockhausen, his complex relationship with Brian Eno and a whole lot more. You can find our full archive of exchanges on resonantadvisor.net, follow us on Soundcloud at ra-exchange, and exchange with John Hassel up next. An expanded version of your 1990 album, City Works of Fiction, was re-released last year. That record roughly marks the halfway point of your career today. How do you feel that album sits in your catalog 25 years on? I don't know whether I can speak about catalog, except, I mean, if in fact, excitement, amazing musicians, one of whom, unfortunately, the guitarist, Greg Ehrgein, has passed. It's a big landmark for me and I think that although it could have been, I was speaking about this with Matthew Jones at Warp yesterday about the possibility that we could have done just another release but making the pack. which is kind of Warp's, one of Warp's trademarks is to be able to bundle things together and do something more than just another release but perhaps it actually got, it might have gotten more attention because there's so much, the three CDs cover such big territory, one of the territories being a live performance with that band and a performance in New York in which Brian, you know, was mixing. And the other being a sort of creative mixture of, what is the word, interpiling, I know there's another better word than that, but outtakes that we'd done this, everything that we did was being recorded on DAT and thank God, you know, I mean, taken care of. And as far as like up on the wall should be like, you know, take notes. You know, don't let things go by without having some sort of a footprint that you can trace backwards. And so I found so many nice things. I may be going beyond the premise of your question, but I found so many wonderful things in the studio. Greg Eragon, the guitarist I mentioned before, was incredible. He could have been Robin Williams in terms of his ability to do comedy. He was just an amazing musician. So to go back and hear those kinds, those ghosts, so to speak. in the studio was a terrific thing. And it's just, I don't have exactly a from-the-mountain perspective on things. It just happened, when was that, 20 years ago? You know, about 20 years. It sounds fresh to me and very fresh to me. It makes me ask, what am I doing now? In terms of those two bonus discs you mentioned, the live performance and the other one with some outtakes and remixes, how involved were you in that process, putting together the remixes that came through? Oh, very. There were, I think, something like 30 or 40 dats, and those are all, I think they're 90 minutes each. So a lot of headphone work and combing through and trying to find things that were not on the original and things that were not. These were just kind of like offhand things, the things that would happen between takes, which is often the most interesting thing. I mean, I always enjoy outtake. productions where, you know, what happens, or sometimes in movies, right, when they do the, when they, over the credits, in the credits, or beginning credits, there's some sort of, you know, live, funny stuff going on. Those are always more interesting in a way than the film. But anyway, so those were, I was. deeply involved in finding those things and trying to make some. take the best out of them. Last year you also were invited by Carl Craig and Moritz von Otzwald to work on some music with them in Detroit. What was that like? It was great to meet those guys. I mean, Carl had been in touch with me before, actually way back. I mean, he had a record I did in 83 called Akadar Bari Java, which was sort of... made of those knitted, those three elements like Akka, Pygmies, Darbari, the Indian Raga, Java, the Gamelan, and it's one of the sort of landmark records, I think, for... the world, the mixture of world elements in a way that's not simply a layer cake of elements, but it's something that actually merges things in a way that thought of it as being like the ethnic music of a planet. that doesn't exist or something like that. He'd heard that and he had called and I actually didn't know who he was at that time and wasn't in touch with the DJ, burgeoning DJ thing at that time. And so I... Just, you know, I thought it was interesting, but I didn't see much value in departing for wherever I was at the time. So it was really cool to get back to, I mean, to see him and see what he did and what part he played in the electronica world, DJ world. And Moritz was sort of new to me, although I know he has a deep history. And I remember, let's see, I wish I could think of the sort of hit that he had that was incredibly impressive to me. It was just the best. electronica I'd heard ever. So that was really cool to be together. Unfortunately, the real story is that I was suffering from I just had an operation, and I had, it sounds like a codger story, but I mean, I'm just, it was the first time after a lifetime of having no problems, never being in the hospital, et cetera, et cetera, this thing came up. So I was actually on the plane with tubes running into my pocket to collect off. off-running liquid. And that was so it kind of put a little spin on the experience. And then I, so I was taking antibiotics for that and they gave me the wrong antibiotics. So I actually had a reaction to that when, and made my lips swell. So I couldn't play, basically, I couldn't play trumpet. So. So it was just a matter of like being sort of getting our feet wet, John von Ziegen with it. the DJ who was part of the band that played a couple of nights ago here at the St. John's Sessions. He was with me at that time. Anyway, so we just laid down some basic things to be worked on later when we went back to L.A., and we did that. Unfortunately, wow, it looks like a whole, you know, this medical things are intruding upon this collaboration actually appearing because Moritz, who had previously had a stroke and been through. I don't think I'm being indiscreet, and I think that's well known, right? And so he had actually had another bit of a health reversal, and they were supposed, after we'd sent them our tracks, our overdubs on what they did, then we thought we were going to be doing a show together. at the last atonal, right? And that couldn't happen because of this situation. So we thought, okay, we'll set up, we'll save this for another time. But anyway, it's sitting there in the can, so to speak, and I'd welcome being able to get back to it. And you've also got a really long-awaited book, The North and South of You, coming out. Can you tell me a bit about the themes that you explore in that book? This comes from back in 1980 when I did the first record called Possible Musics that I did with Brian Eno, produced by Brian Eno. You know, it's already been said in the re-release what the real story is, that I put his name on the top because I wanted to sell more records and I was a struggling downtown artist in New York and on unemployment. So I thought it would be a good idea. It served a dual purpose. There were perhaps more records sold that way, but I would find his LP. I don't have to explain what an LP is to this group, I'm sure. I can find it there in his bin instead of in my bin, you know, in the record. Record pin. And so anyway, the Fourth World was the kind of logo that I invented at that time in order to, because I knew that journalists need it. a quickie, you know, a quickie bite and something that they can latch on to for print. So the fourth world meant first world, a combination of first world technology and third world tradition and somehow a way of combining those things. And that became a new thing. A lot of people latched on to it. You know, Peter Gabriel called and said, you know, and he... invented this festival, the WOMAD Festival and all that. So it became a kind of hot thing. And the New York Times was the best record of 1980, I think, one of the best records of 1980. And so just to underline what that Fourth World meant, and it was that combination of spiritual, technological. to put it another way. And so now it's kind of morphed, that idea's kind of morphed into North and South of You. It comes from a Cole Porter song, you know, East, West, North and the South of You. I forget the, it's called All of You, I think is the song. I thought it was clever to build something around that, I mean, to use that sort of pop thing as a title. But it refers to the similarity between the global situation of North and South and the South being thought of as underdeveloped. while a thing like the samba is, you know, so that has to be thrown into, like, the category of underdeveloped when it's much more developed than many things of the northern world, right? And how those things, the north and south, globally speaking, also mapped onto the body as a waistline. The waistline is the equator, let's say, and the north is command central where the brain and logic and language and all those things reside. And below and south of the equator is where... Babies are born and dances are made and that kind of thing. So it became a way of extending that fourth world idea into not merely music but to a global... a kind of analysis of where we are and using that as, again, a kind of logo to focus on a bunch of things. I mean, going back to the origins of the fourth world term, How did you go about devising that term and concept in a pre-internet, pre-globalization time? I started, who was it? Walter DeMaria when I was in New York. This was all in the late 70s. I was in New York. Brian came to one of my concerts at the Kitchen. In New York, I think it still exists. I did a concert called Fourth World Sketches. I mean, I'd done two records before that also. I'd done a Vernal Equinox, a smaller label, and then one called Earthquake Island, in which I'd gotten some money and did a recording at the Jim Hendrix studio. the electric lady and brought in some people from Weather Report and Miles Davis recording. So I thought I kind of went a little too far in that direction because where I came from was, you know, I had just come from studying with Stockhausen, you know, electronic music with Stockhausen in Germany. And so that was pre-New York. And then when I came to New York, I fell in because I had met Terry Riley, the sort of father of minimalism. And he introduced me to Lamont Young, who perhaps is the godfather of minimalism. I'm just giving you a little background on the New York of that time. It happens to be in my brain now because I just went back and kind of translated my – put down these notes I had in my agenda, you know, like a paper. Remember? Remember that, folks? Remember paper? And in which I put all sort of personal things or career things that were going on. So that was like, the background here is that I was coming from a grant-based, you know, the trip to Germany and all that was like from the German government. A grant-based sort of... headed to the university campus as a professor type trajectory, which I... you know, I didn't want to do. And so there I was in all this mixture going, and suddenly Brian comes to this concert, and then he was working on the Talking Heads, Remain in Light at that time, producing that. And he had just come to New York for an extended stay. So I wrote lots of notes down on that, you know, that I... of things that were going on and I developed this three by five mentality, you know, three by five index cards and every thought that I had that, or every thought that I ran into by other people or coming from me or would be anything, it had to fit on a three by five card. So I've got these little aphoristic, this file of these things. It just seemed to, and there were other, you know, there were other, I think the very first time I thought about or I heard that term, fourth world, I think it was actually, to be completely honest, was in the middle, was some, there's some photographer or ethnologist or someone who had had, who had done a book. in which somehow that combination had come to mind. So, of course, I stole it, you know, like all good artists. And so that's how it came to be. You mentioned that particular book. Were there other literary and cinematic touchstones that informed this interest in the exotic? Well, certainly. I would take some digging through the... rubble of my mind right now to like get to them. But I remember, well, for instance, just this little vignette may not exactly answer that question, but I remember seeing, there's a movie called Bye Bye Brazil, which I think, and I remember David Byrne and Brian and I going to that movie with our respective girlfriends at the time. and going for, you know, Cachaca afterwards and the Brazilian Club and all that kind of thing. They were all, you know, it was all about discovery, and I have to say it was partly through the lens of what I was doing in my work, right? And I had a lot of, I had a collection of records on the Acora label. label, Ethnic Records, that were all quite amazing. And I introduced them to that series also. So it was from that experience. Oh, yeah, also, how can I forget this? Mati Klarwine, the painter who did all the, who did that, like, Santana Abraxas cover. and the Miles Davis Live Evil cover and things like that. And to say cover is to not a touch at all like where he was. I mean, he studied with Miro. He's an amazing, amazing painter, and he just happened to be a gigantic music fan. His record collection was, in a sense, a touchstone for me. He had, like... things that I'd never heard before, never thought of before. And I often said that those paintings, if only I could just put into, what my whole output was about was just simply putting into sound. what those paintings were, which were like, you know, they were sexy, sometimes quasi-pornographic in a kind of beautiful way. And so they touched that combination of spiritual and world. kind of like world, it was a philosophy in a picture, you know, and in a sense that was my aspiration. And you mentioned in the 70s being an impoverished artist in downtown New York. Your records, you know, were often evoking far-flung corners of the world. I'm guessing that you didn't have an opportunity to travel to these places. Were you kind of reimagining them through the films and the books and the paintings you were consuming? Certainly. And I think that's often a more fruitful well to drink from in a way is because it's imagination. I have never been to Indonesia, but I'm... I, the music, you know, the gamelan, especially, of course, when you're in, and it should be mentioned, it's not now that I'm not going to be arrested for anything, it should be mentioned that drugs were around, you know, and, and that the work with Lamont Young was, was, you know, this like very And he brought what later became my teacher, the Pandit Pranath, where I started to play. I gave up everything that I knew on trumpet to try and start again playing in a new way so that I could make some of the curves that happen in Indian music. And I started singing with him to learn things. So I know I'm very... tangential here. So that was the drug tangent, okay? And we were on hashish milkshakes that Pranath, that actually was something that had come from India. You know, in India, the classical India, bong. meaning marijuana grows wild by the roadside. And so even on the table of some of these classical Indian miniatures, you'll see like little round confections on the table, which are called laddu, which are mixtures of like almond paste and marijuana. So that played a part in what we were doing. I don't think anybody could imagine we would be playing, like speaking of the concerts with Lamont, for four hours straight just trying to get a perfect fifth. Perfect, right? And because what happened at that time, I mean, what happened in that state was that... you would be hearing overtones that you never heard before, if you even knew what overtones were. You know, this is not something that comes out of an academic music background that you don't, you know. So that was... kind of introduction to a silvery world, I always call it, where things are happening above, in another world, above the fundamental of the talents. And that's not simply a drug, it's not a drug phenomenon, it's something that the loosening of senses. allowed to be heard. The reality of it is that it's there. And that was extraordinarily important for me. All those things together, right? I was in India. I mean, back to your original premise, that it might be better to dream about things than to actually experience them. But I did do some of that experiencing, too, and that was super important, although it may not have been in terms of the actual, like, how the things I went for. taste-wise were, I mean, I loved Miles Davis and I loved Gil Evans and I loved all the lushness of those harmonies and that were, you know, like post-Revell, let's say. And so that's, in that the answer to that question is all, it's the whole ball in a way. You can decode that. I want to sort of delve a bit further into those sort of formative experiences with, you know, Lamont Young and Terry Riley. First, I wanted to ask more generally about cultural appropriation because many people, myself included, have struggled to sort of wrap my head around the subtleties and complexities of what's okay and what's not okay. And it's something that you've always seemed to sort of handle in a very respectful way. How have you approached that subject in the past? Well, to start with, I had a bass in which, like, after I got the raga experience, which was, for me, mild. I didn't go into, like, being, you know, a virtuoso on the trumpet, you know. I was too old to start doing that. I should have been born and I should have been doing it since I was 12 years old if I were going to become the elephant that dances. I felt that I had a kind of a base, a strong base. It wasn't just like picking this and picking that without having a deeper understanding of another culture, let's say. So the idea of appropriation in the sense of, I think that depends upon, and I'm jumping ahead now thinking of the kinds of electronic means that there are to like facilitate cultural appropriation. I mean, it would be, in a sense, it's like completely impossible to avoid. I mean, it was like the world, the... Coming world, I mean, it was to say fourth world, it was also in a way it was to say this is where it's going and not to like hit hard on the prophetic part of it or anything like that, but just like. For anyone who attempts to know what's going on in the world and in your own world and the rest of the world, it's inevitable. And that connection with the rest of the world was inevitable also. And so you could say that there was a... understanding of that. I mean, as in, once again, I yield to the, you know, to Mati Klarwein and his, you know, his music, his record collection and the paintings and all that. They showed that. I remember seeing a cover, one of the paintings that was... And I have three records of the records, early records have some of this painting on it. But that was, I just thought, this is it. That's what I want. That's what I want to do. I want to make that. I want to make something that's, again, sexy and beautiful and deep. So cultural. Collision is inevitable. It's a question of what kind of credentials you have to do it. Do you need credentials? You've got all the world at your fingertips with your laptop and all the... possible, not all, but many ways of incorporating those things into music. I mean, everything is so easy in a way that there's a real danger of, well, I'm sort of lapsing into warning, you know. But there is no, the cat's out of the bag, right? I mean, there's no sense in trying to like... isolate this phenomenon and so I embrace it and carry it further at the same time I go backwards I did a record called Fasanoma with Ry Cooter producing it was all acoustic and it was in Santa Barbara in a church in the studio and this church was the studio and it was like religiously analog. It was like two inch tape and Kavi Alexander, the engineer, the Indian engineer, wouldn't even make a digital copy for fear that bits would like flow back. flow back through the wires somehow and corrupt the analog stuff. So that, you know, I've touched both sides and touched base with that, let's say. At the same time, there are lots of new things around now that cost maybe 10 pounds, let's say, that do things that... They do things that Stockhausen would require two floors of the West German radio to accomplish. There's such kind of open field of things to do that it almost creates stasis, you know. You get into it and you do something and it's a hit and you get out fast or let's say you're pushed out fast because there's the next person there ready to do the same thing because they have the same technological savvy and the same technological means to make that happen. And I imagine that happens in the electronica world rather quickly. You know, fashion, who has the hottest name? And all that kind of thing. So from my point of view, I think of what I do as still working as a classical artist in a way. And it's just that I'm not one who... closes his eyes and ears to all of the possibilities and I try to put it in some form which is not something that anyone else can do, you know. And taking things back, you grew up in Memphis. What are your recollections of childhood? Well, it's... It's deep there, for sure. There's a question I always think that I'm very blessed to have been born in Memphis rather than in, you know, Idaho or someplace or even Chicago because there was a crossing. You talk about crossing of cultures and where does that come from? I was in, you know, I was, the era of segregation was still present, so I, you know, I'm... I was introduced to it from that, you know, sort of looking across the divide, racial divide point of view. Parked on my street might have been Johnny Cash's beat-up stretch limo. And at the same time, I was around like there was an African-American guy. Henry Barnes, who was a kind of helper for my family and very trusted and would take my older brother and sister to school on a bike and things like that. And I remember he was taking me out to, like, you know the word joint, you know, like I got in Mississippi. Mississippi-type place that's made of RC Cola signs and, you know, nailed together on a wooden frame, you know, and that kind of thing. Well, he took me out to this proto-juke joint in the outskirts of Memphis someplace, and it's one of the big sound experiences I ever had, although I cannot, like, all I can do is... Speaking of, like, is it better to imagine or better to be, I cannot imagine what that exactly, I can't quite recreate it in my mind, other than to say that it's probably, like, the very earliest electronic instrument thing going on, like, maybe the very first or the earliest amplifiers and guitars and things like that. Just, it was so... astounding to me. And I, you know, as I speak about it, I'm still like one of those cartoons where your head is going, right? I'm still shaking. I'm still blown away by it. And it would be, you know, I could spend a lifetime just, you know, trying to mind what that, you know, imagine what that was. And back to the crossing of cultures thing, I thought to myself later after I left, you really never know your place if you grow up in even a small town here. You don't really know what it is until you leave and you look back on it again. And so from those sort of early formative years in Memphis, you went to study at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. Is that where you sort of worked on your sort of trumpet playing? Yeah. Well, actually, my dad had a cornet. around the house, you know, the smaller version of the trumpet. And he had a silver cornet around the house that he had played in the Georgia Tech band when he had gone to school there. So I started playing in high school. And yeah, certainly then I started to study orchestral trumpet and that kind of thing, which you do at a conservatory. And you were still at Eastman when you appeared on Terry Riley's In C. No, actually not. You weren't? No. You had left? Yeah, that was much later. Here's the quickie. progression was from school marriage, married a pianist, army. I went to the army band for three years to escape being drafted. Living in Washington, D.C., getting the grant to go to Germany to study with Stockhausen. Back from Germany to a grant, a Rockefeller grant at the State University of New York in Boehm. And then that was in a group of, the premise there was musicians who were both composers and performers. So I fit that category. And that's when, and Terry Riley came up as one of the fellows of this thing. Also, David Behrman, who's a composer, musician, he was a producer for this Music of Our Time, I think it was called, series for Columbia. And he was there. So then that's how the NC happened. My wife is the pulse, the bong, bong, bong, bong, bong, bong pulse in that recording. So that's where I met Terry and then led from Terry to New York, Lamont. Tell me a bit about NC and your role in that, it being such a landmark minimalist recording. My role was simply, I mean, coming into contact with Terry was... I came back from Europe kind of still feeling in there, even though I thought I was doing interesting things there and not simply like being a little Karl-Heinz Stockhausen. Terry mentioned, he said something, we were at a party or something and said something about being neurotic. like that European music was neurotic. I'm thinking about the 12-tone, the Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, all that, and up to Stockhausen. And it really rang a bell, one of the bell ringers for me. I thought, hmm. And that is really the soil of that American music movement, which then, you know, Terry was, Steve Wright came out of Terry, not well known, that's the fact, and also... one could say that Terry came out of Lamont. And so that whole sort of American minimalist thing, which kind of... took over for a while and perhaps still reigns in the at least in some quotation mark classical vein is um that was my my contact with it was that and and it was with that that i did and also this was the moment of um Actually, when I was in Washington, I was teaching for one year at American University, and this person came through who had the name Moog. He came through and was espousing this new instrument. an oscillator actually that in which one volt equaled one octave you know like sort of making the first sort of connection between music and technology you know electronics I still have like a letter from the director of the university saying a gentleman by the name of Mr. Bob Moog had come Robert Moog has come by and would like to demonstrate so and so and so and so, right? So it was just, you know, I go back. That was when I was still in Washington before I went to the, before I'd gone to Germany, actually. So then come back and then, you know, to come back from that and then to meet Terry and then go New York and meet Lamont and then at the same time be like enchanted with trance with what Miles Davis was doing at that time. And for instance, On the Corner, that record was like a total touchstone, another big touchstone for me. So I was playing with a wah-wah pedal and doing that kind of thing. So while I was still there at the State University of New York at Buffalo and this foundation in this, they call it a creative associate role. Yeah, I guess it was, in the basement, with Moog equipment. And I know if you actually were writing this down, you might find there's a hole here someplace. But the point is that I had these eight oscillators, and that I went in and I made a piece called Solid State that was a kind of big... The quick idea is that if you fill a room with like these two sets of oscillators of eight. eight oscillators were tuned in perfect fifths, right? So you got, and so it's like a very harmonic, it's not a grating sound at all, I mean, it's a very harmonic sound, but I had these filters, and that was part of the Moog advance was that you, you know, you didn't have to... You don't have to sit there and turn a dial. The filters could be driven by voltage. So in other words, you could have a sequence of filters. filtering which I did on this on these this sort of big block of sound so I set all the dials at zero for the first thing so it's all just this big static room filled with with lots of overtones and lots of sound and so then you start this and the sequencer is running right and it's all but it's all running so that all the positions are at the same level So then you start to change one, and then it makes a little bump in the spectrum, right, a little hole. Then you change another, and then you start looking at it as if it's a graphic equalizer, and then you make different kinds of different shapes, different kinds of holes in this. in this massive thing. So I started actually presenting that not as music, but as a sound sculpture. And I thought it was a good way to get beyond the predisposition to like, how would you know, judge that, you know, for an art or a music crowd to judge that. So during that period, I did things at various museums, and that was before I went to New York. Yeah, it was sort of while I was still in communication with New York, and Terry, whose loft I eventually took over in New York, when I moved there, he said, I brought in, I was thinking. So actually, the first thing I did was this, it doesn't make much sense unless you know the piece, but his comment was, well, it sounds like Philip Glass, or it sounds like Steve Reich, you know. And that was because I had things going like, you know, that kind of motoric feeling. And I think it was then I went back and just changed it so that it was all these subtle changes in the... in the spectrum instead of more obvious kinds of things. So that really was the key to it, of making this piece. And actually, you know, Matthew... Jones at Warp wants to release this piece called Solid State as a kind of proto. It actually is still a very immersive experience and would be, you know, the bigger space the better. I've kind of resisted in a way of being released on a record because I think, I'm not sure I wasn't sure if it's not like really in a big space and where you can kind of like lie on the floor and feel things and all that. I wasn't sure how effective it would be, but Matthew was enthusiastic about it and I yield to doing that sometime soon. Before your experiences with Terry Riley and Lamont Young, as you've mentioned, you studied under Stockhausen in Cologne. What was Karl Hahn's Stockhausen like as a person? Well, he was German, but he was young German and, you know, a product of the war in a way still. But I think it was the first real kind of musical. artist that I had contact with. Someone whose life was that. You don't get that in America. You don't run it because everybody is having to do five or six things in order to stay alive. They're a professor but they're not completely invested in it. It's like, I'm an artist. This is what I do. That's the joy of the underwriting experience that happens in Europe, which can be Not disastrous, but who cares if you've got things that come out of it that are good. And by disastrous, I mean that you can support things that don't need supporting, you know, and let them grow where they, capitalist system, they would die of their own, you know, lack of interest, let's say. But anyway, so that, my wife is there, you know, as I said, she's a... pianist, she started playing, you know, Stockhausen and doing recitals and things like that. It changed her life a bit, too. So, yeah, I thought he was an amazing guy. And part of that experience, there were a lot of other European musicians were brought through. It was like a kind of cologne. course for new music. So instrumentalists, the famous instrumentalists, avant-garde instrumentalists of the day and composers of the day would sort of come around, like Luciano Berio. He brought in, like, his wife, Kathy Berberian, was a great singer, and he brought in things like, you know, he'd sort of collage things like an Italian... kind of radio, almost soap opera or something. He'd put that in the middle of something. So what I did was, there's a beautiful piece in Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra called Sommermorgen am See, Summer Morning by the Sea. And it's the first one in which... they call klangfarben melody, meaning melody of timbre, melody of color, as opposed to melody of pitch. And that, it's sort of like, so the orchestration was so that it was like, it was almost like one chord again, referring, you know, like the solid state. It was almost one chord. which moved seamlessly from, like, here's the violin, and then suddenly it's no longer the violin on that note, but the flute playing softly, or this or that, you know? and it kind of pulsed in a way. So that, to me, those are the real landmarks. And I often do that. I often just don't. I'm not biting the whole cookie. I'll find something that's like a piece, and I'll listen to it over and over and over, and that'll be my thing. So in fact, there's a relationship. So anyway, the piece that I did for, the final piece that I did for Stockhausen was that I sampled. quote-unquote meaning in Riyadh and I took bits of that score, of the Schoenberg score, and I had Stockhausen's engineer, this Dutch guy, Jaap Spick, he made these little, I had this idea of like doing, of having everybody playing softly on stage with contact microphones. And they were instructions where they play as softly as possible so they couldn't actually be heard unless the output of their contact microphone was brought forth. So he made these little mixers with like little, like maybe five or ten, there were three of them, five each, so you had this little mixer in which we were touching this little button that brings forth whatever that is being... done on that particular microphone. So it was like a chance to sort of pull forward what you could. The shape that was being made was by chance. I actually used John Cage's kind of chance methods of what I did. In other words, it was a graphic score. for the electronics, but the real notes being played were derived from this Stockhausen piece. These are interviews sometimes good for me because I just forget about stuff like this, and I forget about the connections that they have to what I did. I wanted to ask you about your history with Brian Eno. I guess as a starting point, I wanted to sort of dive into your collaboration on Fourth World Volume 1, Possible Musics. Did you have a sense at the time when you were recording that that you were doing something groundbreaking? Well, what was groundbreaking about it was the association with the pop producer and the pop world, the things that were being done. had already been done in the previous records. And Brian certainly had good ideas in terms of his studio savvy. And, you know, the way he, that was how he got his street cred was for asking those sort of art school questions about what to do in the studio. Like, what happens if I do this? You know, what happens if I... turn this knob instead of turning that knob, breaking through the orthodoxy of studio, right, and with capital letters. So he had some, he certainly had some good ideas, and I was... But as far as, I mean, I resist, and I am resisting actively now the sort of wedding of our names on an equal level with that, because as I said earlier, I had already brought the musical part of the thing. I'd already had two records that were there. And so, as I said, I put the, I remember. at launch telling Brian, well look, I think it's fine if you just put your name after mine at the top instead of being just produced by, which actually would have been more accurate. So I've spent, let's see, how many? 30 years trying to make that distinction between what was there and... and what Brian added to it. And because it's even now, I have to say, like there's a, you know, in the reviews of the recently re-released Hustle of Musics. They printed a long interview, almost verbatim, in which I talk about pretty much what I just said, by trying to give Brian his due and at the same time give myself my due. And it's about the world of music criticism and about how there's this stratification of classical and pop. I mean, anything that's right now, there was a pitchfork interview of that, I mean, a review of that record in which, and another Aaron, Aaron Leitko, I think his name is, do you happen to know that name, Aaron? Yes. And he had said that, he had pointed out that... There was another kind of thing that I was doing that didn't relate at all to the even eighth notes guys, you know, the Philip Glass and Steve Reich sort of thing. But that is what, you know, there was this schism between classical and pop reviewers. But the sort of marker, the indicator for classical was in a sense this constancy, sort of as if you took Mozart and extracted the MIDI information from... from a Mozart piece and just had it driving a pentatonic scale, you know, pentatonic atmosphere, that it just still had to have that kind of motoric thing going. for it to be called classical. It's an easier sell to the New York Times audience who would go to a concert and what they would be expecting versus the kind of urban, sexy, electronics mixture that would be with a Miles Davis concert. Let's say that that would be... So I actually wrote about, when I wrote several, every time I did a record, I wrote these little essays that I thought would try and just say what I thought about those distinctions. So I called Miles Davis would be more classical in a larger frame of, that is to say, if you want to say that the world is made up of. both north and south, below the waist and above the waist, then you would call what Miles Davis does much more classical in a fourth world, larger dimension sense than you'd... call the Philip Glass, Steve Reich thing, you'd call that a very, that would be very white and very occidental, right? Whereas Miles was translating, we had the kinds of influences that were there from blues and from Africa originally and from the electronics. That guitar player just had this bunch of effects on a table. Every guitarist I think in there followed the story and sort of digested that. tried to, now it can all be had in a box, you know, one box. But the essay was about like what is really, what's classical and what's not, right? So I thought Miles qualified for a fourth world type classical as opposed to this other thing. And we've sort of touched on it already, but your first album, Vernal Equinox, obviously resonated with a lot of people, including Brian, and it obviously fed into his My Life in the Bush of Ghosts album with David Byrne. You were slated to collaborate on the album, but it didn't work out. Is that right? Right. They had asked me. David had come back from a concert with the Heads. talking heads. We hung out. We were very social together, right? We had girlfriends and going to movies and I introduced them to Walter DeMaria, the Earth artist, and other, and Lamont Young. Yeah, and I took them by to meet Lamont and All that. So we were quite buds. So yes, so then he came back one day from a concert in New Jersey and he said something. And he said like... Actually, Brian related to me that David had said to him that he wanted to do something else, that he thought the audience he was playing to, that the heads were playing to, was not something interesting to him anymore. They proposed to me that we do this record together, which had something to, which was going to be... would go out to California and rent a house and get some equipment in and just try to create something which was... Actually, at that moment, this record by The Residents called Eskimo was outlined a kind of a fake... The premise was to fake a tribal, fake another culture, right? And so that was the original, one of the original ideas thrown out about it. And so after we'd finished, you know, we were working on possible, working on what became possible musics in the studio. David would drop by and offer to do things, and if we wanted him to do anything on the record. And if I had said yes, it probably would have been my life on the push of ghosts beginning. But I didn't. I was headed someplace else. And so the... And so it kind of just withered on the line because they went out to L.A. Talking about beginning in New York, right? They went out to L.A. and started work on the record, but no more than 10 days after finishing Possible Music. I think if you took the, objectively speaking, if you took both of their previous records, revealed the connection that we had and what I and my, from that they knew and all that, that you'd see a very distinct kind of borrowing. I wanted to use a... polite words and are sometimes I've been thinking of the world a style template where you have a template that you can that you can fill with certain things right and of course their template went towards other things you know they're more pop oriented and had more had a bigger budget and all that kind of thing. And I was the kind of, I basically just felt like, after I'd heard one thing that they had done with Oum Skalsum and a kind of, to me, silly sort of African quote-unquote beat from talking heads, a la talking heads. I said, this is not what I'm interested in. I'm not into doing like the layer cake thing where you can separate this and separate that. And that I was about trying to create a fourth world. music which was integrated and which was in which the granules were mixed up in a blender and you know hopefully hopefully came out with something which was not so easily definable as this comes from here and this comes from there And I think they took that because I was indigent at the time on unemployment and not much money coming out of the possible music pot. They kind of, I think their business situation, the partners in business, Sire Records for the Talking Heads. And EG Records for Brian, they had, you know, all the business people probably said, okay, well, let's just let this ride. You know, he already said no to you, so why make any, why do you want to create problems? Let's just go with this. And later, only after, actually. when I say later, maybe 30 years later. I could just recently have gone through the, I've gone through the diary that I kept, the agenda that I kept in which I wrote down things, and I started putting these pieces together, and I thought, wow, what a fool I was, and how I was disrespected by not having a return. from them that would have been given to an artist like Ravi Shankar or a, you know, or a Ry Cooter or someone who would have a phalanx of lawyers and, you know, a team behind them, they would have said something like, Well, I'm sorry when I said no, I said this is not where I was going. The polite and the certainly expected reply that would have been given by anyone in that time and with those conditions would have said. oh, why don't you come out, we'll fly you out and we'll spend a couple of days in the studio and see if we can work something out. But they didn't say that. And those days, it was pre-email, okay? It was like letters and packages with cassettes in them. And I, in a sense, had already had, I felt the whole situation had become sort of toxic to me because... they were taking something that was my development and putting it with something else. But I had been so kind of innocent, really, even though I was older. Like, David was 28, Brian was 34, I was 43 at that time. And it was because of being part of the... academic, you know, as I said, a kind of grant-based life instead of a professional pop situation, you know. It put me in a different mindset and I just... We continued to hang out and have dinners, and just occasionally I would bring up something like, you know, I'd bring up something with Brian and say, you know, this very much seems to be like kind of co-opting of my work. But it wouldn't be somehow, you know, it would just... go on and I, as I said, I was, well, in a way these other things were being dangled in front of me and the continued work like we did another, we did two more records together with Brian producing and so that's the very long answer to my life in the Bush of Ghost connection. In terms of Vernal Equinox, it's quite a hard record to buy in physical format now. Would you like to see it reissued or presented to a new generation? Well, sure. There are a couple of things on it. that I think are really good. A lot of it is, you know, I wouldn't be, I don't care about it staying around, you know, just as a kind of historical document in a way of like what was going on at that time, if, you know, that would be the reason for it. The other one, the... Earthquake Island would probably be more, there's certainly more going on there, even though I'm slightly embarrassed by my attempt to become Weather Report and to not be myself. In terms of your general approach to albums, it seems like you've always approached it as like a very full package. There's the music, there's often your detailed liner notes or essays and also the artwork, which is what I wanted to ask you about specifically. The album covers have always been really evocative or alluring. How much of a role have you had it traditionally in? sort of overseeing the design process? Well, I've always been on top of it. There's no one that's forced me to do something. And the three records that I did, let's see, Not possible musics, but the next one, Dream Theory in Malaya, and then Akadabra Java, and then later on, Power Spot. Yeah, Power Spot, that's one that... Uh-huh, there's a story there that I haven't thought about. Howard Spott, that was the last connection with Brian as a producer, and that was with Daniel Lanois also, who was also a... It was his studio in Canada and Toronto where we did these things, like those two follow-up records to the three that are on EG, the possible musics in Dream Theory, Malaya, and Aqara Barjaba. So those covers, the last two I mentioned are Mati Klarwan paintings that he offered, you know, allowed me. allowed me to use. We became really close friends. But yeah, it's been, I can't think of one in which I didn't have any role in, except maybe the Warner Brothers. Yeah, well, I could have, the dressing for pleasure. You know, I always had, you know, I was under. I was under, I mean, that was like under another spell of like, oh, big label. That was right after the record we started talking about, City Works of Fiction, which was Brian's imprint label, distributed by Warner Brothers, All Saints. And that's the catalog that Matthew Jones, that was responsible for re-releasing on Warp. So that one had... We're back on... Are we still on covers? Or maybe we've done enough on covers. Well, I just wanted to just briefly touch on the Akka Dabari Java slave from Mutti. And that feels to really nicely, like visually, sum up what we were talking about earlier in terms of like an imagined far-off land. Or, you know, it just really seems quite... evocative in that respect yeah yeah exactly well one one yeah one thing i just wanted to mention the um the the event surrounding the the one the thing that was looking out the window and that i had not actually thought about and that is the that that last connection with brian was on power spot which a lot of people really like that record and um It was done. Here we were. Brian, what were you doing? Well, as I said, we maintained friendship, you know, a strong friendship. I'm godfather to Brian's daughter. So, I mean, it's like, it's a complicated relationship. So, I remember we were walking through the park and I'd come to Amsterdam for something. And Brian said, all right, the talk was about what is a producer? Because, you know, when you're a composer and you're of the university variety, what is a producer? I mean, you're a composer, you're a composer, you're responsible for if this French horn... thing is supposed to be there, it's supposed to be there, right? It's not to be, there's no second layer of like, you know, let's kill that, let's bring this forth and all that, as in, you know, production. which exists, of course, in classical production also. But anyway, the idea for Power Spot was that we were going to do this last record at Grand Avenue Studio, the Lenoir Brothers Studio. And we were going to, I said, okay, I'm going to let the producers take over. I'm going to let the, let the, let's, let's let this producer idea come to the, more to the fore. And, and so that was sort of the premise of that, of that record, which as I said, has some really nice things on it. Thank you. you
