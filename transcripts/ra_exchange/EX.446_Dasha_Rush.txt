*Dramatic music* *music* Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week on the Exchange, we have Dasha Rush. For over a decade, the Russian artist has been at the forefront of techno, but there is and always has been much more to her work than you might hear on the dance floor. In recent years, she's been busy with interdisciplinary projects that present a much grander vision than can be contained on a techno record. even while finding time to produce and perform in club contexts too. So when she came by RA's Berlin office last week, I was curious to find out more about the sound design, digital media, and choreography behind these larger-scale works, as well as the realities facing musicians straddling the line between art and the dance floor. As always, you can find our... full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Dasher Rush is up next. If we were talking about you 10 years ago and you had to explain what you do with in three words or something you'd say maybe experimental techno artist obviously that's not a totally accurate description but i guess what's different these days is that you put a lot of time and energy into like installation slash interdisciplinary work and I guess you did one of these very recently last week in fact at CTM can you just like set the scene of what that piece was for us well the one we did at CTM is called Territoire Ephémère Le Territoire Ephémère was a French which is like in English is Ephemeral Territories Well, it's like a multidisciplinary piece that involves puto dancing, modern dancing, well, audiovisual aspect, actually, the projection on a moving object, which is the body, which is the dancer, actually, and then the screen parts, the visual parts, and obviously the music. So all these elements are kind of connected. It has a story. And we talk about memory, inconsistency of memory, you know, fragile parts, like anything that ephemeral and but that still, you know, construct your identity somehow or like you know personality or so on it was based on the memories based on an information which you know like I express as a friction where the dancer would actually fight with the flow fight or dance with the flow of information but like you know in a on the screen captured real time and So the flow of information expressed in the particles and it's like sort of abstract philosophical piece, I would say, about memory, friction, information. And then that nothing, well, the last part is called Nothing is Addressed, which is more theatrical and has involved dance performance. And it's more like improvisational part. So every time we perform, it's a little bit different. It has like the space to improvise. I mean, based on the inner scenario, of course. But yeah, so yeah, it's, you know, it's just a mix of disciplines that, you know, make one piece together. So we always knew that you were a musician, of course, but how did you acquire the skills to be able to work with something like choreography or you're talking about visual mapping and things like that? Are those things something that you think about in your head while conceiving the piece or is it about collaboration and working with people who are experts in those fields? Well, no, actually every piece is conceived and written. I encountered when I was living in Paris, well, you mentioned that 10 years ago you could actually put me in a case of electronic, but not really, because I was still doing things and collaborations with small theatres or small dancers. painters and it was kind of very vivid scene in Paris which we would just meet up and I mean it was more like an amateur level let's say I mean I still amateur but you know in amateur level like it would happen in squats and free performances and sometimes in museums too like Palais Tokyo but yeah so it's not that I came to it I was always doing that but it's just at some point I let's say like the techno aspect of the club the dance music took it over like the you know the larger amount of time in my occupation but then I just yeah I just felt like I want to go back to that or something so In terms of working, it's always, you know, the piece is conceived, you know, by just sitting there writing, thinking and, you know, okay, inspired by, you know, whatever, some other external information. I would see like a piece of Dutch choreographer, I can't remember. She's active since the 70s. I can't remember her name. She's got a very, very long, complicated name. But I would see the piece based on Steve Reich music. And I was like, oh, wow, I want to do something similar. It's also possible. But in terms of technical aspect, so I would write the piece, for example, I would make a scenario what I would like to be. And then, you know, I work with Stanislav Glazev, who is a visual artist. So I would just, you know, we would just gather together and I would say, okay, how do I do this? So how do I want? So I got help, obviously, from, you know, like a visual aspect, technically. So Stanislav would, based on the scenario, would try to, let's say, produce the visual aspect of the piece, you know, but it's, yeah, something like that. And in terms of choreography, I mean, it's just... I think it's an intuitive process. I can't really, like, you know, I was dancing when I was small, but it has nothing to do with, you know, it's just something that I'd like to explore. So I just go for it. basically it's it's not really a thoughtful process it's just yeah so this so it involve a lot of communication with it with the dancer or something like this yeah i just wonder like how do you communicate how do you communicate like what you want to someone like that well i explain i have a scenario so i i have a written piece like the written scenario so that that would be that part And then I would just, you know, and then of course the dancer could bring the ideas so we could exchange something. But then there is a particular, you know, like I would say, I don't do the choreography of the dancer, but I do the stenography, how it should look like or how, you know, where will he place, then what's the movement and what is it about? And then he would work on it, on a subject. Let's say, okay, the first part of the performance, if we're talking about ephemeral territories, it's about the memory. So the first part is... basically, how can I say, incorporate child where you just have a pure image of yourself. And then you would be like, you know, he would just go for, you know, like, let's say, expressing the child in the movement position. And then the memory would evolve. So you have imprints, well, the idea, imprints on the body, which we project. It's the patterns that you accumulate the information from outside. And then you would evolve. So you would evolve. So, you know, let's say physically you would stand up or you would, you know, like that's the whole process of discussion. So it's, yeah, it's, let's say I visualize the music. I visualize somehow how it should look like. But then, you know, it's really hard to explain actually. process because it involves talking, discussions involve, but to the particular subject, like I would say, how would you express a friction with your movement? And then he goes for it and then we change something and, you know, so yeah, something like that. Were you happy with how it turned out? The CTM performance went really, really well. the one before was okay and the one before was great so we have like you know each time is yeah but I'm never to be honest I'm never happy I think the perfectionism maybe that is always something that I want to change or something that I want to make it better it's just the you know the the way I work But yeah, it went really well. Like this one, I would say it went well. Yeah, the CTM one. You mentioned before that you were doing this sort of work in Paris before, you know, people knew of you as the techno artist. however accurate or inaccurate that is. Yeah. That sounded like quite an interesting situation, dancers working with musicians in kind of like an informal but interesting way. Can you just like expand on that context a little bit? Because, I mean, I didn't know that. It almost made it sound like... that club music pulled you away from something? Yeah, I mean, like, you know, the perception, what do you do, actually, you know, something that is more exposed of you, I don't know, maybe because of the records and something maybe because it's just happened that way that that part was more exposed. So it's just, you know, how the information go and perception. But I mean, I'm sure there is a lot of artists doing other things. Then, you know, just, but like in my time in Paris, it just had, it was just a community of people, you know, from different art, different arts, you know, somebody would study painting, somebody would dance, somebody would do theater. Like I even did the tour with a jog, what is called jog, juggling, juggling. Yeah, it was a circus. So it was like contemporary circus, you know, we would do like with a sculpt, sculptor, juggler and my music. So we do like a trio, trio that we would just do performances in France. I mean, it's kind of local but how would it work I mean it's just I think it was like very romantic spontaneous time where we just we didn't plan anything it was just happening you know we would just gather together and come up with some idea and then we would just do it and then yeah it was very I say it was non-professional, non-organized times, but constantly. And there was a lot of, you know, people who, you know, there were a lot of platforms, there were a lot of squads at the time. So the space, I mean, I'm not talking about squads, like there was more like... I don't know, how could I call it? Artist squads? It was like ateliers, but they were all occupied illegally. So it's like art squads or whatever you can call it. So each artist would have their space. Atelier would do something. You would come to the squad, we'd have coffee or dinner or something. And then we would just discuss whatever ideas. And then something would come up. It was very spontaneous. We didn't really plan. But then there was also collaboration, which were, you know, like some of my friends would do a theatre performance, contemporary theatre, and then we'd come to Paris, they're like, yeah, we're looking for someone to do music, do you want to do music? We're like, yeah, sure. You know, and we would just do the show. It was just, yeah, it was very... I don't know, it was no press, nothing. It was just there and people would come and it was like, you know, word by word or flyers or, you know, it was just different time. I don't know, different way of organizing things. And it was way more spontaneous, I think. Yeah. And it's just because of that rich community, we would just interact between each other. And I think that was happening. And yeah. But then I kind of get focused on techno for some reason, maybe because I moved to Berlin. I don't know. I'm sure this stuff has been in the back of your mind that whole time. But was there a certain point that you could identify where you thought, I need to really start doing this sort of thing again? I just need it for myself. I felt maybe... I don't know if it's a nice thing to say or not, but I felt I don't have enough air in club music. I mean, a space to express, a space to improvise, to collaborate, to, I don't know, to just explore some new territories or not even new, just something that I like. And, you know, like if you do something, it doesn't mean that you have to stop there. And it kind of, I just needed some air. I don't know if it's clear as an expression, some air to breathe. And so, yeah, I kind of just felt like, yeah, I need more than just, you know, like. club music. I still love it. I still love techno. I still love playing in the clubs, but I need some sort of balance. And I mean, it's always been there. It's just like the periods would be different. Sometimes I would focus on this, sometimes on that, and just... But yeah, for my own, it's an internal process. It's not that I decided to become. It's just there. And I just needed it for my personal, I don't know, development or something, for my personal being. And when did you start working with Stanislav then? We started working in 2013. Actually, I was preparing this project called Antarctic Talks. for the 8th one. It was 2014, sorry. So 2014, I was preparing this project. I had this idea. It was for a tunnel and idea for the craft trick. I actually wanted to freeze the columns in the architectural space. So the idea was actually, I was looking for the visual artists because obviously in terms of technical visuals. I wouldn't have time to realize myself, plus the music, and I think I don't have enough, let's say, technical knowledge in the visual specter, so I would prefer someone else do it even. So I was looking for an artist I could collaborate and then yes, you know, through the research Stanislav came into the radar. And so we met and the idea was basically a mapping on the architectural space and the columns. So I wanted to freeze the columns and then the eyes, you know, basically freeze the craft record. But unfortunately, the festival firstly was like, yeah, great, we do it. But unfortunately, the festival couldn't find enough funding for, you know, because the projectors, like they need, you need at least six projectors, very powerful projectors. So they couldn't find the funding for six. So we had to reduce to the screen version. And which was fine, but I mean, it was not exactly the idea, but somehow, yeah, it just went on and on. And then now we are at the, you know, full dome, 360 degrees Antarctic tuck version. So it's still, yeah, still alive, the project, but it was actually meant to be just one time show for Kraftwerk specifically. But somehow, yeah, yeah. And that's how I met Stanislav. This experience sounds like something which must happen all the time with this sort of thing where you have ideas and then the practical. logistics which go into having to execute them yeah uh you almost can't discover it until it's happening or you know someone says oh we don't have budget for this or we don't have budget for that because specifically for antarctic tact you've like spent the the next few years after that trying to get it closer to what you had yeah um in mind originally can you talk about the different stages that it's gone through and... All right. So the Antarctic Tech went through the different stages, obviously. You know, like, as I told, it was one time specific project, then due to technical, it didn't work out. So we reduced the screen version, but somehow it resonates. So we've been invited to further festivals like MUTEC, also for the screen version, but... you know like it was not satisfying it was just not satisfying that's not exactly what I wanted to do and then I mean slowly we did like few shows you know in I don't know in Peru and like all over the place for some reason it's just reason that people wanted to see the screen version I was like why do they want to see the screen version it's just it has to go further But somehow, at some point, we were just, I mean, it's hard to, like, put it in short. We would discuss and try things. And, you know, like, I was constantly talking, no, I still want to do, you know, progress. Like, first, we did just a panoramic version in an Alexandrinsky Theatre, which is, like, one of the most important theatres in St. Petersburg. And then, yeah, it was like slowly progressing. And then, you know, the idea would be actually the next step, we would do a VR version, like where you people just actually walk on those things. And so, I mean, technically... it didn't change much it's just the surface changed the projection changed so we really can explore you know like the whole dome the 360 so you could be really enveloped you can be under the eyes or above the eyes but I mean also the performance evolved we build like in short we build an Antarctic continent from the molecule of water like And then, you know, it develops becoming ice, structure of ice, freeze, so on, so on, you know, expand and become a really ice continent. And then, you know, you travel through a little bit and go to it. But also, yeah, in terms of scenario, it's still the same. But technically, we just adapt to surfaces and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger. So from the small screen version to the full dome and VR, we'll see maybe soon. I don't know. It's hard to put an exact number on it or something, but how much time and effort goes into, say, just each? specific instance of just this one project? All the time. I have no minute to sleep. No, it's a joke, but I can't really measure like time in hours or days it's just a constant work you know you you never stop you just do thing and then oh you have another idea maybe we should change that maybe the molecule of water would change the color or you know the specific structure we constantly discuss and so the next performance we do we're back to the screen version which is funny because I guess it's a centre botan, it's called, in Santander in Spain, but they can't actually make the full, you know, the 360 degrees. So we just go back to string version, but they still want to do it. But like, it's a constant process. You just, I mean, in terms of hours, I can't tell you how many hours, many hours, but like it's... between the project, between the FMR, between the Antarctic Tag, the Dark Hearts of Space, it's just, you know, one day you would work on that, the next day you would work on that, and then I would do a techno EP. So it's like almost a lifestyle every day. You just do things. You're just constantly busy. It's fun. It's fun. Yeah, because I think people who, someone who's more into dance music or whatever, they might, say like a young producer or something, might have an idea of, like an intuitive idea of how to put a record out or something like that or how to move forward in their career in some way or something. But when it comes to something like, I want to be an installation artist. I don't think people would have as much of an easy idea of like, oh, how do I even begin to start doing something like this? That's interesting. I never asked that question to myself. How I would do this? I mean, I did, but not in, like, I don't know. You just do things. But I mean, in terms of physically being able to get into a position where you're able to do the ideas that you want to do in terms of working with different. arts organizations and cultural bodies and stuff like that what was like breaking the ice with that sort of world like i mean i can't say that i'm like you know a lot in a institutional academic art i mean there is always institutions involved but i think You know, to be honest, that also, let's say, a techno scene, like in festivals, is also start mixing more and more with different sort of platforms, you know, especially visual, audiovisual, like Lab Festival, MUTEC Festival. It's not really like an institutional, you know, museum story. It's a mixture. of things. There are different types of artists. There is also a focus on audiovisual. But in terms of breaking through this door or going through the door, I mean, I don't even know specific of it. I never thought about it. I just did things. And probably I would propose... Of course, there are people working with me, like my agent, you know, like Ludovica or, you know, people who support and try to find the context. But somehow it just comes. Like, I don't feel like forcing. Of course, I'm searching for certain things and meeting some people. But I can't say that there is a big effort of finding the space or... I think there are festivals that are pretty open to projects. And if you propose something, you know, verbally or written or somehow, you know, if they know you a little bit, your activity, maybe they trust you on words. But then if you're new or maybe you just put down the project, written project, and they like it and they just invite you, it's not so complicated. I don't think so. I don't feel like I need to struggle. To a certain degree, yes, but to the dark hearts of space for the installation version, it's just the production costs so much money that I don't have that money. We need to find an institution. that would get funding from the institutional part or from the commercial sponsor, I don't know. In terms of Dark Eyes of Space performance, yes, it's a theater version, so it's adapted to theater, but the big-scale installation of that plan, it didn't happen yet. There were several institutional or semi-institutional platforms that were interested, but after the calculation, just nobody can afford. So yeah, there are obstacles, obviously, if your project is expensive in terms of production costs. But then in terms of just open up and present your project and they like it or they don't, but there's always a space. look for it somehow without I don't know it's actually I'm not right place to talk about it I just never think about it I just do the project and then you know or I can be also specific site inspired like Craftwerk how Hanna entire tic tac form it was specific site inspired so I just felt like I would like to freeze the space and you know it comes from the idea you know and of course you know then we may I made it to a sort of scenario but yeah So how often would you have a finished concept before you have a place to realize it? Or how often is it that you get offered something and you're like, oh, I need to make a project that would fit this? Well, it's not that I made a hundred projects yet, so I can't speak that way, like how often. Mostly... The idea is kind of almost solid, I would say, the idea itself, and it partially is written. But then, like, for example, I'll just give a concrete example, maybe it's easier. So in terms of Dark Hearts of Space, I was conceiving the project. I wanted to do, you know, a piece about black holes. I really wanted to do, and it's actually music inspired. then I would visualize what I thought musically and so on. But I didn't really have... let's say platform and it just came. The curator of MUTEC, Patty Schmidt, she would propose to go to the Banff Centre. There is a big residence in Canada. So she invited me to be a mentor, to do sort of, you know, mentoring. You know, they would have a residency for electronic artists the first time. So she would just invite to participate. And then she would ask, yeah, what are you working on? And I'm like, oh, I'd like to do this Dark Hearts of Space. I don't know where I should yet. You know, I was just in. And that's how it happened. She's like, yeah, here's a space. Here's a space. They can, you know, they can provide you with the space, projectors. So they literally gave us the whole theater to just work. And I mean, that's art centers is what are they for? They provide you space and, you know, time and possibility to work on the project. So it just came together. And probably it would take longer, you know, if Patti wouldn't be there with this proposal. But then, yeah, it would just happen. But the project was already like, so in the internal process, the project was already somehow conceived. But it was, I needed the space to try. So the moment you start trying out. And so I invite Stanislav, of course, we do it again, but the different project. So we would sit there and elaborate how it would look like, how it would sound like. So in that process, when we actually try, it would change, obviously. So, but the idea, the theoretical idea, the theoretical scenario or something would be there already. So I think you have to have an idea first to actually find the space or what you actually want to try or realize. Because I imagine there's only so much preparation you can do anyway when you're working in these specific locations. you might get to this space and have to like change all these things, change all these ideas you have. How often do you have to, you know, go back to the drawing board or something when you're trying to actually realise one of these works? Sometimes you try out something and then you go, oh, no, it looks terrible or it sounds terrible. Yeah. And then you have to reconceive everything, not everything, but partially. So, yeah, it does happen. But it's the part of creative process. You're just there to work on it. You're there to try. And then if it doesn't look right, then you just do it again and again and again. you know, if you have a space for it, it's amazing. If you don't, you do it in a small space. You know, we do it sometimes testing stuff in our little studios, in audio studios, and we have like a little corner where, you know, we test the video with a shitty, I don't know if you can say this, with very bad projector. And so, but, you know, the idea is there, you elaborate them. And then when you have a bigger space or, you know technical environment and you know you try a different way and then you can see all the mistakes so you know so it's it's continuous process and even if the performance is ready and you do the premiere and you look at the performance you're like no why did I do that and not that and so sort of so it's constantly evolving and little things change in becoming better and you know it's like lifetime process, I think. Well, at least for me, I don't know. I think my projects are never finished till the end. Just want to change every time. You just run out of time eventually. Yeah, well, I think I finish when I'm dead. Yeah. This might be an amazingly boring question, but I'm interested in like, are you the one who has to figure out the budget for your ideas? Like, how would you even go about figuring out how much it would cost to do any of these things? Technically, you make a research. And then you also... proposed project then the production part like the festival or something they would check we say we need you know you send a technical writer and you say okay we need six projectors that type of projectors that type of lenses I don't know the whatever screen that size you know so you have technical requirements that you define you know based on your knowledge and research and whatever tests So and then the production, which is the festival, they say, okay, well, this would cost us that and so we can afford or we cannot, and so on, so on. So that's for the part who invites to figure out how much it costs for them, basically, to provide something. But, of course, obviously, we know approximately, as I mentioned, dark areas of space have really high projection costs due to the rental price of the projector in general in Europe. In Russia, it would cost less expensive than in Europe because for some reason the... 30,000 limit projector costs enormous amount of money. So yeah, the definition of the cost, it comes with, yeah, also was the fact when it was the moment where you trying to do a show or, you know, expose the installation. So you can, but you can calculate approximate budget in if it's based on the technical aspects. Yeah. Yeah. Would you say that Antarctic Tact was like your first official one of these works? Audiovisually, yeah, we can say that. So was there any sort of learning curve when you were thinking, I want to go get back into doing this sort of thing again? Did you start doing it and be like, oh, I have to learn this, I have to learn that? Yeah, I mean, first I wanted to realize on my own, but then I realized that I just don't have enough time to gather, for example, that knowledge that I think I assume should be there to produce stuff. Yeah, I mean, you learn things constantly when you have an idea and you need to know how to realize it. You're doing research, you're doing, you know, you're just surfing the internet or reading books and like, just like, right, how do I do that? What would be, you know, you learn about callous projection, you know, like, I'm not going to give all the lists. It's basically whatever it is. like recently when I did the installation for Rust Labrador I kind of had to relearn some things about electricity because, you know, it was an electromechanical installation. So something that I learned at school, I already forgot because I just never used in practice. So I was like, okay, how do I do this? How do I do the motor? How do I do this? So, but you just go for it. You just learn it. Yeah, it's mostly technical aspect. you gather knowledge on technical aspects, how would you realize technically this and that and that. But I think in any process, you know, when you do music, You get your new synthesizer and you have to learn how it works. Even if you know the basics, but you still have to learn the specific gear, specific stuff, or light-specific stuff, or projector-specific stuff. And then when the work is done, I had no idea about lenses, for example. I mean, briefly, yes, I know that there's a wide lens. I know that there's, you know, certain... But then there are so many lenses. I learned it's all new for me, you know. So it's in the process you learn. You learn a lot, yeah. And I think collaborations is also great because you exchange knowledge. You exchange, you know, a lot of information that, you know, you just, yeah, becoming more mature and things. Yeah, it's interesting. With the concept side of it, each of the works that you've done have concepts behind them, obviously. Are these something that come to you on an intuitive, subconscious level? Or have there been specific stimuli where you're like, oh, I'm going to make an idea about black holes? Hard question, obviously. Where do ideas come from? Yeah, eternal question. Where do ideas come from? Where the inspiration come from? To be honest, I don't exactly know how that works in my head. I do know what I do know that. Anything can trigger it. So it could be an external source where I would watch the movie and then it would bring me to a thought or something. So in terms of Antarctic Duck, let's say, yeah, I would, you know, I would just get so frustrated from the world. At some point of my life, some moments, I just felt the Weltschmerzen, what is in German, Weltschmerzen. So I wanted to escape. Long story short, so the Antarctic come, the Antarctic come with like from the site specific, I would, you know, I would freeze something, just freeze. But also it's a rejection. So I was tired of people. I was tired of things. I was tired of, I wanted to escape. I didn't want to kill myself. obviously but where would I stop the thought progress where would I escape well where are people okay Siberia Antarctica maybe or Arctic Pole so I choose Antarctica and it was just curious and I start reading about Antarctica you know that's how but it's hard to explain like when I talk about it it sounds a bit silly but then it was just thoughts that would progress and then I would sing and then side specific I would freeze the world freeze and drag whatever it's all mixture it's hard to make a logical line from it but somehow it's just some thoughts that triggers something and then I would see a terrible movie that would just you know I would just start hating the world or something or I would see the news about, I don't know, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and then I was just like, okay, well, that has to stop. So, because, you know, and then the intro of Antarctic Tag, for example, is actually screening, you know, whatever, Second World War horrors, and I would make a speech. It was a statement, and then we go to the beautiful continent. But, yeah, so it can be triggered. you know, from anything. And then something beautiful I would see and then inspiring me. Black holes was just like, I'm just fascinated with black holes and the space and physics and its general interest. So, and then I would connect it to music, the physicality of sound, and then I wanted to work with silence. I was like, how do you post silence in the composition, in a dance track? Impossible. If there is a silence more than 10 seconds, you know, the dance track, everybody would be like, what's going on? The sound is breaking? You know, this sort of thing. So, genres of composition, silence, silence. How do I visualize silence? Silence, okay, nothing, black holes, you know. So it's like a... Yeah, in brief, I don't know. Like, it's hard to explain. It's really hard to explain. But yeah, it's just thinking process. Like you just... So how does this all balance or not with DJing and dance music and stuff like this? I mean, I love DJing. I love dance music. But as I told you, for me, it's just the field is too narrow. Well, that's what I think personally for me. How does it balance? I mean, I think the dance culture, I mean, techno club culture, you know, something more integrated to... entertainment more like a little bit less intellectual just more emotional physical just like let it go thing so it's also necessary you know to yeah like you can't sit there and think all the time about the horrors of the world or about black holes sometimes you just want to liberate some sort of yeah, physical, emotional liberation. And I think dance culture is a lot related to that. When, you know, people dance, especially rave culture, you just, you know, go mad and you don't want to sing. You don't want to, you do want to feel still, but like it's just a kind of emotional organism where I say it's not intellectual, but it doesn't mean that it doesn't have a, you know, yeah, less thoughtful maybe, but you're more spontaneous, more physical, and more beautiful in a sense, like just liberating. So yeah, in my balance of things where I like heady things, well, to me, they heady, you know, evolve and sing and discover and try things. And dance culture is just more like purist emotional thing to me. And I think it's, yeah, it's important too, where you just, I don't know, energy, some sort of... energy-wise you just connect with people when there is one organism on the dance floor where i mean everybody's connected to kind of the same track or environment that's also beautiful and amazing but it has no explanation it has no it's just moment yeah yeah community People just gather together regardless, you know, social status, regardless of this, this, this, this. Just nobody cares at the end of the day. They just dance. It's great. What about in the sense of like your day-to-day life or your ability to live for however many years into the future doing this? Like, do you have to do a certain amount of DJing so that you can do the installation work that you want to do and things like this? I mean, hearing is a profession. Like, yeah, it's source of my income as well, DJing. You know, it's a job as well. I mean, I love the job as a passion too, but there is also a regular aspect of everyday life where I also, you know, it's a source of income, so it's work. And sometimes it's less great and romantic than it might look like because every day of touring artists is not so fun, not always fun. I mean, it's beautiful when you actually... You play the music the moment that you leave, but the whole airport, lack of sleep, it affects your health. There are a price to pay for it too. Are you happy with the balance between the two that you have now? And yeah, some moments I am and some moments no. It depends. You know, like I'm just, I'm alive. So sometimes I'm happy with what I do and sometimes not. And some people would say, yeah, well, you, you know, you're privileged, you do what you love. And, you know, and I realized that. Sometimes you just want something else. But generally, yes, I'm happy. And I still want to do more things. More things. Just experience more things. More performances. Still love to DJ. We've still got a lot of time ahead of you, luckily. Oh, I hope so. We never know. So how different is the composition process regarding music from what you're doing for these interdisciplinary works versus if you're sitting down to make like a techno track or something? Is it the same? Are you sitting down in the same workstation working with the same tools or is it? It's a completely different process. I mean, in terms of music, yes, it's still the same tools and the same studio position, similar. But I mean, in the process of making a little scenario for the project, no, I'm not sitting in the studio. I can lay in the bed or I can sit on the floor. I mean, there is no space specific. I can be outside drinking coffee and writing something or picking my nose and thinking. But in terms of actual production, musical production, yeah, it's still the same. Techno, I mean, I have my spaceship with all the equipment, well, what I call a spaceship because it's like a curve with all the... And yeah, I mean, I just use similar tools to techno or, you know, not exactly the same. But yeah, at the end, it's a similar process, yes. I go to my studio and I do things and I compose whatever try out sounds and make sounds and, you know, but in terms of thinking, like conceptualizing, no, I don't have to be in the studio. I can be anywhere. I don't know how significant this is, but your curatorial work with 4D sound. Yeah, we can talk about it, but it's very simple. I just help. First, we met with 4G guys. I was invited as a guest to perform in Amsterdam. I think the event called Techno in Space. And then we met and we just had, you know, conversation and somehow established certain, you know, curious relationship about sound, the system, and I'm curious about it. And then, yeah, they just asked me to join the curatorial board, which would help them to select applications for the special institute in Budapest. So I participate for like two years. Unfortunately, now I don't have much time to do because I just do my own things. But yeah, we're still in contact. What's it like having to get to grips with composing for however many dimensions? Four. Is it four dimensions? How many speakers are there in the rate? So, for someone who's never done this before, what are they confronted with in terms of arranging their music to work in this way, which is completely different to stereo, obviously? Yeah, it's very different. I mean, I think... Theoretically, if you've never done it before, it's hard to understand how you actually, let's say, put sounds in space and how you move them through space. So the idea of the system is that you can actually control sounds and the movement and change, interchange in a position in the space. So you have, let's say, a cue board. rectangle yeah and you have a certain spot so you have like one sound on the left speaker number one and another one speaker number let's say 15 or 26 so and you would just move so to understand this you really have to try it and I mean it's not difficult you can apply to the residency there is a lot of space people who are interested they can always apply and try it out And then the whole composition, the whole perception of sound and the way you relate to your own music changes completely. So you have to adapt to speaker-specific, you have to adapt to space-specific, you have to adapt something that is not central. Imagine if you have a... orange that's centered in the room. So you know that there's an orange and you perceive that. But then if you take a lot of little particles from the orange, you know, let's say grains or whatever, how they're called, the pulp. put it in, it's a strange metaphor, but anyway, I'll continue, I'll try. Put it in every corner of the room and every space. You would have to see a bigger picture to combine the orange together. So, you know, you have to kind of pull back and see every, you know, so it's a little bit, I don't know why it's a strange metaphor, but yeah. Yeah, so. The perception of the orange changes, you know, and you really have to have a bigger picture of the sound. So it's like you work with little elements to combine a bigger picture. And it's not centered, it's not, you know, focused where you're just there. You know, it's not there, the orange. You have to really see every details, understand where you put the details to still have the orange, actually the picture of the orange or, you know, as an object, let's say, the form. There is a lot of artists were applying, they were trying to create a geometrical forms. via sound. So maybe that's a better example. So you would create hypercube which is impossible but still you know I still want to have a hypercube also one day I'll create a hypercube but let's say let's simple geometrical for a rectangle so you know you would compose that the sound would interact in a certain form and then inside the rectangle there would be a triangle so there will be a sound or frequency that responds to that And then you just move the space. Like, you know, like now I'm moving my hands. I don't know if it's actually in the recording. It's clear enough. It's rotating. It's rotating, yeah. So it's a totally, totally different way of perceiving than just listening to the music. It's not only about the music. It's also about the sound and the sound in space. you know, not talking about a bit of space, but space of the room or space, you know, and yeah, it's, it's, yeah, it's amazing. It's, yeah, what can I say? Orange. You have to see it from different perspective. The orange metaphor was very vivid. Yeah, well, it just came to my mind. So it's, yeah. Just another techno related question. I think you put out, you were at least putting out records in that sort of style, I don't know, like 15 years ago or something at that point. I don't want to say words like the scene or underground or overground or anything like that, but obviously a lot has changed. I'm sure from where you're sitting, it's quite different, like 2006 versus 2018. Is there anything in particular about the way things have gone, which sticks out to you as particularly significant over that time or anything like this? I think... There are, first of all, it's less monopolized in terms of there are a lot of new artists. That's great. Like very independent, very self-sufficient. Yeah, there are a lot of new people and are constantly discovering like with CTM. It was like, well, I don't know all those people. Where did they come from? And, you know, and also. It's expanding to other territories. I never heard some artists from Uganda before playing, well, let's say electronic music, not techno, but not puristic techno, but still related to it. So it's expanding a lot. There is a lot of artists. This is great compared to 2006 and compared to whatever year before. But then the negative side, I think it became way too business. way too money orientated because people that I mean there are two different type of people like people who doing it for doing it and there are people who see that oh that's there is some live in there let's make a profit out of it so there are a lot of I mean That's my impression. You know, it attracts that sort of people who are actually not really interested in the content or... but more into the profit kind of side of it. And so on one hand, it became more business to me, like how I see it, even more than 2006. And I mean, it was always a business in a sense, but somehow, or maybe it's just, yeah. Sometimes it's good because artists can earn their bread, their food, pay their bills with what they do. But on the other hand, it's oversaturated. And certain fees and certain, like, the policies went just completely crazy, which is, I think, overblown. And that kills the, you know, I think it kills this beautiful innocence or beautiful, I don't know, spontaneity, creative part. let's say a romantic approach to it somehow that we do something beautiful there is a sense to it not just because we want to make fucking money and go for holiday for our life which is okay in itself, you know, people like that, okay. But I think it's just, I'm maybe overprotective from that. I think it's great to make money to a certain degree. But when, you know, the DJ fees rise, like... I don't know, crazy amount of money. How do you do this? How would you sustain this if, you know, you just like, it seems like someone wants to just grab all quickly as fast as possible before it's dead and go to the next. So that is a negative side. The positive side is, yeah, there's still a lot of possibility and a lot of new artists. And the fact that technology went widely accessible, a lot of people can do things just with the minimum of equipment. great things and that's that's beautiful that's what I yeah like and since well 2006 it was already going but let's say a bit further away it was privileged you know expensive synthesizers this and this so not everybody can afford but now you just can buy you know abled and great do things or buy little things you know little synth and just create something that's that's absolutely great yeah because There are so many ideas, so many young people and they just, they don't have to be professional, know anything and it's just like, wow, great idea, like, oh, great sound, whatever, something, something. Yeah. So that's the different to me, like, progress from Dreamy, but Elites 90s still or the 2000s where it was a lot of, I think, the minimal phase, I call it. Like, it was... Very fashion. I don't know. And then, yeah, now it's, I think, I think it's more diverse now in, in, yeah, in short, it's more diverse now music wise. And is there anything in particular, which is happening in the next like year or two years, which you're able to talk about at this point in terms of whether it's records or. larger pieces you're putting together or is it is the future too misty to project into yeah i mean i have my projection ideas that i would like to do but it doesn't mean that they will happen not like the idea is not always come to an end and you know sometimes it's just no i mean i can talk about current projects like um i've been saying this for some time We want to do a Lada album. It's the project that the collaboration with Lars Hemmeling. I mean, we've been saying this since 2012. I mean, we still play time to time. We still perform. And we still have so much material, but we just can't put it together in an album. Maybe because, you know, time schedule. I don't know. There's something. But we fixed that 2019 will do it. So let's see if that... comes true, becomes real and Yeah, and then, of course, the Dark Arts of Space installation. Currently, we're talking to one of the curators of the Gamma Festival in St. Petersburg. It's a festival. So he already said that he found the location, almost. And so he has an access to find something, well, something that we need, these super expensive projectors. Apparently, well, yeah, so there is a possibility that we realize it in 2020, this installation. So 2019 will be like a preparation year, the installation. And then, yeah, we still tour the Antarctic Takt and the creative version Dark Hearts of Space. And I'd like to do a new album too. Well, I mean, I'm working on it, but slowly. I don't know how long that's going to take. The moment I feel like, okay, well, I'm ready to let it go, then, yeah, then it's ready. But I can't tell you, like, if it's landed this year or next year. For days of daylight Time to see. I spawn. I'm competing to see you. For days to fly and time to see. I was born. Competing with you first. Competing with you first. They do this universe.
