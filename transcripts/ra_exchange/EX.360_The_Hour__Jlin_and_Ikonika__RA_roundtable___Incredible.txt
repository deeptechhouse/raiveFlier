You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. The Hour is RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. Coming up on this month's show... I have a phrase I always tell people, I say, don't DJ me. And they're like, what do you mean? Don't DJ you. Don't DJ me. Yeah. Don't DJ me. No, not my music, but like don't you know, cuz I don't I don't don't put me on the bill as a DJ Jalen and Iconica sit down together to talk about their new albums and compare notes on the creative process and Some RA editorial staff gather in a park to say who or what has excited them the most so far this year. There was a guy who was next to me who said that hardcore Aphex Twin fans are really nice and so they won't start punching in or pushing in and to an extent that was true because I mean I never got that hairy but people were like certainly kind of being pretty ruthless about getting to the front. But first it's behind the track. We finally released our Real Scenes London film this month so we've selected a track this timeout that couldn't be more London. We had Steve B from Rank Records stop by to tell us the story behind MB and General Levy's incredible and and it's a story that lives up to the track's title. "Incredible" was a track that shook Jungle to its core, both because of the enormous success it achieved and how much some people in the scene were against it. These days, "Incredible" is simply seen as one of UK sound system culture's biggest anthems, but back in the '90s, it was a highly divisive piece of music. Hi, I'm Steve B. from Rink Records. And in 1994, we released Incredible. been affiliated to the label probably from about 91, 92. Still licensed stuff for people and stuff like that. So the record Incredible was produced by M-Beat. obviously featuring General Levy. Embiid as a producer probably started in 91, I guess. Jamaican, but East London roots Forest Gate started off making hardcore records that mutated into what we would call today as Jungle. The gentleman that owns Renk is called Junior Hart. M-Beat is his son. So it was, yeah, father-son relationship, which makes the story a little more interesting as you go along. If you listen to M-Beat's output from about 93... Basically what he was doing was he was sampling, I guess you'd call them bashment records, and maybe old soul and rare groove tunes. So the thinking maybe was, instead of sampling these people, why don't we get people in to do it live? We were working with live musicians, we were playing out live as well. So MB had actually sampled... Levy in one of his older tracks. We were published through EMI, a chap called Guy Moot. I think the numbers were exchanged through those people. Levy just called up one day and yeah, we got him down. So I was the so-called A&R guy. Everything before this, it's quite difficult to get your head around now, but at these times... No one had made a full song. It was all snippets. It was little samples. No one had ever gone, right, start there and finish right at the end. Make it a song. When they played me the rough demo, I was like, yeah, it's good, but it's too much. It's too much. It's too much. You can't put that out. There's no way you can put that out. But my boss... made me see the light, Junior. And it was a massive change because no one had done anything like that. It was a massive departure. I'm glad they didn't listen to me. It was around the time of Easter weekend, I think it must have been 94. We'd gone to Music House to cut. I remember Frost being at Music House and he'd heard it and was like, you've got to give me this tune. And he was like, nope. Junior was not having any of it. He's like, nope, nope, sorry, nope. But... But yeah, he relented in the end. Yeah, we only gave it to three DJs and I remember specifically, it was a bank holiday weekend, I know that for sure. So we cut it on the Thursday, them lot went out Friday, Saturday and Tuesday our phones just lit up like, just like an explosion, just blew up. and there was only three people that had it. Devious said he played the tune for like half an hour or something. He'd like literally, he had to wheel it up eight times and stuff like that. It was crazy, yeah. I think as far as sales-wise was concerned, I'm not sure if it was 350 or 450,000 that we sold. I remember at the time, you couldn't move without hearing that record. I'd walk down the street, I'd hear it coming out of someone's room. A The radio had been on. Anywhere you went, you'd hear it. So a lot of people liked that record, from kids up to whoever. Got to number eight in the charts. Totally independent. We had murders with that record. Absolute murders. I believe he did an interview in The Face or ID magazine. The sentence that really kicked it off was, I don't know if he said, I'm bigging up jungle or I'm running jungle or something like that. So I think the people from the jungle fraternity, some of them... took quite a fence to that because from their point of view you've got this reggae artist who's never sort of done anything to do with jungle drummer bass. He's got a hot record and now he's king of the jungle as it were sort of thing. So yeah there was a now famous meeting with a lot of the big jungle boys. They formed a committee and carried on with all sorts. If people played a record we're going to boycott you, you're not going to play at raves, if we see this, we're going to do that. So we had that to contend with, plus London wanted to injunk the record, they tried to. We were totally independent, we were fighting all of these crazy things. You have to remember, no one was interested in that music for years. We were a self-contained unit. The West End didn't want us, record labels weren't interested. We had our own distribution. We had our own radio stations. It was self-built. Everybody built, you know, they all had a part to play all over the country. So this chap comes along and runs off his mouth and people get upset. You know, I can understand, but I mean, to actually form a committee to say, you know, and some of the things that were coming out was like... You know if promoters book him or us to play they're gonna boycott them If any DJs play the record they're gonna take the record off the turntable smash it give them a fiver and then they're ostracized from the scene We had a tune I'd given this A-list Jungle guy still is today gave him a remix to do and then I got a call a couple of days later saying look I can't give you this thing because they're all going mad and I don't want to get involved in it. So they took out all the remix samples and it's an anthem today. There was all sorts of craziness going on. I really didn't understand it at the time. It was shocking as well. It seemed a bit like kids throwing their toys out of the pram almost, you know? So the reason I think this record's lasted so long... this conversation with mb a couple of times he seems to think that it's got like a nursery rhyme quality to it if you listen to if you actually sit and listen to it there's a lot more going on than that but he seems to think it's something to do with that like subsequently over the years i've bumped into people that are really like big artists now that are like that was the first record i ever bought i bought that on a tape when i was at school and that's what got me into jungle and stuff like that. We're going to get Siri. I have cursed at Siri so many times and her response is like, that's not nice. Yeah. I tell Siri, I love you. And then she's like, I don't think that's appropriate. Like, so yeah. That's cold. Yeah. What do you mean? Exactly. So, is Iconica? It's Iconica. Iconica. Yeah. A lot of people used to say that. Jalen, you're an idiot. Okay. Yeah. Back in the day. Iconica. I'm so sorry. Iconica is a good one as well. Iconica. Okay. Say it again for me. Iconica. Iconica. Okay. That's okay. So, it's like Iconica. Right. Got you. Which is quite pretty, I might add. But why that name? It comes from the word iconoclast. And that means someone that destroys religious objects. So I'm not trying to do that literally. No. In a literal sense, but in a musical sense. I was that weird kid listening to metal and R&B. so many mad genres I felt was really right when I started producing to kind of rebel and have that kind of attitude and maybe that punk attitude that I had when I was playing the drums in like bands when I was younger also have that kind of come into play You don't like tradition? I don't like tradition, nah. I mean, you'll see it in my song arrangements. Right. Especially with, like, vocals. Yes, I noticed that. It was actually... I had to ask myself about five times when I was listening to your album, the song that actually listened to your album in reverse, by the way, which was by sheer accident, not fully in reverse, but the last song to the front. Okay. So, cause yeah, I'm, I wish, you know, that's not a bad idea. I should start a little countdown. Yeah, completely. I was like, wow. Oh, this was the last track. Right. So when I, hit the last track. I said, wait, so can she, I was like, can she sing? Can you sing? Oh no, that's not me. That's Jessie Lanza. Oh, okay. So, cause I was like, wow, can she sing? And I got really excited. I wish I could sing like Jessie. She's got such a nice, high, soft, like effortless voice. Okay. Yeah. Cause I was like, I feel like a demon. Did I put on a deep voice? No, but it was cool though. I was wondering. I was like, wow. I was like, can she sing? That was like the first. thing that initially like struck me because I'm always listening I love vocals different types of vocals not necessarily a person singing or musically sometimes it's just the tone of the person's voice right exactly like you know I like sometimes like I'll give you an example I love that James Blake can sing one verse and then sing the bridge and then it's just amazing he could sing the same verse five times and it still be great just like you heard for the first time. Well, my favorite thing is just to sing a load of hooks. Yeah, exactly. Like, right. Just not traditional, you know? Yeah, exactly. I'm glad you asked me that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. Tell me it's such a crime. Me don't want you. The way you don't belong. You're listening to The Hour from Resident Advisor. When I'm listening to Black Origami, I feel like I'm on a mission or trapped in a maze. It's kind of frantic and I love all the panning that you've used. How do you feel listening back? And do you feel the same way? Was that the intention? It's a bit crazy, you know? When I listen back to any track, and not even just Black Origami, I think because I'm so moody in a sense, musically, that can change. Where today I loved it, and then tomorrow I hated it. And then today, and then the next day was amazing, and then the next day, horrible. How could I do such a thing? So it just really, it depends on really what state of mind am I in or what mood am I in. But as far as like when it comes to like the panning, I just like, I guess my sounds to hit in different ways and not just in just this all one direct one focal point thing. You know, like the bass is coming in from the left and then I might clash in with the drums and then they sound like they've collided in some big... explosion has happened. So those kinds of things, usually those are like fly-by-night decisions, I think. Like, they're like, ooh, let me try that real quick. But not necessarily, you know, like, I never come in with the intent of doing anything. Just kinds of happens in the middle of the process, I guess. Yeah. Like, it must sound crazy just on the headphones and just everything kind of spinning around. like it's very free day. Yeah, sometimes it can get hectic. Sometimes I don't like it on the headphones because it becomes too much for me, even though I'm the one making it. But it can become too much for me where I can't take it. And then it's hard to feel because with the headphones on, sometimes it can just be overtaking and too overwhelming. Like I remember... Classic example was I was actually making the title track, Black Origami. I could have probably finished it in two days, but it took me an additional four because every time I got to the ending, I just kept getting this feeling of being overwhelmed and I would have to leave my room because it was just too much energy in my room because that's where I was making it in. Would you say it was like fatiguing or was it just... It was fatiguing because I was probably like slaving away at it. But then also, too, I was very happy with it at the same time. So it was like a happy and tired thing, I guess, at the same time. Yeah, because you put your labor in. Right, exactly. But you're satisfied at the same time. So it's like a paradox almost of two emotions coming together. And they're fighting against each other. And then you just don't want to be in the middle of the fight. So you just leave, which is what I would do. So would you say like your personality almost changes? Completely. I morph into like a totally different, I don't even know. I think there's some type of metamorphosis that goes on for sure. Would you say there's like one other character or many? I would have to say it's probably, I think there's one character, there's me, but then there is like a whole nother, I think it's like a totally separate, I don't think it's within myself, I think it's a totally separate entity that has nothing to do with me, but just happens to be there that we can work. It's actually quite, if that makes sense. Yeah, no, it makes sense. Okay. Yeah, it's kind of like an automatic. Yes, yeah, completely. It's just a feel of, and a lot of it is like trial and error to having the experience over so many times, you know, doing this for quite some time now. And then you kind of know what to do. And then you know, and then you also know what not to do. And then you're also like, oh, but shit, I'm lost. And then it's like, no, I'm not lost. I know exactly where I am now. So then you react to that. Yeah. That was a great answer. Thank you. My question to you is how long did it take for you to find your sound and what were the... greatest challenges along the way? I feel more comfortable with my sound these days. Now, I think people are getting it right describing my music and I'm kind of happy about that. It's nice to be like, yeah, I agree with that rather than, nah, that's completely wrong. And I would say it's like science fiction, R&B, but with loads of the 80s synths and some just modern drums. So yeah, this is something I'm really into. changed my mind in a year or two. When did you feel stable in your sound? I think right in this last album. Yeah. You feel stable? Yeah, yeah. Because the second album was called Aerotropolis and it was kind of me pretending to go in the time machine and going back to the 80s and 90s and seeing what I would produce if I was around. that time playing with those fantasies but now I just feel a bit more grounded. How does your life line up with your music? I think my earlier stuff is maybe a bit floaty or dreamy or it's just escapism. I feel distractions is a bit more of a physical thing even with the artwork it's it's about road it's about concrete it's about buildings. A little bit cold, I think, and a bit kind of grey and blue, like the album cover. My face is on the pavement. That's how grounded it is. Nice. It's like a slap on the face on that cold pavement. So there's a lot of tubular sounds, drums, in your new album. Would you say there's an attraction to those sounds? Where did that attraction come from? Oh, that's an easy one. I was kind of fascinated in my heartbeat. I don't know why, but I am. I'm still fascinated. But I love drums. I just I love percussion. I shouldn't just say drums. I should just say the entire line of percussions, period. Because I also love like, you know, like the cowbell to me and just like the Tibetan bells. I love them. And a lot of that came in black origami because I was traveling to India. I've gone to India four times now since last year. There's a person that I collaborate with who actually dances with. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So she actually dances with me. Her name is Avril. So when I go, you know, it's like we we we hang out, you know, and everything. But also to. India's music culture is so rich. Well, just their culture alone is so rich. But then musically, it is just like astounding. And a lot of it I can relate to, especially being of African descent, because, you know, it's just it is it is inside of me naturally. you know, being melanated. It's just, it's there. You know, you recognize, it's like something, it's very intuitive for me. I know that sound. I know it very well. Having like a tabla or a sarangi or, you know, a djembe. What's a sarangi? It's a string instrument. In a sense, it's kind of. Now, I wouldn't say wholeheartedly, but. of the sitar, but it has like its own vibe. Like you, you know it as soon as you hear it, you know, it was that type of an instrument. And, um, I also used instrument out of India, which Avril gave to me called the storm drum. And it's like this. Huh? Cool name. Storm Drum. It's funny because her middle name is Stormy for real. And everybody think it's a nickname, but that's really her middle name. Yeah. But and but this actual piece of equipment is called the Storm Drum. And it's like you would think it was plastic, but it's not. And then there's this long spiral, very skinny. It almost reminds you of like the mattress spring, but it's not. It's really long and you shake it and it creates this really low sound and then the sound just fills up the room. So it's like this whole vibration type thing. It's really cool. It actually sounds like a storm coming. I think I used that in my track High at Night for Black Origami. Bye. It's interesting you use Fruity Loops. Yeah, I use Reason 5 too though. Reason 5 and 6 and then I also use Sony Acid Prom Old School. So that's something I'm sure a lot of people haven't heard in quite some time. That's all audio, right? Yeah, it's audio. It's audio, but you can also like usually I might go in there and tweak a drum sound or something like that. and they're like, yeah. So I may take it straight from the machine and then put it inside of Sony. Are you like opening like the different applications or are you like slaving them to one thing? Um, I had to get a computer so that I was able to do that because at first I didn't have a computer that I could just slave everything and what I mean by that was I could slave it. But it would start glitching really, yeah, really badly. So then, but now that I have a computer, thank God. After having two bad shows of my computer malfunctioning, so I just went and bought a brand new laptop altogether last year. And I haven't had this problem since, of course. What do you use for your live shows? Are you DJing? I am, no, Ableton Push. Ableton Push 2. Yeah, I do know how to DJ, though. And so I thought you were a DJ. No, yeah. No, I'm actually, you know, I always have a phrase. I always tell people, I said, don't DJ me. And they're like, what do you mean? Don't DJ me. Yeah. Don't DJ me. No, not my music. But, like, don't, you know, because I don't. Don't put me on the bill as a DJ. Yeah, please don't. Like, yes, please don't DJ me. Because I don't think I've, you know, I just, I think I can do so much more than DJ. And there's nothing wrong with DJ. All my friends, I have so many friends that are DJs. But I feel like I don't, as much as hard work as they put into it. I think my hard work goes into the creating process. You know, their craft and love for DJing is equivalent to my craft and love for composing. So that's why I say don't DJ me. See, my problem is I'm a DJ and producer. Right, right, right. But I find it sometimes really hard to DJ my own songs. I had to learn. And this becomes a problem. Yeah, yeah. So I guess I try and keep them separate now and just be, when I DJ, it's for the party. Maybe I'll put in a couple of my tunes in there. I have a suggestion because I know I had this same issue when I first started, even though I did technically really just start. My first show was in 2015. My entire career I performed at MoMA. And from first crowd was 4,000 people. So yeah. Yes. No pressure. Right. So my heart felt like it was in my stomach, but like when it came to learning my sound. and learning what it was um when you say you're having a hard time if you can get in tune with do you know your patterns no i mean like not do you know your patterns musically like do you know your own patterns as if you were having an outer body experience like i know exactly what i would do i don't know that probably sounds crazy that's the thing i don't know what i'm doing half the time okay yeah Okay, yeah. Then I was about to say, it's almost like you have to become two people. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, this is my thing. I'm a Gemini as well. I'm like, you know, I just, I can't stick to one personality. Okay. Yeah, I'm a Leo. I don't know how I do it. It's quite insane. I think I have such control issues. Oh, God, it's crazy. Yeah. Okay. So getting into, because when I was listening to your music, I found it quite interesting that I had no pinpoint. And what I mean by that is, is I'm like, If I had to guess, like, what do you like artistically? I mean, well, I shouldn't say what music inspires you. I didn't have a pinpoint. And I was so happy that I didn't have one. Because you know how you can listen to a person's records after about the fourth one. You're like, oh, okay, I kind of see where this is going. But I didn't have that with you. So I really, I commend you for that. It's a gift and a curse. So I know the curse part is that means you can end up in the wrong space too. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So what I do want to know is like, who inspires you artistically? I think I'm a hybrid producer and a DJ. And when I DJ, it goes from like... like 100 BPM all the way up to 160. And it could be like a lot of R&B, hip hop, what we call bass music. It can go to grime, might play a cheeky... early dubstep tune, I should say. I can play footwork. So that's my mentality that I'm just like, I can do it, I can do it, I can do that. And then all of that kind of informs my productions. So when I come back home from touring or playing shows, I'm like, right, I'm back at home because I can't write on the road. I need my things. I need my... My little studio. So I, you know, just digest everything and then come back home and start working, experimenting. I've recently just decided not to stick to a BPM. Very smart. And distractions, it's just all over the place. It's distracting. So it can go from like a, like, yes, like 100 BPM stuff to like. 75 or something stupid like that no I and I don't consider that stupid because I have to say I see your big tech life hat here and so I have to um when you were talking about you know you don't stay in the same BPM I really like that because I get put in the category of footwork all the time I could say and scream it from the top of a rooftop that I am not a footwork artist, but in the next article of some sort, you see me. I mean, I've had that problem as well. Exactly. Being labeled dubstep, you're just a 140 BPM person. You're not even an artist. You're just that. You're just pigeonholed. You're completely pigeonholed. And this was really a big thing for me with Black Origami. Because even when I'll give you a classic Like when Nia Kenya Rise had come out, there is no way in hell you could say that that was a footwork track. But they were still naming and saying Jalen's footwork track. And I was just like, I was screaming on the inside. I guess people would say it's a different type of footwork. Yeah, but now they've put, and it's like, but what I've never understood is like. People change and the art people evolve. People evolve. And so it's like, I can't. Exactly. It's like, I can't say, okay, you started off in dubstep. Okay. So. you might want to make an R&B album the next thing you do. You never shake the title. And so when you have to actually listen back, you almost have to really do become two people sometimes because you listen back and you say, is it me? Sure. Yeah. You're so far ahead of what you're doing. Right. Like you've made an album. It could have been made. Well, my album was finished late last year. Okay. So there's been like. six, seven month gap now. So yeah, I mean, like nobody knows my sound now, like presently. Things come out slowly or people think that's you now. Right. But it was you last year. Last year. But it's only coming out now. Right, exactly. And I think people forget that. I forget that too. And I need to remind myself. Even with Black Origami, the last three tracks that I had made on it, my whole theme was I just really wanted to make time and space disappear. And I really didn't start touching that until maybe the last three tracks of the album. And so I really have a ways to go. Can you talk more about the last three tracks of the album? Yeah, sure. I'm talking about They're Not. in the order of which I had done them. But I'm talking about that I had, the way that I, yeah. Yeah, because they sound very, they're not, I don't know, like origami-ish. Yeah. So, yeah, yeah, yeah. So then there's like, okay, so there's like 1% with me and Holly. And then there's Holy Child with me and William Basinski. And then that is probably the track that I felt the freest doing. And then there is Challenge, which is just me. And so I also felt very free doing Challenge, too. Going back to Holy Child, that was the first time in my career that I have actually felt that I said, my God, I've never felt so free creatively ever. And like, I can go back. Actually, was there something technically? No, it was a feeling. It's not a technical thing. It's just like, because you know yourself very well. And it's like, you know, even though something that you have done may be good in a lot of. people may love it. Like people, okay, they love dark energy. I probably at this point, you know, with Black Origami being out, I would consider it quite naive at this point. Black Origami is naive. Dark Energy is naive to me now versus Black Origami. Would you say it's because you, it's like your first album? No, because I would have to say probably because like The growth factor, it can't be ignored. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's really, I think it's there. And it's just like, but I always feel like I'm never satisfied with any of my work, so I'm probably the worst person to ask when it comes to this anyway. People are like, this is amazing, this is wonderful, and I'm just like, but it could have been better. It could have been way better. Like, that's... I feel that way sometimes. I'm like, did you not notice that? You didn't notice that? Bad automation. Like, no, it just didn't work. I'm like, you didn't, nobody noticed that. Cool. Yeah, it's like, it could have been better. One thing I do notice about your work, because I really, I would love to know if you do this, if this is one of your practices of, are you like an effects person? Do you like effects? Yeah, I love, Really long reverbs. Okay, okay. Digital reverbs. Because I know, yeah, I was about to say, because I was just trying to remember. I just chuck reverb on anything. Okay, okay. I don't know. Yeah, reverbs and chorus. And chorus. Okay, nice. So usually I'll run my synths in a chorus first and then reverb with some long decay. Okay. And sometimes 100% wet. because yeah nice and i can switch between the two like i can put my effects in my software that I'm working with, or I can use, I've got like a few little guitar pedals that I like to mess around with. Okay. Just to like make a chain. And I kind of do it when I get bored of my synths. So I try and change the instrument almost, change the synth into something completely different just by using effects. I think that's amazing. Because you want to get your money's worth. I'm not like, I want to exhaust all. my things exactly this is my thing that i love to do i think that's i commend you for saying it i've saved money yeah I've made money from music and I'm going to put money back into that music. What's your three favorite pieces of hardware? I mean, this will change every two, three years, but I got a Korg Polly 61. I think that was trying to compete with the Roland Juno 106. This synth that I have hasn't got any MIDI. so um ableton gave me ableton so i started using ableton and i was like right i can manipulate audio so well. I don't even need MIDI. I can just play in my shit. And I can zoom right into it and cut out all the bits of dust in that audio. I can leave it in. I can use that for whatever. These days, I need to work. This is a career now. I need to make tunes. Not quickly, but with... efficiency I guess this is not mass production right it's not mass production we are not machines you know and you do need to break that's often something that we artists don't talk about which is you know your mental and your physical health care we don't talk about when we're on the road and we're switching all these different time zones like this. And, you know, when people come to see us play, it's like, you know, they're having a great time. We might be up there exhausted with 102 temperature. And, you know, this is not something that really gets talked about often. You know, it's taken for granted. I think people find it a little bit glamorous. Right. And it's like, you know, half the time it's Your mind has to be switched on constantly. You can't afford to mess up because it messes with your money and then you mess with your fans as well. Right. People that want to come out and see you. Let me ask you. So are you, I'm happy you brought that up. When you play, are you thinking about the crowd or are you thinking, or are you playing from yourself? A little bit of both. Okay. I used to be really bad and just play for myself. Like, I used to play a lot of, like, industrial techno and then mix it in with, like, Ray Stroman or something and it would just, like, freak people out. I'm like, I'm kind of... of loving this but I'm kind of doing it I don't know it's back to being an iconoclast I'm just being cheeky okay but um yeah over time I was like nah that's really selfish like you gotta stop doing that shit okay like just get your shit together um and you know program your sets a little bit better don't get overexcited or drunk as well this is a problem as well like there's so much alcohol around you Oh, yeah. It's very true. People often ask me, they're like, Jay, you want a drink? And I'm like, no. You're good. You're very good. Even after the show, they're like, hey, you want a drink? And I'm like, no. Now I want to go back to the hotel room and go to sleep because my flight is at 8 a.m. and it's 3.30 now. That doesn't mean you're, you know. Yeah. I'm Thank you to J-Lynn and Iconica. And remember that both of their new albums are out now. We've reached the midpoint of 2017. So last month, I gathered three of RA's editorial staff to get their personal highlights of the year so far. It was a ridiculously hot day in London. So instead of gathering in our stuffy studio, we decided to take the conversation to a nearby park. We found some shade under a tree and I asked everyone to tell me who or what has excited them the most so far this year. This is the hour from Resident Advisor. So exciting one this month. Joined by Holly Dicker over from Rotterdam. Yeah, hi, I'm Holly. And I'm Martha and I produce The Hour every month here in London. Okay, so we're gathered in this idyllic setting to talk about who or what has excited us the most so far in 2017. Holly, in the email reply you sent back to me, you said, I think I'm going to have, you put have in two stars, have to talk about Gabba. Please explain, why is this such a... a pressing topic for you? Okay, well, I'm based in Rotterdam, which is also known as the birth of Gabba. It may have been seeded in Amsterdam, but that's slightly debatable. It definitely became a thing in Rotterdam. I have to talk about it purely because three sets that I've seen this year that have completely blown me away have all been Gabba sets. All very different, different settings from three very different artists. So the first one was Bleaching Agent's closing set at Unpolished in Amsterdam. So he stepped up at 8am, fresh as a daisy, and unleashed pure hell. is all I can really describe it. You can also go back and listen to the mix because everything was recorded. So I guess to set the scene, the night started with some techno from people like... Perk and Randomer played together. MPIA3, did you say that? Yes, I think, yeah. That's the trust thing, I think. And then things slightly got harder. A&D stepped up. Meanwhile, The Horrorist was playing in the smaller room at the back. with some sprinkling of Gabba, but he sort of does a lot of different things. Okay, so it's called Unpolished, and the name in this case is pretty instructive. Well, I can tell you their tagline. So Unpolished is Reactors' most hardline techno concept, and that pretty much sums it up. But obviously it all went out the window when Bleaching Agent stepped up. Okay, because there is a slightly interesting broader context at play here. So you wrote an event review. You talked about it really enthusiastically. Admittedly, not many others on the team had even heard of the event, but it's wound up being one of our most viewed event reviews of the year. Was that surprising to you? Or are we sort of talking about like a latent, like hard techno following among RA readers, do you think? Well, as soon as it went up for sale, it was sold out within hours. Without a line-up even being announced? I assume so, but yeah, it was my first Unpolished. I have been to, so it's run by Reactor. They're based at Warehouse Elemental Strat, so I've been to the venue before. It's sort of like an empty warehouse, and they sort of react to every event they do. They move the place around, so it's kind of like a bare-bones thing. But I didn't really know what to expect. If I'm being honest, I was going to see The Horrorist, and it was wonderful. But, yeah, it was basically absolutely rammed from start to finish. There was a huge queue. around the block before midnight as we arrived. So yes, there's obviously a massive following. Okay, but it's been part of a pattern for you this year and there was a couple of other notable sets. Yes, so that and then in a few months ago I went to Intonal Festival in Malmo in Sweden. In general, I'd say it was quite a sort of sit-down concert style, very highbrow, intellectual, thinky festival. And then something wonderful happened around 1am when a crew from Stockholm and Sweden blew in. and played a gabaset. You've got to expand on Blue Inn. So they're called Drom for Colterton. It was a trio. consisting of Katja Lindeberg, who produces and DJs as Haj 300, Lois Nygren and Cecil Vincent. I think there's a couple of others involved. They've got an actual studio space in Stockholm. So they were all set up in what I can only describe as a corridor, which is like a little thoroughfare from one bar to another venue. Very small. They were set up and then I think it only took about one track for them to suddenly slip into 190 BPM, blistering Gabba, and it was wonderful. It brought a smile to all of our faces is all I can say. To say the least from the sounds of it. You seem to be describing something of a contemporary Gabba movement or at least there seems to be an increase in interest in the sound. I mean, as someone who's been following this music presumably for some time does it feel like more people are interested at the moment I think what was interesting about those two sets is so Bleach Agent obviously doesn't normally do this kind of thing it was a special actually it started as a I think he played the last Unpolished and as a joke to the promoter, he was like, oh, next time I'll do a Gabba set. And he did. And he absolutely brought it out. And as for the Stockholm crew, I don't know much about the scene in Stockholm, but everyone who was there really enjoyed it. I know that there's some contemporary bits going on. I know that D. Carboni, for example, from Repitch, he sort of dabbled in some Gabba. And there's this Parisian troupe called Casual Gabba's. But I don't know. What I'm talking about is sort of the original. 90s hardcore dutch thing because it's the big one coming up towards the end of the year there is a massive one coming up so gabba's popularity has sort of came about largely because of this event it's called thunderdome it's celebrating 25 years in utrecht in october and i can't wait My highlight of the year so far has actually been an unexpected free gig on Liberation Day, which is May the 5th in Holland. Throughout Holland they have big free parties. I just happened to cross the one in my neighbourhood. The Gabba father of it all, DJ Paul Etzlak, was playing as per usual. And I've never seen so many people united in... Moshing along to hard as nails Gabba music. What's the dancing like? It's wonderful. I don't know how to do it. But you know what? It's everywhere. If you go to any party in Holland, a techno party, there'll be some of it popping off. My friend described it as like a bunny dance. I think that's enough, right? Yeah? Got it? I mean, I guess what else are you going to do at 190 beats per minute? Well done. Ray, you're making your debut on The Hour. Hi, yeah. How do you feel? Nervous, excited, all the usual things you get before the big game. Okay, well welcome, welcome. So you went to Field Day this year and you saw an act. People were talking about this act. Yeah. Please fill us in. Yeah, so I went to see FX Twin. A few people had told me that it was the first show he'd done in London in five years, which I guess immediately gave the thing a sense of occasion. What was also interesting was that, you know, Aphex Twin was, I guess, part of the conversation at the festival long before he'd begun playing because there was a merchandise stall that had been set up kind of on the quiet. which was selling sort of a couple of logo Aphex Twin t-shirts and a 12 inch with 11 tracks on it, which was more or less like the one he released in Texas, I think. A couple of years ago. The Houston gig. Yes. I think it was actually the end of last year. Was it? Yeah, I think that was the last one he did before these European shows. Sure. So it was similar in the sense that it was released, you know, in... It was released in tandem with a specific event and the name of the EP was like London and the date of the performance. So I think that was 3rd of June. Anyway, so people were wearing like carrying around like Aphex Twin carrier bags with the record inside and wearing the T-shirts. you know kind of before like by the afternoon there was just Apex Twin stuff everywhere and you know kind of I guess in some way it made me quite excited for how this gig might pan out. The gig was held in this kind of air hangar, aircraft style hangar space. I don't think it had been in previous Field Day festivals before so it's you know a new thing. It was a very, very vast arena. And so when I got into that tent, I managed to sort of squeeze at the front and was kind of just saw the scale of production involved. So there were 12 screens. There was a bunch of lasers kind of, you know, going off at some point during the gig. And it was in tandem with the music. I mean, all that stuff felt. like basically like sensory overload it was uh a complete um yeah it was it was complete like chaos in a sense what were the scenes like down the front i was sort of safely towards the back third but i was imagining the front being absolute scrum well um what was funny was there was a guy who was next to me who said uh that hardcore afix twin fans are really nice and so they won't start punching in or pushing in And to an extent that was true because I never got that hairy. But people were certainly being pretty ruthless about getting to the front or squeezing past people. So it was a bit of a scrum. It was generally pretty good-natured, given the amount of people that were squeezed into the space. And getting on to the actual music, I mean, I kind of haven't seen Aphex Twin play in a long time. So I think the last time I saw him was at Sonar about five or six years ago. So I didn't really have that much of a sort of expectation for how this would turn out. But I guess what I was really impressed by was just the variety and the craziness of this music. Because I can't think of many other artists who would pack a tent of that size playing such challenging electronic music. I mean, it was really pretty amazing that so many people seemed to kind of really go for this. I think there was one particular moment that kind of... summed up the kind of contrasts he was making in this set so I remember there was like a an underground resistance track called what was it called? Method of Force and then He then played a shaped noise track, which was pretty hard, pretty unforgiving, just kind of bursts of noise, basically. And then the track after that was Imonitinium by Roy of the Ravers. And so I think just all of these tracks in sequence were really interesting and kind of characterised. the sudden jolts in style and tempo that this set underwent over the course of the two hours and yeah I basically found this all really impressive and I think I'm sorry to cut in there were you at all surprised at how up on things he seems to be Because there are a bunch of artists, you can look over the track list, there are a bunch of artists who, you know, maybe emerged in the last six to 12 months or something. I think for me personally, I did find it somewhat surprising that he was checking. I don't know, you always imagine him like cloistered away in his bunker in Cornwall or something. with absolutely no eyes on the scene. And you're like, oh shit, he's playing like Chino Amobi or he's playing like Lorenzo Senni or something. Yeah, this is it. Like, um... I was reading a Pitchfork interview that Aphex Twin had done with Philip Sherburn, I think it was published in 2014, and Philip had sort of asked him this question about, you know, I think it was something along the lines of, do you miss having this dialogue with Jungle that you used to have in the 90s? And he said yes, because what's replaced, I guess, that... the scene to which Aphex Twin was sort of talking to and responding to has now been replaced in Aphex's sort of, I'm paraphrasing here, by the kind of big blob of internet where the scenes are very ill-defined and often inseparable, or inseparable to some extent. And I guess... what that I guess the variety of the music he was playing in a set spoke to the fact that he's I guess engaging with this with this new world and coming to terms with it and As you say, he played a Chino Amobi track. He played Shapes Noise. But he was also playing a lot of Apex tracks, both old and new. He played at least one track from the EP that he released that day pretty early on, the B1, which I think is actually really, really good. and the, you know, like a Polygon Window record and I think it was Audax Powder or something like that. And there, yeah, as you say, there was just a lot of like new and vital seeming music that was being mixed in amongst all this and it all made sense. And I think the kind of... cohesiveness of all this music was just really impressive. Did you come away from the performance feeling like it lived up to the hype? Yeah, I had, yeah. Because... I think for some people, I don't think any Aphex Twin performance will be good enough because it's obviously an artist who inspires so much strong opinion. And I think for lots of types of Aphex Twin fans, there will always be one record or one gig that will never be surpassed because obviously these things just provoke really strong emotions. entirely understandable. I think for me what I was thinking, I wasn't only thinking of my experience during that gig, I was kind of thinking of like, you know, younger guys who either, or indeed girls, who have either only had a casual understanding of Aphex Twin music or just come in and been curious about what this what this weird logo artist was and had sort of, you know, I'd imagine that some of them would have hated it and left, but maybe other people would have actually really stuck with it and found it pretty transformative. And I'm quite envious of being young and not really knowing very much about this sort of thing. And the idea of being blown away by that was like really... really excites me for both them and like a younger version of me so I think that I think I'm not only thinking in terms of my experience and whether it met up to my expectations but also other people who may not have had any at all and been sort of really surprised by it. Thank you. Martha, let's move on and talk about your selection. You've gone for Proc Fiscal in general or Proc Fiscal's EP release? Proc Fiscal in general, maybe, just because I only found out about him this year. But yeah, he's a Scottish grime producer and he released his Highland Moral. LBP with Hyperdub and I actually found this guy like 2am on a Wednesday at studios for the Hyperdub night which is monthly at Corsica. Which is kind of becoming a bit of a thing at this point isn't it? Yeah it's a massive thing for me I've been to like nearly every single one and it's just like a really special it feels like a thing when you go there. and people from the first parties talk to you at the next one, it's like, oh, you're at the first one? And to me, that's the feeling of a little community growing, which is really cool. And the programming is always amazing and surprising as well. So I haven't made it to one yet, but it's the case that they're doing the more visual orientated stuff in the first room and then all of the music's in the second room. Yeah, room one is an art installation, some sort of visual art. Like they had for Iconica's EP launch, they had Mungo doing the visuals in room one and then just music straight through in room two. And the sound is amazing in room two. So no matter where you're standing, in Corsica in Room 2, you're going to have a good time, basically. And yeah, this is the party that Bjork played that everyone was very excited about. Which was really, really good. I was there lurking. She started off with thunder sounds and five minutes of birds tweeting. So I was pretty left. I was pretty into it. But yeah, for this particular night, I was watching Kisi play her set, which was really great. I'm a big fan of hers. And then her set ended. I was like, well, it should be sensible. Should go home. It is Wednesday after all. But then this guy came on the decks and I was actually blown away from the first track. I was like, what is this? What is it? And it's just really hyperactive. His kind of take on grime is just really fresh and really exciting. I really like him. Be what you wanna be. And Ray, you told me about what his name actually means, Scottish thing. Yeah, exactly. So at the end of, I remember just watching Scottish television news and it would be whenever there was a little segment about a crime report, there would be a little line at the end of this thing without fail that was like, a report has been submitted to the Procurator Fiscal. And when I read about this, when I first found out about this record by Proc Fiscal, I kind of put two and two together and I was like, ah, Proc Fiscal, Procurator Fiscal. Yeah, so that's basically a Procurator Fiscalism. You know, I think I need to get a lawyer friend at this point to explain this properly. But essentially, it's like this figure who kind of acts as a liaison, I think, between the courts and the police. He's like a public prosecutor who I think sort of... looks into uh you know deaths and uh various other types of crime yeah well after you told me that i dm'd prop fiscal on instagram and said is that where you get your name from he was like yeah i just saw it on tv thought it sounded cool so you were right there we go But I'm hearing words like death tied up in this name, but musically speaking, I mean, the idea of death is very far from my mind when I'm listening to this stuff. It's really high energy and sounds really good. and I started playing because I do a show on Radar Radio and I started playing a track and there's like the ultimate compliment at Radar is basically if you're playing a song and people like burst in like what is this and that happened when I was playing one of his songs so That's how you know he's good. And do we know anything about the idea that there might be some sort of stirrings of a grime scene in Scotland? I mean, it strikes me as the sort of thing that's like catnip to journalists. You know, everyone really likes the idea. It's like, oh, yeah, grime in Scotland. But have you come across other producers? Not so much producers, but... There is Ransom FA is like an MC and Chrissie Grimes as well as an MC and they have like a little thing going which is really, really exciting. The accent is super strong. It's really good to hear it spreading all over the country. I really like it. Yeah, I mean I was doing some digging. There was a compilation on a label called Plasma Abuse, this Overdose compilation. I guess that was one of the first things that Proc Fiscal released with. seem to be all Scottish artists but I'm not going to claim any like you know weight of understanding or authority on this yeah no it's interesting I'm very excited to hear more that's it for this month's show thank you for listening Join us next month when we'll be looking into the art of DJs opening tracks.
