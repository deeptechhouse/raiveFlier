so Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists labels and promoters that are shaping electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch and I'm the associate editor of Resident Advisor. When it comes to record stores, Berlin is special. Some 20 years since vinyl died as a mainstream format, records still sell like crazy across the German capital. In most cities, record stores are shutting down. In Berlin, new ones are opening up. These shops are respected around the world, but they're also staples of their community, a place where like-minded people meet in person, something that's increasingly rare in the age of discogs and social media. But more importantly, they're completely on top of their game. In Berlin, record shops still have better music than pretty much anyone else. During Bermuda Conference earlier this month, I talked about Berlin's vinyl culture with four people who know it most, Tinko from Oya, Fanny Johansson from Block, Etienne Delta from Bass Cadet, and Christian Ponenberg from Record Loft. *music* Hey everybody, thanks for coming. I'm Will Lynch, I'm the associate editor of Resident Advisor and this panel is called Vinyl City: A Look at Berlin's Record Store Culture. So it's kind of needless to say, record shops in Berlin are a pretty distinct cultural phenomenon. Every city has record stores, but they're usually a very specialized kind of thing. Sometimes even more like a novelty or something. In Berlin, it's quite second nature. Loads of people have record collections. records are still almost like a mainstream commercial product. And I guess one of the most interesting things is in other cities, record stores are dying or they keep closing, including other cities in Germany. And here, there are actually new ones opening up. Which is funny, at some point in the past year or two it occurred to me that I had this idea that the current crop of record stores was probably the last one. That to start a new record shop today you'd have to be kind of crazy or kind of quixotic. But in fact, this year in Berlin there were at least three new ones. Some of them represented here. And they seem to be doing pretty well for themselves. So I guess I want to basically talk shop about how this business works, how the kind of industry, you know, for lack of a better term, works and maybe muse a little bit on why Berlin, why records, like what is the relationship between these two things? So I guess I'll start by sort of letting everyone introduce themselves. We'll just go down the table. Hello, so I'm Etienne from Base Cadet Records. We just opened like four months ago, so talking about new, that's it. And yeah, we got a selection of new records and second-hand records. And yeah, hopefully it's going pretty well. Hello, I'm Finn Johansen. I work at Hardwax. So we're not that new. The shop opened in 89 and I'm a buyer there. Hi, I'm Tinko. I'm from Oje Records and we're kind of middle-aged. So we're turning 11 years now. open a new shop and yeah in the heart of Prenzlauer Berg and the new one is here around there in Neukölln and yeah I'm manager there buyer too and yeah no I'm Christian I'm doing some kind of place called the Wreck-It Loft I kind of I have been a record soldier for a couple of years searching and at some point it was just time to open something and yeah it's an adventure we we had at least yeah we had one year where we were operating from a little office somewhere around Meringdam then for a month of hardcore refurbishing the place and now we are open for like three, four months and I have to say that I mean, I made some assumptions but really I think records is kind of interesting for the people again. And yeah, it's kind of the digital thing is over. It is. Okay, I guess I'll start with the new guys. Etienne, can you just give me a quick rundown on how the shop started, how the shop works, how did you first have the idea to start a shop? So actually, for the people who don't come to the shop already, we are a two-headed shop. It's a record shop on one hand and on the other hand it's vintage clothes. So I made the record shop with my good friend Laura. And it's an idea we had one year ago and we had the opportunity to make it really quick and pretty much easily. And we thought it would have been much harder to make but actually it was. Yeah, pretty... lots of work, but straight to do. And yeah, so far we're doing good. And being new, it's... yeah, it's got... I mean, it's pretty hard to get into the ballgame of the record. But it's exciting. So you moved here three years ago from France. Do you think it would have been possible to do a similar thing back home? Would you have thought to open a shop like this in your home city? No. I was living in Paris before for four years and that never went to my mind to set up a record shop or even a shop because... prices there are really really expensive for the rent and when you want to sell a company it's pretty much harder than here in Berlin for much reason and yeah when we had this idea popping up it was my friend coming from France to Berlin settling here and we just thought about it and then it came naturally so I think it was way better away easier making it here and for the record store obviously also like it's really as you say like a city with vinyl culture so it was more natural to make it here than way back in Paris or elsewhere And were you worried at all about jumping into a crowded market? Yeah, I think it's a good thing to have such a competition and loads of records. I mean, for the prices, for yourself wanting to be pertinent and going to the points. I mean, it's pretty good. Christian, I guess I sort of just want to get a basic rundown on what is actually going on with Record Lofts. Is it right to say it's an unlicensed shop? No, no, I'm paying tax. Okay. No, no, no, for me it was just I'm a bit like allergic for all this, yeah, I don't know, like... pinpointing marketing approach and creating a very tight image and for me personally it's the records it's the music it's people that want to find out and I think that is the edge that you can have where you are a little bit before Discogs and before all this digital kind of commerce that people want to find out. And there is so much music out there that... I mean, maybe Finn knows everything, but for a lot of people, you can create a place where they can still kind of amaze themselves, find something, you know, like make it your own. I think that is a very, very, how do you say? It's like, I don't know, especially for DJs, because this is what I wanted to say. We are all catering to DJs. We are not catering to the kind of crowd rock collector or Rolling Stone. guy, you know. And those record shops are out there, but they are not doing good, you know. This kind of scene is dying everywhere. It's also dying in Berlin. We are only happy or in the lucky situation that we are in, like, we have spawned something in a vibrant scene. But for me personally, I think... Yeah, it's, I see, like, yeah, I don't want to tell too many anecdotes, but there's people that really, yeah, that... first-timers and people that kind of go out with the, how do you say, glaze in their eyes. And that is what actually is driving me. You mean customers at Record Loft? Yeah, yeah. Like people spending hours. And I know some shops have a policy that you are not able to listen to more than 10 records. I actually think I just have to have more record players for the people. Maybe I end up, I have to shop as record players, but that's part of it and part of the beauty. And I think there's so much, like dance music is such a diverse genre that there are like... there is so much stuff available and it just needs for the people to find out and I think that is also the speciality about a place like Berlin that the people are not just utilizing music but they want to kind of dive into it and have Less pressure. DJs in other metropoles, they just need to deliver. And that drives you into being very efficiency-minded also. Yeah, I read an interview you did where you dropped the statistic that 20 to 25% of house and techno being sold over the counter occurs in Berlin. I mean, seriously, if you... We could... I don't know if this is too private, but I mean, we could just say if you guys all want to spill the numbers, we can make like an assumption about it of a 500 records release in the end and maybe 125 sell in Berlin, and that's 25%, you know. And of course, that also tells you about the state of... dance music at the moment. Of course, and the other thing is I can totally understand people that want to buy digital. There's nothing bad in it. When you live somewhere where they don't even have record players at the club, why would you buy vinyl? Yeah, actually, I thought before it's... I guess it was obviously connected to the record store culture. But out of any city I've ever been to, in Berlin, it's probably the most unusual. to see a laptop in a DJ booth. It was, you know, fairly interesting. There's blogs about it. There's what? There's blogs about it. DJs looking at laptops. I love it. Yeah, I guess that sort of reminds me of something else that I think sort of the power that vinyl records have, you know, in the face of obviously... digital formats can seem a lot more practical and everything, but records still have this level of authenticity to the extent that DJs looking at laptops would be something you might make fun of with a blog or whatever. but you wouldn't make fun of DJs playing records? It's not the DJs that you make fun of but just like the kind of stare in their eyes, you know? I mean, it's the same like people looking on their phone or watching TV or you know, you don't want to see like a performer. club going like watching on it you know that's just but I think it's more the haptic thing it's like you a record is something that you can actually own you know that you can have in your I mean I mean when you move then you realize how much it is but I think in the end you know you have a haptic thing and I remember when the internet came up I was collecting jpegs I was downloading pictures of these kind of things that were amazing me, still on a dial-up connection. And I was thinking, yeah, and this is a collection, and I have all these amazing JPEGs. In the end, you don't own anything. And then your hard drive crashes, and then all of a sudden you realize, oh, where's my backup? So with the racket, and it's the same with clothes, it's the same with... I think that is really something that I'm very concerned about, that all the digital things are nothing that you possess. And in the hunter and gatherer kind of nature of humankind, you want to build something like a collection, whatever it is. If it's rackets, if it's cars, if it's clothes, if it's something... you want to own something. You don't want to sleep on a digital couch. You know what I mean? Tinko, so OE has been around for about 11 years, right? You just had the 11th anniversary at Renata. So what brought on the decision to open up the second location? First thing is that the gentrification in Prenzlauer Berg is going on and a lot of people, a lot of customers have moved to Neukölln and Prenzlauer Berg and they're so lazy to drive the 30 minutes to Prenzlauer Berg. So, no, yes, this is one reason. So we have a neighborhood there. Also, Markus, who is the main part of the new shop, is living five minutes from there, so maybe this is also a reason why we opened the shop. And also, I mean, sometimes a couple of months ago it was so busy. in the old shop that we, I mean, the people had to wait sometimes 15, 20 minutes to get to a record player and we are limited in space and could not offer more record players to listen to music so this is also one. one reason and yeah we have we have the structures of I don't know connections to all the distributors and why not open another shop somewhere else Finn I think you know for me the most interesting thing about Hardwax is how it sort of achieved this pop culture status or like I was noticing recently I saw on a map, like a totally basic map of Berlin that tourists get, that hard wax is one of the locations that sort of is noted. Like there's a little dot and it says hard wax, just as if this is a mainstream tourist attraction. And it's interesting to me because in the end, what hard wax sells is not really... It's a fairly niched product, strange techno white labels, dubbed seven inches and stuff. This isn't the kind of thing that you would normally show to tourists looking to see the sights in Berlin. Why do you think it is that hard wax in particular is kind of so fetishized or has such an aura surrounding it? I think the main reason for it is that the shop was there importing all that stuff when nobody else was doing it. I mean, I'm only living in Berlin for 12 years, so the back stock of my collection of electronic music I didn't buy in Berlin. I bought them all in Hamburg and other cities. And there were stores in Hamburg, for example, that were even older than Hardwick's. But they all died. they're all gone and there was this kind of you know in the beginning Mark Ernestos the owner of the store he personally traveled to American cities making direct contact with the labels importing the stuff buying the stuff directly So there were lots of really long-lasting connections and friendships and collaborations established. And this kind of, you know, had a really, it just made wider and wider circles. So a lot of people internationally feel some kind of connection to it, not only because of the store, but also because of the labels surrounding it. the few labels we distribute and some of that was really important so made some impact and the other thing is that I think at some point it kind of develops own dynamics so the more entries you have in some tourist guides then it's just there and you cannot really influence it i mean we have people like sometimes we have this feeling there's there's a bus a coach parking outside in the yard drops off like 20 young kids and they enter the store and they haven't even played a record in their whole life. I mean, they just enter the store because they feel they have to see it and then they even take some records and stand in front of the deck and... Usually my colleague Pete walks over to them and says, can I show you how to play this record? I can tell you never did it. And they're like, oh yeah, thanks. And yeah, it's kind of moving and frightening at the same time, I think. But yeah, you have to keep in mind that... There are a lot of tourists, they're only there because they think it's an attraction. And of course they're like a minority. Most of the tourists come to the store because they just want to enter the temple or whatever. I mean, there's a lot of people who like... a pretty big mail order we ship worldwide which is like it's like a 50 50 percent mail order 50 store business and so there are lots of customers tourists who come to the city and they were like they were ordering per mail for years and they, you know, save up money and say like, whenever there will be some time I go to Berlin and then I come to the store personally. I mean, we get a lot of emails from people who are regular customers and they say like, next week I'm coming over. looking forward to meet you in person or whatever. So it's kind of really, it's really personal in a way. Yeah. Sorry, you want to say something? But Finn, Finn, I know you are a shy guy, but please, can you just draw us a line of the people that have worked at Hardwax and how it was like incubating all of what is now and what has been techno? I mean, I want to know about DJ Hell working at Hardwax. I want to know about Cassie working at Hardwax. Massadetman. Soundstream. How could I forget that? No, I mean, but that's serious business, you know. I mean, it means that talent was always emerging from hardwags. Yeah, I mean, there were lots of now famous or well-paid traveling jet set DJs who started working. Good DJs. Good DJs too? Of course. I mean, I can't really tell much about... DJ Hull, for example, because I think he only worked there for like two weeks. He got a lot of good records in that time, I'm pretty sure. I heard his collection is amazing. Yeah, but I don't know how well that is connected to hard works. But yeah, there were quite a lot of people working on hard works. Lots of... Panorama Bar, Berghain Residence, Gernot of Mode Selector worked at Hardworks, Shed worked at Hardworks, Marcel Detman, Prosumer, Cassie, Electric Indigo. I mean, even now there are well-known people still working at Hardworks, like Sleep Archives. Finn Johansen. Yeah, whatever. Pete. Torsten T++ is a main buyer at the store, even if he's not producing anymore. So it's always like, I don't know if you can call it a hotbed of the international techno scene, but... there are some connections. That kind of brings me to something else I want to talk about. Strangely enough, Finn and I were on another panel last night. I forget if it was you or Nick Kulpner, but somebody mentioned the fact that record stores traditionally... played the role of being this community center, like a hub of the community, which is kind of changing. In a way, they still are, of course, but it isn't quite the high-fidelity vibe of everybody standing around telling each other about new music. Maybe it is at Record Loft, but in general, I think even though the shops are still doing business and they're still doing well, the purpose they serve is sort of changing over time. So I was curious what you guys think that the kind of new thing that record stores offer really is. I think a lot of like how much the record store is a hub nowadays depends of how Hot the records you get in per week are so you know you can notice a hop if you get in some records that everybody wants because around these times all of the people are coming down because we have like this policy we only leave a record online for a bit and if there's only like 20, 30 copies left we put it offline and keep the rest for the people who actually come down to the store to get it because I think it's just a matter of respect. And that's one thing. So we just noticed that on days where like two or three new records and they're maybe not that wanted or whatever, then it can be quieter too. And the other thing that is really working against this tradition of the record store being in a hub, a social meeting. point is of course social media I mean over the years there were lots of people meeting at the store doing like yeah making connections preparing some collaborations and now they do it on Facebook that's of course a real difference but still I mean, I think it's just a matter of logistics. If you're a DJ and you're booked in Berlin and you visit the city, and of course you probably know like five or six people. you want to meet. There's not that many options you can do it. You can, of course, have a nice dinner together, but meeting five or six people at the club and talking things over is not really feasible. So it's either a restaurant or you can also meet at the record store. And I think it's... It's a very, very traditional thing and that's still going on. I mean, every weekend we have lots of DJs coming in with bags and trolleys, dropping off and doing some digging. And that's not a real matter of how... How legendary or well-known or famous you are as a DJ? It's just I think for a DJ. It's just a natural thing to do Yeah, it kind of reminds me actually so I was at ade recently and every time I've been to ade It's interesting how like you know the purpose the whole thing is networking to some extent but the conference itself feels very contrived, and any conversation that I would have there just feels a little bit unnatural. But then pretty much every day at rush hour, there's an extremely natural alternative going on. Because everybody is drunk. Could be. But seriously, what I want to say is every fucking scene has to have these integral points. And I really believe in that. And I think that it becomes more and more interesting these kind of places, like the record shop, like the graffiti shop, like the skate shop, like all these little things. these niches, these pouches, cultural pouches. I think that... especially in these kind of days of transparent social media and email and blah blah blah, it also means that you are not facing some kind of natural person, you're facing some kind of profile, you're facing some kind of information that's purposely put on there to be transparent to you or suggesting that it is transparent and not meaningful or thought through. But then meeting people in person really tells you what's going on with them. them and I don't know, such a big part of communication is through body language and through things that, you know, haircuts, shoes, whatever. You can tell more about a person, you know, in life and I think that's why these places have to exist and that's all. also why these places kind of thrive because all of a sudden you have this feeling back. All of a sudden you're not like sitting on your computer all day and just like exchanging information with people you never met. It's like a little bit of, I don't know, bad breath. No, I mean, just... Just to step on, like, this is one of the reasons we did the record shop, and this shop is, like, having some place where people can gather and just, I mean, fight against social media and stuff, like, you come together, you gather around something that's not digital, but physical, and then... create a culture and get together. I think it's really important in the fact that you go to record store now. And it's also important, I think, for people who are not well-known, for the usual customer, to see all these famous DJs face-to-face in a record shop and see, oh, this is a natural person too. And I can maybe also talk to him and get some tips from them. Definitely a big point also for the generation of new buyers, of new people who are interested in records. You cannot have this on Beatport or so. Definitely. I didn't want to... I was hesitating to tell, but actually... And this is really the point, and this is also... For me this was an amazing moment. Yesterday evening I couldn't go home. because there was Nina Kravitz looking through boxes of records and there was like one random Italian 20 year old guy who looked, you know how the people look in Bologna, a little bit alternative kind of, and you could tell that he's like buying, he's still at his first 100, 150 records. We were talking to him, he was like, no. I can't really play this sound in Italy, the clubs are different, da da da da da. And at the end, you know, he had like a bunch of records and it was like something like 25 euros in records. and everything was closed. I'm like, back, back, backyard. So it would have been really complicated to get him to the cash machine. And Nina Kravitz was like, how much do you owe the guy? And he's like, 25. And she's like, okay, I'm going to do it for you. And you wouldn't have imagined the kind of look on his face. I mean, I could tell that part of him staying there was the... the aura of Nina Kravitz. But the other thing is she saw it in him. She saw something where there's a new record soldier and a new techno soldier and she just completely... That guy had serious dreams that night. That guy... is coming back to any kind of record shop in the next years and that guy is gonna dance his ass off at Panorama Bar or whatever and that's how you, you know, that's what people understand or some of them understand, you know, and that is what comes from the record shop and doesn't come in a fucking paper box from Discogs, you know. That is the real difference and I personally think that every DJ, every musician... No, musician not, but DJ needs these kind of experience to kind of, you know, play music with a meaning. There's these things about like, there's a message in the music, but if you just get the message in a brown paper box, it means that... you know, there's no emotions surrounded by it and that's what you actually get. Who would shop clothes online, you know? I mean, I wouldn't. Maybe you do. Yeah, this is not only a thing for other famous customers, maybe it's also... a task for us as record shop dealers and for sellers to to to support these people i often we had people annoying us with questions like what kind of record player do i have to buy me and so the stupid basic questions what But everybody needs an answer to this in the beginning. And when you treat these people good, they will come back. Maybe not everyone, but this is exactly what you said. They need this experience to be guided also. This is this is one point and then the other point what what is especially got value for me is The employees we we have I mean when I was 16 I had my I had to do a traineeship during school time and I did it at, maybe you remember, WOM, World of Music, so a big music chain what dies already. I did this and this was for me my start into the idea to have maybe sometimes an own record shop. And so we're doing the same. We have often 15, 16 year old guys to do a traineeship in the shop. For me, this is very, very important to connect these people to vinyl and to have also new customers in the future. I mean, it's not only this person. his friends and what he's what he gots and he tells about yeah I'm working now at OE records or so and getting this record and he shows to his friends and these friends are infected too so this is yeah for me a good point to I have to work on also on the on the future thing too to raise the new generation of record buyers too. I think I'm kind of a bit bored of these, like telling some anecdotes about... some famous DJ coming to shop, what did he buy, how he behaved or whatever, was he nice, was he arrogant, blah, blah, blah. That's not really important. What is really important are the regular customers who come to the store because they come like a few times a week and not like every few months. In that aspect, what we can really observe is that it's really changing the people who come to the store to buy records on a regular basis because years ago it was mainly like... male, young, very nerdy, very interested probably. And now we have lots of girls coming to the store buying records, for example, which is something I really like. I think it's very important that it's not just like a boy thing. It's very, you know, it's kind of a dead end in a way. So when people move on, there's nothing left. So that's important. I mean, we had, for example, we had like a customer who came to our store and he was really young. The first time he came to our store, he... came with his father and was like a school kid and just buying his first few records at the store. I can't remember what it was, but it was probably something he read about which was played at Berghain or whatever. And then he started coming more regularly and you could really see that evolving. The stuff he bought, the amount he bought. And then, you know, at some point he didn't come with his father anymore, he came on his own. Then a few weeks after he brought some friends. Then, you know, you could really, each time he came to the store, the stuff he bought was becoming different. You could see him digging deeper. and you could see his taste in music evolving and then he bought his first DJ trolley and you know, sky's the limit, you know, whatever. But yeah, that's what Tinker was saying. really important that you don't resign on what you achieved as a record so you have to keep moving. Yeah, I can tell exactly the same and sometimes I'm also a little bit proud of these people and of the education maybe I was part of it. When you have a customer over a year and you see him evolving and progressing and so on, yeah, what kind of guy is made out of him? Cool, great. Now maybe he's producing his own records. We have people like this who we accompanied for a couple of years and now they come to the shop and, hey, we have this first record self-made and so can you maybe put it out here? yeah, why not? If it's a good record, cool. And yeah, I'm sometimes really proud of these people. Yeah, I guess to sort of give a more like customer perspective, you know, or sort of the reason why people keep coming back to the shops and everything is... To me, it's sort of interesting how sort of as a music critic, as a person that just likes buying records and stuff, going to a record store is a lot less... sentimental of a choice than maybe someone outside this culture might imagine. I don't know, like a year ago, somebody asked me just how I'd find out about new music. And my email inbox is kind of like a war zone of promos. And I have like a RSS feed with every blog. And I'm sort of geared up to receive all music-related information. But the best music that I hear about comes from just looking through the bins at record stores. And it's sort of interesting to me, like, you know, why is that the case? Like, how is it that this sort of oldest, you know, format is still the most effective in terms of, you know, bringing you something interesting that is... not yet hyped up, isn't part of the PR circuit or whatever. Because if it wasn't for that, your customers would only be kind of old-fashioned. you know, like people looking for novelty items, but it's very much not the case. I mean, you're dishing out some of the best music that's available before anyone else knows about it. Yeah, I think that's actually the main point. I mean, I used to work as a music journalist too, so I know this promo avalanche landing on your inbox every day. And the biggest problem about it is it's no filter. It just lands, everything there is lands in your inbox. Do whatever you want with it. So most of it you delete or you have no, you don't have the time to listen to it all. It's just suffocating. And one of the, I think one of the main... Main things about record stores, why they're still important is they serve as a filter. The buyers of the record stores, they try to divide the music that is really worth purchasing and keeping from the stuff that's only put out to... get some gigs for the producers or whatever. I mean, there's so much music out there that it's not really, not trying to say something. It's just like, yeah, it's just a business. People, nowadays, you earn less and less with producing music, so you have to get gigs in order to survive as an artist, maybe. in that sense. So a lot of people just cling to whatever is trendy and don't invest too much of an own signature or own ideas into it. And all this mediocre stuff that's just... just tools and it's just functional. The record shop buyer can sort it out. So the people who come into the store, they don't have to wait through all that to get the good things. So I think that's why you end up in a record store and you found the good things in a bin. Because, you know, there's just a bigger chance that a lot of records you listen to are worth buying then. And I think also what you said about your inbox being totally full, it means that the good stuff is not produced by the guys who are really eager. I mean, nowadays, I would say that, let's say, big commercial success comes with... being adaptable in the most easy way to a most not specified crowd, you know? Like, what is shallow kind of... reaches more people. That's how products have evolved the last 10, 20 years, by becoming less edgy, you know? And the guys who make the interesting music are the guys who spend all of their time making the music and not promoting themselves. And all of a sudden, I mean, there's this phrase or this term coined... Called outsider house, you know, like where does it come from from people who live in a small? Village and who are like totally depressed about their surrounding and this kind of energy they they just gather into making their music and There's a very strong emotional energy coming from the music which is maybe in some cases negative energy but that is the interesting part and it's not like mainstream guys making all of the same hi-hats the other thing about and that's what you said about the bins you know, like from you as a customer or as a record buyer, you know, there is more to the record than just the music on it. If you shop digital, if you are listening to promos or whatever, the only reference you have is like the actual sound file. While when you're in the shop and you're flipping records, it also means you have a haptical approach. You're kind of like, okay, this feels right. Let's listen to it. It's the whole thing. It's like how the record is pressed. It's not just something that's sitting there or being just a little picture of the middle of the record. And I think that it's the same like communication. There is so much more to a record than just like the file itself. Plus, do you think you can manage to get in a state of mind where you are like open? to what you hear when you're sitting in front of your laptop flipping through Beatport? I don't think so. You're still in your own kitchen or in your living room or at your desk just like, oh, I've got like 20 minutes off. I'm just like flipping a little bit on Beatport. If you go to a record shop, you at least spend 10 to 15 minutes to get there and you're like, wow, now it's time to kind of like... lose everything else and now it's music mode and I'm open for it. And I think that is the real thing that you're like, okay, my ears are opening, now it's time to kind of let everything go. Maybe you're hungry, you forget about it. Just really some kind of mode that you can concentrate on. And then, of course, you can find it. You cannot find it between a piss and a coffee. Yeah, I agree with Christian about that. Like the customer, I mean, we act as a filter, but the customer himself acts as a filter. When he gets into the shop, I mean... when they are bitports, you know, at the same time, there used to be this rapid share blogs that just popped up and you could like kind of get every tech house release and the kind of release Christian talked about. And Russian torrent. Like for free and like you have your hard drive with like loads and loads and loads of files and just what you do with that, nothing, you know. And the customer, I think he features himself. because he goes to the record shop and then he has to pick up the records from the bin and then listen to every record and then he hasn't like ended up open-ended wallet you know so he has to choose and pick up and so actually i think it was like it's um the the record store as the customer that works as a filter so yeah that's what the medium still is pertinent so
