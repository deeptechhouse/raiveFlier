Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Watergate is one of the best-known clubs in the world. Celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, the Berlin-based space is renowned for its stellar location on the River Spree, its stunning lights, it was among the first to put LEDs on the ceiling, and its top-shelf house and techno programming. It was never a sure thing, however. As Uli von Bacher, the club's main booker, explains, 10 years ago, the neighborhood that Watergate opened in, Kreuzberg, was a clubbing dead zone. I sat down with him earlier this month to discuss its rise to prominence and the imminent threat of a rate hike by German collections agency Gemma at RA's Berlin HQ. - How long has Watergate been running now? - Exactly 10 years. - Exactly 10 years. - Exactly 10 years, yeah. - Did you think 10 years ago that you would be here still running this club? - No, not, honestly, like 10 years ago was, everything was so different. I didn't even think I would do like. bookings and club management in the first place. When we first started I was still into DJing, thinking of an artist career, but the more the club developed the more I got into the whole organization and And since I was doing drum and bass, drum and bass slowly faded out in like the German or Berlin music scene. So I made this kind of transition to working in the background. And I actually like it now. German bass was quite big in the 90s. Yeah, it was big everywhere, I think. But it never really made the step forward into some kind of... in economically healthy music business. In Berlin? In Berlin, of course, yeah. And I doubt it ever did in the UK. There's just a few people that can actually live from it. So when you grow older, you need to feed your family and then you can't live from it. from the beat really you seem to be living from now I do yes yes we were pretty successful with with uh with drum and bass parties when we like the team of Watergate which is uh um stoffel nicholas myself and all the other employees like lots of them were involved in in our drum and bass history which we had back in the 90s we threw parties uh in like warehouse locations underground clubs stoffel was even running one of those underground clubs called toaster in berlin that's only 25 years now and um then we but we were always renting into other locations you know so we never had our own space we could never like really plan on things you know plan in the future and um we had this residency at wmf club which was like pretty big in one of the biggest clubs in berlin in the 90s and we decided to When they closed or they once again moved on to another location, we decided to quit and to start our own club. Tell me about WMF. It seems like a lot of people talk about it in hollow terms in the 90s. Also gets forgotten, I think, nowadays. You know, everyone talks about Trezor and Burkine and this. But I think for a lot of actual... Yeah, WMF is like... I don't know. It's difficult. I think it's like the second generation. club like it's not like the e-work or like the trezor you know but it came a bit later i had more focus on i in the very beginning was more focusing on like let's say more more funky more soulful stuff and they did the whole trip hop stuff and like the terra nova parties were there and um in the 90s they became kind of a of a leading club for me. They weren't so super strict in techno. They were very open musically. Was that important to you? Of course. Myself, I was raised on hip-hop and early house music. And when you have this kind of background... Like, I couldn't say Trezor was my initial experience like everyone else's. Like, the original Techno people are like, okay, I was in Trezor and then I got, like, into Techno. For me, the whole Techno thing in the very, very beginning was like a bunch of crazy, very, very badly dressed people going wild. And then I... initially had this thing with like standing in a club and listening to like really early hardcore breakbeat which was like the evolvement of like future hip-hop for me and this is where I got I got caught for electronic music You were dressed very sensibly, though. You were dressed very sensibly, though. You had a very good fashion sense all through the 90s. Me? Yeah. You said I was dressed ridiculously. Yeah, that was so just... I'm only exaggerating a bit to, you know, like techno and the whole ED, like EBM music, gothic people, like the techno people, it's like they either have this, you hardly find people that come from a strict hip hop background, you know? People listen to like gothic music, EBM music and industrial stuff. and then they tried to take that one. It's all about peer groups and how they get together. I was strongly related to hip-hop. So for me, it was a bit ridiculous, this kind of going wild in a dark room. Yeah, of course. In a dark room. Did you grow up in Berlin? I was, yeah. I was born in West Berlin. Steglitz. This was before the wall came down. Friedenau, yeah. That was before the wall came down. So my first club experience ever was at Kuhdam, Nürnberger Straße. This is where it really, really all started. But this was like normal discotheque kind of clubs. And then when the war came down, everyone started going to the east, exploring the east a bit. What I really found impressive about the whole techno culture was that they seemed to be very... much forward thinking in terms of how to organize their parties just walk into some warehouse and put up a sound system you didn't have this with hip-hop really hip-hop was more like established at the time already it doesn't have this new thing to it you know and this is what got like lots of people into electronic music the whole setting of the music you know this kind of rotten warehouse atmosphere and very intense music and new lights, you know. It was just brand new for everyone. It must have been also strange, I guess, growing up in the West, all these people who were in... coming in, I guess. Although in the West, it was all of these misfits as well who were living there because they were trying to get out of military service, right? So there was already a cultural scene. Yeah, but I think I'm a bit too young to say. I was just raised, and I went to work when I was 16, and I was into 3D writing and that kind of stuff. trying to quit the military service. I wasn't like politically. But it was still an enormous moment. Of course, of course. It was a big change. It was like everything changed from that moment on. I used to live in Stieglitz. That was some kind of center of town. Now it's outskirts. You know, like everything suddenly started changing. That was the thing I always found interesting about the wall coming down is that it literally changed the conception of the city. Yeah, I think this is totally unique. You don't have this anywhere in the world. Having two cities developing separately from each other. We got two universities, we got two opera houses. Suddenly you have everything double. It's really funny. So when you said you were going out, you met Stefan. Oh, yes. Yeah, I was into, like, early hardcore drum and bass music and started DJing. And then we formed, like, how do you say, group, gang. of people that were somehow in the same vibe and Stoffel was part of it he was more like the background organizing person at the time and he had the toaster club and we did drum and bass parties moved on to WMF then and was Alec Empire part of this at all? yeah he was big at that time but he was doing the kind of digital hardcore recordings drum and bass right which was like totally different crew well he was pretty early he was his own interpretation of that sound something like really whereas I was more like trying to let's not say imitate the British thing but more Well, my focus was on the originators in the UK more than Alec Empire. How many different sort of like drum and bass? crews were there in Berlin would you say? Were there a lot of clubs for this stuff? At some point everyone was doing drum and bass you know even Ewerk were establishing a drum and bass night because it was just suddenly becoming like really big and was the new thing and it was very very refreshing but then very quickly the music didn't move on in the way people expected it to move on and the music didn't work in the way people were expecting it to work you didn't have uh well you had this typical drummer bass problem with having a party having its peak between two and four and then slowly fading out until six and then it's over because of course that has to do with the kind of culture that's behind it yeah it's it's not like people taking huge amounts of drugs that make you dance two days it's more like a weed thing and then people are like naturally going out home at some point and um also Like Berlin never had this kind of background that you have in London, for example. This kind of mixed race culture background. We don't have many black people over here that brought their culture. No Jamaicans. No real reggae scene in the way that London had it. So all those influences that Drum and Pace took from... weren't really existing here so it's something that you that we tried to put on top of of the scene but it's it worked really well you know i don't want to make it sound small we had like amazing parties but this is why it didn't continue yeah i think like after a few years like end of the 90s uh it just didn't continue and was uh we had a party series called hard-edged and we did collaborations with metalheads, hospital records, and we brought pretty much everyone that's important to the scene. And we had chemistry in Storm at the time when they were big. And so we were some kind of outpost for UK drum and bass artists. Everyone knew us, but... But with the music not really happening in the city, with not having the producers living in the city, not having the double-aid exchange every weekend, it's very difficult to keep a scene alive. And when drum and bass then musically developed into what it is today, like not very much happening in a musical way anymore, like very repetitive in its... in its form, you know, then it slowly died out over here. You didn't have the key figures anymore, you didn't have opinion leaders saying drum bass is the new thing, you didn't have the media writing about it, nobody was really taking care of the music and there was no key figures like... like those crews that were formed, they slowly died and didn't do it anymore or they turned their heads to other music and... So I find it interesting. I mean, I imagine around this time that this was happening, you were also opening up Watergate, right? Yeah, but don't get me wrong. I wasn't so much into drum and bass that I didn't have a focus on other music. Of course. I was working in a record shop at the time, which was hip-hop, drum and bass, house, techno. course i always had an eye for for other music as well you know and um that's why we could like open a club and everyone thought it was we were opening the a new drum and bass club which was doing drum and bass on friday saturday wednesday all i guess because you had this past Yeah, of course. In the promotion aspect. Yeah, of course. I didn't... I personally was a bit astonished at the time when people were thinking we were opening pure drum and bass club and I only then noticed how much I was connected as a person to that music for people. But our initial thought was doing Drum and Bass on a Friday, doing House on a Saturday, and with the two-floor concept of Watergate, mix this kind of music with... with reggae, hip-hop, soul, everything we like, really. Everything that we come from, musically, electronic music. At the time, we had good relations with Hard Rocks record shop, so they were doing the reggae night downstairs. We were focusing on... trying to present when we first opened Watergate pretty much everything that was musically important for us. But we very quickly found out that this is not what people expect when they go to a club. Let's go back for a tiny bit. I want to talk more about that though. Opening a club in Berlin, I guess. First off, the thing I find fascinating about Watergate is back when you opened it, the location seemed ridiculous to a lot of people because all the clubs were in Mita. Yes. And so people were like, oh, like, how can you open a club there? No one will ever go to it. Yeah, that was... Yeah, we had lots of talks about the location thing. And at this, when we opened, everyone was like, how can you open a club possibly in Koisberg? It was dead at the time. This corner was like, you'd never go there. I must say, we had this location scout that was one of the guys from WMF Club. He was the one who knew about all the locations, where to go, where you could rent a space for a limited time. I must say Stoffel was the visionary at that time in terms of location because his idea was to finally start a location that you don't have to move away from after two or three years, where you can invest money, where you can work on for the next 10 years. And this seemed to be possible there. which is funny today is it's very endangered because now it's the hotspot and all the media is going there and you've got the media spitting and we're like, you know, like the location is not so safe anymore. But at that time it seemed to be super safe because it was dead end. There was nobody going and we thought we can be loud in this space. And we also... for like the view is the view to the bridge the view to the water the whole location itself is is somehow a bit magic and um yeah i was a bit frightened of leaving Mitte at the time but Stoffel was very convinced it could work there. How long did it take I mean before you were convinced in terms of just the location and their neighborhood that wow this is something that's I mean, I immediately saw the possibilities in the space. This was very obvious. You had the two floors, you had the view, you had the bridge. Everything was like super nice, the club itself. But I was hoping to have it like... not in this area where nobody goes because you know, like all your friends say, oh, amazing, you're doing a club, but why are you doing this in dead end Kreuzberg? And it took a while and at first we weren't very successful with the club. I remember myself walking out of the club to the Oberbaumbrücke and you know this view over the bridge and I was standing there and I was seeing like couples. passing by the street like 100 meters away and I was like oh hopefully they're gonna enter the club and then they passed by the club and I was like oh shit you know this is hard to believe it's funny if you compare it to now I don't have to walk out the club because I know I'm gonna open the door and there's a queue and this is so this is like if you if you compare it to 10 years ago this is so this is the complete opposite you know and the old area has changed it's all somehow sometimes i'm saying we've been in the at the right time in the right spot and we you know sometimes you do say one thing right in your life you know like opening a club at a time when it wasn't very popular to open club there being the first one to do it and then finding out to because time changes in your in your direction in your you know to you to my how do you say to my um favor to my favor yeah Was the lighting system there on the top floor always there? No, no. That's something we brought late. At first we were, this is funny, at first we were, since we came from this drum and bass background, we were thinking of we need a space where we can like be really loud. We've got like super professional high pressure sound. And we were, you didn't have, upstairs you didn't have the view to the water because we closed the windows. We made it like a shoebox up there, you know. We wanted to have like pressure, dance, sweaty atmosphere. And I still remember, I think it was Atta from Playhouse who one day came and said, okay, what's behind these walls? Oh, there's windows. Well, you have to open it. Why are you not opening? You're being so stupid. You have to open them. And then, you know, like we were... If you've ever been to Robert Johnson, you can see why I'm saying that. Yeah, of course. Yeah. And we only slowly made our way to having the whole windows open. Then we opened little spaces so you could see through, but only in the ship. What's the name of it? Yeah, the porthole. Yeah. And then finally decided to make the step to just open the whole window. And at the same time, we changed the interior, the whole architecture of upstairs. We were thinking of... We had like a... We had like a really old school setting up there. You came in, you had the bar, then you had a wall, like almost building a bar in a separate room. And then you had the dance floor, which was separated from the bar. So you had the bar area, you had the DJ area, which was like very old school. Now we found we need to somehow connect the bar to the DJ booth. and make it one piece so people can have drinks, dance, communicate. It needs to be like one social space, not like the social space dance floor, social space bar, social space outside, like separated from each other. It all needs to like melt into one thing. Only then people can actually melt into like one big party, one big experience. And we had architects that we asked to develop an idea. And they developed the idea to build the bar and the DJ booth and then connect it by this, where we now have the LED ceiling built in. But the architectural idea is more like a connection of bar and DJ booth into this wooden thing that is around it. And then we only thought, okay, what are we going to build in there as a lightning? And then we met those people from the other side. the river that were experienced in making experiments and they're building their company with led lights and they came and they said okay you know what we could put the led lights up there and make it one big led ceiling which at this time seemed to be like super super crazy because nobody would ever do leds on the ceiling everyone at that time was doing led on the walls But you didn't put them on the ceiling and when we built them on the ceiling and it was literally literally like like when we first switched on the ceiling we were like okay this is gonna be like either super cool or it's gonna be super bullshit and I still remember when we first opened them again for after after changing the the main floor I already knew it's going to be amazing because I had seen it. But I was curious about how people like the new lights, you know. Everyone seemed to be like amazed, including myself. And I still like it. It's just a perfect setting up there, I think, in terms of... a club that is like second or third generation of Berlin Club still has an underground vibe to it but also went with the times and to new technology and you know how do you innovate with that structure in place I mean it's so watergate you know these lights I mean are you constantly getting in a new person to do different shapes and add things in terms of to the light ceiling yeah From the very beginning, we had a light jockey, a guy that took care of the lights because we knew when we seen it that we shouldn't use the LED in a kind of... Ibiza way like putting all the colors and making it look like like rainbow all the time you know so we thought like we should use it in a cool way and make it like don't use all of its functions more limited you know but that was at the time minimal music was also really big So we were thinking of making just black and white, black and white, red, red, black and white, you know, this kind of thing. And yeah, the light jackets, even now, still things of... Is it the same person, basically? It's been all the way through. It's been Baba. He's been our light jockey for ages, and he's literally been, he's the man of light at Watergate. But since he can't do every night, you can't be three times in the club. you'll die one day really early. I don't want to be responsible for this. So we thought of other people also doing the light. I mean, the light is, if someone is into light technology and you let him work with this LED ceiling. This is like a super opportunity because everyone's amazed and he can like actually work his whole movies on this, on the ceiling and, and, and, uh, and play them there, you know, his patterns and whatever they develop. When did the lights get added? Oh, difficult question. three four years after opening don't take my word for it it's funny 10 years yeah of course but still you you forget about things but it's been a big change to watergate at that time i took over the booking as well like one year earlier because at first i didn't do bookings i i was responsible for for the for the drum and bass parties and we had bookers employed at the time But I got involved in the whole structure, organization, management very early and then it was only like one more step to take over the whole booking thing. And then I left the drum and bass thing where I stepped back a bit at first and took over more bookings. then started getting sucked into the whole management thing, so I had to leave the drum bass thing, and I only did it as part-time. By that time, had they decided to streamline things in terms of the programming, or was that something that you brought in? I think for me it was pretty much a natural process, because I took over the management. Then we left the drum and bass thing. We said, okay, let's make the Fridays different. I tried to make Fridays a bit more funky and Saturdays a bit more techno. But then certainly from just by... when you get to know the business, how it works, how much money DJs get on Saturdays and how much they get on Fridays, you can't make rules and say, okay, I'm going to be funky on Fridays and I'm going to be techno on Saturdays and then you get like a superb techno DJ offered on a Friday and you just do him on a Friday and then you break your concept of being funky than you are of techno on a Friday suddenly and then the whole thing develops more and more into you. represent one style of music in the club and you have it going on a which is the main challenge i think on a constant quality you know you because what to get at some point we had like a super hype and we got like voted for i don't know eight best club in the world thing you know when the dj mcqueen burkheim got number one and spurlin was at the peak of its hype um We had this super hype, we could have done anything, you know, and people would queue up. But I think when you overcome the hype and then keep the quality, this is the main challenge for me now as a booker for Watergate. So how do you evolve it naturally? How do you move from minimal to deep house to whatever without? Well, the programming has always been... heavily influenced by my musical preferences. So I don't book music that I don't like, really. But I do not force people to dance to my taste of music because I like it so much. So I want to give like a... picture of what electronic music now dance music nowadays offers to people from techno to deep house you know they I've always been into all different styles of music, so it's pretty easy for me to program in different directions also. What's the philosophy on the Wednesday nights you do every single week, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday? Wednesday nights are where you're initially meant to be... smaller nights just one floor running and a bit more intimate a bit more cozy like having more Berliners there since we had this super heavy rush of tourists and people that were like Well, tourists. Of tourists coming to the club. People like me. We were looking for an opportunity to have our own following and our own crowd in the club. And also with the development of us and our artists, also our artists got bigger and they were all away on the weekends. So you hardly get to meet each other again. And then Wednesdays, nobody is overbooked or so. So you still have a high frequency of old friends, of label mates, of people that are your residents. coming to the club. This is how the Wednesdays were meant. And also a space where we can experiment with smaller artists. I don't need to bring all the big talent up. bring up-and-coming artists. And we very quickly found our way to new residencies of smaller labels. You mentioned earlier when Berlin was at the top of its hype. Do you think it's not as hyped anymore? It is still. It is still. But, you know, from as we... just said a few minutes ago like when i started it was not at all like this nobody would come to berlin and experience music we hardly had tourists you met 90 percent berliners on the parties and it's maybe still maybe they you never know where where it goes you know like maybe we're In the mainstream, we are now on the top of all European cities, I guess. Maybe we can go more mainstream tourist-wise, be more relevant in terms of city ratings. When did you notice that it was becoming something, a tourist destination, clubbing in Berlin? I don't know. It's just the whole process of Watergate is basically this development. So you're to blame? No, no, no, no. I don't think it's only the clubs that are to blame for the tourist thing. And I'm not at all someone that is against tourists. I'm totally happy. Because if you belong to the people that experienced promoting parties back in the days when you didn't have tourists. then you know how it is, how it can be when it's empty, you know? So I'm very happy, and we're happy to have... good people in the club like good tourists good like what I don't like personally is like people going on a stag tour to Berlin because alcohol is very cheap here and they're like expecting to get into Watergate and have a massive heavy drinking party but this is not what we're meant for and I don't think they should You know, this is the risks with becoming famous. You know, you've got like a big bunch of idiots also coming to the club. This is when you have to decide to not let as many people in as you could let in favour of a good party. It is obviously the risks of becoming famous. Yeah, I think it's a problem that we have, that Berghain has, that Chisor has, that Wigan has. Every club in town that is a bit more known. has these problems at the door. One of the interesting things, and I guess I wanted to touch on this, we made a film last year called Real Scenes Berlin. Yes. And one of the things that got cut that someone said, that you kind of touched on, is people don't realize how much the tourists make this economy possible. And they don't think about... the economy of how many people are working in these clubs and how many people make their living just by virtue of the fact that these places exist in Berlin. It's not something that's really brought up very much. It is an economy. It is now. It is now. It used to be... Working in the club scene used to be something for people that take big risks or people that want to make some money for their studies and then quit again and make a family, have a proper job, whatever. At least not for me. It wasn't clearly something that you... plan as your life plan, you know? And now you can, you could do it, yeah. I'm making my living purely from music, from club music, from making a club, promoting. On a, let's say, on a level that is nowadays more socially acceptable, I can... It simply said, I can now tell my parents I'm doing club and they would say, oh yeah, cool, proper job. I cannot say, I couldn't have told my parents 10 years ago, oh, I'm doing club. This is a proper job, believe me. They'd be like, club? What is this? Now they read it in the paper and they see the cues and they see. how the scene flourishes. I must say it's still, it's still not... accept it as much as it could be as a job. And it still has some strange... Well, it's the first generation of people who are figuring out how to do it as a job. So there's obviously going to be... Well, just look at the people from Hardwax, building a record store, forming labels and making their living. from a record store and living this electronic music life. Just look at Dimitri from Tresor, who makes a living from it very much earlier. Maybe this is only my view to it, because I personally have this impression that I can now live from it and I couldn't have... years ago for Dimitri must have been this must be imagine the third episode or so in his life what did what did we get wrong in the film or what did you you watched the film I assume um yes what was not an important point that wasn't brought up or covered in depth in your mind criticize me Difficult. I know how difficult it is to squeeze everything into this, into like a 10-minute format or 15-minute format. To be honest, I can't remember. How long is it? 15 minutes or so. Yeah, how long is it that you made the film? It's one year? One year, yeah. I think one of the things that we... had in our mind was, you know, we want to try to cover the fact that where this stuff came from, where it stands now and where it could be going. And that's so many different issues, especially in Berlin. Yeah. It's a very complex situation. One of the things that you brought up in the film that I found really interesting was. that it's very tricky when the city in some ways promotes the club scene as part of the city's appeal as like a tourist destination. But at the same time, won't help you in other ways. Yeah, this is the political aspect to it. And this is like a constant fight that we're having. I mean, there's always been... to say this is difficult in English well maybe for people who are not that familiar what you mentioned the media spree earlier what is that It's just a city's plan to develop the area in favor of people that are making financial investment in this area, which actually kills all the underground and kills all the scene, which is one day going to make everything move away. has actually made the area so interesting. Like simply said, it's like Mercedes Benz are building a big house and BMW are building a big house and like a big company builds its house there and then you've got different white collar workers going there every week. like, 9 to 5 job, and all the independent culture gets, like, pushed away. People that... You can't be having a party on a Thursday morning at 9 a.m. It's going to cause problems. It's going to cause problems. You know how it is. When this area becomes, you move into an area which is totally dead end, as we said, yeah? And then this area develops and flourishes. People that have flats and houses sell the houses for a better price. People with more money come. People with more money want to have a bit more quiet because they might have children in future. They want to have it more quiet, so they blame the clubs. So the clubs have to go away. So all the artists go away. So the whole area changes. And it's a bit like, I had the impression Soho in New York had kind of a similar development. You know, you have like everything is very well organized and you have like very... easy loft living but you don't have club life the spirit goes I think this is what they call gentrification I think that's the classic definition this is the classic yeah and um What you were referring to, what I said in the movie, is that we have a government that pretends to love the club scene so much and that pretends to be so much on our side, that pretends to be... moving things forward for the club scene but then comes up with the idea of like making a berlin music week and promote the club scene but as a as a medium to attract investors to come to town and these investors are the ones that are responsible for our for the fact that we have to leave one day. So I find it a bit like, I don't know, doppelzüngig. What's the word for doppelzüngig? You say something... Double speak. Double speak, you know? It means something different. But I think this is how it goes in politics. Is the club commission part of that organization? No, we're not. The club commission is a network to represent the clubs in town. I don't know how old they are. They are pretty old. They formed more than 10 years ago. And they are meant to represent the club scene for their... It must be tough with all of these different clubs and all of the different interests and different struggles. So it must be hard to form a coherent, here's what we want. Oh yeah, that's very difficult because, as you know, the clubs are very much run by individual people, like very special freaks. And you've got the Watergate freak, and you've got the Tresor freak, and you've got the Berkheim freak. they do club life for different intentions everyone has his own dream and vision of how things should go get all these people under one hat and try to organize them, very difficult. This is very difficult. And this is maybe our fate because we cannot be organized really in an economic way how you should be organized to get yourself a lobby in the politics and get yourself hurt out there. What have you been able to do? What we do, yeah, what we've done is we formed the Bermuda project with the Bradley Music Days thing. which is the idea of giving the city an independent series of music events run by independent clubs, totally independent in terms of money and fundings or so. We don't get any funding money from the city. And at the same time, keep our freedom. Because we can do whatever we want to do in our own music week. And we get the trust from the other clubs. And we get the trust. Are you doing things after that, like pooling statistics to be able to go to the... Statistics. Yeah, yeah, we do. To say like, here's the exact amount of people that came to the clubs during this weekend. Oh, yeah, we do. We try. We try to. Like last Bermuda, Watergate was very busy on four days. We did the Fly Bermuda Festival in Flughafen Tempelhof in the old airport, which holds like 10,000 people. Then we had weekend pretty busy. We had, Berghain was busy, I think. and Ritter Butzke was busy. Like all those clubs just take their capacity, multiply it, and then you have the amount of people that comes into town for clubbing. And that's easily, you easily get to like 50, 70,000 people then. Over the weekend. Over the week, yeah. Starting on a Wednesday until Sunday. I mean, we're doing workshops, daytime. We did the Debug Music Technique Target. We did a fashion event in the afternoons in Watergate. We did like lots of... little events that brought little amounts of people but This was our idea to establish something from ourselves, by ourselves, and keeping the independent spirit without selling our souls to people that actually want to work with us only to promote our ideas to the outside world as a... as something to pull people that invest money in the city for a totally different reason. Yeah. The other elephant in the room right now, I suppose, is Gemma. Yes. Where are we now with it? The thing I find... interesting about it is that it seems like from all the estimates I've read online in the newspapers about what the price will be everyone seems to say that a change needs to happen and they want it to happen it hasn't happened the Gemma licensing but that because of the way that it's set up even if this change happened it wouldn't go to the artists no that are being no what basically what we do as a club we we pay the game money as a flat fee and this flat fee gets distributed by the gamer through key system to their artists. So you're not keeping track of what tracks get played? No. The game, I don't want that. Because if every club or every discotheque in Germany would send them lists of what's getting played, they would actually have work to do. was having the flat fee money. This is like a bureaucratic work that they have to do. They have to take these lists and write it all down and distribute the money to the correct people. What they do is they take a flat fee, which is... calculated by the amount of people you can hold, the square meters your club has, and so on, you know? And we're paying this flat fee, and the flat fee never goes... I think no money from the flat fee ever goes to any artist that gets played in Watergate. It goes to all the big artists, to the... Dieter Bohr and Peter Maffay you know the big German musicians that are official members from the GEMA and that gets the share because just imagine all this money all this flat fee money goes into this big bowl and this big bowl gets distributed by percentage to the economically most successful artists in Germany. And I can tell you there's a few artists that is more successful than others. And then the club, the people that get played in our club, even though the money belongs to them. Why, you know, the estimate raises it a thousand percent just from a strictly mathematical standpoint? How was that? Why is it such a high change? Well, the GEMA says they now want 10% of the door. Not of our profit. They want 10% of the door before we paid any taxes, before we paid any rent, anything, you know. And plus, if the event is longer than five hours, they want like an extra 50%. And then after these five hours, every three or four hours, another 25%. So they take the length of the event as well into their calculation. Why... maybe you can't answer this, but it seems kind of baffling to me that if the event is longer than five hours, it goes up 50%. Why, why that is ridiculous. Like jump. It is a ridiculous term. I didn't come up with the idea. It's the GEMA. This is why we're struggling if this comes, you know. The GEMA says, you know, I guess it's like that. The GEMA sees the typical discotheque. The typical discotheque has a DJ, let's say DJ Eddie. He gets 50 euros per night. The club gets 15 euros. So they make a good money at the door. I can tell you every club in Berlin has a completely different calculation of their income. They make money at the bar and they distribute their money from the door to their bouncers and to the artists. So basically what we're already doing is we're giving already 90% of the door money to our artists. This is how I work. I don't have a problem telling this everyone. The money that comes in at the door goes to the artist. This is what I pay for fees. I mean, I can tell you the... The DJs that play at Watergate, they get okay to good money. The game are things where just having some DJ Eddie that gets 50 euros and we should pay more. But we already pay more. I mean, the whole scene, the whole economy, the whole... the whole club culture has built around the old, the old tariff, the old, the money, you know, and, and now suddenly, just imagine suddenly something you need for your living goes up by a thousand percent. It seems like, that they didn't. really talked to anyone before they decided that these were new things. And now they had this protest. And I assume I saw something and grooved. magazine when they had a guy from uh gima there so obviously they know that there's a discussion being had do you see this thing getting resolved and how well it's a situation that the law is going to go into effect Oh yeah, that's going to happen. That's going to happen from January 1st, 2013. And then the gamers are going to come and send you a different invoice. This is what people have in their postbox then. should all stand up and as we we already did we did demonstration but this is already it's still very small protest and uh we got the topic into uh the media and it seemed to be every newspaper i know has written some article and most articles are all in favor of the club scene and most people don't get it why you can go up with uh with prices from one day to the other by a thousand percent or even more and the only ones that don't really get it is the game arm and i guess what they're expecting is us to to sit on a table with them and then agree somewhere in the middle I must clearly say I find this wrong because their whole structure, their whole organization, and the whole idea of putting this new payment method is just wrong from the very beginning. And we should speak. I'm ready to pay more money to the game. Prices go up. This is just a normal thing, natural thing. I'm not ready to get myself robbed from this company which doesn't even represent the artists that actually play in my club. I see this as a big, big problem. And I find, and I must say that here, listening to me hopefully, I find also the artists, they should... stand up. The artists that play in the clubs that never saw a penny from their text being played at Watergate, at Berghain, at Tresor, you know? They should stand up and say something about it because the game acts as if they were representing the artists, as if the artists were in their part, in their corner. But I must say the artists are in our corner. The artists are making a living from playing in the clubs. The artists are not making a living from their payments out of the GEMA for their tracks being played. But it should be that way. So this is the actual problem. If the artist would make a proper living out of what they get from the Gema, then nobody would have a problem. But the Gema are taking from us and not giving it to the artist. And this is wrong. We should all... stand up and try to get the gamer on their knees and either yeah and i'm afraid of where you're going next get them on their knees and yes no they don't have to swallow but they have to They have to accept that they have to make changes inside their company. Yeah. And this is honestly... That's the tough thing. And how do I get them there? I honestly believe I can have lots of media coverage and I can have Sven Fiet standing up for me and I can have... everyone shouting it out into into the world the game is bad it will not help us unless we get them to court how do you do that well how do we do it we can there's different ways to do it you can just not pay it they will take you to court Is that probably what you're seeing? This is probably going to happen. Either I can shut down the place or I can get myself to court. I don't have 200,000 euros per year to pay to the gamer. But I guess I'm just asking from the sense of if there's no agreement that changes before 2013, do you think that court is probably the best way to go about it? Of course, because this is going to take them to... They have to explain themselves to a judge, to a proper judge that... can decide on the situation. Now they don't have to explain themselves to nobody but the patent and the authority that has to, which always acts in their favor, let's say, put it like this. There should be more control over what they are doing. They've been disconnected. from the politics which is a good thing so nobody can like you know a bit of the history of the gamer yeah so they're disconnected from any other outside influences so they can work and distribute money to the artists, what they are meant to be for. They shouldn't make any profit. This is how they're meant. This is why they are being a fine. It's one of those things where they're set up under really good circumstances, and you understand why it was set up that way, but because of that setup. Because of that setup, now they have, well, as always. People are using these structures in their own favor. And we've got this thing which got out of control now. And it just helps a few. The GEMA is representative for all artists, for all music artists in Germany. And they act in favor of just 3,000 proper... of 3000 best earning artists in the company. This is not all this. What I'm saying is not so super correct because of my English. It's not, I don't have the words to explain it properly, but it's, it's close enough. Yeah. I hope you get the point. Yeah, for sure. Um, why don't we try to end on a positive note? We should, of course I didn't come up. with the game I've been using. What are you up to these days production-wise? I know you've started producing. No, yeah. Production-wise is I've always... You know, I've done a production with Sebo K because we know each other for ages and he used to do drum and bass as well and then he was shopping records in my record shop and then we got him to be a resident of Watergate and when I quit the drum and bass thing, we sat together and thought about doing a few tracks. and getting our own influences in there. Drebbelk is pretty much the same musical background as me. And we did some stuff on Get Physical. We did something on Cecile a while ago. We did a few remixes. And we sat together to do something for the 10 years Watergate and a Rehersary box, which we're going to release later this year. I thought I must have a track on there because this is something we're doing like a really nice package like with like free vinyls in there. Like it's double CD was exclusive tracks from lots of really well-known Watergate connected artists. And I wanted to have a track on there. So we got to the studio and made music. Which is very refreshing when you always sit in the office and you work with music, but not make music, actually. One of the things about the label and the club itself, you look at it in kind of contrast to Berghain, I'd say the artists aren't... as associated with Watergate as they are with Berghain. Maybe that's because they don't play on an every-single-month basis. Was that a conscious decision on your part? No, it was just the way it happened. We never, like Berkhan have this super, this is super hardcore resident focus. Yeah. And Watergate has this in a way too, but not as strict. And I always wanted to keep it more open as well. This is my personal, how I wanted to run the label. I didn't want to limit myself to residents only, have also... and if there comes an opportunity if I meet someone like Solomon and we're like close and we ask him to do a compilation. He says, yes, why not do it? I don't want to limit myself or the label to rules I make. I've made this so often. I guess you're saying the funky techno Friday, Saturday. Yeah, exactly. This kind of thing. You try to have an idea. You make your own rules. And for this idea, and then you find out you limit yourself only by having these rules. So why not just open it and try to release good music with good people, you know, and that's it. It seemed like... the mixed CD series came a little bit later than I would have expected, maybe. Yeah. I was surprised, almost, that you were starting it. It came at a time, certainly, when mixed CDs were already... Is it... Is it just sort of a love letter to that idea? I had, yes, the, yeah, it is. It is definitely. The fact that it came so late was more that we didn't have the time to do it. We were like a really small team at the time and it was always in. in the back of our heads to have a mixed CD series. But when you're sitting in the office 12 hours a day, and you're working on three parties per week, and you're having all the side effects of three parties per week, and then you just can't make it, really. And then we forced ourselves to start it. And we got this amazing graphics and we thought we just have to now push this a little more. And we formed the label, which was initially thought to be a mix CD genre label only. And then by the time we got exclusive tracks from the artists that were doing mix CDs and then released 12 inches. according to the mixed CDs. it's all going the way that we're forming something like bigger you know it's not only in future it's not only going to be the mixed cities we're going to release a 12 inch here and there because we get stuff offered from from artists and um it seems like the the the idea of having a label connected to a club in in times of like really bad economy for labels seems to be like a good argument for... for distributions because you've got like a proper promotion tool. You have the club as a promotion tool for the Mixed CD, which is a label a normal label doesn't have. Well, it's the same idea, I think, as like all these labels now going into becoming booking agencies or trying to... Yeah, they have to. Yeah, yeah, sure. They have to. They have to. And business has changed a lot in the last few years. people have to struggle to survive with making music and when you're releasing records you can't make a living from it then you ask your artists to give something of their fees. Are you seeing the same thing with... you know djs who just dj like it's just tough to get people to come out to see people who don't have a record out or something to well that's the sad thing that's it you know what this is really sad that that you don't have the pure dj anymore the guy that spends his life on selecting records for other people, which is the initial, this is how I got into DJing. Not that I thought I need to make a record to get out there. It was like, I need to make a proper, nice mix CD to get out there or mix tape at the time, you know? Maybe you should do a night of only DJs who DJ. I mean, you're in a position where you could... Effect changes. Yeah, I doubt there's anyone left. Most DJs have gotten into production in a natural way. They've been DJing and they got their head around the production thing and then they started doing production as well. But nowadays you sometimes have this thing. I mean, I must admit, you can send me, I get sent loads of mixed CDs and I don't even have the time to listen to them. It must be really frustrating if you're living somewhere in... in the middle of nowhere but have the dream of being a DJ and then you make your superb mix CD with a nice photograph and everything and you send it out and it doesn't even get listened to but the business has changed and there's more nowadays there's more to being an artist than it was maybe 20 or 30 years ago like 20 years ago you were You were getting a job when you were making a good mix, but there wasn't so many people doing mixes. Nowadays, I get shitloads of mixes and I can't even listen to them. So what's the best way? Final question. What's the best way to get a gig at Watergate? Buy me a beer. I don't know. You have to get your name heard. You have to see that I get to know from you. But mostly just buy you a beer. Two beers is better.
