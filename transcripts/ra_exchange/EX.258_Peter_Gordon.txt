Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Aaron Coulthay and I'm the news editor at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Peter Gordon. Peter's roots stretch back to the New York downtown scene of the 1970s and 80s. He's the man behind the Love of Life Orchestra, an experimental disco ensemble that formed in 1977 and is still active 38 years later. Peter is as busy as ever. these days. He put out an album earlier this year and he's collaborated with the likes of Factory Floor and Tim Burgess in recent times. We spoke in London recently while he was in town to perform some Arthur Russell instrumentals with his live band.

Why did you decide to revive that project a couple of years back? Well, this was a piece of Arthur's that I've always felt particularly close to and interested when I was really the... When I first met Arthur in 1975, this was the piece. that he was working on and he asked me to help him on it. So I sort of felt both for that reason a close affinity to the piece, also I've always been interested in instrumental music, instrumental pop music, so I felt a closeness with it there. So in 2012 I I was invited by the Kitchen Center in New York to revisit the piece and do a new reading and I jumped at the opportunity. And then Benjamin Freeney of Foam Music had heard about the concert at the Kitchen and he reached out to me and here we are. And when you got that offer from the Kitchen in... How did you go about assembling the group to perform? Because there's some people that you've been performing with for decades. There's some newer sort of members as well of the group. Well, what I was interested in doing is really working with both the core of veterans. of longtime collaborators, both of Arthur and myself as well, plus some newer members to bring added energy and to bring a new viewpoint into the group. So I think it's... Things get, anything gets stale if there's not fresh energy, fresh blood into that. So I saw this as an opportunity both to have the continuity and to bring a new perspective to the work. And your son, Max, is also part of the outfit. Yeah, yeah. And he's been also sort of part of the Love of Life Orchestra. Yes, yes. So how long has Max been performing with you on stage? Well, really ever since Max was born. I mean, we sort of had this relationship where we'd basically play music together. I mean, this was really an important part of family relationships. And I'd sit down at the piano and he'd play trumpet and we'd... jam and then we'd switch and he'd sit down at the piano and I'd switch to saxophone and he'd been certainly hearing my music and hearing Arthur's music really since he was born and then as he evolved into his own musical identity he really I mean, obviously I'm biased because he's my son, but he brings really a very strong musicality, a very strong foundation, the sound as well. And especially now that he's older and he has his own... career as a songwriter and a producer and a musician. So he's bringing that point of view as well. And you mentioned, you know, Max growing up with Arthur's music and also your own sort of relationship and friendship with Arthur Russell. Tell me about how you first met Arthur. I first met Arthur when I moved to... I was born in New York and then moved around when I was younger. So after college, moved back to New York. And this was in February of 75. And one of the first persons who I met was Arthur. Actually, Reese Chatham introduced me to Arthur. This was in the East Village. And we sort of found that we had this affinity both for pop music. for experimental music and that sort of began an ongoing conversation musical conversation and conversation. And the live instrumentals work is kind of this meeting point between concert hall performance and pop music. What was it that appealed to you and Arthur about that zone between those two styles? Well, I think it was really a lot of it represented our musical experiences growing up, because really, we were both performers trained on our instruments, Arthur on cello, myself on clarinet and saxophone. So we sort of had this musical training coming out of the classical world and an interest in experimental music and trying to push the boundaries of music as well. But at the same time, there was really this, a real kinesthetic connection with funky music. And as a sax player, I was always playing in bands and in rock bands and in soul bands and in funk bands, and this was part of my music. And so I think for both of us, there was really the interest to sort of combine that music, that music of physicality, that music of the heart and the body, as well with our... intellectual interests in expanding the form and possibilities. And I guess at that time, mid-70s New York, it must have been a fertile time to be... exploring those possibilities? I think so. I mean, I think every generation really has their own fertile time. You know, they just, you just need to look right in front of you and look at the opportunities. New York was, other than art and other than really this dedication and sense of conviction. New York had nothing else. The city was broken. It was poor. It was like the neighborhood we lived in looked like a war zone. I mean, there were blocks and blocks of rubble. And no one had any ideas of, you know, making money or becoming or making it rich. But really there was this sense of conviction in the community of artists working together. And this was this really defined the community in New York. And so the and since. There weren't. This was the time before the real estate speculators, before gentrification. And we owned the neighborhood. This was our turf. And so when you came back to New York, you were living in East Village? Yes, yes. And it was all sort of, in terms of the downtown scene, it was all centered around those, a few blocks in that area, is that right? Well, there were a few centers, but really there was the East Village. Visual artists and those needing larger spaces were also in Soho at the time. which was really mostly empty industrial lofts. And there were, I mean, there were no, there was one bar down in Soho. There were no stores. Then in the East Village, which really had a long tradition of counterculture. I mean, it was, before we moved there, it was, you know, earlier it was one of the centers of the hippie movement. Generations before, it was a center of even the anarchist movement. So there was this long... tradition in this neighborhood. Just going back to Arthur, I wanted to ask you about his legacy and the way his music and his importance to music has been viewed and how that's kind of changed over time. Do you feel that there's been a growing appreciation for what he did? Oh, absolutely. When Arthur was alive, he wasn't getting much attention. Mostly there were sort of the dance hits. I mean, not that they were huge, huge hits, but they really made a really important impact on the club scene and on the dance music scene. But other than that, he was... fairly under the radar at the time, but I think there's the nature of Arthur's music, and this is something which I've even been discovering even in these series of performances. I mean, I continue to be amazed about how much, how rich this music is. I mean, last night we were performing in Islington and I'm on stage and I'm playing through the music and it's, you know, we've been rehearsing and it's open system, but it's... It just struck me how I'm still discovering things within the music. And I think that's really the nature of Arthur's legacy, that it's not all on the surface, but it's something that sort of grabs hold of you. And it speaks to different people in different ways. For example, I was connecting to his instrumental music. music, to the composition as well as the melodies and sort of the possibilities for finding, for taking off from these musical seeds that Arthur planted. Others have connected to other aspects of Arthur's music. Some really connect to his brilliance as a singer-songwriter. For others, he really speaks, I think, for a whole generation in terms of gay identity. And this was a very important part of Arthur's music as well. Others connect to him through the spiritual side. And I think this is... So it's really very rich and very multifaceted. So I think this is something which is very special about Arthur's music is that he speaks to so many in so many different ways. At the same time, it's really Arthur's music. And it's all of our music. I mean, it's really music that keeps on giving. It's really an open system. And in terms of around that time in New York, were you going to clubs? Were you going to parties? Like, were you experiencing these, like a lot of this, you mentioned some of Arthur's like more club hits. Were you going out and hearing this kind of stuff on sound systems? Well, not to the extent that Arthur was, but yes, having the opportunity to hear Arthur's tracks like at the Paradise Garage where like Larry Levin, he would take a record and he would spend an hour on it and it'd be this constant build. And so hearing the music in the clubs, it was really... very powerful. I mean, and I've always liked rhythmic music, funky music, dance music. And so I think that was really an important part of the whole experience. And so I began having clubs which would have rock bands, and then they'd have dance music in between. So there was really sort of, there was already this cross-pollination of the music that you would hear and that people would play. It was part of an ongoing discussion. And within it as well, this was also a very rich... period for salsa music in New York. So you'd be hearing all this music in the streets, coming out of boom boxes, coming out of windows, coming, you know, in the clubs. I mean, this was New York City and this, you know, music was very much the soul of New York City. And in terms of your own personal music development, coming back to New York in 1975. How did you go about sort of throwing yourself into the creative scene there? Well, I was very fortunate because I had a friend before then. I had been living in California, first in San Diego and then in San Francisco. And already I had been sort of... pursuing music along those lines of crossing genres. I think an early piece of mine, Macho Music, which was on my first album, Star Jaws, was really an exploration of... both rock and pop music in minimalist form as well. And then so when I moved to New York, I had been on the road with a band. It was sort of a... 50s rock sort of retro band and we were touring and it was the middle of January and I spent the month in Chicago playing with this band and then I came to New York and I had friends who had sort of arrived before me from California as well as new people from New York and then immediately I was I just met folks in both the St. Mark's poetry scene in Soho, you know, the Soho, the scene around the kitchen as well. And so this was a very welcoming community. And, you know, musicians, artists, they're always looking for new people, new ideas. So I met Arthur, I met... Reese Chatham, Garrett List. I found this really thriving, vibrant community, and I just never went back to California. I mean, I had some friends pack up my stuff. I mean, I didn't look back. It was just, I arrived in the East Village, and especially after having spent January in Chicago, New York in February felt like the tropics. by comparison, and there was, you know, just music and performances. And also, there was a real possibility for this real sense of, you know, DIY productions. I mean, you didn't have to wait for anyone to, like, offer you a gig, because no one would offer you a gig. But basically, you'd find a... There'd be a bar, which might have slow business, and you say, hey, you're not doing anything on Wednesday night. Can I play some music here? Bring some friends. And that's how I think the New York scene grew. It was very, very open and very receptive in that way. It was also known as like a very cross-disciplinary scene in terms of musicians dabbling in art or poetry or other forms, other creative forms. Is that something that you did? Did you try and do it on music? Well, yeah, I mean, very much. I mean, it was a community of poets, visual artists, and it was cross-disciplinary and also people... did multiple things. So you had visual artists who also played instruments. You had musicians who worked in visual arts. And people also connected through their jobs. I mean, it's, you know, I know, you know, so many bands were put together because some folks had been like working in a kitchen or bussing tables together. or working as plumbers or doing construction. And this was so really, I think the artistic community really helped both came out of that as well. And you mentioned briefly your first solo album, Star Jaws, which came out on... lovely music, which is just an incredibly intriguing label. And tell me about your first experiences with Mimi Johnson and Robert Ashley. Well, I first met Robert Ashley when I was a student at University of California in San Diego, and Bob came down to do a performance. And I was blown away the way he was able to put together this. large piece. He was working on his opera in memoriam, Kit Carson. And I was struck both by the way he was able to gather forces of people and different elements and the way he was able to integrate social structures with musical structures and artistic structures. And it was... It was a real inclusive type of music. I mean, it was very, in one sense, it was very avant-garde. but at the same time it was very connected to the society and the politics and the science of the time. So I was really blown away by Bob's work, and I just actually transferred schools and went up to Mills College where Bob was teaching. I just sort of... left San Diego and moved ahead. So Robert actually became a mentor for you? Yes, yes. Robert, he was a mentor. I guess I started out as a fan. Then he became a mentor. Then he asked me to work with him on... Perfect Lives, produced musical tracks for this video opera, and that really gave me the opportunity to cut my teeth in the studio because these were seven half-hour songs recorded multi-track. And this really, I got to spend hundreds of hours in a multi-track studio, and Bob really pushed me to experiment. And this was really an opportunity for me to cut my teeth in the studio and to try things that maybe in other productions they would discourage you from trying. I mean, usually if you work on sort of more mainstream projects, they don't want you to go outside the box. They want you to sort of recreate something that's been created before. And this was just the opposite with Bob Ashley. He was not interested in what had been created before. He really wanted to create something new. So I was able to really treat the studio. sort of as this large modular synthesizer. And then so this, we have this sort of extended working relationship. And then... I was a fan, then I was a student, he was a mentor, then we were colleagues and friends. You mentioned that this outside-the-box approach to music is something that I would say has come to define your own career. What is it about the avant-garde that has appealed to you for so long? I think the thing about music and the thing about art is that you can really create your own world. You can really create a perfect world or an idea within a fixed environment of a perfect world. When you do this out in society, usually people mess things up. I mean, they always make things worse. You know, people go on these campaigns for reform and they suddenly have a new idea and often they make things worse. But the thing about music and art is that you can create these worlds and it's kind of risk-free because the only thing you have... to lose is your whole reputation but but no one really gets hurt otherwise and also it's it's part of the uh conversation of us of a society i mean culture gets stale ideas get stale you need new you need new approaches it's sort of like and it's trying I'm trying to find the multidimensionality of things. You don't want life to be a two-dimensional experience. You can be staring at a wall all day long, but go around the corner and suddenly you'll say, wait a second, that's not a wall, that's a... It might be a cube or it might be a sphere or it might have other dimensions that you might not have experienced. And I think in all fields it's a matter of sort of exploring new possibilities, exploring the intellect. This is what we do as humans. human beings we learn it's part of the learning process it's always learning about the world learning about learning about music. I guess for me that's what avant-garde is. It's also always challenging the status quo. People have a way of consolidating power, political power, artistic power, and I think we shouldn't let folks have a free ride in that. I think we should always be questioning. This is our, I think... Perhaps this is why we're put on earth is to question things and to learn. And how did you come to start the Love of Life Orchestra? Well... I think as a composer, I always identified myself as a composer, and I just was not attracted by what had been sort of the modus operandi of most composers coming out of sort of... the more contemporary or even the classical music scene where you write a piece, then you try to get a bunch of people to play it, and then you have minimal rehearsal, and then you do another piece and you're starting from scratch again. And no one was offering me commissions to write for existing orchestras or ensembles, and I really... needed an ensemble to work with for the music to grow. And also, I guess I'd always been in bands. Maybe it's just part of my DNA. I'm a musician, and what do musicians do? Musicians play with other music, and they have a group of musicians to play together. At the same time... The early concept of the Love of Life Orchestra was very much also a, it was kind of a political, a populist idea, because at the time the sort of the new music, the classical music world at the time, it was very sort of both elitist and it was sort of... very removed from actual experience of people's lives. I mean, a lot of the music was really hard to listen to and not in a good way. So I was really interested in creating this band. And also, an ally that a band, a musical ensemble, is a society within itself. It's a community, you're defining the community, and people come into a community with a shared purpose, but with their own individual backgrounds. And so I wanted to put together this ensemble in which musicians, artists, coming from different backgrounds, could come together in this unified purpose, which would be the music. and each bring different experience. So some of the players might have been well-trained coming out of the classical world. Others might have come more out of rock bands. Others were poets and really were not musical performers per se, but were interested in music. And so I felt by bringing together these different... people from different backgrounds, it would help inform the music and would sort of find a music that would... would reflect society of different people from different backgrounds and different cultures and different interests but all working together with a shared purpose. Did the reality match the concept or did it take some time to gel? Yes and yes. The concept, I think it... work, the reality work, because the music really reflected this, and we're still in process. I mean, I'm still learning about the music. I mean, I think the thing about music and life is that, you know, the more you go on, I think the less and less I know about it. It's like the more and more mysteries reveal themselves. And maybe that's just the... the nature of the experience of living. People like Peter Zumo and Randy Gunn have been in the Love of Life Orchestra for three decades now. You must have built some incredibly strong personal and musical relationships in that time. I think so. I mean, there's a strong musical relationship. There's a telepathy that happens. It's almost like you almost don't have to... talk about things, just start playing, you kind of know what the other might do. And you're working from a shared common ground. And each one of us has different backgrounds, different interests, and when we go on our own, we do different things. coming out of both working within the ensemble and working within the community. I mean, the thing is, is that, you know, I have my band, the Love of Life Orchestra, and, you know, Arthur had, you know, his group of musicians he put together. Peter Zumo has his ensemble as well. We're all doing different things, and at some point... It might be under my name or it might be under Peter's name or it might be under Ned Sublett's name or even, you know, or Laurie Anderson's name or whatever. But this is really, it's all generated by a community. And sometimes it seems unfair. Some people get more attention than others. and things come in waves. But I think all of this music that we're all doing is reflective of our community. You mentioned Laurie Anderson there. How many times have you collaborated with her in the past? Well, you know, we haven't collaborated much lately, although we're very close friends and, you know, we see each other socially often. I first met Lori in 1976, and there was a dancer named Poo Kay. And Poo had her loft downstairs from Lori's. And there would be... be these open dance jams where people would just come over and dance and these you know dancers and non-dancers and then musicians would come and play along and Laurie came downstairs and I would you know had brought my sax over and then this is when I first met Laurie and that's when we started working. You released a new album called Symphony 5 last year. It sounds like that was a result of you coming back to New York again after a stint living away. What brought you back to New York this time? New York's my home, and it was always, even as I was growing up, I sort of had a sense of being a diaspora New Yorker. I always felt like wrenched away from the city. It was my parents moved away when I was three, and they moved down south to Virginia. I always identified as a New Yorker and would always be visiting my grandparents there. And living in the South, I was clearly a Yankee. I wasn't a rebel or, you know, and this was... This was the segregated South. So I guess I always saw myself as a New Yorker. At a certain point, I had moved away from the city in the mid-'90s, and I was living out West for a while, in most part in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where both raising... family as well as I wanted to pursue sort of longer, larger form pieces. So I was writing operas, music theater pieces, more extended works. Then it was really, I always knew I would be coming back to New York. So in 2005. moved back into the city. The city had changed, but at the same time it was still the city. And it was time to both bring the group back together and to write some new music reflected of the changed city, the changed world. From moving back to New York in 2005, the Symphony 5 came out in 2014. So it's quite a long, I guess, gestation process. Tell me about how you went about getting the band back together and how the recording sessions went. Well, I moved back and... Obviously, I was still in touch with everyone. And we had done some, you know, one-offs over the years as well. And then I guess what I always do, I just sit down and start writing music. And I work modularly and start sort of, you know, compiling these different sections. And I learn very much about the music through performance. So we might. play something even for a few years before it becomes really fixed and it grows. And I mean, it's funny because when the symphony came together, say in 2011, it became clear to me that this was really a symphony. And then I sort of began putting together in terms of the movements. pairing it as a symphony. But then after, actually after it was recorded and I began looking at some of my very early notes for it, I found a folder. I work digitally now, and I found a folder which was titled Symphony North. And I had totally forgotten that I began working on a symphony and then just sort of put out of my mind that I was working on a symphony and then began getting into the detail, writing the music. performing it, having the music evolve over a series of gigs, and then sort of say, oh, this is a symphony. And then I guess I had forgotten about the original attention, then it came back and sort of revisited it. In terms of the recording, this is actually also different from most of my recording. because all the music was performed live in concert at this wonderful new music performance space called Roulette in Brooklyn. So we recorded the live concert and had multiple... direct recordings, as well as different room mics around the house. And then I asked Jeff Jones, a.k.a. the Jedi Master, who's a wonderful producer who's received Grammys for his work with Wynton Marsalis and Dr. John, and then... gave Jeff the tracks and he really did some wonderful things and in mixing it and sort of bringing out the uh the the maintaining the energy and the essence of the live performance as the same time sort of making preparing it for record release so that show in in brooklyn in 2013 what was the atmosphere through in the air like that night? I always liked when I was first working with Bob Ashley and he talked about music as news. So it's through a music performance that's like the news of the day. So I think I saw this very much as part of that. It wasn't the intention at the time to be recording a live album or anything. to record as much as I can. And there was the opportunity because of the setup, the audio setup. They had the Pro Tools really wired into the system. So we had stems. And I asked Jedi, Jeff Jones, to come in. records as well. So we had these tracks and then it was sort of, then I heard what I had and coincidentally Ben Freeney of Foam Records was in town. We had already been talking about putting this Arthur Russell project. together and uh and i mentioned i was doing the symphony five and and he said oh i'll come and hear it so he came and heard it fell in love with the piece the recordings turned out to be i think quite good and really captured an energy and then that uh then the album really came out of that. In terms of the album's title, and you mentioned that it's a symphony, can you explain to a layperson like myself what kind of symphonic qualities the record has beyond being divided into movements? Well, it's 40 minutes, which is a long time, and I think there are certain elements... of the symphonic form, like the first section, the first movement, which I call exposition. And it's really, like in a symphony, it's really a laying out of the musical material that I would be working with. It's establishing of the musical language. the sound. The third move in, "Juvenalia," is sort of more playful. It's sort of like a scherzo in a symphony, which is like the second or third move in the symphony. It's like it starts out sort of setting the foundation, and then there's kind of a playfulness in this. But other than that, I really didn't follow any rules. And the period of planning and recording the Symphony 5 LP overlapped with the retrospective on DFA. Can you tell me a bit about how that record came into existence and how you first hooked up with DFA? Well, I kind of hadn't been thinking about recording at all. I really, it seemed like the record business had kind of died or just didn't seem interested in what I was doing. I mean, I didn't. feel any connection with it. And then I got an email saying that there was... some guy named James Murphy who was putting together a compilation for Fabric, this club in London, and it sounded cool. They wanted to license my track, and there hadn't been much interest in any of my recorded music. I mean, I didn't know that anyone even remembered it. And then not only did James and Pat Mahoney, not only did they put this on the fabric compilation, but they opened and closed it and sort of defined it. And then I went to... Obviously, I was pleased and flattered as well. And so I went and I met James at a club where he was DJing in New York. And it was like, wow, this guy's playing music that I really like. You know, I haven't had this experience. Wait, there's something going on in pop music that I feel like I can connect to again. And then I just got talking with James, and he said, oh, you should do a record with us. And initially they were just interested in re-releasing the EP. And then I got talking with DFA, with Jonathan Galkin. really running the day-to-day operations of the label. And then I began overwhelming him with this bringing in tracks through the years of things that I had been playing. But, you know, I always liked to make new music, and it was sort of part of the deal. Okay, we can do some reissues by just... you know, want to do some, include some new work as well. So it's not just a retrospective. So that's when. and as well recorded another heartbreak in Don't Don't Redux, which was sort of the final tracks of it. But in the process, it really gave me an opportunity to sort of go back and revisit this part of my musical persona. dance music and disco music was now being looked at in a different light. And as well, hearing what James was doing with LCD and hearing groups like Hot Chip and Holy Ghost and what Gavin was doing. And suddenly it felt like there was a musical scene that I felt connected to. Personally, it really allowed me to revisit this part of my music and to think of it in new ways. So that Fabric Live 36 mix sounds like it opened quite a few doors and I guess the full record on... DFA must have done the same. I was really interested by the Justine and Victorian Punks recordings that made it onto that album. Can you tell me about their provenance? Well, this was back in 79, I guess, and Jay Burnett, an engineer who I'd been working with. told me that Colette was interested in doing this recording of Beautiful Dreamer for an art piece and did I want to arrange it and produce it with him. And so we booked some time. She had some backers and we booked some time in Electric Lady Studio. and recorded the single. I basically brought in my band, Love of Life Orchestra, and Colette's a visual artist, a performance artist. I mean, she's not really a singer, but we put sort of, that's why I think there's this sort of... very, very naive vocal part and, you know, sort of very innocent sound to it. I mean, literally, I was conducting her word for word as the music was going, showing her how to say each word. You can even, if you listen even closely, you can hear the page turn on one of, at one point. And... And that was really a one-off for her installation piece, Beautiful Dreamer, in which was really installation and she would be lying in a bed in the gallery. and this music would be playing. And at the same time, she really had introduced me to the music of Lucio Battisti, the song Encore II, which is still you, which was the B-side of this. And we recorded it over a couple of days and mixed it. Then I had forgotten about it. And as I'm putting together... the album for DFA, this was in the period of MySpace. Remember MySpace? And someone on MySpace just sent me a, posted the cover to this that I'd totally really forgotten about. I said, wow. And they happened to have an MP3 of it because I didn't even have it digitized. So it was really a fan sent me an MP3, and this reminded me of it. And then I sent this over to James Murphy, and it sort of blew James away. And that led to its whole other new life. And what reaction did you experience when that record came out on DFA? The retrospective? Well, it was really, I mean, you know, it introduced my music to a whole new audience. I'm certainly indebted to... to James and DFA for, for doing that. And also for me, you know, personally, it was a way of, of, you know, hearing this sort of scope of my music altogether in one, in one context and then putting it. back together so it was kind of a how can I say a certain rejuvenation of music which I had been doing in the 80s and then it was good to hear it also outside of the context because you know because when I was originally doing a lot of people really thought it was really uncool because you know everyone was singing about death And it was all this nihilistic stuff. And, you know, and you had the dead boys, you know, who I love. And, you know, so-called no wave scene. And there was also, you know, there was a lot of darkness, you know, coming out of the punk scene. And I had the love of life orchestra. It's like people would come up to me and say, oh, is this a Christian band? I said, well, no, this is a secular humanist band. Then they'd stop talking to me. But by the time the DFA record came out, people forgot that this wasn't supposed to be cool. And they started listening to the music. And they started listening to the music for what it is. And also at the time, you know, in the punk scene, everyone was talking about death and everything. Then people really started dying. You know, then AIDS hit. And it was really fucked up. And, you know, so the whole music changed. And then the whole, you know, the world really changed a lot. And I think sometimes it takes a while. for music to find its own time. And I think my music seemed to speak to the time, even though it was music I had... A lot of it recorded decades before. It seemed to be very current. And I guess that what you're saying there in terms of your music being current and being embraced by a newer generation has also led to some interesting collaborations in recent times. One I wanted to ask about was Factory Floor. How did that come about? Well, it just, you know, once again, I mean, social media. I got a message. totally out of the blue, from Nick Voigt, saying, you know, we were common friends with Reese. She knew Reese Chatham's music. She liked some tracks she had heard, and she just sent me some raw tracks. Would I want to do something with it? I wasn't really thinking much about it, but I just loaded it into... computer. I work in digital performer at the time that the software I was working with. And then I started laying down tracks. And I said, wow, this is fun. And then I started adding tracks and doing... mix and I sent her back a mix and they really liked it and then we continued working and exchanging files back and forth and so it really came out of very organically I mean it wasn't something like a record company saying oh you know why don't you guys do these things together it'd be great for marketing it was sort of like I got this you know this this note from Nick, we started sharing files. Then we had a mix and then Optimo wanted to release it. And that's what happened. Was the record that you did with Tim Burgess last year, was that similarly organic in terms of the way it came about? Yeah, yeah. Because, you know, I met Tim through Nick and we got talking and sort of, and he was a fan of the work and we said, let's... you know, let's do something together. And then he wanted to do a cover of one of Arthur's songs, I Couldn't Say It to Your Face. We began working on that and then some new songs. And that sort of came organically. And then we have a new release, which came out this year again, and it's sort of part of an ongoing project. Hopefully soon there will be an album of our collaborations together. I like it when working relationships happen organically. I mean, it's... We're kind of in a curatorial world now where, you know, sort of non-artists, non-musicians, they sort of like the idea, they have this idea of putting so-and-so together and do this, and it sort of becomes sort of more of a stamp of a curator rather than an artist, which can be very interesting. But I also tend to like it when... musicians or artists meet each other and like, you know, hit it off. It's sort of like, you know, a love at first sight thing. Even with instrumentals, it's like we have Jerry O'Byrne, I mean, wonderful Irish guitarist and singer. songwriter who I happened to meet last year when I was in on the Dingle Peninsula in Cary for a week or a couple of weeks and I heard Jerry playing at a pub with some singers who were close friends with with Kit Fitzgerald who's my wife and video artist collaborator and she the singers that he was playing with. So I went to John Benny's pub in Dingle and heard him playing with these singers. I sort of kind of liked his approach, and he did one song, and I don't know, it just struck me, and I introduced myself. And then we met the next day and had tea together, and he had some instruments, and I brought a horn, and we just started jamming. And it just, you know, there was a, just a musical affinity right there. And then in putting it together, the tour for instrumentals, I just thought that Jerry would make sense, would be sort of simpatico with Arthur's music. So I like that, the way these sort of things happen organically in terms of artists' collaborations. And you're also remastering some Love of Life Orchestra tracks for re-release. Yeah, yeah. How's that process coming along? Well, in one sense it's overwhelming because there's a lot of stuff that's unreleased. Also a lot of stuff in analog media. So it has to do with digitizing, going back to the raw tracks. It's always a question how much to mess with it and to add things to it or how much to stick with what's original. And it sort of becomes apparent when you're right in the middle of the tracks. In any case, just by putting things in different orders, different context, I think there's... I'm discovering stuff about my own music that I guess wasn't necessarily apparent. at the time. You know, sometimes you're in, you're just doing things, you're doing life, it's ongoing, you have a conversation, and just making these notes, and then years later go back and to listen and see, okay, what's there? Usually, I mean, I go through this thing that if I record a concert, if I listen to it the next day, it's like the sense, oh my god, what have I done? I'm never going to... make music again, I'm failed, this is like an utter disaster. Then I might go back to it a year later and say, well, you know, it wasn't so bad. And then I wait a little bit longer and say, hey, that was really good. And it drives me crazy. You know, people, my family has learned to expect this from me. It's like... don't listen to the recording the day after. You're not going to like it. It's hard to transfer that, the experiential, to more as a listener. But it gets better with age. Either that or it gets worse. And at that point, you just have to say, okay. This is good. This is crap. Or maybe it's both. It's sort of editing, sort of the ongoing editing process, rejuxtapositions, and also you put things in different contexts and it has different meaning. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
