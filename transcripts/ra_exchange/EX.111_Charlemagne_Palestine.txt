♪ ♪ . . . Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Charlemagne Palestine has widely been called a minimalist composer, but it's best if you keep that to yourself if you meet him. You may just end up getting an earful. He prefers continuum or trance artist. All of the descriptors seem to fit though. Charlemagne's music is one of epic duration. His most well-known piece, Strumming Music, consists of him building up a storm of overtones from only a few repeated notes on a piano over the course of nearly an hour. The key difference between Palestine and composers like Philip Glass and Steve Reich, is the approach. Palestine's work is raw and full of life, and he often compared himself to abstract expressionist painters like Jackson Pollock. Performance-wise, you're also likely to often see him playing amid a number of stuffed animals while he drinks cognac and smokes. In short, he's one of a kind. I talked with him a day after his performance with Monkhoff at Infine's 2012 Label Workshop in August. you You grew up in New York. In Brooklyn. What part of Brooklyn? It's called East New York Flatbush. East Flatbush, East New York. Brownsville. What was New York like back then? Well, we're talking, I'm 65 now. a few some days ago post-war then yeah I was born in 47 in Brownsville East Flatbush It was an immigrant neighborhood where the younger, as my parents had come with their parents from Eastern Europe, they married on the Lower East Side. And as the Lower East Side became more and more full of people and there were no trees and things like that, people started to think having a better way of life. And Brooklyn in those days, especially where I was brought up, was still... almost like farmland. And so Brownsville, and what then became East New York, was developed especially by Jewish immigrants of the first generation to have a better way of life away from the squall of the Lower East Side. I was born by that, by the time I was born, it had already been going on. I even have a book on the history of Brownsville. There's a whole big book about it. And so it started around the 1920s when, just after the big immigration of Jews from Eastern, one of them, one of the big people wanted to live. in a nicer place. Were your parents escaping the war or had they moved over in the 20s? No, they came just before the Russian Revolution but they were in the pogroms which were existing. The Cossacks used to come regularly and kill some of us but especially on my mother's side, my grandfather... would have had to do 25 years of military service. And he couldn't be, and at the end, we wouldn't have been citizens of the Russian Empire. So people were getting all their family money together, taking boats and coming to America. And my mother's, my father's side of the family, they were from the Ukraine, but they did the same thing. And so my mother and father met on the streets of the Lower East Side from two very, very different, even though they were Jewish, they could just as well have been Siberian and Iroquois. Indian or something like that. They were not really very similar. My father's dark. They came from dark Jews, probably from what was Mesopotamia to Odessa, Black Sea. And my mother's side, they came from Poland. Belorussia and they were pink. So I have a pink, my mother's side was pink and my father's side was brown. But they were all Jews in the whole big diaspora. Were either of them musical? Or interested in music? No, musical in that it was still the generation when some of us went to synagogue. And so there was popular music, of course. I mean, there was some little of Perry Frank Sinatra and things like that. But also we had still a tradition of religious music in synagogue. That's what I first, I was singing Johnny Ray as a kid because I liked his one year sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye of these sad songs. But then I immediately was able to continue in synagogue being a singer for a long time. religious services, especially those that we gave for the bourgeois Jews of New York, as they could afford to have in their synagogues. They had choirs and chasens, you call them, who came just before the war. They were saved from the Holocaust. and sing and live in New York, especially because New York was the biggest community until 1948, when the year after I'm born, Israel is founded. So, but at that time, New York was really an enormous Jewish... community in the new world. And you were singing and this made an enormous impact on you. And actually became very good at it. And I actually got to sing with some of the great Chazans of which would turn out to be some of the last great Chazans of their time because there are some now younger generations of these a singer who sings traditional in a traditional style during the services of there are special songs they're called Chazans And so I got to sing with some of the great Chazans of their time. just at what would then become the end of more and more in America, New York, the Jewish tradition of European Jews, after the Holocaust, of course, also, went on to that sort of pushed Jews to secularize. assimilate into American society and things like these very esoteric Jewish singers wasn't part of the deal. So they sort of disappeared by the time I was a teenager, meaning by the time I had my bar mitzvah, which was on the Lower East Side, just on Delancey Street, that was in 1960. And in 60, you were singing, and you were also doing some stuff with... I was in Brooklyn in the middle of nowhere, because it's very far even now. The Bobos, that they call them in France, the bourgeois bohemians, hadn't yet... still haven't gotten to that part of Brooklyn. Because when I was a kid, you never said you came from Brooklyn. It was considered really... that you came from a shithouse. This is why you got bar mitzvahed in Delancey Street. By that year. Yeah, of course. Yeah. In fact, then I, which still exists now, Fiorello LaGuardia, who was half Jewish. all immigrant, half Jewish, was the mayor of New York City. And in his period as mayor, he founded a series of specialty schools for immigrant children to be able to better themselves. And one of them was the High School of Music and Art. And so I took a... audition singing and lo and behold I got I got in but the high school of music and art in those days was next to city college on 137th street and st. Nicholas Avenue in Manhattan and so from Brownsville, East Flatbush, to there on the train was almost two hours. So quickly, as I got into that school, my mother organized that I would have my own little apartment about the size of this hotel room, 105th Street between West End and Riverside. And so by the time I'm, when I'm just 15 years old, not even yet 14, I have my own apartment in Manhattan. And so then my life changed. I was out of Brownsville because in those days, now everybody wants to come back. Now I'm I'm so proud to say, oh, I'm from Brooklyn. You're from Brooklyn. Oh, wow. What a lucky. Wow. They're so impressed. But 60 years ago, 50 years ago, it wasn't a very cool place to be. You said your life changed, like, obviously, that you were living alone. All my schoolmates who were in that school, many of them were not. They were, in a way, Europeans. They weren't really children. They were kind of children of immigrants, but their fathers were scientists, won the Pulitzer Prize. famous writers, philosophers. I found out that down the street from me, because of a girlfriend I had in the same building, was Isaac Bashevis Singer, the famous Yiddish and American writer. So all of a sudden I was in a milieu, a very important... intellectuals, musicians, writers, poets of New York intelligentsia. From that moment on I became insatiably curious and with an appetite for culture and I never looked back. Tell me about the school. I mean what did you learn there? Music and art? Yeah. exactly what it said, music and art, though it wasn't such an interesting school. I mean, the teachers were sort of nice, but it was being in an atmosphere of all these different, it was the students who came from such a sophisticated European background. that was the most important thing for me. I, all of a sudden, was accepted in households of very upper-class intellectuals, and my parents were workers. So... It just put me in another milieu that eventually helped me to get to university because then I went to like six universities in New York or schools and universities to keep out of the Vietnam War. So I was all of a sudden immersed in another class of cultural class and the top of the top if you weren't into mass culture, New York intellectual culture was the top of the top of post-war American culture. Who were some of the people that you were hanging out with that really made an impact? My girlfriend, my first girlfriend, Ruth, her father had fought in Hungary, and he had known quite well Bela Bartok and Zoltan Kodály. And so he would tell me stories about them. And I used to do a style of improvising on the piano where I would invent pieces and then I would put names of famous composers on them and see if people thought I was bullshitting them or they actually believed me. And Bartok was one of my favorite thieveries. Stravinsky, Bartok, Hindemith. And so I would do pieces that sounded like them in a way, but invent them at the moment. But when I met... Ollie was his name, Ruth's father. He immediately knew, well, what kind of crap is that? That's not bar talk. And so that's how we became friends. He said, I'll show you what real bar talk is. is like. And then later I did get to meet, because I had another girlfriend, Jacqueline, and her father was the first French horn player of the Columbia Symphony Orchestra. And he thought I was a very important... new voice of young composer musicians and through him I got to meet Lucas Foss who then introduced me to Varese just before he died to Stravinsky I got to sit in on several Stravinsky his umteenth total integral symphonic music conducted by him, by the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, as the first horn player was almost my father-in-law. Finally, we broke up. We never married. So it was through this whole kind of like... circle of people that I knew that and I met Mark Rothko in those days I met Bashevis Singer I met him as a young artist and so I Was painting, visual arts, had a big impact on you? Well, I would say that I was as much visual as it was called music and art. You were supposed to choose. I was accepted for my singing. But once, like I said, I had this appetite. It was called music and art. And it turned out that most of the really pretty girls were in the arts section. And so I hovered around the arts section a lot and the smell of the paint and watching. So I quickly, in my nostrils, I saw, I didn't see the... the barrier, and it started to be the times, and we're talking about the middle 60s, eventually in the middle 60s, when multimedia was coming into, and there were the, then I got to, I was a street guy, I was in all the bars and bistros where bohemians hang out, I dressed as a, early on as a beatnik with a beret and dark glasses even in the evening. And I was 14. And I was hanging out in the big fat black pussycat and other legendary beatnik and art bars. So I got to know all kinds of poets. I became the conga drum player of Tiny Tim, the singer who used to sing tiptoe through the tulips. Allen Ginsberg I met. I was kind of cute also in those days. So I had a slippery slide between a lot of the artists of those days were gay, and so I had to slippery be careful because I was quite... You were an attractive young man. I was attractive, and I was attracted to the girls. That's what I was mostly. But I did easily strike up conversations and got my drinks paid for me by famous guys because I was kind of a drunk. Tell me when you met Morton Sabotnick. Morton Sabotnick I met in that whole period when actually that comes to the story when I'm a record salesman at the Record Hunter on 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue. And there I meet a guy, several people who would then remain friends in my life. One of them is a saxophone player, tenor player called Bob Feldman, who eventually worked with Charlie Mingus, and now he's actually an actor in pieces by Richard Maxfield. He travels all over. They even call him a sort of minimal jazz. He was a record salesman. Ingram Marshall, who... then eventually would have an effect on through him he was at Columbia Princeton at that time a student and Ilhan Mimroglu who was a Turkish composer who was an assistant professor at Columbia Princeton Electronic Music Center but he also was a record salesman at the record So there was this group. And then Ingram, I tried to get, I was already doing like these, I was buying these little tape recorders and trying and doing all these experiments myself. Because like I said, I mean, I just was, I just, everything I saw, I began to either imitate or develop because I just had this. incredible appetite how did you move from classical music and sort of you know following what you had heard to improvising and creating no but that's exactly how it is i became i was like a i was like a dingo i uh i i i started to do piece i didn't like I was very undisciplined. I didn't like to learn pieces. So I invented a style that sounded like it, and then I could fool around in the style, and I'd say, well, that's a piece. Well, I never heard that piece of Stravinsky's. Well, yeah, well, this is one of those, you know, forgotten pieces. And so I would just, I just. So you were a faker. I was a faker. Until I finally invented my own music where I could then say, hey, this is, this is me. Palestine's. Okay. So you're at the record store. The record hunter. And so Ingram had started to work at this place called the Intermedia Center because Columbia Princeton was just too formal and I would have had to, I had no university background and even their machines were very, very sophisticated and even finally old. old-fashioned because at that moment by the Bleecker Street Cinema which was also a much hipper place to be then then up on 120th Street there by Columbia University and Broadway which was just for students of Columbia who were there this was a building just above, a series of places just above the Bleecker Street Cinema in the hippest part of, again, I was back then in the, you know, what 10 years before had been Beatniks. The Beatniks were gone. And there was a studio there, and they were working with some of the new equipment that was being invented. which was much more flexible and much more performance-oriented than the kind of stuff they had at Columbia Princeton. And it was the moments of Bob Moog. And in this case, Morse and Bannock had already a very good relationship with a new synthesizer inventor called... Don Buchla who came from the San Francisco, the Bay Area. They had all come from San Francisco, basically. Moog, I don't remember. Moog, not, but Morton as well. Oh, yeah. So that's how, actually, they met in California at the San Francisco Tape Center. That's right. There's even a book on that now with Tony Martin and a whole bunch of those guys that I eventually met at this. NYU Intermediate Center, it was called. And there I got to meet, I met him, of course, more, because he wasn't the director. He had a guy there, a director, a guy named Michael Tchaikovsky, who was the director in those days. And through there I met a whole series of people and I started to really work with this Buchla. Did you immediately... sort of see it and be like, wow, this is next level. This is new. This is exciting. It was like I could fool around like I did on the piano and I would invent that it was Stravinsky. But whatever you invented on that instrument, nobody had ever done before. So there was no one I was imitating except myself. And the music that Mort was doing was totally, in another words, a little bit poppy-woppy for me. So there was no competition. So I was already starting to do like sort of space sounds. And I enjoyed it. You had to sign up. And most of the day hours were taken. And so I took all the night hours, meaning from midnight till six in the morning. And so it was great. I had great fun getting up because I was still living by that time in another place on the Upper West Side, in fact, in a street full of jazz musicians. And in the middle of the night, I would take the train down to the village and work all the night in this. in the studio. And there also who lived sometimes in the studio was a guy named Serge Cherapnin, who was one of the sons of Alexander Cherapnin, the Russian composer. And he was a kind of a disciple of Mort and Don Buchla. And he was in a little closet. He used to live in a little closet. And it was just enough room to put in a little sleeping bag. And he lived there, eventually with a woman composer, Marianne Amacher. They lived in that little closet together. And I would come in the middle of the night to work. And so the closet was just down the. down on the same floor just there so I would come through and they would be working watching television or he would be working on a module and so they became good friends and there I met also one time now very like around 68 it was probably 69 Eliane Radigue, who had just come from Paris. And we remained and still remain very dear friends. You said Mort was making very poppy, woppy stuff, and you were making other stuff. Were you all listening to what other people were doing? Oh, no, we were all very... He had just come out with Silver Apples of the Moon. He was a famous guy on Nonesuch. So, I mean, I'm saying this poppy woppy, but it was very popular poppy woppy music. It was... It was the most popular electronic music of that moment. Finally, electronic music would never become very popular. I mean, in a pure form. It's used, and it's been in Sputnik and different kinds of famous... There were pieces that came out that became... became number one that used electronic techniques, even Cher later on with the kind of voice synthesizer that I used a little bit last night, like Laurie Anderson used, but Cher. But in general, electronics is too electronic, it's too cold to ever have become popular. So why were you drawn to it? Because it was an open forum and no one had, it was totally, it's like discovering the West. It was unjust. undiscovered territory who knew what was there and who knew it I mean who knew it was going to be so sort of static and boring or that people wouldn't really have so much patience except now where like 40 years later, this young generation has integrated all these kind of, already you can have an electronic studio on your laptop and you can integrate it into a kind of like, you know, people going, like last night to a dinner and dancing and a DJ and music all together so I could play my, which I do all the time now. I played, the reason why I disappeared from the Reich. Glass, Lamont Young, John Adams, because they were all my colleagues. Why did you disappear? Because their world, I just found it so uptight. It was like Columbia, Princeton. It was just so academic, and they became so academic. It was no fun. Before we get to that, you went with Ingram to Asia around 71. Well, no, but that's because that goes back to Murtzabatnik and... and the Intermediate Center, because then, all of a sudden, Mort is invited by the director of NYU, who now I don't remember his name, but they were all invited by the Disney family to come and become the heads of the cultural part of the new school that was being developed. called the California Institute of the Arts. And so Roy Disney, without realizing it, invited, and they were considered, we were considered the cutting edge of new technology, but we were also, if you wanted to look at it from their point of view, long-haired pinko communists. And so he didn't realize that at the moment. because we did it. All those people in New York did have great reputations in the new technologies of culture, which is what Disney had been into, and he had left a whole lot of money to open a school like that. He had already had a school like that called Chouinard, but it was a small school. And now they wanted to open an enormous university on the outskirts of Los Angeles that would finally be called Valencia. And so they invited almost the entire NYU cultural part of the Intermediate Center, but even there was a bigger part. And they invited them all, gave them higher, stole them from NYU because they offered them a... They made an offer they couldn't refuse. So I went with them. So then I was asked, even more said, even though we had, we could say we had stylistic and points of view difference, and I was like a young, pain in the ass. But he saw that I was creative and all the people around us were all creative. And so we were used to that kind of like dialoguing. How were you a pain in the ass? Well, I never knew how to. First and foremost, which was one of my academia problems, is that I didn't know how to respect people of different. rank in the academic community, either by their age or by their job. So I was really a dingo. I mean, I could go at anyone. I could insult anyone. I could usurp anyone. And I still am. I mean, I'm that kind of guy. But now I'm 65. I mean, there aren't some, a lot of, well, a lot of the guys I used to, that I used to usurp are dead now. So now I'm on the top. And I don't have people, like, getting at me because I never was in an academic, I mean, I treat, I played with Mondkopf last night and we were like two guys. I don't know how old he is. He could be about a third my age. I didn't ask him. But we worked like just two guys working. And so I said, don't kill me because his machines make much more, make bigger erected sounds than mine. And so we just bantered. And I gave him a whiskey. our first thing, and then we toured, and then we just, we worked, and it just, and I've been doing, working a lot with generations from... people who are in their early 20s now to people who are 50. And it works really well. And in this new world where everyone has their own electronic music studio in their pocket, and there's this mix between dance music and... It seems like some of the people that you're working with, the ideas that you've had have finally filtered through culturally. So now there's a lot more people for you to work with. Well, this goes back. to the time when I lived on 87th Street, around the time when I became part of the intermediate studio there at NYU, is that I was living with this guy in the same building as this guy, Bob Feldman, who now, as I was told, he was a tenor player. and is now sort of one of the heads of, they call minimal jazz. He's almost, he's about 70 now. But we lived in this building on 87th Street and all around us there were like jazz musicians. We had, Pharaoh Sanders was our neighbor upstairs. My wife, I was married at that time. I had just gotten married and my wife used to take the mop and because of... Pharaoh Sanders did all that screaming. He was the saxophone player with John Coltrane who did all that screaming. So he was practicing upstairs. He was practicing, and I would sometimes come back from the Intermediate Center in the morning, and he'd be on the stoop. with his bag, he says, man, I just can't take your wife. She's driving me crazy, man. So you've been screaming, you've been doing that screaming again. But she likes that baritone stuff you do. Why don't you, when she's around, why don't you do more of that baritone stuff? And you know what happened. I don't know if you know the career of Pharaoh Sanders. He gradually gave up the screaming and he has this fantastic kind of om technique of playing like a baritone. magnificent singing style. So you're saying your wife might have had an effect. Well, everybody's wife because that screaming like drove you crazy. I'm going to have to reserve time. But anyway, and Mingus was across the street. Eumassikela and Miriam McCabe had a little like brownstone just down the street. Jimmy Garrison lived in a big apartment building just on the other side of the street. And so, for example, one day Bob... and I had apartments just right next to each other, and you could look out the window, we could look out the window and see each other on 87th Street and then look across the street. Mingus comes and he says, hey, tenor player, tenor player, hey, hey, because he would hear him rehearsing all the time in his room. That particular day, Mingus's tenor player was sick. He was playing Birdland, and he asked Bob if he'd play as a substitute. Of course, Bob said yes. But I never forgot that in jazz in those days, there was a style that you could just sort of like... call somebody and they could come and it might work out. And I was jealous of that. I mean, in those days when I was doing this now, what they call, I always called continuum music or trance. music then then that horrible minimal word came in there word that I detest because it's so mini-mean um so um now as you were saying is that I meet a guy and we can play because there's a sort of like a a style that a continuum style that We started like 45 years ago, and it's diffused and changed, of course, and become totally, but now everybody has their synthesizer in their pocket. and we could play without any special... He just listened to me. I just listened to him, and we played. And that was like they used to do, and the jazz musicians did 50 years ago. Tell me about... You were talking about California, you know, going out to California. Yeah, that was a very interesting time. was a very interesting place especially we were all so many different teachers there and influences in all the arts this goes back that there there were painters filmmakers developers of technology. Nam June Paik was there with his television guy from Japan developing new ways of doing media. So then I got involved into video. There was John Baldessari, who was early into conceptual art, and several of the New York post-abstract expressionists came, and so there was abstract expressionism. and California Conceptualism in the same school. There was Stan Brakhage and Stan Vanderbeek, the two very experimental filmmakers. There was Mort. There was... all of us who were these new Ingram. Ingram was a more academic guy because he had really been a sort of university guy, but then there were like dingoes like me. In every field there were in the dance department and there were a lot of radical people and then they had a lot of world There was a whole section that then became world music and dance And that was where how I got to Indonesia because also I had already loved Folkways records that I had taken out of the library at the Danau Library. I don't know if you knew that next to the Museum of Modern Art, and I was a bell ringer right next to the Museum of Modern Art. There's a fabulous... record library called Donnell still exists and you could in those days you could take out like five vinyls and they had a fantastic collection almost all the Folkways records of Moses Ash, who was this sort of very eccentric New York Jewish guy who thought that it would be a great idea to amass all the traces of all the lost cultures in the world and put it in a record company. and it became Folkways, and I adored those records. And so now I was in California, and I got to meet some of these people who played these musics from India and Indonesia, Bali, Java. the Led Zeppo brothers from Ghana. And so it was great. And we all lived in California too. And we actually all lived in this sort of like ghetto around the school in this place called Valencia. So Ingram and I also became, as we were assistant professors, we had more time on our hands. And so we became members of the Gamelan, the Javanese Gamelan. finally they had the Scripps family them who famous publishing family there was the black sheep of the Scripps family loved world music and dance and his wife was a Jewish Brooklyn girl who had become an Indian dancer and they gave lots of money for us to travel and we went to to Java and Bali and Thailand on a trip in 1971. You traveled with some people who took you to the music, or did you just seek it out yourself? No, no, no. We were part of that group. There was a guy called Bob Brown, who was Robert E. Brown, who had been the director of world music at Wesleyan. They had stolen a whole bunch of people. Cal Arts stole people from, as they stole people from New York University, they stole people from Wesleyan, which is a very celebrated, even now, center. You know where that is, Wesleyan, Connecticut. It's a very celebrated world music. center where they've since, I would say since 50 years, they've invited musicians and dancers from all over the world to come there, be in residence, and people go there to learn very exotic forms of music and dance. What was it about that particular music that you saw then that was so fascinating? Well, it was integrated into real life. That was what most... What I most missed in this academia and all this, you know, the Stockhausens and the Boulez's, I mean that was the epic also, even John Cage, who I got to know eventually through his mother. I met John Cage because I went to In 1964, I went to the nine evenings at the Armory, and as usual, I didn't have any money, so I snuck in. And so I was afraid that somebody would catch me, and so I used to like to find someone who I would stand next to who seemed to be irreproachable, and then they wouldn't realize. And I saw this woman in a wheelchair. And in the front part of the, because it was a big armory where they do military, indoor military maneuvers in Manhattan. And they were having nine evenings of art and technology that Billy Kluver, who I would eventually meet, and Bob Rauschenberg, who I would eventually meet, and all these different guys. So I stand next to this wheelchair with this very smiling woman who sees that I come there, and she turns and she smiles at me. Oh, hello. And then the thing starts to go on. Are you enjoying yourself this evening? a very, very, very amiable kind of woman you'd see in a church cake sale. And at a certain moment she says, well, are you enjoying this? Oh, yes, I like it. You know, you should be my son. And so, and I said, oh, yes, I must have said, well, who's your son? Well, that's my son, John. And so that's how I met John Cage. And so it was, I mean, much of the things that I learned was like on the street and people that I got to know are on the street. And then I went to different places. But what I, the thing that I always felt this sort of sadness about was the That you had to sneak in to these places, that it was part, you know, concerts, that it wasn't integrated into daily life. Okay, that's right. I didn't see it at this moment in that way. But exactly, it wasn't a tribal, it wasn't, it had no, it had very... It had very scant tribal tendencies, we could say. And I really craved something more tribal, I suppose. Which, even though when I was singing in synagogue, it was at the death of that kind of tribe, I did have a whiff, we could say. of a kind of tribalism where all those singing and moving and dancing and eating and talking and religion were all kind of integrated. And these people who were coming from India and from Indonesia and from Africa... They had this integration, things that they ate, things that they wore, things that they all knew how to do, not just one thing. You had to know how to do other things. They knew how to play several instruments. They knew how to sing as well as play. They knew how to dance as well as sing. They knew how to sculpt. In Bali, the Balinese musician was a sculptor, a painter, a musician of Balinese gamelan, a master of Balinese gamelan, a sculptor of masks. a singer of the Balinese singing tradition and of the Kachak tradition. He could do them all. Plus, he was a fantastic cook. So every time there was a festa, they would have, and so he would do all the food. He was able, he was an all-around, a total artist. And so that didn't exist in our Western tradition. And that, I thought, was I still don't know how to cook. So that's something I never got there. I never got to his level. But that's, for me, when it's integrated somehow. And even now, with this young group all together, and everybody is eating, and it's a kind of like an evening all together in this magical kind of outdoor temple like last night at the Carriera. It's something. I mean, last night wasn't the perfection of that thing, but it's a tendency that... A university doesn't or rarely offers, certainly not for people like me. I always felt like an outsider. So in this new secular world of young people, I feel like an insider. And though people tend to treat me with the respect of age, I often do my best that I'm not Sir, that was my father, and that I'm just Charlemagne, and I don't feel old or older. And Aud, my wife Aud, is the same, even though she has a certain age too. So wherever we go around the world, we're just Aud and Charlemagne, and we're another member of the big worldwide community of whatever it is that we're doing that I'm not so sure about, and that I like too because we haven't decided. It isn't all codified already. I think that last thing is important for you, not codifying things. Anything that's not codified is interesting. Well, like, for example, those pieces of Phil Glass that Bruce Brubaker played. It turns out, because Phil and I had a studio together. This was at the festival that we're at, just for people who listen. Yeah, the day before. Yeah. There was a two hours, an hour and a half concert of solo piano music of Phil Glass dating from around 1980 on. That's what Bruce told me. Well. Phil and I shared a space together. It was called the Idea Warehouse on Breed Street. A woman named Alana Heiss, who eventually founded... PS1. She was finding spaces for artists. And Phil was, we had met in Rome for a festival because I was working with a woman dancer who everybody knew in New York. She was very legendary, famous, and she still is. Simone Forti is her name. And so we were sharing the space, and I was working on what would eventually be my evolution. I had just come back from California, from CalArts. I had worked on a spectral continuum piano piece, which was a piece with arpeggios and overtone reinforcement. lasted for five hours, that I had already found the Bersendorfer there, because there was a Bersendorfer Imperial, which at the time was one of the greatest pianos in the world, and it has nine tones lower than any other piano in the world. I have one now at home. That's how I met my wife, or she had a small one from her family, because she comes from a family that has a very famous... Austrian-built ballet in Brussels, and they have Bersendorf. Okay. So he was working on his music in changing parts. and eventually would be working on Einstein on the Beach with his Farfisa organs. And I was working with the Bersendorfer. And so quickly what I want to say is that I was developing this sort of like approach to playing the piano. which last night I gave Every Piano's Different, and they asked me to play this approach because it's called strumming music, but there are like, you know, 500 strumming musics. I mean, every time I go somewhere, it's a strumming music. It's not the strumming music. And so... to get back to what I was saying. I was listening, finally, because it's rare. It's been a long time since I really listened. a long time to the music of Phil Glass or Steve Reich or either because their music for me gives me claustrophobia. I always feel like it's sort of like hemmed in. And so I was listening to an hour and a half of these certain intervals that have to be sounded. in the coat. And as usual, I was with my wife, Aud, who loved it very much. It's very pretty, melancholic, nostalgic music. But each time it always has to arrive at those same particular intervals in the same particular way. And by that time, like I have trouble sometimes with Haydn or Mozart, that it just... I feel like I'm in a prison, walking in a small room around and around, and I can't get out. And so last night I played Allah. strumming because it turned out that the piano was a nice little kawaii instrument very rare a little bit dry for me not enough overtones but very a beautiful sound and joachim the recording engineer had set up an enormous system of like six microphones on every part of the of the piano, so it resounded, though not with overtones, but the sound quality was very beautiful. And so I did an alla strumming, which dates, we could say that that dates from at least six or seven years before Phil Glass's metamorphosis pieces and things, even ten years. That's not important. The importance is that mine is an approach. It's a way of life. It's a way of approaching the instrument. It's not a treatise. And when you were saying that it's very important for me that it's not codified, yes, that is, I never thought of it in that way because I don't use that word code, but I used it today and then you picked up on it, is that that's a very major difference between me and those guys. And also with the group, the young group now that I hang out with, this entire worldwide tribe, we are touching on all kinds of things all the time and trying our best, but we don't. get bogged down or imprisoned by codes. I wanted to ask you about the Bersendorfer. You mentioned it. You love it. It's one of your favorite types of pianos. Well, I loved it because it's had a very sad and difficult evolution since I first played one in 1969 in California. It's a piano that was developed by a father and son in Vienna in the middle of the 19th century, especially for Franz Liszt, then Busoni, Johann Strauss, Richard Strauss, as they were in Vienna. And they developed, especially at the beginning, they developed for... Franz Liszt, he was someone who started by playing in salons. finished by wanting to play for lots of like ordinary people on the street. He did some of the earliest outdoor concerts in his time in the 19th century. And so he wanted to develop a piano that you could like bring out on a wagon, put it somewhere in the environment. like a town square, and then play it. And a thousand people could come and hear it. They didn't have to pay, and they didn't have to be from the upper class. That was a development that Franz Liszt was very, one of the things that he enjoyed. And so he wanted to develop an instrument as there, there were never, there wasn't yet loudspeakers or anything, an instrument that could fill a large space. And so it needed to be more resonant. And the Bersendorfer was. It was developed at that moment to be more. And he used to do pieces he loved to do sound of, like... like sound effects, what we would call now, like organs, eventually theater organs have all different things that make explosions and have drums inside of them, which would eventually be like a synthesizer. So his idea was to ask to develop, and he worked with them to develop an instrument that had this extra... octave on below and I always would wonder but what do you need? What does that do? It just makes a whole lot of noise. Exactly. Because even when he did his transcription for the 1812 Overture of Tchaikovsky, which is one because he loved to do transcription of symphonic music for the piano. There's a place where, you know, that's in the score of the 1812 Overture of Tchaikovsky. So when Liszt would play it on the piano. He could make these sounds that were a little bit like Mankov did yesterday, especially before we played together because he did such strong sounds. I said, you're going to kill me in the first five minutes. So he toned down. But it's that kind of... So now, like almost 150 or more years later... So it was a piano that was developed kind of like a synthesizer. It was the synthesizer of pianos in those days. And then it was bought eventually by an American company in the 60s. And that American company was very rich, from Indiana. And they wanted to... It was sort of like the... brainchild. The owner of this very rich company loved the instrument and he wanted to make it more and more important. He wanted to electrify it and like a kind of a the greatest player piano in the world, and he had all these ideas. And he invited many American, famous American or crazy American players to play the instrument. He got us instruments. He would make sure that our instruments were all over the world for us. And I became a Bersendorfer artist. with Cecil Taylor was a Bersendorfer artist. So imagine all these guys who did these very radical piano music. And so we had a chance to play this instrument. This instrument was fantastically resonant and had all these possibilities. And it was owned by a rich company that didn't worry about, because it never made any money. So it was a a non-profit kind of, they did it just for the technology. I did one of the earliest records ever on a player. My record, God Bear, that finally came out in the 90s, but I actually recorded it in the 80s, was done on a computer. generated um um bersendorfer where it could replay that was developed by wayne stanky at mit and things like that so um um so it's an instrument that was very interesting because it it it's a piano but it was almost like a synthesizer and now i play organs i i already developed an organ piece when i was like a teenager because an organ a pipe organ can also, in the way I play it and develop all these sounds, you can have a thousand different sounds going at the same time, coming from a thousand different sources and beating and interfacing in real air and not like from even 10 speakers or 16 speakers. 16 speakers is nothing to a thousand little voice. Think of a chorus of a thousand birds and frogs or something like that. And that's what a real good organ is. And so now I've been playing my schling and bling because for years I was forbidden. often forbidden because of churches and places like that. A weird Jewish guy playing an organ music that's scary and maybe even demonic, who knows? No, for a long time. Young people got into churches. In the days when I was younger, I couldn't get it played. But now, young people go all over to different churches and convince the... the people. So I get to play now in all the major organs and major cities in the world. But it took a long time for me to be allowed to play Schlingenbeek. You mentioned that you recorded a record in the 80s, and it was one of the first records that came out, and it came out in the 90s. And I think this is something that's been an issue for you, not so much in the past 10, 15 years, because there's been a lot of issues. No, no, no. Now I have record offers before I even have an idea. It's great. It's great. But in those days, no, from the 70s, well, anyway, in the 60s and 70s, for you to have a record was an amazing, there wasn't internet, there wasn't CDs, there wasn't, it was a very, it was very hard to have a record. Who got in touch 15 years ago and sort of changed the state of affairs? Who got in touch? Several people. It was a sort of a kind of a collaboration between Glenn Branca. Sonic Youth, a company that was already existing in Holland called Baruni, and they had a subsidiary called Stalplat. Why do you think around that time... that people are like, oh, we forgot about him. Yeah, no, that's what happened. People's... It started to be everybody, it's me, me, me, me, me, went on for about five, seven, ten years. And then those me, me, me people grew up a little bit and they started to look back. And I was on the list of the, you know, him, him, him. So I became one of the, I wasn't the first him they went back to, but I was one of the hims. And that I had really disappeared. But it turned out that there was just, for example, Glenn Branca and Lee Rinaldo had bootlegged and some of the couple of the lounge listeners, there was a whole group of people. At the end of when I started, gave up to play. I had a Bersendorfer in my studio in Soho and my last pieces were very violent, almost because I was terribly depressed. I was on the way out of that. I couldn't see how I'd ever make a living in this, playing an instrument like that and in that kind of atmosphere, etc. And that was just when they were inventing punk. And so it turned out that a bunch of those guys in those last concerts that I gave that were maybe 10 of them, there were thieves with cassette players. And what happened is that when the new period of looking back, those cassettes, it wasn't just a dream. They had actual proof that this crazy guy had been doing these amazing things once upon a time. Who were some of the other forgotten names? Was it Tony Conrad? Tony Conrad. I remember Table of the Elements put out a big box set of his around that time. I'm not really sure because we all... I mean, none of us kept in much in... I didn't see Tony for years and years. I started to work only with my animals, living in Switzerland. Happily, I had a... a couple of rich Swiss crazy sponsors in those days that got me through a few years here and there. So you basically gave up music? For more than 10 years, yeah. In fact, even when they tried to, are you the, no, no, no, I'm not the, no, no, I'm just a sculptor with stuffed animals. I don't know from nothing. No, no, it's true. What convinced you? What convinced you? All those guys. Everybody started to come and bug me. It was just enough of them came and bugged you. Enough of them came and bugged me. And I liked who they were, what they were asking me for. And so we tried it out and it worked. And a lot of them were coming to Europe. They too, even in there, had to survive in Europe. And I adore Europe. I always adored Europe. From the very first time I came back, I say came back to Europe because my family was born in Europe. I came to this new Europe. I loved Europe. I mean, there's nothing like being in France. I've lived in several places in France in the last 40 years. I love... I love living in Europe. There's nothing like... New York is okay, too, and San Francisco I like because it's so European. And now you live in Brussels. Now I live in Brussels because my wife is... is from Brussels. And though I had a career already early in Brussels in the early 70s, I had already been invited several times because one of the most famous artists from Brussels loved my work in those days. He was the cartoonist Hergé, who invented Tintin. He loved my piano pieces because for him they were like adventures. And I used to do them there. They always got me the best Bersendorfers in Belgium in the early 70s. So I never lived there, but I was there on a regular basis. And then I met my wife because of friends I had already met in the 70s. And I met my wife, Aude, in the... late 90s and we haven't separated only for several days at a time since. What's left for you? You've done so much, but you're still working with all of these young people. Yeah, so everything's left for me. Everything's left for me. Yeah, I just need to be, you know, I have to live long enough. It just was a lot of wasted years, I think. I mean, interesting, because I'm different now. I do things better than I did back then, because maybe because I see all the, I see everything in 360 degrees now. Where I used to see it much less, I didn't see it in three or four dimensions. I saw things more in two dimensions. How did it open up? Well, all the difficult, I mean, I saw how it could be, how anything can be destroyed, built. and everything in between, I have a much bigger viewpoint of how things can fuck up, for example. So I'm a master of being able to unfuck up things before they're fucked up. Because I already see exactly, because I've been there. I'd already seen how it's been fucked up like that at least 10 times. So I don't want to see it an 11th time now. And now I know how to prepare. for that fuck-up, which could have been the 11th. It happened even last night. I changed totally the way I was going to perform at the last minute, because I was having trouble with Joachim and the voice, because I wanted to do a piece more about the voice and the synthesizer, and then there was... Munkoff, who had his killer machine, which is like a transformer that can devour you in two seconds. I said, how am I going to... what am I going to do with all of this? And then it turned out that by listening the night before to the piano that Joachim had especially created another kind of a weapon with that piano because I had planned, oh no, I'm not going to play piano. They're not going to. Put me in this piano thing with all these electronic musicians and shit. I started it long before the piano was with electronics. And so I had this whole idea in my head. And the voice. And I'll make it sound like a crazy monster voice. And no, it didn't work. So the piano and Zoom at the last second. I said... I'll show the approach. Already people have listened the night before to two different approaches to piano, and mine predates all those things, and it's an approach. It's not a mode, but it's an approach. and let's see if we can integrate it into electronics, which is what I always had wanted to do, which is something that Glass or Reich never tried to do, and things like that, which I've always liked, and I still try to bring all these very strange and... disparate elements together and it worked.
