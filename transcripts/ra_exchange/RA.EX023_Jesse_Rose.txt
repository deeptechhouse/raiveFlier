Well now. Well now. Well now. Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Johnny Coleman, and I'm a freelance writer for Resident Advisor. Front Room, Made to Play, and Play It Down label head Jesse Rose is a hyphenate DJ, artist, producer, and label chief that seems to have always been in the right place at the right time. From the rough streets of West London to the burbs of Bristol or adding some Jack and House to the techno-filled clubs of Berlin, Jesse has always had an ear for freshness. Recently, we spent some time talking about the F-word, clubs and drugs, and creative restlessness. You're 30? 32. 32. You look very spry. There's been a lot of stuff going on. I mean, it's been, you know, we'll talk about that, but you started a little bit earlier than most, I think, but you grew up in the UK. So tell us what that's like, especially for people who aren't, you know, who haven't been to London or haven't lived there before. I was brought up like near Labrador Grove, which is like a really cool multicultural kind of area. Just kind of like in a kind of dodgy housing estate. But it was loads of fun. I mean, there's like music blasting, reggae sound system. you know, people dancing outside of houses to reggae sound systems on the way to school. There was always, like, there would be a punk party going on next door to my house, so, like, most people would see it as, like, you know, you come from, like, an underprivileged in America or a poor area or something, but for me it felt, like, really vibrant and exciting. and just sort of looking back on it now definitely gave me such a big scope because to be around punks next door and then reggae sound systems and then my dad playing soul and funk and stuff at home and you know there was jam sessions happening in my house because my dad was a musician it was definitely yeah a great musical start to it all. Your dad was a full-time player, so he was just always playing in the clubs or at home and had musicians in town. Was he traveling a bunch? Yeah, my dad, yeah, he used to travel around, play, like, small clubs. He'd also, like, he'd just go, like, busk in the street in, like, Italy or something. But really, for him, like, music was... was always not about was about doing it for the the joy of doing music so like he'd been offered a contract like in the 70s for a crazy amount of money that looking back on it he probably should have taken but there was a clause in there that said he could that they could change some of the lyrics. And he was always a poor guy. He was brought up as an orphan. He had a hard life. But he had really a high... He had good morals, high morals. And he turned down the contract. And he was poor his whole life in terms of money. But he was always really happy because he was always playing music and he loved playing music. So having that whole jam sessions and great musicians coming through the house. I mean, he played with a lot of like, you know, different great musicians from like Motown type people to to like. rocky type people it was just it wasn't not necessarily that all of those people were like super famous but they were you know some great musicians coming you're growing up there i just imagine it being like a pretty like boisterous kind of loud neighborhood is that is it like in pretty like what part what part of london is that exactly it's west yeah west london yeah um yeah boisterous yeah it was definitely um Yeah, you definitely had to be careful. There was definitely, you know. Was it predominantly black? Yeah, it was mostly black. But, I mean, when I went to school, I was one of a handful of white kids at my school. And there was, you know, but it wasn't, it was black, Moroccan, Asian. It was the whole world in, you know, in a class. So, yeah, it was definitely a very mixed up neighborhood. I mean, when I was a kid, actually. Like I remember growing when I was growing up that I was always scared of like the punks like in the skinheads They were like if I was walking along the street and there was a group of like, you know black guys and there's a group of like Skinheads walking on the road I would definitely go over to where the black guys are because the way that I was dressed and everything you would know that I was I Was definitely not a punk. I mean so like I would be safe on the other side of the street you know like and in those days it wasn't you know it was there was definitely like musical related gangs uh-huh yeah and this is the 80s right yeah this is the 80s this is the 80s this is like late late late 80s late 80s so you said musical gangs i mean yeah i mean you could define and and still i imagine in london you define you could define the gangs by what music they're into because how they dress is what music they're into. So, you know, so obviously the skinheads are into a certain type of music. You've got the Rude Boys dressed back in the day. They were wearing like yellow Versace jackets and, you know, whatever, real smart. But, quite tacky Italian designer clothes and they would be like the dudes who are into drum and bass and then you see the dudes in baggier clothes and you know and then in West London it was more mixed up it wasn't so said great but you could really see who was from where the ravers are wearing like day glow clothes it's like you know so yeah it was it was definitely like gangs of music and something we'll talk about as we go along whether there's whether it's an artist or as a producer or whatever the difference is like insert error as a label had um it seems like there's always been an element of otherness of you being kind of surrounded by certain things but always being kind of like representing something that's at least at least slightly different or how You know how mixed perspectives are like, these are the sounds that are going on, but my personal experience is a little bit different at least. I think, yeah, I mean, I don't analyze myself too much about... how I produce records or I've always just gone into the studio and made a record that I'm feeling that day and I wouldn't tell you why I chose that particular sample or the record went in that particular way and the same with my DJing like it's not I'm definitely in my DJing I could say I was more influenced by DJs that I heard that I loved and by producers. When I'm making records, it's definitely just a feeling that I have towards just making whatever comes. when I go to the studio. And so some people will say, oh, I can really hear whenever you produce a record, it's by you. And I think, well, that's pretty mad because I've made techno records, house records, hip hop records. Like, you know, I don't stay in a particular genre. I like, you know, I kind of mix up the genres a little bit. So yeah, maybe that's due to kind of being a mixed up kid. Yeah, totally. I mean, I That's definitely, I mean, it's in a lot of producers or people that are very specific and it's something we talked about, but it's, you know, it's everyone is, I was reading something about boys noise the other day. It's like when you say boys noise, you think of probably one specific sound, even though. Yeah, even though. Everyone's got a range or whatever it is. And especially people, you know, you don't want to have. At the same time, I think. I've been really lucky because most people are stuck in genres, you know, like he's a minimal producer, he's a house producer, he's a techno producer, where I've worked with and feel so lucky to have worked with such a range from, you know, from Henrik Schwartz being regarded as this great techno deep house guy to Hot Chip, a band, to Derek Carter, the Chicago house sound, you know, to Dave Angel doing whatever it might be. You know, it's like I feel like. The fact that I haven't, my sound is mixed and influenced by so many different things almost gives me acceptance in loads of different areas, you know? It means that I can go and play at Cocoon with Sven and I can go to play at Parklife with Missy Elliott. You know what I mean? So that, you know, it definitely feels to me like a plus as we talk about it. Right. Yeah, and this is maybe more just editorializing, but I feel like, you know, obviously in the States over here, we have dance music communities aren't as big and as developed, I feel like, as in parts of Europe and like the Far East. And it seems like in those places where it's taken more seriously, I think you might be more, I feel like you might be more likely to find just like these genre purists. people who like you know time like only techno only house or like the techno verse deep house yeah yeah yeah it's it's nice to be like in an environment where it's not like the lines aren't so serious because because it's you know people aren't as educated or don't care as much about the difference between techno and house yeah house house and that and i think and i think realistically i probably also as a producer As a DJ, I think that my sounds continually stayed within house music. So, you know, the people that come to see me play kind of know how I'm going to play. I might play slightly deeper someday. I might play more crazy another day. But it's all within a certain sort of vibe. Whereas as a producer, it's kind of funny when I think about it because, you know, You're All Over My Head was like... a kind of almost crazy minimal record that just dropped into a folk break but went into so a lot of like you know at the time a lot of the minimal guys were playing that record and then I'll make Well Now which could have easily been like a toothpaste advert or something do you know what I mean but it's love you know it's got you know loads of love from like house people and whatever so It doesn't matter if you go or you stay. It doesn't matter at all. I made my mind up. I'm going away and there's no use crying. I don't know. I probably, I probably like make as many people happy as I depress them with the next release. Right. Well, what you're saying is a DJ is more locked into kind of how this is all the overall big picture of how all these. 40, 60, 100 records work together and like, where as a producer you don't have to worry about that. You can just be like, here's this one record and you figure it out. - Yeah, I mean, I can put like a stripped back record together with a crazy record and build that into a three hour set. Whereas like, most people would go, oh that. isn't quite part of my sound like I play this sound so yeah I think but the thing is I think as a producer if you've made one record that someone really loves they'll kind of follow you from that you know so like people who loved something I did on Classic back in the day like Sneak might not love some of the releases, but will always wait and find, wait for a good release to come back because they look, you know, like for me, I love Pepe Braddock and Pepe Braddock might go off and do a record, which I find way too deep that I can't play, but I'll still check it because I know that, you know, he'll come up with another record that I will be able to play. So we're back in West London. You're growing up. We were talking about how like, you know, just all the different vibes. It's not just white. Obviously, it's not just black. It's just kind of this multi-culti mishmash and kind of rough, but you were safe because you were, you know, part of that community. You weren't an outsider. No one's going to mess with you. But you said there were like sound systems on the streets and pirate radio and all these other elements. So can you talk about some of those like Well, yeah, it was all in certain time periods, so it kind of started out, like, the earliest stuff I remember listening to was, like, my dad playing, like, funk records, like, soul records. Like, I remember being really young and him playing, like, Royer's Everybody Loves the Sunshine and just, like, being, like, five or something, do you know what I mean? Dancing. Like, there used to be, like, parties outside my house and those kind of records were being played I remember like my dad would wake up every day like blasting music so I would always wake up to music so there was a period where he was like playing cameo like I remember She's Strange like being kind of corny but but also just really happy like just positive music I like the way she walks, I like the way she talks, and she turns me on with a special concern. Now I'm a different guy and I don't compare to many, but next to her I'm plain ordinary. Not many can see the light blue aura that surrounds the girl wherever in the world. She's a 9, a 10, a 20, 50, she's bittersweet and a taco treat. She's great, and I like it. Just the way she is Strange Walking down the avenue She's strange Always doing something new She's the kind of person everybody knows Sort of from there, like, I suppose, walking to school at the ages of, like, seven, eight, hearing these reggae sound systems. um you know all that kind of sound system music um and then as it as i got older going sort of 12 13 14 pirate radios early hardcore drum and bass who was running who who were running these pirate radio stations in your area what was styles i mean it was and that Again, it was that whole, why I think English dance music is so great is because it was so mixed up. You had Kiss FM at the time, which was a pirate radio station with like Judge Jules playing like solo, doing a solo and funk show. And then like, you know, Groove Rider and all these, Colin Dale, Colin Faber, techno guys playing early, Balearic House and whatever. And then I wouldn't really listen to that too much. Like in my area, it was more about drum So I'd be listening to stations like Don FM, listening to Sunrise. They'd be drum and bass from Friday to Sunday morning, and then Sunday morning they'd start playing house music. But house music was super uncool. Like, you wouldn't tell anyone you listened to the house shows on Sunday. Why is that? It was just the culture. I mean, like, you know, drum and bass. I mean, drum and bass really did express how we felt at the time. It was like, you know, it was kind of dangerous. It was dodgy. We were starting to go out to, like, illegal parties at the age of sort of 13, 14. It's probably the same in America. I mean, if you come out of like... I mean, my area wasn't like Compton, do you know what I mean? But if you come out of an area which is heavy, you listen to music which relates to that area, you know? And each area has its sound. And definitely for my area, it was drum and bass and before, like, hip-hop and, you know, just urban music that derived from black music. Yeah, it seems like... House is kind of a hard sell to 13 or 14 year old boys, especially whether you're gay or straight or whatever It's just like it seems like it's more an aggressive time period. Not even not even even if you were 20 and 23 Like, you know, whatever age you were coming from the blocks where I live you would not listen to house music man like house music was just I mean because the thing is you can't screw your face up to house music and drum and bass was like you put your base on you screw your face up you walk down the road you're kind of always ready for a fight or something happening is there's you know, you're ready for something and that puts you in the mood of like being ready for something. So do you find yourself listening to that much drum and bass these days or it depends just to switch it up? I listen to everything. Generally, I just, generally I listen to everything that's not house music. So I listen to, I mean, yeah, drum and bass, a lot of hip hop. I listen to like a lot of different. music also in terms of sampling so like but I want to I kind of listen to the all the tracks on a daily basis to kind of get into that so I might go for a time of listening to bulk and funk or I might go for a time of listening to like mad French folk music or I might go at the moment I'm listening to like loads of old-school hip-hop and loads of funk and Yeah, so it always kind of changes. You are... You're a teenager now, you're in London, and then at some point you start playing records first. Yeah, well, what happened was my mum moved out of London. She moved to Bristol, and... Basically because, you know, the school I was going to was pretty rowdy. There was metal detectors, people weren't really working, most kids couldn't read and write. I was kind of getting a bit into crime and whatever. And it was like, look, we've got to get you out of London and get you into school. So she took me out of London, which I absolutely hated when I was like 12. And she took me to Bristol and to an area which was completely white. which made absolutely no sense to me at all and I hated it, I absolutely hated it but one good thing that came from that was that one day I was walking through a park and I bumped into a friend that I knew when I was like really young a guy called Jamie Anderson and I went round to his house he was like four or five years older than me and he was he was playing like house records and techno records and was making these records and and really that was a life-changing moment because I didn't think you know I had no idea that I was going to go into doing music so yeah at that point I started getting him I started getting introduced to all like you know Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson Orlando Vaughan, you know, Strictly Rhythm, like, Relief Records, a real mishmash of, like, of, like, tougher Chicago stuff and techno-y stuff, and I was still playing drum and bass and hip-hop at that time and still going back up and down from London, this was, like, about when I was 14, going to London on the weekends, going back with my gang of crews, like... record shopping at like black market records which is like the cool drum and bass stores to go um and then but i could never get a gig in bristol because no one was listening to hip hop or jamaica so what were the kids your age listening to in bristol i mean they they're definitely there was definitely a drum and bass scene in Bristol I mean actually in the irony of it is that Bristol was massive on trip hop hip-hop and drum and bass but the the guys that were my friends were all putting on house and techno parties and so getting plays when you're 15 like a drum and bass party is a pretty hard it's like I mean I managed to do it a couple of times but it's a pretty hard thing to get into so I just started getting into house music I love like In the Detroit techno stuff, there was all these synths that were really similar to drum and bass and started making records with Jamie Anderson and doing that kind of sound and slowly just kind of got into that sort of sound until I was like 18. So was everything a co-production essentially? Yeah, at that time, even if I produced it myself, Jamie would engineer it for me. And what were you guys, just technically, what were you guys composing on and what were you guys doing? It was like insane analogs, you know, Mackie 24 track desks and Akai samplers and Cuba. And I mean, I remember really as a stoned moment at like 15, like just looking at a button and thinking, is this actual computer on or not? And just pressing the button. and switching off the whole computer, which lost Jamie about a week of a track that he was working on. Because back then you couldn't save the track, do you know what I mean? It was all linear. It was all, it was, yeah, everything. You couldn't work on multiple tracks. So as soon as you shut that down, you've lost mixes. And it was really, yeah, a big fight endured. And, you know, I probably deserved what I got. So, yeah, I'm quite happy that we moved out of that full analogue time. But are you glad? I feel like a lot of the people... you know, around our ages, they've kind of grew up whether in a lot of different creative film fields that were had to grew up learning analog stuff. And they were at the tail end of when that was a necessity. And then, you know, we're there when all these new nonlinear software based things were being developed. And so you have those like hard knocks where you had to know how to do it. So it makes you appreciate it, right? And like an intellectual way, but you're happy to have. To be honest, in those days I was really thinking, I don't know if I'll ever become a producer because this is so bloody complicated because you've got to learn how to use a mixer, a compressor, a sampler, Cubase. all the other outboard effects and you know each of these things takes a while to learn I mean it was a complicated process the sound was great you had like you know a really really true sound but but the whole setup was just a nightmare so I was just co-producing and I never really I didn't ever think I thought look I'm a DJ I love DJing I was I was Really, I was still at a time when there was DJs that just DJed. And I was just making tunes because it was fun. So it wasn't the days where you had to make a record to be a DJ. It was like, if you were a good DJ, you were getting booked. So I never thought about that I was going to go off and have to learn it myself. And that kind of came later because... I moved to London when I was 18. Started, you know, building up my DJing back in London. Still going back to Bristol to work with Jamie and stuff. And then around 21, 22. So this is the 90s, right? We're in the 90s. We're... in the early 90s maybe maybe it's even the beginning yeah late 90s okay it'd be late yeah no it'd be even actually early 2000s okay because we're talking about we're talking about 30 yeah we're talking about 14 years ago 12 years ago I met I went out to a party and I met I met Switch Dave Taylor um and we got drunk and he was really into like a sort of house sound and I was more into this techy kind of Chicago sound and we were like let's make records together so we started working on a project together, Indusive, which we spent a year making our first release for Classic and it was all about making a record that Derek Hart would play. We made it, Derek Carter signed it, we went and saw him play it, it was called Jazz Chops, No Hangups. you But after a while, Dave was like, look, you know, I don't really think this is working how I basically am having to sit there and program everything and you're coming in with samples and directions. I think it would really be a lot better if we could just work together. So I'll make a bit, you make a bit, I'll make a bit, you make a bit. And I was like, that's still kind of reluctance. Do I really have to go and learn how to do this? And he was kind of like, look, I tell you, you don't have to learn how to do it, but then we won't work together. So I was like, okay, cool. So I went off for like three months and sat in my house, which at the time was like... electricity run on a key I remember like just sitting in my house in complete darkness charging my computer on the next door neighbours like with an extension lead to the next door neighbour and learning how to do it and how thankful can I be to like to Dave now for making me do that because because it gave me the confidence to make records myself and also to make records with him, make records with a guy that I super admire as a producer and engineer. It seems yeah, it seems like some of these early experiences are like situations where someone's like, you know It's like almost like a punishment or something like, you know like when you had to move to Bristol for a while and then or it's like Dave saying you can't I'm not gonna do this until you come back and some tough love and you have to go figure this out and I figure anything out I don't by yourself seems really tough, but it's like once you go push through it It's like great now. I I often feel like the unluckiest and luckiest person in so many ways. I've had so much, you know, meeting Dave at that moment, totally the right moment, and for us to work together and learning, super lucky. Him making me go and spend three months learning how to use Logic at the time and not being able to write records felt very unlucky. But then coming back and, you know, again, I mean, talking about luck, I mean, Front Room was started 10 years ago. I'd met a guy in a bar. I was managing a bar. I was 20. I don't know why they let me manage a bar at 20. And I met a guy in a bar who had sold me this dodgy half gram of coke. And I'd taken it and I'd given it to some friends and they were like, man, how could you bring us such bad drugs? And so I called up this dude and I was like, mate, you just ripped me off. You need to come and sort this out. So this is a really honest story. He came back to the bar. And he gave me a grammar code back in the days when I did drugs. And... And I thought, oh, that's pretty cool. You know, you're like a decent guy. You kind of fucked it up, but now you've come back and you're a decent guy. And then this, I ended up becoming mates with him. We ended up going out a lot together. And he basically said, look, I'll give you the money to start a label if you start a label for me as well. So I started Front Room, which was for me, and I started Lounging, which was for a lot of the West London acts also with Jazzanova and great, great label still runs today. Right. And that was an important time for that. Those styles. And that was massive. I mean, we were, we were putting on nights like for like 2000 people with every big broken beat artist. And that was really for him. And like, but how lucky am I to meet a guy who has enough money to invest and trust me to invest. 30,000 pounds at the time or 40,000 you know in the time when you were having to press up a load of records and the stuff that you needed to do to do it. So, so like a really, again, just a really lucky meet. And, and yeah, so that really started off the whole, the whole labels thing. And through those, through having the labels, this was, you know, 10 years ago, I, I started getting people I knew and other people involved in the labels and this started a big relationship. So at that time. I met Trevor Lovies out and I connected Trevor Lovies with Switch, who was actually Solid Groove at the time. They started Switch. It was Trevor Lovies and Dave Taylor. And then at one point, Trevor was in another thing, doing something else, and Dave took over the name. So at this time, it was very exciting. It was about eight years ago in West London. that all of these different characters came together and we all just started making like very different sort of house music which later got tagged as fidget you know and the whole fidget thing was really funny because like me and Switch, me and Dave in a pub getting drunk going, I bet you if I wrote on my press release a name of a genre and you wrote on your press release a name of a genre, that suddenly we would be able to have a genre just as a complete piss take. And so I released This Is Sick and he released A-Sided, my single on Dubsided. this is sick solid group production so in fact weird that we both released each other's productions on our own like our own labels yeah um do a lot of there's a reason a lot of people do that label heads just because they don't want to have to promote their own thing they want someone else to do that i feel like for me i mean dave is the best anr man in the world like he's the strictest producer he'll he'll come in and go look that's terrible that's crap It's like having the highest seal of quality by producing for his label and I just managed to black him always to produce on my label. So that's kind of the relationship that it's been, you know, like. Or, you know, This Is Sick was supposed to go to another label and I was like, look, I really love it. Let me release it. No one's going to get this record. It will probably sell five copies, but let me put it out. It ended up selling 25,000 copies and being one of the biggest records of the year. So I don't know if that makes me a really bad A&R or a good A&R. I think it's good. So, yeah, so going back to what I was saying, so we both put on a press release that this word fidget, and it kind of made sense at the time. I mean, we were making records that just didn't start and end the same. And at that point, every house record was a looped up disco record that started and ended and you knew what it was going to do. And then suddenly we would just start chopping things about and it sounded a bit odd, but it was all a joke. It was all about, did you really just put a folk sample in this like minimal beat? Did you really just, you know, play a bass line that's like doom, doom, doom, doom, one finger bass line that drops into like a sample of whatever Britney Spears or something, but you couldn't tell it. Thank you. And then suddenly, from these two releases, you know, all the magazines are like, there's a new genre, Fidget House is born, check it out. At the beginning, it was cool. I mean, we were like, this is mad, you know. We're like, you know, we're DJing all over the world now. There's other producers getting involved in the sound. Crookers are coming through and Hervé and Sindon. And suddenly there's actually a big... genre of people um and at that time i left i went to berlin it was um this was when exactly 2003 this this was about six years ago so yeah i mean i moved to berlin at that time because i was really into house music that kind of chopped up and did different things but I wasn't really interested in in making this really massive big room big festival sound you know I mean like it was more about like Chicago records that kind of twisted about and were a bit odd and having fun with it but it started not being a joke producers started making these records as serious records And then to me, it was like, well, that's just cheesy house then, isn't it? I mean, it was in the point that with the, you know, the eclecticism, the eclecticism of the sampling and just kind of the left, the left turns you take it with some of the choices in those earlier records. didn't that kind of make it more fun and kind of take some of the serious stuff out of it? And that's why people responded to it because it was... Going out to clubs, the whole point of going out to clubs is to go and have fun. It's Saturday night. You've worked really hard all week. You work in a supermarket. You work wherever you work. You've worked hard. You want to go out and have fun. And I think I still feel like that. I think that it's great to have but I also think there needs to be elements of different things coming in, an element of surprise, an element of fun. And so that was really what we were doing. And it was just also a really big in-joke where we would watch massive German DJs playing records. This Is Sick was a piss-take record. This Is Sick was done as a joke. it wasn't a serious record and suddenly people are playing it as this serious like almost electro record and it was like this is really mad like these so now the you know it came to a point where I had to kind of get out of it. And the move to Berlin was definitely not about getting into the Berlin sound and getting into that, but actually at the time, you know, my girlfriend had been beating up on the street at three o'clock in the afternoon for her phone and, you know, I had a couple of things with crack. and I'd been living in West London for most of my life and I just fancied a change and I had some friends in Berlin, it was nice, easy. place to live the airport was amazing let's go yeah so um and then I moved to Berlin and and and again just talking about being super lucky I moved to Berlin and and Panorama Bar and you know Bergheim guys were really interested in the fact that I was doing something slightly different but would still work with what they you know with in their parameters You know what strikes me as funny? I was thinking about that today too, is that, because it's, it was a Friday night. - Or is it Saturday night? - Saturday. - I just felt it was funny that downstairs you've got more just like the depraved, hyper gay scene, but it's techno, and then upstairs you've got a lot of house related stuff that you're playing, and that's the mixed crowd, which I thought was funny. - But actually when I started playing at Panorama Bar five years ago, whenever it opened, it was actually more like a cosmopolitan gay crowd upstairs in Panorama Bar. and more of the bare fetish crowd downstairs. And so it wasn't so mixed up. It was still quite a gay club, but obviously everyone had heard about this really exciting club and started to, you know, started to fly over every weekend on EasyJet. And so it became more of a mixed club. I mean, it's still one of the most, if not the most difficult clubs to get into in the world. there's you definitely I think there was someone told me it was 70% of the people don't get in so you might see a queue of 2,000 people right and the night might not be absolutely rammed inside because the quality control is it's kind of about choosing I've I've always thought it was about choosing just people that you know look like they've gone out to party look like they're not there to pull girls they're not there to get really drunk they're there to to go and party and that's probably why I've had the best times DJing in that club. Kind of going back to that move to Berlin. Like, I moved to Berlin with really worried. I'm moving away from my crew that are blowing up, you know, that are starting to remix all major artists and stuff like that. You know, Dave Taylor, Trevor Lovies, all these guys are staying in West London. They're still, I'm moving over to Berlin. What am I doing? Why am I doing this? This is the worst decision I've ever made. And I arrive and the first week I go and have a meeting with Panorama and they're like, look, we'd really love you to do a night. what would you like to do? And I said, oh, well, I'm just starting this label called Made to Play. It'd be great to have like a Made to Play night, but I want to do a Saturday. I don't want to do a Friday. Now, all the label nights at that time were on Fridays. And I said, I want to do a Saturday because the Saturday was a more mixed crowd. It wasn't, it wasn't purists on a Saturday. It wasn't like, it was still super music heads but it wasn't, Fridays were like a very minimal, very like a certain sort of sounding so I started doing the first night on a Saturday and it really took off. I mean it was just the right time at the right place. There was no other house nights apart from the Innovisions night you know so to go into a place which is normally playing minimal. and start playing, you know, solid groove records or classic records or whatever, lots of energy, it really, you know. It felt to me like when I was 12 going out to these early raves, the excitement in the room, people on people's shoulders, you know, it felt like playing gigs at some points. It felt like being in a band and playing at a gig because the whole crowd's just going nuts. So that was part of it. So that was a great start. And then at the same time, Get Physical contacted me and they were like, would you like to do a compilation? And that was really great because it... it kind of, I could show what I was doing to a different crowd, to different sort of people that probably wouldn't know about this whole West London crazy house thing. And it's funny because I re-listened to that recently. I hadn't listened to it in a while, but it works. But it, you know, it makes sense in that with what they were doing and what they're known for. Yeah. And it seems to be like a through line and like, it just, it works. I think. There are enough similar elements. I don't know what they are necessarily, but it works. At the time, I really couldn't see what, any connection with it. I mean, I didn't, I put one record from their label on the compilation, but from that moment, they then went off and signed Nose and signed like, you know, and had all these different, and it. I could, you know, they're very open to different types of music, those guys, you know, and in a way they're very un-Berlin in that way. They're not that super one sound focus. So yeah, so I'd arrived in Berlin the first week, residency at Panorama for May to Play, compilation for Get Physical and debugged the big magazine of Germany, said, look, we'd like to... to put you on the front cover. So, what a welcome hamper that was. Yeah, where do you go from there? Yeah, where do you go from there? And you were embraced because it was different, right? It was fresh to them in general? Yeah, it was just, you know, honestly, it wasn't very difficult to be very different at that time because, you know, everyone was very focused on a very deep sound. And at that moment, the whole of the club, the club scene around the world was very minimal techno. It was minimal techno or it was hard electro or it was, you know, trance-y sounds, whatever. And so it was really easy for me. You know, house clubs were still going. And also, I was on that circuit of minimal DJs, but playing house music, which is really easy, because you've got a guy before you just playing totally tracky, and you go on and play a recluse record. Everyone goes nuts, because it's just like, bang, it's just like bright. It's like energy. There's contrast. Yeah, the contrast of it. So my job at that time was really easy. I mean, now everyone plays house. You know, now it's like, you Well, to be honest, I'm going to start playing minimal techno now. Exactly. Yeah. It's like, there's like a contrarian element because you don't want it to be the same thing everyone on the 10 clubs down the block are doing. At the same time, if every, you know, at one point I remember people saying, are you pissed because like everyone's saying that they've always played house and you know you've been you know like a real you know advocator and a guy that's really stayed in within that house genre especially as a DJ and I was like nah I'm really happy because I stopped taking drugs like five years ago traveling so much it's impossible to you know to constantly get on planes while being paranoid of police dogs and whatever. And so, and at that time, you know, it was a lot of really tripped out after parties and stuff. When you're not on drugs, that really is boring. It's probably the most... It's like watching, for me, watching paint dry. I actually remember the day, going to see Ricardo on a Sunday and him just dropping loads of Strictly rhythm and vocals and watching everyone go nuts and thinking, how can these same people that were listening to paint dry... be into this music but they were they got it and and from that point onwards i can go out now you know three days without sleeping because the music's great so i'm really happy of this house music revolution well it's like what you said earlier i think um if someone wins you over with one record whether it's a producer but as a dj if they win you over with one experience or just their general reputation you could have the two the same two guys playing the same records And if they believe in you, then they're willing to kind of go with it. Otherwise, they'll be very, especially I feel like in Berlin, very arms crossed. You're so right. I mean, many times it happens that I go and DJ and the resident DJ is playing amazing. You know, like I'm like, literally like, I want to know what everyone thinks. record he's playing is and he's totally in it and you know everything he's totally spot on but he's a resident DJ no one's really dancing it's like he's getting no reactions he stops as soon as he stops I go on this is my fifth gig of the weekend I'm holding it just together no sleep whatever and people are going nuts because they've decided that you are the reason why they've come to the club that you are you know it's DJing and this whole scene is a lot about perception. You know, there's, you know, people perceive when you go to see Ricardo, he's like, you know, this really crazy, drugged up, like, whatever dude who's going to take you on this mad journey that isn't focused on what he looks like, that is going to, you know. And so... that gives him the freedom to go wherever he wants to go near enough. You know, it gives you, and the same, you know, I have that same thing in certain places in the world I play and I really feel like I can, you know, at Panorama Bar, I have no constraint at Panorama Bar. If I want to play for six hours and I want to... to take it down to 100 BPM and then take it all the way up to some hard, like mad Detroit techno and then play a disco record. As long as I'm taking them on the journey, I feel so relaxed in doing it and I feel like I've built the trust that I can actually just go and do what I love, you know? Yeah, and it seems like probably around the time there was a big spike in you being in demand probably after the whole body language and Made to Play was launched. And it seems like last year was another big year for you touring where you were playing like 150, something like that. - Yeah, 110 gigs last year, it was pretty quick. In fact, it actually just happened like, you don't really remember how clearly, there's never a defining moment. I've DJed for, what is it, 17 years. I couldn't tell you exact defining moments. It all kind of blends in. But I remember just putting out the A-sided records, you know, seven years ago. And then suddenly offers came into play, you know, around Europe. And then it started getting bigger. At one point, and it was about five years ago, I was touring the world and I didn't know how it had kind of happened. Actually, I mean, going back to why I stopped taking drugs, I was touring the world really heavily, playing four to five times a week. flying from Australia back to, you know, I'd fly from Australia back to Berlin. Two days later, I'd fly off to do an American tour, come back, fly, you know, and never taking breaks and just caning it and partying and having an absolutely great time. And then I just got really ill. I lost, I got an inner ear virus and I couldn't walk for a month. I stopped and I went, you know what, like something has to give. And that's the thing, you know, you have to, something has to give. And at that moment I was really like, if I'm going to carry on doing this, I've really got to look at how I can do it. And what's more important is more important going out and taking drugs all the time and partying. And, and, or is it more important that you get to go out and do what you really love, which is music and seeing different places so at that moment I said look this is an easy decision all of that stuff I've had the best time ever it's been amazing you know I know how it is to be on pretty much everything and now I can and since then I can now go around I mean I'm an alcoholic so I mean it's not like it's not like it totally stopped but you know I feel like I'm on a level now and maybe that's why it was blurred before I'm on a level now where I could kind of tell you when different things have happened and stuff whereas before it was just a mishmash of things happening and you know I don't know how I was getting to countries. Yeah, just on autopilot. I mean, a great story. I remember being with my girlfriend and doing the night at Panorama Bar and I'm getting a call from Rob Mello and Rob Mello's saying, look, where are you? I can't find you. And I'm like, yeah, I'm here. I'm in the club, but I don't know where I am. And my girlfriend's saying, no, we've left the club. We're that didn't realise that I'd actually left my own club night and gone to another club night and then telling the DJ that's playing at my night that I'm still in the club. You know, it was pretty... It was pretty crazy fun. So... Okay, so then you pump the brakes on that a little bit and plus in Berlin I feel like too maybe at the point it's probably so easy to buy cheap pills and just to like do nothing, you know, just I don't ever remember buying drugs, man. They just ended up there. You know, so much going around and Right. Yeah. After having traveled so much, like Because this is something that I'm constantly interested in or like obviously there's no proper formula that always works It usually seems like to be a combination of good people good DJ They both get each other and they're both willing to go on some crazy whatever whatever it is but for as like ingredients to a good party because you you know you played all different continents and What do you think? I always felt for me that the best parties were places where people were not so rich and work really, really hard. So an example of that is Scotland, you know, and it's not like all Scottish people are not rich, but I really felt like in Scotland people are working really hard and the people that I'd meet in the clubs that I was playing were like, you know, people who... who were doing manual jobs that were, you know, they weren't like in the city just, you know, working at a marketing company. These people have been working and they've worked hard really all week and they want to party, you know? And so for me, when I'm playing and, you know, whether it might be... you know, wherever, in fact, wherever it might be where it's like a poor economy or, you know, where people actually have to do a job rather than, you know, a proper job, that the parties are normally better, you know. So for me, I think that's the ingredient of a good party is not being in a place where people are spoiled, where people actually go to party. With the one exception of... With the one exception of Japan. Which is the weirdest. Because Japan completely contradicts it. In fact, in every way. A good party is people who work really hard, want to go out and party. Really lots of great drugs. MDMA, preferably. And, you know, lots of mixtures of people, you know. And then Japan. No drugs. They do... No drugs. They do work hard, but they're certainly not poor. And... The enthusiasm in, you know, playing at Womb in Tokyo is up there with the enthusiasm of playing at Panorama Bar. You know, the excitement and the energy is totally there. So, yeah. I mean, but our world is, everything is all contradictions, isn't it? In a way, you know. Do you want to talk at all about the Black Rose project? I think like, as is with everything in my life and my career, everything's just been pretty organic. Like nothing's really been planned out in any way at all. And, you know, with Henrik, I'd co-produced, I'd had Henrik play for me in London a night I was doing. Then we co-produced a record for an early album I did called More Than One. And then, you know, we became friends and we were DJing about two years ago in Barcelona. And he said to me, you know what? He played first and I was playing after. He said, you know what, should we try and do a back-to-back? And I said, how is that possible? And he said, well, I'll manually move the BPM on my Ableton and you just tap the record. So if it's going out, you just tap the record so it's going in. So he comes on stage and we start playing back-to-back and the place just goes nuts. you Like, it's so super unexpected that a guy that just played live is now doing a back-to-back with a DJ. And it was really great. And then, like, a month later, I was doing the Made to Play night at Panorama Bar, and I'd had him booked to play. And again, he did his set, and then after his set, he said, should we try and do it again? And I was like, yeah, let's do it again. And we ended up playing for, like Where all these records he was playing was coming from I don't know he had loops and it was you know it was it was pretty difficult because I had to make sure that it was in time the whole time so I'm like double DJing as well as not knowing what he's playing and trying to work it all out but that kind of almost at times when it would go out or something made this interesting energy and then what happened was People started calling our agent and saying, look, we'd like to book Black Rose. We saw them play at Panorama Bar. We heard about Panorama Bar. And so the name had already been given. People were asking to put Black Rose Schwartz in German as black, so it kind of makes sense. And then we said, okay, let's do some selected shows. So we've been asked to play a couple of festivals and we played those festivals and we just instantaneously felt like we had this great fan base. like people you know whether people come to see me or people come to see him or just this mixture of the whole thing and you know so now each year we take like we'll do like seven gigs last year we did like exit and melt festival lovebox certain you know certain festivals and um and we just kind of build it up a little bit more and we started making tracks for the set And the record that we just released, Anthem, I found this sample of a guy singing Black Rose. And I was like, I gave it to Henrik just before a gig. He starts doing something with it. As we're playing, he starts mixing it in. And it's like, nah, this is actually really, really cool. Let's do something more with this. So we start making that and we start making other tracks in our set. And then we started adding instruments into it. He starts singing onto it. Now everyone's DJing off computers, so everything's absolutely seamless. So you start bringing in things where things are not seamless, where it's coming in and it's shambly. I mean, it's never gone so out, but shambly. And then you start adding on top of that, like a cowbell. playing on top and suddenly all these effects and me looping over a vocal and it's like what's going on here and the energy from it and we're really having just loads of fun because I'm constantly kept on my toes he's kept on his toes he doesn't know what I'm about to do at this section of the set and it's just created this real buzz about the whole thing that we're doing and you know it was Again, that whole thing I was saying about organically is that we didn't go, okay, let's start a group and let's really make it big and let's do festivals and then let's release a single and plan it. We just went and DJed some gigs and the gigs were cool. And then we just released a track because people kept asking us about it and the track seems to be doing pretty good. Yeah, and I think people do, audiences honestly do, can tell or consciously or not whether or not the performers are having a good time and that's like a big deal. A lot of times it seems like people are phoning it in or at a festival it seems like it's a very specific routine for a lot of these people because it's a short slot. Yeah. It's not six hours, it's an hour maybe or less. And so it's like a lot of people are very like, we only have this much time that I mean it looks like we're on like 20 pills when we're playing or something we're just jumping up and down like you know just having just a bit you know and I think that's also I mean why you know I feel like why I get booked as a DJ a lot of the time is because I'm playing the records that I absolutely love and I I'll be dancing as much as you're dancing while I'm playing those records. So you're getting an energy off of me that's... you know, you're getting this really good energy off me and if you're getting this good energy of me then I'm getting the good energy of you and then you know, we're having a great time. We're in LA right now and Jesse came over here for kind of an extended vacation and so what are you doing here? Because it's, to me it seems like after, you know, listening again to your solo LP, it seems like it has like a really heavy kind of... pop sensibility to it as a whole piece. I don't know if that's like a... I mean, I'm sure you probably got that so much, but it has like a nice kind of... has all like the Jessie Rose single stuff I had kind of gotten to know from you, like the personality in there, but obviously there's a lot of collaboration on there and you've got... It seems like LA is a good fit because obviously there's a lot of guys like Switch over here and your Ruskos and your other kind We've also got a lot of these very specific pop producers here too and hip-hop producers as well. So what are you getting from that? What are you inspired by? I mean, basically, I have to kind of take it back because about two, two and a half years ago, I kind of felt like I'd done my album and I kind of felt like... I just fancy doing something different. And I always do. I like moving to different countries. I like, you know, I like changing styles. I like, you know, whatever it might be. And about two and a half years ago, I thought to myself, you know what, I'd really like to get into... get out of just making house singles and get into something different and I didn't tell anyone I just thought it to myself and about two days later Joe Hotchip called me up and said hey look do you fancy producing a track for our do you fancy producing a track for our album and I was like yeah I would love to do that. And, and, and madly because I've never had anyone produce a hot chip record before. They always produce their own records. So an absolute compliment to ask me to go in. And, and so from that point, and then I was coming over to LA a lot because switch was here and I was working with him. and I was also playing in LA and then I was getting into this idea that more and more I want to go off and produce other people and do other things and then the winters in Berlin were pretty cold and last winter it had gone on for a little bit of a while and I said you know what next year when January comes I'm going to go over to LA And what a happy move it's been, you know? I was supposed to come for two months, I've extended it to five. It just feels like there's just so much energy and positivity over here right now. It kind of, you know, I've started a production team game with Noah from Chitty Bang. He's doing this, like, you know... big hip-hop stuff working with switch um you know working with lots of different artists in different styles and hip-hop and in poppier stuff and healthier stuff really across the board and it's you know i don't want to be i don't want to be stuck in the genre i want to be a producer in every sense of the word. And I'm working also on my next album. And my first album, What Do You Do If You Don't, was really about, for me, was about making an album for the people that supported my 12 inches. So it was like keeping in the theme of what my 12 inches had been. And if you would like A-sided, then you'd probably like the collaboration with Hot Chip or something like that. And this album is really about me going off and doing lots of different things. There's two-step records on there. It's just going to be a varied album of me trying to step out of my comfort zone. I think a lot of people stay in their comfort zone. And by coming to LA and by doing this, I'm constantly challenged. And I think that's about growing. And I want to grow, do you know what I mean? I mean, I'll always be short, but it'd be nice to grow in that. It'd be nice to grow in that. Well, totally. It's kind of, I mean, it's not about, I don't think it's specifically about what I'm about to say, but it's like, it's nice. to go to a place where obviously you have people that you've worked with here before and it's not your first time here obviously but it's nice to have to be like well okay I'm here now these people some of them know what I'm into some of them don't I kind of have to re you know it's like the old cliche you're only as good as your last record so I gotta make a really good record yeah you know because it's a different audience there's there's some similarities But obviously, like, dance-related communities are, I feel like they're younger, but they're strong. But versus how big of a city L.A. is, you know, 10, 11 million, it's not. proportion wise there aren't as many people in the dance music but the people who are really are I think as well for me it kind of gets me out of a routine like I've just taken two months off of DJing and you know I go into the studio every day for a couple of hours and I go in without the need to get something done I go in just to make music you know knowing of course I've got all these different projects to work on but just going in and just having fun. And I think like that, that's also a thing when you start becoming a producer that, you know, is just doing remixes every week and is working on the next single. I feel like that's more selling out than going and producing Britney. Cause if I go and produce Britney, I'm like, how can I make a really cool record? And I'm having produced Britney, but as an example. How could I go and take this pop person and do something really cool that would sell a million copies? I know how to make a house record. I've made house records for 16 years. I haven't ever proved the point that I could make an amazing hip-hop record for Jay-Z or an amazing pop record for someone else. And I've been brought up with all of these different styles. Why am I putting myself in a box? In Berlin, I came up... against quite a lot of people being like, how could you go off and work on, how could you work on a Hot Chip record? I mean, they're like a band and they're not, well, because I'm not boring. Right. You know, hopefully. Forget the tears and the pleadings The strings and the ladders, wrongs Because your day is done
