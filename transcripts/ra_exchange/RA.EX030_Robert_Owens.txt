free free free free free free Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. House music legend Robert Owens' voice is arguably the voice of club culture itself. His vocals have appeared on more bonafide classics than nearly anybody else. That said, the man will be the friend of just about anyone. He gives some good vibe in the studio, he's worked with Photek, and was most recently heard on drum and bass up-and-comer Icicles' newest single. We caught up with Owens on the eve of the re-release of I'll Be Your Friend to chat about his career's many twists I'm pretty angry. What caused you to move over to England originally? An independent record label called Freetown asked me to come over and do A&R-ing for the label. So the owner more or less gave me the run of the label. And I put together an in-house... band for this label. I used to go out in Scallon Town. Singers and stuff within a lot of the clubs where they did live nights and I just found a lot of individuals for this company and it was like a little pet project for him and something totally different for me. You hadn't done anything like that before? Never, no. So I was kind of shocked. I was like, okay, you're going to entrust me to just do this? I was like, okay, well. Did you have any big successes? Oh, no, just more of an underground thing. It was more like just, I think he looked at the whole label thing as just like a little toy. thing and he was just fascinated with me as a character you know. Had he seen you playing? Yeah he knew about my whole history and everything fingers think the whole run you know so once people found out that I was here it kind of just set off a chain throughout Europe. they start booking me and by it only being like one or two hours away from most parts of Europe it just made it made me more accessible to do a lot more dates than I was doing in America. And so I ended up staying. Did it never really pick up in America outside of, you know, big cities like Detroit or New York, the music that you were putting out back then? If it did, I wasn't aware of it. You know, I mainly stuck to the places that I knew and mainly around the people that I knew. And it was always... concentrated around maybe Philly, New York, Detroit, and Chicago, sometimes LA because I had family in New York, LA, and Chicago. I always went around those areas anyway, you know, so. anywhere in between it just mainly stayed around those areas because a lot of the big main key clubs back in those early days were concentrated within those cities. I was struck when I I was reading your biography that you had this L.A. moment or connection. It was just family that was out there? Yeah, but even if you're familiar within the church background, if you've ever heard of James Cleveland, I used to be a member of the Voices of Cornerstone. With James Cleveland, I was a member of the Southern Community Choir in California. And so I come up with a lot of these people, Jody Whatley and all of them, Shalimar when they used to go there with James, Aretha Franklin's come out of James Cleveland's church, and a lot of singers. So I've had different periods, you know, where I've been involved with different things. And probably with the church thing, it's always been a part of my life just because of family. Was that when you first started singing? The church was the first place. Yeah, in the background. And then you sort of got pushed up to the front when people... Yeah, they kept trying to get me up to do solo stuff. But they would pass me around like... They might put me in the baritones. They might put me in the tenors, first, second tenor, second soprano, because even younger I could really hit high pitches and stuff. Alto, catrato, they put me in between different people, you know, but I was happy doing that and just fluctuating around the back in areas. But then they tried to push me to do a solo. and I just broke down. I think nerves just got to me and I couldn't do it and they kept trying to do that until I kind of got the courage to do it after a while. What was the first time you sort of did it and you knew, okay, I can do this? Oh man, what's the first time? I don't remember. I think I probably never, even to date, I still get nervous. Really? Still? Probably the first few seconds and then you kind of settle into it. Did your voice change quite a bit as a kid? You said you could go and fluctuate in different sections. Yeah, definitely. More of the bravado movement and stuff is a lot stronger now. kind of the base area and bottom end is a lot stronger now. Were you studying singers at a certain point or were you just always just like, I love that? I love that and because people told me within the family environment, often I would hear, you can't do this. never be able to do this and that forced me to challenge their thought what was it that you were saying that you wanted to do or can do it was a feeling it was a feeling inside of me that like even just turning on the radio I would hear singers and I try to emulate a copy whatever I heard and it's like wait I might hit that same kind of note How can I hit that level of a note but change it? I was always interested in altering something to a point where it was unique to me, regardless of what people, especially by people telling me I can't do something. That caused me to be more introverted and go inside myself and start studying me and seeing. How can I alter something to make it sound different? but comfortable to me and in return maybe it'll sound comfortable to someone else and then within like just normal job environments I found just practicing it in front of like colleagues in job environments things like hey Rob you got something there man you should try the same you should try to do something Like, really? You think so? What jobs were you working in? You were just auditioning in the break room for that or something. I've worked in theaters, ushering theaters to the concession stands in theaters, shipping and receiving in Woolworths and places like that, moving up to shipping and receiving into hospitals. assistant in the hospital. So the patients lying on the bed, your life. I'm actually was putting that responsible for putting their menus together. Okay. This is the nutrition assistant, you know, so. I've tried a few different things, but within those environments, even I was responsible one time for all of the inventory that came into the hospital and actually checking everything that came in, the whole list of things, the whole stock of whatever was in the storeroom. shipping and receiving, sending out and receiving goods and stuff. I've done a few different things. But within those environments, I always would sing, you know, but kind of subtly. But people like singing louder sometimes in those environments to kind of... Relax the day account of move it alone. They just got you know some enjoyment I'm hearing me saying and that think little things like that push me. Were you doing this in Chicago? Some of these motion Chicago, California off in Ohio sometimes if I would go there for the summer I would instantly go to a shop and try to get a job or something. Just out of instinct, you know, coming up out of urban ghettos and stuff, most of the time being broke, you know, you instantly, you know, you want to find different areas to make money. And even I'd do a bake sale, fry you some chicken, spaghetti, have a car party, whatever it took. To you know just make some money you said you or I read in an interview I think that you left home at a certain point about 16. Okay, and where were you jobs at 16 in Chicago? So you were in Chicago at that time. I had my first apartment probably about 17 and They just gave I didn't even have all of the money for the rent, but the guy just trusted me And he said, I see something in your eyes that's honest, and I'm going to give you this apartment. And he gave me my first studio apartment when I was almost turning 17. Wow. But I was sneaking into, like, the damn one where Ron Hardy was playing. You taste so sweet. He was just touching the person. and very calm, kind of calm character. So to just see him trying to just move a little and release, it was kind of powerful. He was quite calm, but the music he was playing was quite... You know, it just exerted a certain energy that went a step beyond this kind of mellow... calm character and beyond that you know just times that we were around each other and talking and stuff I knew him as a person you know beyond just him DJing but just this style and formula that he had for like finding little obscure pieces of a track and when you actually knew the track and how he found just this maybe four bars of this track and looped it to turn it into a track he thought this is incredible and how he interacted, maybe this mad sound effect that you would have never thought about playing with that track and that little piece of a track. It was just his little formulas and things that he threw together and physically seeing him live, how he could do things. He could stand there and mix the last four bars of a track over and over with two copies. He was the first one that I've seen play a record backwards by just taking a needle thumb, the needle thing from sewing kits. And he put that on the middle of a 1200 and flipped the needle around and put it to the back and it played backwards. Alive and in person. Stuff like that was just incredible to me. One time he was playing and the speaker in the back just blew up. It caught on fire. Little things like that. It was like, wow! He's playing so powerful, the speakers can't take it. Even though it was probably some electrical fault or something. It was just... Just a bad electrician. Yeah, but the atmosphere and the vibe, it was like the energy had built to this just so powerful point that it just exploded. And people just screamed and kept dancing, little mad things like that. I have great memories about him. What was he like as a person? You already talked a little bit about how calm he was. He was a calm person. Easy going, you know, beautiful heart. He never really, you know, exerted a lot of emotion, but you knew it was there, you know, just from conversations and stuff. The same even with Larry LeVan, the same thing, very easy going, at least around me. With the warehouse and the music box, was there a rivalry there, really? than you can tell? If it was, I'd say it would be in the fashion of a brother and sister kind of vein of rivalry. It's still overall within that whole circuit. All of us were the same group of people. We all knew each other. Everybody skipped from one to the other. And everybody wanted to know what the other one was doing. because a lot of the younger ones even coming up even people like Terry Hunter, Gene Hunt a lot of these people that came up in Chicago and that broke out I knew them when they were in high school and a lot of them used to come over to my house and stuff and it would be like well Ron I want to know what you're doing and Frankie would say what's that remix you're playing and so it was always that you know so I'd say it was more like a brother and sister kind of scenario with a lot of them. Was your place the hangout because you were so young and you had your own apartment? Everybody's place was the hangout. You go from, they skip from house to house to house to house, yeah. When did you start making, writing tracks? It was Mysteries of Love? I think Mysteries of Love and Donnie at the same time. And A Path, well, all three of them. you Because with Harold Dennis and a guy named Marvin, they actually had a bunch of tracks. And because I was DJing even back around that period, they came over to my house and they was like, we're getting ready to do our first record and we want you to pick it. And so they just played me a whole series of tracks. And I picked that track that ended up becoming Donnie. And I think they had started to rough with Chip E. Harold and Chippy and all of them asked me would I come in and just coach them through the whole situation. So I came and I was like, well now you know I'm not here because I'm still writing some stuff with Larry. I'm actually Fingers Inc. I probably shouldn't be in here to actually sing on this. It's like, well now, just help me through the thing. So I'm in the booth and I'm... kind of singing the parts to him to go down the track. Chip E is recording this. Of course. Of course he is. Ron Hardy heard it, did a mix. And then that was it. So we had to leave it as it was. Why did they come to you? Did they know that you were already sort of... Again, back in that day, whatever I was doing, I was doing splice editing and stuff off of a pitch control tape deck. And I had probably about five cassette decks hooked up. And so I was just dubbing off because I didn't have the money to buy the stuff that I wanted. to buy I was just taking CD a cassette units and pause editing off of each of them and re-dubbing and stuff off of each of them like a mad scientist here so they used to hear me play in some of the clubs I was playing in I was playing more like the bars and university parties and We had a regular party that we did monthly, like a block club kind of thing party, and a lot of the same crowd came to these parties, so they knew I played. And they would just come to me just because of the ideas that I was creating from them. I even gave Ron Hardy some things I did off of this whole... splice editing thing that he used to play in the music box. So we all knew about each other. You, I remember you talking about how you would record your own vocals onto a tape. Yeah, and I would record my own vocals and play them behind the sets in the, um, university and pub where I had like regular residencies but at first I didn't tell people it was me you know but people's like oh this guy has something here it's all right until eventually you know I met Larry Hurd and then after Larry Hurd and Harold and them people finally found out it was my voice on some of this other earlier stuff. When you were talking with Larry, what was the moment where you were like, we have something here, we're working on this? The first day I went over to Larry's house, he played some things for me and I said, well, I think... I have some lyrics that I go with this and instantly I tried that on this and that on this and that was it. What were those tracks? The first ones was Mystery of Love and A Path. Deep inside emotion gives company to believe. For sure as you perceive a dream, reality it can be. For one day you'll wake up. And then Can You Feel It? But we didn't record Can You Feel It? I just started playing Can You Feel It? Ron Hardy got sick one day and I played and they asked me to play in the music box. I played Can You Feel It? Washing Machine. What else? Mysteries of Love. And I played I played them about four times and people just went in a trance every time I played them as instrumentals. And then Ron and Frankie heard, what is this you playing over here? You better bring... Again, family kind of thing. What is this? I ain't heard it. So I went over to Frankie's house and I gave Frankie an edit that I had did of a path. And he stretched my edit out even longer and started playing it, gave it to Ron, and I gave all of them. those tracks first. So I was actually the first one in Chicago or anywhere to play any of them tracks. Were you okay with them taking your stuff and editing it longer and sort of changing it around? Yeah, because at the time they had the big names and they were the... big DJs, Ron and Frankie, you know, in the big clubs. So, you know, for anybody it was like, you know, you were honored for any of them to play any of your stuff. And then moved on to giving them to Larry Levan, and then we started going up to New York to play at the... Paradise Garage, and then I started doing Zanzibar and a bunch of those clubs. Did Studio 54 before it closed. How did Larry... Do you know how Larry sort of knew about you? Was he just... From Chicago because they were all connected. Those tracks just blew up. In New York, they blew up Donnie and Mysteries of Love and things like that. Bring Down the Walls just blew up in New York instantly. I think Larry had those things on cassette again before they even came out and he was playing them up. And as rough as they were, we were shocked that people liked them in that stage of where it was at. But I think it was because the garage's sound system was so powerful and unique. You just felt everything with them. It was mistakes and bring down the walls. that we'd be listening and worried people were going to be like, oh, that's messed up. And people sometimes, there's one time where the doorbell rings and people like, ah, scream on the door. I was like, they don't know that's a mistake. It's like, yeah, we all paranoid and worried, but it's little things like that that make, you know, all of that stuff such a special moment in time when you remember just reaction of how you don't have to try to be perfect in life. It's more about naturally just giving you back to life and, you know, somewhere someone will feel that. Well, they could probably hear that it's raw feeling. Just so people sometimes often want raw, and they don't want perfection all the time. They don't want people trying to be perfect. Life is not perfect. Given the choice, though, would Valeri bend on these really big mixing decks? using the most modern technology? I assume it was as much a money thing as anything else. Yeah, but I'm sure some people would, but knowing what he know then and what he knows now, I think it's about just finding a little unique section of instrumentation that's synonymous with you. and that makes you feel comfortable about what you give back to humanity. And that's the most important thing. Whether it's 200 pounds or a million pounds, that doesn't matter. I mean, some of those same tracks. record companies asked us to go into the studio and redo them and it took all the life out of them going in and working on those tracks putting them through the processing of expensive studios you can play the raw version even of a path opposed to the more polished version of it and people say well I still like the raw version do you find that more often than not the first time you do a take of something it's the best one often that's what people want they want something natural you know they don't always I think if I was more in the commercial vein of something, maybe you want a set formula, structure, just kind of more polished thing. But with house music, it's more that just... natural flow and movement of something that people wanted, especially back then, you know. There must have been some pressure there at a point when you were getting a little bit of success early on to replicate whatever it was that you were doing. Yeah, I've never thought about that. I've always looked at myself as a fountain. A fountain flows. The water don't go back in. It just keeps going out and flowing out. Tell me about I'll Be Your Friend. It seems to be obviously the labels re-releasing it with these new remixes. Bless them in two ways. Can you tell me a little bit about the recording of it and the circumstances around it? They've asked me to do it over. I came back in. I re-recorded the vocals. And just felt lucky that I could re-duplicate what I did all of those years ago vocally. Because listening back to it, it sounds a lot close to the original, but that's all re-recorded from every angle. Just all of the new young generation that they've gotten involved in doing the remixes and stuff, these are all people that... are of now and what's happening now. And I think everybody's done an incredible job from every angle, from label to remixes. The whole movement of what they're doing and presenting it to this present generation is great. Were you surprised when you sort of went into the studio and heard they had re-recorded all of this stuff and were able to sort of put it together? No, I'm never surprised. I'm just grateful. You know, a survivor is always grateful. I'm a survivor. You know, and so, you know, you're just grateful. For every constructive, positive thing that happens in life, it's about being grateful. It seems like that's been one of the defining themes of your career and the lyrics that... Yeah, because I'm a survivor. It's always coming out the other side. Yeah, you think anybody that's come from a rough, urban background, coming up with gangbangers and thugs and... gangsters and seeing people shot and killed right within your own family structure friends if you escape that and you achieve something come into an area in life where you're around a structure where you're making people happy, it's just natural instinctive to just be happy and grateful that you've escaped that and you can always look back on that past. and revert to that thought or that feeling of being happy and grateful. Because I could be a casualty. For sure. At what point would you say that you were close to being a casualty? Oh, many times. Many times I've had people shot right next to me, blood splurting. Of so many situations that they're not important, you know, the important thing is that I'm not there. That it didn't happen. That I escaped the madness. And I went on to do some constructive things in life because for all that you learn or accumulate, if you come into a state of mind where you think, okay, I'm giving back to humanity, you're living as Ayn and you're doing something positive with life. I wanted to talk a little bit about the more recent stuff that you've been doing. I guess you put out the album Art just recently. Why a double album, I guess, first? Has anybody else in vocalist in house music done a double album? So why not? Did you just have so much material? It's a whole way of challenging yourself and to do something different, something that someone often if... If just a group of us are sitting around and a thought comes into my head about trying something and then everybody say, oh, no, that's a bad idea. Instinctively, I'm going to try to step outside of myself and look at it from two different ways. Maybe it is a bad idea. Then I'm going to say, well, why is it a bad idea? analyze the situation down on the site. But if one track off of here can touch somebody's life, then it's not a bad idea. So I'm going to challenge myself and see if I can do it because you said it's a bad idea and you told me not to do it. And everybody told me not to do it, but from artwork, everything you see there, it's all me and what I wanted. Every pick track. Whether it's good or bad, it's something that I wanted and desired and felt that if one thing off of here can help somebody, I did something good. Is that why you're always quite open to working with all sorts of different artists? I mean, this Icicle track that came out recently, this drum and bass thing, I was very surprised to see what you're... your name was on it because I was like, I didn't expect, you know. Again, if they said I couldn't do it or I shouldn't do it or it's totally out of the arena of what you normally do, it's like, well, why shouldn't I? So I met him, liked him, got a good vibe from him, tried ideas, he liked it. He's coming out. So what haven't you tried yet that you're still looking forward to? Rock. One of the bass players from Pink Floyd, what is his name? I can't remember his name. He was working with the youth from Killing Joe for a while. They were all working together, but the group of them tried something with me. But they wanted to take, because of knowing my past, they wanted to try to do something. house. I'm like, no, I want y'all to do some rock. Like, so they tried something, they tried to do house, but in the end it didn't come out because the label didn't get it. But I wish that they would have took me into that arena, you know. I'm sure both of you are coming at it from different angles, right? They're like, oh, this is our chance. to do house and you're this is my chance to do rock yeah so it kind of it didn't um work but i would i would love to go that route uh at some point with any you know somebody you know on that kind of caliber um and i don't know maybe some commercial person I've never worked with. But for me, you see, I'm more open with whoever approaches me. I don't really try to seek out trying to find any of these major big people, you know, because it's like almost impossible. A lot of people think, oh, just because of what they've achieved and their level of fame, you're coming to them. use them up. And it's not about that. It's just a fascination of what it would be like to work with someone. Even someone like Ashford and Simpson, Quincy Jones, or Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. A lot of these kind of artists. It'd just be curious, what would they pull out of me as an artist? Do you think that some artists are nervous about? trying to approach you, being the legend that you are. Once you meet me, I'm like the gardener next door or something. All you got to do is meet me, and you can see how simple I am and easy going. And a lot of people meet me in clubs, and I hang out and stuff. Even when I play, I come before I play. I sit and talk to people and you can just naturally see I'm approachable and, you know, relaxed kind of person. At heart, I'm an old country boy. Thank you.
