I don't even know how to... Bye. *Dramatic music* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Rabia Biani. The artist formerly known as Mofosis hasn't released music in three years. but he's never been so busy. His label Morphine has become a key crossover point for club music and the avant-garde, while his research into non-Western experimental music was brought to the fore as a curator of this year's CTM Festival in Berlin. Yet Bjarne's heart is still in the dance, and he constantly relates his work back to his mentality as a DJ, mixing incongruous sounds into an extreme experience that makes you reconsider the walls we build between styles of music. As always, you can hear our full archive of exchanges at resonantadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Rabia Biani is up next. ♪ ♪ So I guess a lot of people who read RA would know you mainly for your work as Morphosis, but you don't even use that name anymore and you haven't even been releasing music for the last few years. But that doesn't mean there's been a slowdown in activity. In fact, it's the contrary of that. You've been almost busier than ever. But your work seems to be drifting off into lots of different facets. So can we at least talk about the basics of what you've been involved in the last few years? It's been maybe two years already that I stopped using morphosis as a moniker. I wanted to focus all my job and work around my own personality and not hide it behind. moniker and I think from that point things took a slight shift in the way people perceive what I'm doing. The people, at least the people around me and not the wide public because it's never about being a wide public for me and that's probably one of the points where morphosis was becoming a bit odd for me as a moniker. It's not because I don't want to share with a wider public, but the type of work that I'm doing is quite based on a research functionality within. And yeah, Morphosis was becoming a bit more open and specifically going into a more electronic music scene. So like the dance electronic music scene. While my point in what I do is more about hybridization and more about... creating a point where different things can gather together or clash or combine. It depends on the way someone can see that. And from that point, there's something new coming out. And therefore, I cannot close myself in one scene or one genre or one thing that I do. And many people see that as a... eclecticism or chaos mess I do understand that but in my mind it has quite a balance and it refers to everything that I've done since the beginning so far. So you're still actually playing sets all the time. It's not like there's been a slowdown in musical activity. It's just not official releases from yourself. So what have been some of these contexts that you're finding yourself playing in now? Because it's not just Morphosis playing, you know, vinyl in an 808 or something like you've been working with Vincent Moon in audiovisual situations before. performing with lots of different types of people. Yeah, I think within a market that requires an artist to have a constant output and a constant media coverage, let's call it like this, in order to get shows and gigs and work, I think I got lucky that I did not need it recently. And it's not that I stopped producing for a reason that I don't like producing anymore. The choice went into an own personal research for this. The research goes into the variety of instruments, the variety of sounds that I can explore throughout my path, in musical path, let's call it like this. In those last years, I've been producing other people. This goes in the same direction where I'm actually producing my own music. Because if I should think about it, I started as a DJ and I continue being a DJ, even if I'm playing live, even if I'm performing with other musicians, even if I'm producing musicians or anything else. For me, it's the combination of sounds and the combination of outputs, whether it's my stuff or other people's stuff, and the approach of a DJ. into an instrumental or a band world. So all the production work that I've been doing in the last few years, from Senyawa to Charles Cohen, and creating stuff on the label that are limited series or special items, musical items that can be presented to the public, is actually part of this process. I still call this my own music in a certain extent. If a DJ can call a DJ set his own music. So I haven't stopped producing, if you think about it this way. But from a catalogue or from an output, like a personal output perspective, I have been working a lot on music, on recordings, especially live recordings. And that's the dimension where I find myself more comfortable. Why is that? I think the connection with the public. is really important for what I'm doing. At least from my personal side, I find it very difficult to record in a studio. I connect this to an energy flow. What I give is actually influencing someone else and that someone else is giving back energy into what I'm doing. So it feeds back in almost at the same time. This actually shapes a lot and influences a lot my performance. or my recording session, let's call it like this. I don't want to overstate it, but I could feel that there was some sort of Rabi tinge over the Senyawa album, for instance. Was that recorded in your personal recording space, that record? Yes, Minjadi was recorded here in Berlin. It was just a curious approach from my own... scene or perspective or call it like this how it could interact with a band coming from Indonesia that is doing completely different type of music and especially vocals that normally are categorized as odd in our environment let's call it like this But I've been already working with a lot of people using vocals. And I was, of course, throughout my musical research, music instruments and vocals are a really tangible part of what I like in music generally. So having the chance to work with Rulé and Woukir opened a real concrete path. in working with musicians that have this kind of approach to the stage. And they also never recorded in, I think they never really recorded in a studio before. Maybe they did it in Jogja, but I don't remember if they did it before Menjadi. So they also were very curious to see my approach applied on their music. So we were working on the album structure together, like making longer pieces, longer takes, repetitive rhythm parts. It was really magic to work with. on that album, definitely. Would you say Senyawa are kind of emblematic of the direction that the label and yourself has been moving in? Because you're talking about, you know, coming across new instruments and exploring the range of the human voice and things like that. And they seem to really epitomize that, you know, how did you come across them initially? Well, I discovered them at the Segero Festival in Denmark. And it was something very personal. It wasn't only the music that attracted me to their work or something like this. Coming from Lebanon and being raised within quite a traditional music environment in Lebanon. which historically is well known that the influence between Middle Eastern music, South Asian and East African music is quite big. So this influence and this travel of this sound throughout the years made me a bit curious about discovering more about... Asian music since the beginning, basically. But their own approach to their own music was really different from my perspective. It was almost like going beyond the exotic and beyond the historic. creating a new voice that could actually become a starting point for a new thing happening from that region. And I kind of found myself also involved in that, like on an emotional side. So it was kind of like a revenge action from a band coming from Southeast Asia. throughout the world and reversing the world music aspect that has been throughout the years here, of course, alive since a long time. And this was the most important thing for me. Apart from producing their record, in what ways have you fostered their development? Well, it was a very few work, let's call it like this. I don't like to officially... call myself like the manager or producer because I am not, it was pretty easy because I knew there was something special behind that. And I knew many people on the electronic and experimental scene wouldn't be liking that kind of music or output. But I knew also that the majority of people would find something special in there. you know, because of a historical factor. It's something that relates to nature, relates to earth, spirituality, all these elements, we find them already in our... the music that we actually like from the minimalism from the 60s and 70s, early electronic music to a lot of experimental and rock music and free jazz that most people that belong to this scene really love and explore in a way. So I just needed to, you know, present them. And they did the whole rest of the job, like remarkably. We briefly mentioned this a while ago, but a lot of your recent live performances have been audiovisual works dealing with film that Vincent Muna shot. Can you talk about... how that project came into being and how it relates to everything that we've been talking about so far. I've met Vincent Moon on, maybe we met each other on the internet many years ago, but then he was part of the festival, the CTM Festival program. I invited him for an installation, a permanent installation all throughout the festival. and a small presentation on the opening night. So this is where we spent almost two weeks in Berlin working on his installation. And he was all over the festival, like shows, he was seeing everything. And he was really excited about this CTM festival for him. From my side... Of course, Vincent Moon's work is, for me, some of the most important stuff that I can find out there. The more I explore into it, the more I find stuff that I can relate to from the perspective of a listener and a viewer and the love for the image and the actual... spirituality that is contained in those images and the sounds he records. I often imagined myself using some of these sounds in a DJ set, also the ways they would fit in a club context. And I think he also had from his side a lot of curiosity about performing live as a filmmaker or as a musician or as a DJ in some ways. So I think we found a connecting point where... can perform live playing his own films and he calls it live cinema experimentation and this experiment about how to deconstruct reconnect all these images and films and shots that he's been doing all around the world and from at the same time from from my side i can as well sample live sample deconstruct all the music that is coming out from these films or play on top of it or that loop it or process it live and We've done three shows the last few weeks, and I think the potential of this thing is quite huge. It was really amazing to work with him because we have a similar attitude, like approach to performance. Of course, we have a similar approach to music, world, and realities. He's a really great artist. The fact that he denies himself as an artist while filming and while producing his films, I think the way he can actually reconnect with himself as an artist is through performance, live performance. And this I find really, really exciting in a way or fascinating. Specifically talking about the instrument research again, how does Pierre Bastien fit in this? Because he obviously has a very distinctive take on building his own instruments out of parts that people would not even consider to be a traditional instrument. Can you just talk a little bit about what he does and how you came across him? Pierre Bastien has been on... on my artist list, like the highly respected artist list, since a very, very long time. I met him personally maybe, I think, five years ago or something like this, and we kept in touch. And the idea a couple of years ago came to me that maybe it would be a time as well to explore what Pierre Bastien would do. do for a label like Morphine? Or how would he present his latest vision of the music he creates? I think Pierre considers all this a musical output rather than an exploration of mechanical parts, putting them together to make sounds randomly. For him, it's a real composition mode. almost like building an orchestra by himself or a band or a swing or jazz band for him. There has been an art scene in France in the last century that was creating art out of robotics or mechanical instruments. And I think it all comes from this really nice French... approach to cinematic maybe coming from Mélies, Georges Mélies. I think that's the school and like the way I see it without going into like much deeper description of what Pierre is doing. So I think Pierre fitted really well on the series, on the label. and as a master of this instrument or variety of instruments that he builds, and also the modification of traditional instruments is also another approach that Pierre is involved in. So there was a connection between people that create music on a modular synthesizer with people that are... building their own instrument and creating sounds out of it, or people that simply use a very simple device from two strings or a vocal strings. Why are these approaches in particular more interesting to you at this time than traditional instrumentation? It's just the way we look at the future. We don't have to deny history, but we have to look at the future in a more concrete way. Rather than following what technology is bringing only, we have to also acknowledge the fact that the future can also be somewhere where we have to learn how to create our own stuff in order to survive. And probably this thing I've learned a lot here in Berlin. There's a lot of recycling and there's a lot of refurbishing and there's a lot of community work in Berlin that inspired me a lot to go out from the cycle of buying an instrument, using it, throwing it away. We have to keep a close circle running. in order to learn how to face the coming future. And that's something I believe it's very, very important not to enter the standardized commerce, go into a personalized approach to it. We have to learn this because we don't know how the future will be. We might need that one day. So this is really tying music creation to issues which perhaps have importance far outside the music sphere. This is to do with, you know, how you relate to the world in a larger sense. Well, this music is somehow the language with which you relate also to the world. And it goes, like from my understanding, it goes far beyond the... aesthetic, like the sound aesthetic or beauty of a composition. I think it's a very powerful social and sociopolitical tool. And we know a lot of connections between music and spirituality, the invisible world. We know a lot of connection with... between music and the revolutions and the revolutionary actions. So yeah, the connection with a lot of aspects in our society nowadays or in the recent years. So we cannot deny the power of the interaction between music itself and the issues that we are facing nowadays, and especially in these recent times. I think... I think we should start learning how to raise our voice in a proper way because... It is needed. I think it is needed, especially right now. And I guess another artist who you've put out recently who ties into these sorts of topics really closely is Pauline Oliveros, who is an extremely significant, influential American composer, writer, dramatist, activist, all sorts of different types of things. What drew you to this? to wanting to release her and Ione's work, her partner? I had the biggest, let's say, honor and pleasure to... to be in touch with her. She was doing this performance in New York, New Arts Festival, I think, curated by Laurie Anderson. And she was presenting the expanded instrument system that she's been working on since many, many years. And now it was like finished. And she did this performance to present it on an eight-channel output. And since the series was exactly about how you create or how you actually give birth to something and you use it in a, in a masterful way. and you create a musical output that can really represent that way. She totally fit it in that series, and I think the album was sublime, just amazing. So there was no reason why, let's call it like this, why not putting it out. And on the other hand, Pauline has been of influence on my... on my work. So it all fitted together. It's interesting when you're talking about, you know, how these things all fit together. And for the casual observer, looking at the direction of morphine, say someone who's just into dance music, and then they come across a Pauline Oliveros record, that must have quite an effect on their perception and expectations. I don't want to go into the extent of becoming the preacher or the teacher. Humbly relate again to my DJ skills or DJ world, let's call it like this. And it's surprising how they act really well on something that they don't actually expect. And by doing this on a dance floor, by playing... something that is completely unexpected or like from a crowd perspective that still can tell the story within a set that still can be connected with what happened before and what will happen later. This is related also to the releases on Morphine. Morphine is actually still the small world where I... where I play my music, you know what I mean, by releasing them. All this can definitely be part of a whole where people can... relate to Morphine as a dance house, experimental house or noise label. And then also like avant-garde or free jazz or Indonesian music. So these three artists who were just talking about all performed at CTM earlier this year, which you had a curatorial role in. Yeah, I've been asked by CTM. to guest curate a part of the musical program and work on the entire musical program together with them. The theme was new geographies and it fitted quite well with what I was actually doing in my own perspective of how, again, a DJ set is made. And so throughout this approach, I think... We worked for like maybe 10 months on the program. And while working on it, we were constantly learning new things and learning how to explore this completely new approach of curation of a festival. While it could happen randomly in an event or something not really big. have an artist coming from a different country and is actually playing music that is quite new for our country or his. We kind of wanted to pack all this together and like explore all these non-borders that are already existing nowadays. And we also explored the extreme difficulties that are the actual physical borders that are still there. And the comparison between what arts and expression is bringing and bringing together all around the globe. what politics and countries and institutions are actually blocking more and more. We had serious problems with many, many artists to provide them visas to get them to Germany. And that was also something that we had to face more and more and in a more extended way in this year. And this year is also marked by the whole thing, especially in Germany and in Europe, of the Syrian refugees situation. We really went to explore as well how difficult it is for a regular musician from Syria. to be able to come to Germany to perform in these times, it was not possible at all. While we had a whole wave of European right-wing mentality. that was actually throwing from the other side and blocking all the borders and trying to stop this from happening, like the actual crisis from being solved. So during the whole process of exploring, studying regional stuff and sounds from different parts of the world, we were facing more and more a political situation. The whole festival started quite a marked political position, let's call it like this. Yeah, I think this was the biggest learning experience for me on this side, on this matter, how to understand what are the borders and the non-borders. of nowadays. So you said that you didn't come up with the concept yourself, their concept fit in with things that you're doing already. Exactly. And yourself and CTM aren't the only people thinking this way. Absolutely not. Of course, there's a lot of people already working on this since many, many years. But the point of giving a theme that was so particular from CTM, I think from CTM's perspective. was to reverse the classical CTM situation of Western musicians, experimental and avant-garde and electronic musicians coming from the Western countries mainly. It was to reverse this whole... this whole thing and especially the musicians from western countries that were involved this year at CTM had to have a real connection with the whole theme as well. So we had to be careful not to go out from the theme or to take it too much in depth into a radical situation. So it is still a festival where people will travel or come from Berlin to attend these shows. The focus was also on a, you know, validity of the shows themselves and the exploration of new things. This is the new geographies theme. There are other things out there which come from different parts of the world. Randomly, they get attention, but we wanted to focus on this attention itself. I think, of course, you're open to yourself a lot of cold situation or criticable situation. But at the end of the day, I think, yeah, I think it was quite a big learning experience and a lot of fun as well at the same time. So I guess this has also brought you to... fairly far-flung parts of the world, including Siberia. Was going to Siberia part of like a Goethe Institute funded thing, like, you know, bringing disparate cultures together? Yeah, I think Goethe Institute is still actually working on quite a big project, which is the hybridization on a geographic level to bring artists from Germany and... take them and go and actually go and do subtle things in other countries, especially now. I think their focus is mainly the ex-Soviet Union area. But this is not to bring the musicians and do a showcase of... electronic Western music. It is more to feed local realities in those countries. And it's being done through CTM and Unsound equally, I think, in an equal manner. And CTM actually officially was involved only in the CTM Siberia festival that was last year, while Unsound is doing a wider project. on this matter. And I think being in that situation, I saw something taking life in Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, and a lot of hope in the local communities. They saw that it was possible to do something, even on a very small scale. If you live in such remote areas outside from the map of the good things that are happening, the New York and Berlin and London, you kind of are always in a situation where you don't have a lot of strength and a lot of hopes in what you're doing. But an activity like this there and staying 10 days with the locals and working with them on shows and, you know, showcasing what is coming from Russia in especially that region. I saw a lot, a lot of hopes in the local music community. I consider this as a really good thing. And of course, you can combine Western stuff in order. know, enrich the experience for the locals. There was also a boiler room session there. It was incredible how many people came and how many people were actually feeling lucky to be able to be on boiler room and watch it happening in their own town. I see this as a very, very positive thing. Of course, it enriches the local mentality. Let's call it like this. There's another festival that you've had some degree of involvement in called Terraforma, which has its own views on sustainability and connecting situations together. It's a festival that happens outside Milan in a very old park, villa park, that is a huge space that was basically abandoned since many, many years. The project of Terraforma, besides the sustainability of the actual festival and the involvement of the local community from food to vendors to musicians and etc. The focus of the festival, I believe, is within five years to reopen and revitalize the whole park. Every year they take a part of the park and they do the whole work and they clean, revitalize. all the trees and, you know, all the environment there. And I think they discovered there's actually a very ancient labyrinth there. And starting from next year, they're going to start rebuilding it. And this is going to go on in that direction. And I think for a local Lombardo or Milan area festival, it's quite an example to push even outside those areas, I think. I think it's something that should happen on a more vast or wide scale. And it's the connection that we have to have again with nature and with the environment and learn how to respect it and actually try to help it within. our own possibilities. And that's what the actual name terraformer comes from, from terraforming. So we've somewhat talked about the broad range of things that you're involved in, in one way or another. How busy are you? How do you balance all these different things and still get things done? I don't know. Yeah. Still, we have quite a good amount of time, I think. I tend to never get bored and ideas constantly come in, projects constantly come in. There's a lot of stuff happening. the next months I would say quite incredibly beautiful stuff as well there's you know touring and shows are still going really well but not too much so that they don't cover the whole time that I have available And yeah, working on new recordings. So hopefully soon we have something coming up. Let's call it like this. From yourself or in collaboration with other people? I'm still not. Still figuring it out. Yeah, it's always the dilemma is always the big one. How much can I do and what can be presented as a new work? This is one of the reasons why I haven't been releasing stuff lately. I'm searching for a focus point where I can deliver it. But so far, I'm still having fun exploring. It's very healthy in my opinion. So even though you're operating in a lot of different musical contexts and doing a lot of different types of work, you're still playing in clubs, playing 12 inches, sometimes with an 808 out there. why are you still drawn to this context because you can see like someone like donato is completely cut down the dj and almost almost nothing yeah for for different reasons of course but for me the club as a concept is where people actually gather in spirit And I still want to live it this way. And I still want to believe it is this way, even though many people can disagree, many people can talk about the loud music and the straight kick drum, and many people can criticize techno or the modern techno. I don't tend to do that. I think it's the right for everyone to have. their own recreational part or where they actually find themselves really like their own selves. And so I think there's still a kind of a connection with what I do. And I think also throughout the work, the years I've been working with musicians and, you know, going through the avant-garde and the experimental music, I think the real key for which I've been actually involved in those areas was the fact that I am a DJ and I come from the club scene. And it's really curious for an avant-garde musician or a musician from Indonesia. to actually explore that small thing that they never had the chance to explore in a way or to know what could happen on these extents. And it's not about making a remix or... playing with a guy that does techno. It's the actual ideological approach from the club scene. What can happen if that scene can interact directly into all this experimental and avant-garde or outer national scene. So I think I'm still learning a lot from both sides. And I'm actually hoping that I can still contribute to both sides of the music that I love, let's call it like this. So it's a kind of a small mission to myself to keep a foot in one and another and another one and try to explore what are the potentials of all this. The sea is upside down. Or why? But we are here on our terraced face. Birds are floating outward and we find ourselves here. I find you. You. You. In the stream, your lips are mine. Your eyes, I see with your eyes. These ears are listening backward into time. I'm so excited!
