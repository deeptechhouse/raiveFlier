You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour! This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour. This is RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Coming up on this month's show, we'll be chatting with Amsterdam's new nightmare, Shamiro van der Heelde. about what he wants to achieve during his time in office. And BotBock and Elvis1990, the founders of the highly influential UK label Night Slugs, will be celebrating 10 years of the label by playing us some of their favourite tracks from the catalogue. But first, I'm going to hand over to Carlos Hawthorne, who's been looking at how some of our favourite record labels Handle giving feedback to their artists. Giving and receiving feedback is an essential part of... life. Whatever your field, it's usually the best way to learn and improve. I'm a writer and reviews editor at RA and feedback has been a huge part of my growth. Even so, it wasn't until a recent conversation with a producer friend of mine that I got to thinking about the role feedback plays in shaping some of our favorite electronic music. If you're a producer, most of the feedback you receive is from A&Rs and label managers, the people who ultimately decide whether they want to release your music. This process varies from label to label. Some people like to be very hands-on, inviting artists over to their studio for intense one-on-one sessions. Others take a more relaxed approach, preferring to be involved as little as possible. Either way, it can be a tricky and lengthy process, but one that's vital to getting the best music out there. Over the course of the last month, myself and The Hour's London-based producer, Martha Pezzenti-Caden, sat down with some artists and label managers to dig deeper into this behind-the-scenes world. Hi, I'm Will Saul and my record label is Ouse Music and I am head of A&R at K7 and curate the DJ kicks. In terms of giving feedback for a release on Ouse Music, I don't think that I've ever tried to say to someone, can you make it a bit more Ouse? Or can you? Do you know what I mean? Because I don't really know what that would be. It always very much depends on the artist. Some artists thrive on and want a lot of feedback and that can be sort of right the way from how does the snare sound to is the arrangement right in terms of where the breakdown's position, should there be another breakdown, should there be a breakdown. And some people are very, very precious about what they've done and they don't want it touched at all and it's either like it or lump it. and I totally respect that. But also I think to a certain extent depends on the stage of development the artist is in themselves. If they are a new artist that hasn't released very much then they're going to be much more open to wanting your feedback to develop because you should have had, or at least at a certain point as an NL you would have had a lot of experience, you would have listened to a lot of things. and part of why they are releasing a record with you is that they are hopefully trusting you and your opinion. So yeah, younger artists and more underdeveloped artists will be looking for more feedback, I would say, than someone that's already kind of developed their sound, knows what they're doing, knows what they want to achieve with the track. So a recent example of giving feedback... would be for the Phoenix EP that Mark Easthawks has just released on house. Mark sent in an early demo. To me, there was almost more ideas in it than made sense for the track itself. There was so many strong ideas in it that I started to give feedback about maybe taking a few things out and he experimented with doing that and then came back with something else and then it became quite apparent that actually there was two full tracks in the initial idea that he... sent so we ended up then sort of separating it and it became parts one and part two after a certain period of time you don't really can't really see the wood for the trees you say you make something and then you send it in and you're not really sure how you feel about it so I think a good second set of ears should be able to go there's so many strong things in here that it's almost not totally coherent if you take some stuff away from it it becomes better but I think it takes time to build up a relationship with someone where they really value your feedback in terms of the example that I just gave with Marquis Hawkes, we've worked together very closely for the last few years, I think after a while they totally trust your opinion and I think when you've given them advice or feedback that has then helped in a direct way that they can go okay he does actually know what he's talking about or um oh yeah that that did really make a difference then i think they they look for it on everything that they do with you and that's that's where it becomes really enjoyable and you feel like you're actually sort of helping and you're involved in the process A good example of feedback actually hopefully making a difference to someone was with Midland when he released his Trace record. It's not that I really gave him any feedback on the track at all because I didn't. It was just he was hesitant about whether he should release it at all. He wasn't sure whether he liked it or whether it was very good and I thought it was brilliant so I didn't force him to put it out but I definitely said you really should release that because it's brilliant and he said okay fine I'll trust and then it did really well. It was definitely his sort of, at the time, it was a big record for him, and it definitely gave him a stepping stone onto the next sort of stuff that he did. So, yeah, it's lovely when you have that sort of relationship with them and they do actually trust you, and you then in turn see it help. So in terms of feedback, here's Batu, the Bristol-based DJ and producer who runs the popular record label Time Dance, responsible for excellent 12 inches by the likes of Bruce, Ploy and Lurker. They get pretty specific. because I feel like sometimes those smaller details are kind of what mold a track into being like a dance track to me. Stuff like just taking out like a drum hit here or there. I kind of tend to do it over, you know, write like a little note on these tracks, like refining what I've put. And it's not like it's the same thing that would fit into my DJ sets. A label is like the A-side or the B-side. this kind of stuff but it tends to be a just process just certain little things will stick out to me and those will be the things which I think revised basically talking about understand what the artist is trying to do is really important you feel that you're on the same thing and you're sharing the same vision for a trend to it and more receptive thing Balraj Samrai and Ruben Platt run Swing Tick the Manchester label that's been putting sound system music since 2014. I dialed them up via Skype. Samurai was on the move at the time, so it ended up as a three-way call. I asked them about when things go wrong during the label feedback process. There's been times a certain track can just end up with a compromise, but I mean that's only ever been on a track-by-track basis, that's a release basis or anything. It's convincing and nice that it's ready to go though. Do you think it's your own experience as producers that shape the way you give feedback? Some of the language you get to say for things sometimes, it's talked about like temerity in a strange way. in an abstract kind of way that makes necessary that useful in a description sense they don't necessarily know how to articulate and it can be a frustrating process it's like oh is this what we want now like you know is this what you want and i think i think that's helped us be specific there's a certain way you want to avoid talking to people I wanted to hear from some more label managers who also produce music themselves, so I spoke with Pearson Sound, co-founder of Hessel Audio, to discuss the role feedback has played in his own artistic development. I think it's only in the last few years that we've opened to sharing music with people before it's finished and sitting in a room and playing your music to people. I think that was probably something that was quite scary maybe starting out, but then now... can see the benefit for it and I guess why don't you want to have some extra ears on something before you share it or play or send something to someone and within the first listen they'll spot something that's clearly not working. I think when you're working it's very easy to miss things or you get a very sidetracked element and then you send it to someone with some fresh ears and they're can immediately spot what a tune is. So yeah it's something I've been to and I'm not comparing. what we do to sort of you see some of these people working on and I think sometimes just having different ears on something can really your music and the day you can always decide act on the field just to have sometimes different opinions is really useful I thought by experience to give advice you know using our experience in clubs and testing stuff be ashamed not to use it in a way be ashamed not to sort of pass on that advice In our Berlin office, I sat down with the German DJ and producer, Dana Ruth, who's been running the house and techno label, Brukade Records, since 2007, specialising in warm, functional club music. It's released music by plenty of newcomers, which has informed Ruth's hands-on approach to the feedback process. So you will take kind of tracks that aren't quite... and play them in the club and see how they sound on the big system. Yeah, I like to try it out also. For me also important is the arrangement. how it's arranged, can I mix with it really good because I'm looking for very mixable tracks and because this is the way how I'm mixing. I like long transitions, I really like to work with these tracks and this is also my approach when I'm signing tracks. Do you think it's your own experience as a producer that allows you, that gives you the confidence to give feedback? Absolutely. Absolutely. Also, it's my experience as a producer because I, of course, I produce a lot of stuff, also a lot of shit stuff, I have to say, and that was not perfect or I made mistakes. And if I see somebody or I hear somebody and I see a talent, of course, I want to develop this talent also and I want to take my experience too. to give to them, to make them better, because it's nice, again, for my label if I have an artist that grows with the label. Do you think you've got better at giving feedback? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. The more I know with production, the more confident I am, the better I am with the feedback. The more I know what I would like to have for the label, absolutely. And in terms of as a producer yourself, how important has feedback been to shaping your own sound? Yeah, it is very important, but I'm a bit stupid if it comes to this because I'm... I'm sometimes too lazy to send things around. I do things and then they are on my computer. I forgot to give it to somebody. Right now I'm getting better and better. Feedback is always very important and I'm very happy if I have feedback because I always can learn. It does nothing to my ego, it's just, it makes me better, always. And when you were learning, was feedback a part of the process or did you just kind of learn on your own? Yeah, it was very important. I produced also with some people together. I can, and all the time I got the feedback. I was just changing things to the better. It's a very good thing to get feedback. And I don't really get the people that feel offended if somebody gives the feedback or says, or maybe you take this out or you should never be offended. Nobody wants to do something to you. Everybody just wants to make you better. Nobody wants to. do you bad or want to hurt you or whatever. Just you have to take this and make yourself better. How do you criticize someone's work or provide criticisms without offending them? First of all, it's always be positive because also, I mean, music is an emotional thing and maybe this person had this idea and you cannot share this or you have other ideas for the piece. Being positive and just give ideas. It's not that I say, yeah, but you should do this, that. Just be positive and encourage them to try something new and lift them up. It's good to say positive things and then just be... constructive like yeah start with the positive things in general chris farrell is best known as the man behind the idle hands label and record shop in bristol though he studied music at school he's not a producer a detail that very much informs the way he runs his label so what's chris's approach to the feedback process i think it comes from you so myself like although I have an understanding of music and I know it's put together. It's kind of less that. I think it's just more the thing of like, I don't really see it as my place, you know. I kind of generally fear this. I'd say artists are final decisions on things. Putting music out is definitely a rewarding part of the industry. I just kind of want to make it as painless for them as possible and just facilitate, you know, it's the music. It's the most important thing for me. to make sure I can like decent quality decent little bit of attention from I'd struggle to be that kind of executive producer type I think it's best to just have that kind of snapshot time really so I've got friends or whatever who aren't quite there in their way to make more tunes probably actually let's go straight you know I mean, I know when Shanti started making tunes, you know, it was a while before. You know, when is he going to sign it? But yeah, it's not necessarily my role. Here's Shanti Celeste, who used to work alongside Pharrell at Idol Hands and at Bristol, the label with No Vowels that they set up together in 2011. Last year, she started her own label, Peach Discs, which she manages herself in addition to touring and making music. somebody's artistic integrity and I don't want someone to feel like they're having to change loads about a track just for me it's there however it does need to also work for me because it's so the way it is so that everybody's happy and from you're somebody who makes music has also had to deal with this on the other side is I just say look usually most of the feedback is feedback which was everything that's already in the just read like just redo the whole thing like so it's always like I always try and give feedback which it works with all the elements that already enhances the vibe of the track that is already there if you know what I mean when I do it I always say if you feel really strongly about this I don't want to change it then that's totally fine and don't do it and then just send it to somebody else you know I mean because it's because it's always just like at the end of the day I've done it with a few people and most of I've never really had a bad response. I've done it with everybody that I've released and it's always gone down really well and I'm currently doing it with a couple of artists who are going to release on the label and we've kind of been doing some back and forth. quite well as long as you don't as long as you're not basically trying to take over the tracks and make them your own do you know what I mean which I don't know whether anybody does that but I do think it's really useful to give people feedback because when I when I was doing stuff and people would just refuse me straight away or just be like no I don't want this track for whatever reason I would always be like god what if the reason they don't want it is because of a really detail do you know what I mean so it's I always felt like it would be really good to know why it is that they didn't like it do you know what I mean so maybe I could change it that not everybody has time to do that and even I sometimes don't feel like I have time to do that with every single person that sends me music in fact I don't do you think you feel comfortable giving feedback because you're a producer yourself yeah I feel comfortable to give feedback because I wish I had some feedback sometimes and the best experiences have been when they've given me feedback. The reason I used to show more is because I did need feedback and I needed help whereas like for me now I feel like this pressure of just like well I'm doing really well now I should know how to make music on my own without people helping me do you know what I mean? Because in my mind people giving me feedback is essentially people helping me but it's just been very like I don't need help just like I don't need anyone but that's not a good attitude to have I think when you get feedback even if you don't follow it it just gives you more ideas which is f*cking g* As you've heard, feedback, in whatever form it takes, is a crucial cog in the long chain of events that leads to a record being released. The right advice delivered in the right way can have dramatic effect. not only on a single track or an EP, but on a producer's confidence and ability in the long term. The important thing then is to make the process as positive and constructive as possible. The better the relationship between the artist and label manager, the better the music at the end of it. As a label, Night Slugs has spent the past 10 years releasing music with its sights firmly set on the future. During this time, the label run by Bok Bok and Elvis 1990 seemed to influence an entire generation of producers. of the groundwork for the experimental club scene that's thriving today. We wanted to take stock of some of the incredible music that's come out on Night Slugs, so we asked Bok Bok and Elvis to stop by our London studio to play us six of the label's most vital tracks. You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. Hey, this is Bok Bok. And this is Elvis 1990 from Night Slugs. So our first pick from the catalogue is I Roll by Girl Unit, our third ever release. Yeah, I remember that one when you dropped it in the East Village rave the first time and I was like, who the hell is this? What the hell is it? Yeah, it's Phil. It's a crazy track. It kind of put together everything that we were really interested in at the time. I think one of the biggest influences on this was that we booked Genius really early on. And them guys were all playing Rat Alert by Yan Driver. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think that pitch bend thing just really caught on with us. We were all on that neon pitch bend kind of vibe. That is like the first era of Night Slugs, you know? Night Slugs, wave one. And yeah, Big Up Girl unit. I still play it all the time. It's still like a sick track from the genre, I think. Dropped in Berghain as well, the weekend. That's right. Thank you. Next up we have What again by Girl Unit because he really dominated 2010 for us. But yeah, What, that was a huge track. Oh my God, that one dropped in the rave. Where was that? Crucifix Lane. Crucifix Lane, yeah. I think it got like four rewinds or something, you know. Definitely. That was one to rewind at the time. Definitely kind of showed, I suppose, our hip-hop influence a bit. because I think to that point maybe people weren't so familiar with that side of Slug but yeah that one I think it's like Proto Trap or something definitely heard a lot of producers from that world credit it as being a big influence for them so again big up girl unit Okay, next up, Silo Pass. Huge track, huge track. One of my ones. Yeah, it was nice for me to go back to an era where Dumb Valve-style grime was my biggest influence. Always enjoy playing that one. I've stopped playing it myself. But there are millions of remixes that I can draw for, so... There's always a version of Silo somewhere kicking about. Definitely made it in the old Nice Lugs headquarters in South London where we all used to kind of live together and that is a very nostalgic feel thinking about that now. And yeah, I think it was really made out of all the original kind of classic kits that everyone was using at the time, 2003, 2004 times. I kind of did a bit of research into how to make those sounds and stuff so I spent quite a bit of time on that sort of archaeology which is why it sounds the way it does. This stuff is Ballad 4D, it's my own track. I remember making this so vividly. I was trying to recreate... Actually, I was so obsessed with Kenny Larkin's Pump the Mood remix at that time. So I was trying to recreate that in some way. You can hear it in the intro. And then somehow I stumbled across this crazy patch, or I made this patch on the DX7, which created that bass sound. And I could... Going back, I could never actually recreate that sound. It was just... One of those studio magic moments. Yeah, yeah. It's gone. It was a moment of genius given from the gods and it's gone forever now. It's hard enough to save patches on DX7, so I don't play it. Yeah, that's the problem. But this one to me is just pure sublo. Love it. It's like Black Ops or something. But also the prototype for this sort of deconstructed club thing that people did a little bit after that. Take care. What? Next up we got "How We Relate to the Body" by Jam City off of his seminal album "Classical Curves". This was so great at the time because it was just this stripped down club movement with funk all over it as well with this like with this funk synth and I have a feeling I think that I think this I think this track was influenced by Arthur Russell's... Yeah, it's got very Arthur Russell. Arthur Russell's... "Let's Go Swimming" Let's Go Swimming, with the dub the Water Gibbons. The Water Gibbons dub. Yeah. But taken into the world of kind of, what was it, 2012, Night Slugs, really influenced by Jersey Club and those kind of really big kick patterns, really hollow. Super minimal, but maximal at the same time. Definitely. And I still, I haven't played this one in a while, but I think it's... When it's drawn for the right moment, I can definitely do things to the rave that are quite special. Next up is Helix's debut on Night Slug's drum track. I think this really set the bar for drum tracks around the world basically. If you listen to everyone's music today, you can hear influence from this track. It's just a total cold banger. Definitely would agree with that. Sort of tribal house, it's grime. It was obviously vocal by... I flirted D at one point. Also hit on like Funky at the time as well. Funky. Same kind of patterns that were dropped on the harder tracks back then. Certainly an archetype and remains an archetype for the kind of music I want to play in the club. Ten years is quite a long time. Definitely a lot has changed for us and probably a lot of our focuses have changed quite a lot I think at this point. Quite a few of us are involved in production work, working with artists, just in the studio every day making beats. I'm doing quite a lot more work in sound design and kind of work for commercial bands, like creating some, like using what I've learnt from night slugs and like my sound design through club tracks i can apply that to like different films and various other bits yeah i mean i would say that people have definitely run away with um with it and the underground club movement is strong but i just feel like i'm i don't know i think personally i'm moving in a direction where i'm just making a lot of hip-hop beats at the moment working with a lot of artists so maybe feeling a little bit less involved I suppose but it's because it needs young energy and that's it you know we've been around the block for a minute so it's time to apply what we've learnt to other things When it comes to nightlife, Amsterdam is often held up as a best-in-class example of how to sustain a thriving scene. In 2012, the city appointed Murek Milan as its first nightmare. a position that was created to represent the interests of the city's nightlife industry while acting as a bridge between that industry and the local government. After serving two terms, Milan was recently replaced by Shamiro van der Helde, who made it his goal to make Amsterdam's nightlife more diverse and more welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Our ace Frederik van Weening met up with him last week to get his views on where Amsterdam nightlife is at and where he'd like to see it headed. We're welcoming Amsterdam's new nightmare, Shamira van der Geldt. Welcome. Thank you, Frederic. We're chatting here at the top floor of the Adam Tower with a panoramic view over the entire city, which is pretty cool. You will follow up Mierik Milan as the main liaison between local politics and Amsterdam Nightlife. Definitely. For a term of three years. And you will also be the chairman of the Amsterdam Nightmare Foundation. So just to give a little bit of background for those who are not... familiar with the concept. The Knight Mayor of AMSEM is a mediator and liaison between all participants of AMSEM nightlife. A rebel in a suit, as we often call it, because you can be a pain in the ass for the local regulators sometimes. You also have to speak the same language to achieve goals and by having a dialogue to change the rules. So after two terms, Merrick Millan is passing the torch to you, Shamiro. You've been a fixture in Amsterdam's culture scene for over five years, I think. Yes, definitely. At least five years. Hosting radio shows, TV shows, acting, emceeing, organizing events, writing, dancing, you name it. The whole creative shebang, I should say. So you are a born and raised Amsterdammer, isn't it? Yes, I am. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself? Yeah. Unfortunately, it's only listening. Otherwise, as you say, on this panoramic view, I could actually point it out to you. But I was born in the north of Amsterdam. And I was raised in a center by my two parents, my lovely parents. My parents are from Suriname, which is an ex-colony and slave country of the Netherlands. And they came to Holland in their mid-twenties and got me and my sister in their early thirties. So what's your personal connection to Amsterdam in the night? Well, my personal connection to Amsterdam in the night is, I think it's very familiar to many that when you are on a certain age, let's say 17, 18, maybe 16, you find it difficult to communicate on several topics with your parents and you feel the need to... go out to meet others. Myself, I used to skateboard a lot, so I was outside quite so many times. And yeah, the older you get, the longer, the later you have to be home. And yeah, I made a lot of friends outside. I used to dance and do breakdance, and I was interested in actually all elements of hip-hop, but also theater. And I was finding quite so many difficulties with my parents. The rules and lines, etc. put me in, and yeah, the night was actually the place where I could set myself free from their ideas or wishes. My parents were pretty strict, and I could leave the house, yes, but then I had to be home at a certain time, and then I found it really hard to be home at that time. It would be quite often that the key was in the lock, so it would be impossible. possible for me to go inside. Just locked out. Yeah, locked out. And sometimes I would tell my friends, I would ask my friends if I could sleep with them. But also a lot of times I didn't really dare to tell them my truth or the way things were laid out for me. And then I would just go to my neighborhood and just walk around like five, six, seven in the morning. Yeah, nightlife really was a way out for me. I believe it is for a lot of people. You know, when you're at a certain age, you just want to find your own beliefs and it's really hard to... to deal with the things your parents maybe want for you. And it's a time where you have to find out yourself. And this was my time, yeah. So why do you think nightlife is so important and powerful for our city and our Amsterdammers? And why do you think we should treat it with big care? It's a privilege, let's start with that. It's a privilege to be able to have something as a nightlife, because nightlife for me stands, in many ways it stands for freedom. The night time is actually the only time where you have this freedom, where you can actually explore yourself and others. So just looking back on the accomplishments we've made with the Nightmare and the Foundation, So I guess MIRIC's biggest accomplishment is organizing several international summits on nightlife and night culture. Yes, definitely. But moreover, introducing the first 24 hours licenses here for... a bunch of clubs back in 2013. So I think you can state that our nightlife has changed drastically over the past years. And for the first time, a good selection of clubs can stay open until whenever they want. Yeah. And in return, they need to commit to offering a more diverse cultural creative content for their clubs and become more multidisciplinary, I would say, with a strong community function, such as the school, for example. It's not only a club, it's also a restaurant, a bar, a gym, a co-working space, which is really incredible. and it wasn't like that before. You can practically hang out there for 24 hours and it's not only about drinking a lot and dancing a lot, but it has much more value, I would say. So obviously Marek and his partner Ella Overkleeves made big steps to professionalize the position. Back in 2002, when the first Nightmare was installed, it was more of a gimmick, wasn't it? It was more of a figure that... Came from the night, but it wasn't a really serious job. It wasn't. I wouldn't necessarily say it was a gimmick, but it was an idea. And also when you talk about a 24-hour permit, obviously it's something Mierik introduced also with Isis, his nightmare before Mierik. But it's the nightmare. was an ID and the ID was professionalized by MIRIC and also he got between the city council and the mayors and he made the nightmare an important... he was able to tell people how important it would be to have somebody protecting and thinking about how our nightlife is and should be and can be, especially at Forest Cities Amsterdam where there are so many tourists, also so many people who come from abroad to live here. It's very important to keep your certain beliefs that maybe have to do with the fundamentals of Amsterdam. And our last night mayor, who unfortunately passed away, Eberhard van der Laan, also saw... or mayor, yes, sorry, also saw this, also had this vision of creating a position for somebody who could speak up for the night and really be representative. So when Mierik started his role, he was pretty much left with a little paper, an A4, with some contacts and some scribbles as a handover. So good luck with that. I have much more now, definitely. How are you being prepared for this role? How am I being prepared? Luckily I have Ella and Mirik who are supporting me 100%. There are a lot of documents I have to look into, stuff that's already been done, but also a lot of connections that have been made in the last years. There is this club committee, which is the Club van Honderd, the Club of Hundred. These are 65 clubs who are sponsors from our foundation. I have to meet all these people, I have to talk to all these people, hear about their ideas, also gain their confidence to actually really do something for the city and also bring a lot of people and new people together. So you work on a regular basis with the mayor and his council. How does that work? How often do you meet? Well... We just had our city council elections yesterday. So I didn't really have the chance to meet. Well, I've met our mayor now, but we will have a new mayor pretty soon. And I think I have a meeting with him next week. And then the new mayor will be installed. And then I'll have another meeting. for these meetings we even have pre-meetings to exactly have on paper what we want to discuss and also try to get a fund for our foundation and the things we do and this is actually pretty new for me but very very exciting just to have the chance to like everybody has these conversations in clubs or at bars we talk about the things you find interesting or important and now I have the chance to talk to the decision makers and show them my passion my love and my dedication for our nightlife yeah you have such a powerful role and I think that's it's amazing that here in Amsterdam we try to bridge the gap between the nightlife and local politics. And Amsterdam, our city has one of the biggest electronic music offer, I would say. And sometimes you often see when things go wrong in the night, when there's violence or rules that are not followed, local politics can easily react by killing. or locking up the industry. Just like parents would, right? Yes. Yeah, we've seen it in Sydney where they... created lockout laws and just locking up the whole industry. I think the nightmare is important to avoid reactions like this. Definitely. So what effects do you see on having these 24 hours licenses? A huge effect. As you mentioned as well, these places offer so much more than just a drink, a dark space with loud music. And also for a city like Amsterdam with less than a million inhabitants, it's really important and nice that we are able to go out, but not just go out at night to dance. but also to watch a film or be inspired by art or meet each other. And as I mentioned before, in our daytime we have to work, we have certain things we have to do, and with this 24-hour permit it actually gives us more time to get to know each other or build connections when it's just going to a club. and dancing loud music and the only place you can actually talk is maybe the smoking area or the hallway. A 24-hour permit. offers so much more. It also offers people to go to an event during daytime. How nice is it when you are able to have a super nice lunch with friends, maybe at your place or at my place, and then at 3 or 4 o'clock we go to the club and we have some dancing, we have some talks, we meet up with more people, and whenever you feel like it, it could be 8 at night, 10 at night. 10 in the morning you leave and you go home and you go back to you go to your work and it also gives so much more um gives so much more feeling to the daily life you live people really change um to what they experience by night and this they can obviously bring in their daily life yeah i think it's also a great tool to expand city. I think the first pilots with the 24-hour license, the licenses were granted to the clubs that were a little bit more out of the city, outside of the city. which gives a bit of more spread of people expanding their view and going to these places. And these places also become very... ...influential places to build for new buildings, for new ideas. The nightlife really creates the possibility for new places to be found and for investors. eventually also to invest. And that's how we are the creators of the city. We create the next new hotspot. And this is a beautiful thing that, as I said, our last mayor also saw and understood that these people need to be heard. These people need to have a place to create the future of the city. Yeah, and develop your talents as well. Yes, definitely. That's super important. So what do you think are the most important challenges Amsterdam is facing? Several. Amsterdam is a very diverse city, one of the most diverse cities in the world. I think we're in top three. But hey, who cares about numbers? Yeah, we have, talking about numbers, 180 different nationalities living here. Yes. Quite impressive. It's super impressive. And I'm one of them. And my friends also are from all places. So it's super important that we are able to stick together, even though the media can portray different things. It's very important that we are able to connect and find each other. It's also very important that we feel the need to speak each other's language. It would be nice if I could say two sentences or one word or just say hello or goodbye. I would have a connection with this person. Instead of only wanting people to speak my language and not just talking my language as in Dutch or English, but talking my language as in my personal. it's very important that people understand each other. And by understanding each other, people also have... respect for each other. When people talk about certain minorities, it cannot just be a negative thing. When somebody talks about a minority, I can think, hey, my baker also is from this nationality. I have a super good connection with him. He's a super nice guy. We only talk two or three words with each other, but it's always love. And that's an important thing that has to stay and has to... move through the city and also through nightlife. Yeah, I do feel, to be honest, that our diversity in the city doesn't really reflect well enough in nightlife. I still see that our dance floors are predominantly white. Yes, and I would say yes and no. When we talk about electronic music, yes. When we talk about Afro hip-hop... different types of urban genres, I would definitely say yes. And these two worlds can definitely also learn something from each other. Are they mixed already or are they living separate? Well, they're... pretty much living separate. Myself, I grew up with a lot of hip-hop and I think when I was 22, yeah, between 20 and 22, 23, I got more and more into electronic music, first starting as an MC, vocalist. But I also found that industry very white. I almost found that I had to have a reason to be there. if I was not white. And yeah, this kind of struck me. So do you feel there's a role for clubs as well to make the venues and the clubs more inclusive? Is it, for example, the door policy that's falling behind? I think there's several things. I think door policy is very important, but also obviously the people you have working in your club. and not just people you have working in your club, also people you have playing, I often say that diversity is a new form of quality because if it's just electronic music played by one type of people, one sort of people, you automatically will reach the ceiling. And I believe, personally, that by putting several people in places, several cultures, several types of IDs into one place, you'll find the best ID. You'll add something from every culture or from every type of person. And then also these persons will find something there. Because I remember when I was coming to a lot of clubs, I find myself as the only person of color. I automatically didn't feel at home that much. And that's the thing what a club has to be. You have to feel free. You have to feel safe. You have to feel comfortable. That's one of the most important things. And I hope, obviously, we're still going to talk about safety because that's also a very big issue. But you have to feel at home. And when I'm there, I'm the only... person of color, I don't feel unease. This is a really great quote. It was mentioned before, I think, Werner Meyers, who said, diversity is being invited to the party and inclusion is being asked to dance, which I find really, really cool. And that's pretty much the thing we need to accomplish now, I think. Definitely. And it will be different. difficult because changing something from start like when you start a club and you start saying okay like we want to have this and that and this in yes you have you start with that and people already understand but when the club is already there when the structure is already standing it's really difficult to take parts out and put other parts in automatically you will have to disappoint people and you have to tell people for some reason you are choosing him over her or her over him and it's not just skin color or ethnicity it's also Male, female, queer, LGBT, it's everything. So can you tell us a little bit about safety and your campaign or your plans to create a safer nightlife? Yes, definitely. I think it's very important for people to feel safe in their surroundings because if they feel safe, they also feel... They will also be more able to talk to others, but also be more able to express themselves. And when people express themselves, they learn from each other. If they don't express themselves, they keep that within them, or they won't be able to develop, which can also end up in aggressive behavior. even. I think it's very important that people are feeling free. females on the dance floor. I listen to a lot of podcasts where people talk about, there's a Dutch saying, meisjes plagen, kusjes vragen. To bully is to ask a kiss or to playfully ask a kiss from a girl. And there are so many structures that are built in our society where we really have to think again if that is how we want. Is this how we want to raise our children? Is this how we think we are equally having the same opportunities? I often heard that females leave a party not because they're tired, but just because they're tired of the harassment. They're tired of being touched, being asked, being looked at or being whistled at in a certain way. And this is not what I think our future should be. something we really need to address. And this is also something I talk with the club owners with. How can we make a more safe space inside the club? And then again also, how can we make more space outside of the club? There are safety people who work at the club. The security also has to be trained. The bar staff has to be trained. have to know that they have to keep their eye out for things like this. I think there also should be facilities and I know that you thought about that as well. Also if you think about safety in listening to music or safety in taking drugs we need to have earplugs available at clubs or we need to educate people if they want to take drugs. how to do it and how not to do it. Yes, definitely. That's also safety, isn't it? Definitely. It's a very wide skill. It's a big topic. Safety has also to do with a certain education and a certain adultish way of enjoying nightlife. I want to be able to go out on a Sunday and to work on the next day after. Just because I really... benefit from going out it really helps me just like how people benefit from going to the gym and to have a safe space is as I said is super important exercise for the mind and the soul definitely and the body as well I rave I rave I sweat one yeah learning maybe you can you can give other cities or some considerations what what does it take in order to be successful as a nightmare and a foundation i think especially what like you said to be a foundation and to be independent is one of the most important things as we said midich milan brought the nightmare to a wider audience and it's being internationally It's becoming a thing, so to say. I think New York also has a new nightmare now. London has been having a nightmare for a little while also. And this idea is being brought to more cities and countries. But as I said, I think it's really important to be independent because only in that way you'll be able to talk to every party. be taken serious by every party as well. And also you're able to still keep your own ideas and your own red line through the massive industry. Because there are so many things going on. There are so many different, like males, females. There's money, there is drugs, there's so many people who want to have their shit. say or already have their say in the night and it's very important as a nightmare and a foundation to be able to touch all of them but not be connected in a way that anybody is waiting for you to help them in a way that you are helping them to earn more money or to make them a better club whatsoever. Yeah, me personally, I've been wondering about your music taste and if there is a track in your nightlife or night career that really made a mark. Yes, I do. I do have one. Can you tell us about the moments? Yes. Maybe you can hear from my voice, I kind of feel in love now because just thinking of this track and this moment. It was during Lowlands Festival. It's not the biggest festival we have in Holland, but it's the most prestigious festival, I might say. There are a lot of international acts, but also a lot of Dutch DJs. who are on the top of the industry that are able to play there. One of my best friends, Elias Mazian, played during that festival and he was playing in the 24-hour tent. So the tent that doesn't end, you know. I've been there, yeah. And it's a three-day festival. We were there, we were camping, we were having fun with a lot of friends. and he already asked me, like, hey, Sunday I have to do the closing. Are you down to host or emcee with me? And I think he asked this on a Friday, and I said, yeah, definitely, man, we're going to do this. But, of course, on Sunday we were, like, completely smashed and tired and hadn't showered for I don't know how long. And then he asked me, hey, Shamino, are you still down to do the closing? this with me I looked at him and said okay let's go let's do this so he was already playing and I think the the tent was half full he was not really feeling it because the DB meter was too high and then my friend took it out and another friend lifted me up and I sat on the speakers and I was able to host for such a huge crowd and more and more people came in. And then he played the tune Cookie Dust from Roman Flugel, which is one of my favorite artists. And I still, like, I think it's four years ago, but I still have people come up to me in the streets or during events and say, hey, man, that set, that day, the best moment in club history. Wow. Amazing story. Well, let's have a listen then. Thank you to everyone who contributed. Thank you very much for listening. We'll be back at the end of April with another blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides.
