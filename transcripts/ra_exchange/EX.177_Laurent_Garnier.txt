Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Ropline, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. For nearly three decades, Laurent Garnier has urged himself to create on the cutting edge of dance music. Beyond the turntables and studio, Garnier moves between genres and performance techniques with the aim of continuously challenging himself. Pick any moment from his musical journey and it's easy to see this creative momentum. There was the hacienda in the late 80s, his time spent in America... exploring house, the techno of his label F Communications, and his entry into the realm of jazz. "I never want to be an old artist playing my old tracks just to please the older crowd," he says. "I don't think that's healthy." So in 2013, with forthcoming releases on labels like 50 Weapons and Still Music, Garnier continues to reinvent himself, as he told R.A.'s Sanjay Fernandez in a advance of his headlining set at our December 13th party in London. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ So you're playing Panorama Bar? I am indeed. Tonight? Yes. Tonight. Do you know what time? Yeah, 4 o'clock in the morning until 9. very decent hours isn't it i'm gonna i'm gonna go to bed before how do you keep up the energy i sleep before um you know if i start late usually after 2 2 30 in the morning if i start after 2 or 2 30 i go to bed i try to sleep for a couple of hours so i feel much better you know i think with my old age i have to do that now before I I never cared when I was younger you know I could go on for hours I still can go on for a long time but I need little moments of peace and I'm gonna get that tonight before I'm gonna play because especially I'm doing like a five hour set I don't drink too much I don't do anything so I need my head to be together and For me, DJ is quite a mental thing as well as physical. So I need my brain to be... together and usually I'm better in the morning when I wake up so I'm kind of sleeping before and I feel like it's you know some way the morning so my head works better do you how often do you get these moments of peace that you uh so desperately need I if I need it I get it I I take it um you know I'd rather not go for dinner or stuff like that then, you know, I mean, now I'm getting more like that because I mean, I take my DJing very, very seriously. And every time I want to, I want to try to do as good as I can. I've never been that kind of guy who just gets pissed before the gig and goes, I will see what's going to happen. And if I'm drunk, I'm drunk. I'm not like that. I take my gigs very seriously. So, you know, if I have to go to bed, I would go to bed instead of going for dinner. But it's kind of, you know, I'm used to it. It's fine. It's no problem. Yeah, I mean, well, it's funny that you started with DJing because I actually wanted to start with production. Well, let's go to production. Yeah, because as much as busy as your DJ schedule is, I hear the next six months is massive for you in the studio. Oh, you've got people talking to you, eh? You've got information. I've got ears everywhere. I've been very busy in my studio, yes. So, I mean, you've got forthcoming releases planned on some pretty big labels. You know. Yeah, totally. No. I mean, tell me what you know. Well, I mean. I'd love to find out. Just names like Still Music popped up. That's the first one. Yeah. Okay. What's the? January. January. January. And how did that come about? Well, I've asked the people from, there's a festival in France called Les Nuits Sonores, and they have some kind of a management company or like a company where there's quite a lot of people working together called Artifarti. And Vincent, which is the boss from the New Sonor, has been an old friend of mine for a long time. And I kept telling Vincent, you know, it'll be nice if we start working together a bit closer. You have to understand that why I moved on like this with him. It's because we actually opened a club together in France. We opened a club called Le Sucre. That opened three months ago now. And we teamed up together to, you know, put some money and open this place. So there is some people from Artifarti. There are some people from the Nuisonneur, which is a company aside from Artifarti. There is, of course, Vincent. There's me. There's Agoya, the DJ. And then there's a couple of other people from Lyon, which got involved with the club. So already been getting closer to Vincent, I said to him, you know, maybe we should think about teaming up. a bit stronger. And I said to him, I have a great team of people I work with and I've been working with them for a long time, like Christian, my tool manager, and then Eric, which I used to run a label with, and then Susanna here, which does all my bookings in Germany. So I have a very good team. But I felt that I wanted to do some different things and I needed some fresh blood, as well as working with my team. I didn't want to... get rid of anybody because I'm very happy whoever I'm working with but I thought some fresh blood would excite everybody. So I started to work with Vincent and the people from Arty Farty and then we started to think about what I should do next year, you know, what I'd like to do and then they told me maybe you should go back to the underground because you always belong to the underground. But then at some point, sometimes some messages were not clear, you know, to the punters. And especially as the whole scene has completely changed in France. France is... is really living a really exciting revolution music-wise at the moment. And I think the young kids, which are, I don't know, 22, 23, which run very small labels, they don't know what I've done 25 years ago or what I've been doing for 25 years. Of course, they were not there. So it's kind of working with these guys because it makes sense, because it's where I've always been. It's where I'm at. So I've been doing a lot of different projects for the last eight years, eight, ten years. But I haven't done that many dance floor orientated music. I've made some albums. Then I made some music for contemporary ballets. I wrote a book and then we released the book again. And then I worked for some films. I've done a lot of different things. but concentrating on my more dense flow of music, which I could release on labels and, you know, not on... not on the idea of doing an album. I haven't done that for a long time and I used to do that a lot. So we are going back to this. And my first idea was, sorry, it's a bit of a long story, but I said to the guys from Artifatti, I think it'll be nice to go to labels that people don't expect me to. You know, I think people would expect me to go to labels maybe like Cocoon or maybe try to speak to Cocoon or maybe try to speak to Poker Flats because they're great labels because they're very established or maybe carry on with Headbangers which could be a possibility of course I thought it would be more exciting to get to much smaller labels. So I'm starting with Still, which is not a big label. It's not a small label. It's quite a big label. But what I wanted to do is, because I love so many different kinds of music, instead of putting all the different styles of music in one album, I said, why don't I do it the other way? I do different EPs under my name. So they're all going to come out under the name of Garnier. We're going to forget Laurent. It's all going to be Garnier now. I don't know if you know that. I knew that. Oh, you knew that. You do know a lot. I hope I'm going to tell you something you don't know. Surprise me. But I'm not going to tell you everything, of course And my first idea was to make a very Chicago orientated EP because it started there. You know, the first thing that I heard in house music was Chicago. So I thought if I have to start again something fresh now, you know, doing it in a funny way, I think I should start with the basics. So Chicago. I went to Chicago this summer and then Jerome, the guy who runs Still Music, is a good friend of mine. We've known each other for a long time. And then we went to have dinner together, just the two of us. And I said to him, you know, I have this idea. I've got these guys I'm working with at the moment. And I'd like... to do few different EPs. What I said to him is, we're going to do 12 together, but we will not go away because we're going to reuse that 12-inch later on on something different. And then we might connect everybody together. So he looked at me like, oh, this is exciting. you know, can I hear the track? And I said, listen, I have one track I've done. It's not mixed properly, but I was playing in Chicago on that night. So I said, I'm going to play it tonight at Smart Bar. So he came with me at Smart Bar and then I played the track without telling him, you know, because I wanted to see his reaction. And he comes up and he says, hey, dude, what's the track? And I'm like, that's one of the new tracks. And he said, I want it. I want it. I want it now. Jerome is a very enthusiastic guy. He's a very interesting character because he's a French guy that lives in Chicago. And he's the person at the moment that is reuniting in some ways. some of the old boys from Chicago and re-releasing their music, which is wonderful. And he's actually doing the same with Detroit because he's releasing a new compilation about the new scene of Detroit. And the funny thing in Detroit, they don't have this thing about putting everybody together and trying to do something together. It's just a French guy that lives in Chicago that does it for them. So he's that kind of person that puts people together and... gets his shit done. You know, he does the thing. I think you probably couldn't have picked a better label than Still Music if you wanted to get across the Chicago vibe, I think, in that sense. It's funny because I didn't have the idea to release a Chicago-orientated music EP in Chicago. But when I went there and I played it and I saw the people in the room going crazy and then Mike DeBorn was there and then there was a couple of friends of mine from Chicago, which I haven't seen for a long time. And then Jerome was there and then Jerome said, hey dude, what's this track? And I'm like, it's my new track. And he said to me, I want it. I want it on steel. And I said to him, I think this is perfect. This is brilliant. So I went home and then we spoke a lot with Jerome. And the great thing with him is you can send him text or emails anytime. It just answers you within five minutes. And I love that. I love having this fast communication with people. And I said to him, all right, I'm going to do, the whole 12-inch is going to be about Chicago. So I've done one track which is very ghetto. One is very housey. And the other one is very much like... like a hard edged stuff they used to release on Dance Mania. It has a little bit of a techno taste, but it's still very Chicago. And all the vocals on it is just all from Dance Mania. I've done what they used to do. They used to strip everybody else's music. So I've stripped the whole collection of Dance Mania with samples. And I made these three tracks and that's the first EP to come out in January. That's awesome. And because as a DJ, I travel a lot. what we'd like to do with this whole thing, with these four EPs that will come out within five or six months, we're going to release each EP on a different country. That's something we want to do because we want to be very different music-wise. We want to catch small communities. We know very well, you know, I know for sure I'm not going to... it's not going to be a very global EP, either the first one, the second one, or the third one. It doesn't matter. I'd rather go back to the underground and talk to a community. And then from that build something, you know, go back to my roots. That's it. Totally. I mean, in terms of even the second release here is also coming up on 50 Weapons. No, the third release is coming out on 50. Oh, you know 50 Weapons. You do know about 50 Weapons. The tracks are done. I mean, that's a nice, I mean, I don't know the other two releases, but it seems like a nice compliment. to the still music release as an aesthetic because the label itself has its own distinct sound. Definitely. And music-wise, super different than the EP I'm doing. I mean, the second EP is a down-tempo EP. So we actually send the down-tempo tracks. It's funny how it works with 50 weapons, because you know, I can tell you. I sent Garneau and Maritz, I sent them three down-tempo tracks saying I loved the Mod Selector album, I love the Mod Selection compilation, and I would, you know, why I'm approaching you. Because I didn't know them very well. Why I'm approaching you is maybe on the idea of, I explained to them the whole project. It's maybe on the idea of doing like a down-tempo EP on Monkey Town. I didn't aim for 50 weapons. It was more like for Monkey Town. And then they come back to me and they said, no, we don't do 12-inch on Monkey Town. Usually we do albums. But we really like one of the tracks. we would love to take it for the mod selection, the new mod selection compilation. I said to him, it's really, you know, it's a great compliment that you want that track. But I think I want to keep these three tracks together. And as I thought about it as a 12-inch as a whole, I'd rather release it, you know, somewhere. And then... and then maybe come back with another track for your mod selection compilation. And they said to me, they said, well, actually, we would love to do a more, you know, up-tempo dance floor stuff on 50 Weapons. I said to them, I've got two tracks. I've got just maybe what you need. I don't know if you're going to dig them. So I send them to Gernot and then within five minutes, he sent me a text back saying, man, these tracks are really hot. I really want them. And he said to me, I want a third track, you know, because two tracks is maybe not enough. I want a third one. So I said to him, well, I'm actually working on a kind of 303 track and I like it. I think it's going to be a nice, you know, complimentary track. So I sent it to him this week and then he comes back to me and he says, you know, Laurent, I've been thinking quite a lot because these guys are thinking a lot like me. I've been thinking quite a lot and I think the first two tracks stands out for each, you know, they're strong enough. I don't think we need the third one. So I'm like, okay, no problem, which is cool because I've got an extra track, which for me is going to start a new EP. So I've got a lot of music. I've got already the three first EPs done. So the second one will be down-tempo. And I know which label I'd like to do it with. The guys are very interested and it's a super, super small label. It's a very, very small, completely intimate label. Because I don't want people to think that, again, I'm sleeping around, I'm trying to shop. So I'm not. I just want to work with people. I love what they do. I love what they represent, what they've been fighting for. And you know, I wanted to be, I don't know, I wanted to be like quite a strong relationship. So I have very good relationship with quite a lot of people. I'd rather go to a super, super small label that have only done two or three releases because I don't release music to sell it. I don't care. I want to do stuff with them because it's getting, you know, we're getting a stronger relationship. I think it's interesting as well that you know that people might expect you to release on kind of institutional labels like... like uh of course Pogaflat or Cocoon but then you're also this is a statement of kind of this continuation of digging for music that I mean I want I want people to understand it's absolutely not dissing Cocoon or Pogaflat because these are labels I've been working with I've been working with Pogaflat because I remixed Martin Lenski and then Cocoon I've been friends with the guys from Cocoon for a long time They've asked me to do compilations. So they're my friends. They're people I work with. But I thought for me as a music digger, as you say, I needed to go somewhere a bit unexpected. I mean, when I released the Jack in the Box on Headbangers. We did it with Pedro because we knew everybody would be very surprised. We did it because we're friends and because we thought it was funny. And I mean, this is why I actually call the track Jack in a Box. I was the Jack in a Box. I was that person coming out of that box saying, hey, I'm here as well. And we did it especially, we did it as well as, you know, Pedro wanted to do because he liked the music, but we did it as well because we knew it was going to create something a bit strange. And we took people, we surprised people. And I think that's healthy. After 25 years of being here and doing my stuff. I need to carry on surprising people. So sometimes when you surprise people, they get pissed off or sometimes they, you know, they're quite happy or they go, wow, this is tricky. Why did you do that? At least, you know, we have something to talk about. And I hate going into a stable thing. I need to feel uncomfortable to feel alive. And I think especially in techno music, techno music has been there for 25 years. And I think and I see that with the new generation. I see that the new generation is kind of shaking the whole thing up. I think three or four years ago, we arrived in a time where... everybody was going quite fast in his own train tracks. We were comfortable. We are who we are. We carry on doing our gigs. We carry on doing what we do. And we could carry on doing it for the next five or ten years, but not bringing anything fresh or not surprising anymore because it's been there for a long time. And we need fresh blood. We need new things. And we need, as artists, we need to surprise people. Do you know what I mean? Do you understand? Yeah, completely. I mean, for me, what I see in your work, perhaps through the last two decades, is a humor as well. Like that kind of movement between labels, sounds, and genres. in your album, the artwork or the film clips for the, maybe the radio edits and stuff. There is this kind of humor that comes across that, that doesn't, it demands not to be taken too seriously. Of course. Of course. The thing is, I haven't built myself like a product. This is why I think some people don't really understand me because I haven't marketed myself like some kind of a product. Now you can see, it comes back to what I was saying to you three or four years ago. I think a lot of people, a lot of DJs, a lot of the people in the scene for the last 10 years, thought about themselves as a product. So they designed logos for themselves. Now they write their names in a special way. They're becoming something you can stick on a wall and, you know, they're becoming logos. And I found this a bit unhealthy. I don't really like that. Me, I want to be myself. I want to be who I am. So I do a lot of different projects. I try to keep a lot of humor in what I do. You know, I mean, if you follow me in my Twitter, Instagram or whatever, you can see serious pictures of me DJing. But then after that, you can see me dressed up as a vampire. or something because I went to a party and I put all this in there because for me, it's who I am. I'm stupid and sometimes I talk a lot of shit and if you know me, that's the way I am. So it doesn't shock my friends. Do you know what I mean? It's like the name of your radio show. It is what it is, right? Exactly. It is what it is. If I wake up in a bad mood, I'm going to say I'm in a super bad mood. So I'm only going to play music that's going to cheer me up. And last week, you know, I thought I was very sad because of Lou Reed. So I did a special Lou Reed when everybody thinking I'm going And then a week after, I don't know, if I want to listen to down-tempo music, I'll just play down-tempo music. If I read a book about jazz, I'm going to say, oh, I just read this book. I heard about all these references, so let's hear about it. That's the show. It is what it is. That's who I am. It's the same as my own radio station, which is PBB, Pedro's Broadcast. I just did it to make my record collection live a little bit. You can listen to the Sex Pistols and straight after you listen to Derek May and then after that you listen to maybe the Ravel's Bolero. It has no connection but for me it has because it's all there in my house and that's who I am. That's who I am and I don't do it too seriously. It kind of... reflects the moves through different genres that you've had in the last years. And I mean, like in the, in the last two decades as well. And I mean, I, the interesting thing for me is your movement through jazz as, as in production and hearing that influence stray more and more into your work. And I think it's, it's become such a. undeniable part of who you are if it wasn't from the start. I'm listening. I found it very interesting. I think jazz is a very important part in the process of techno music. What I mean by techno music is the roots of techno music, Detroit. Without jazz, we wouldn't have had people like Funkadelic. and, you know, these big kind of bands which are making funk music. And without Funkadelic, Derek may always say, the techno is Kraftwerk and Funkadelic in an elevator. You know, it's just the two genres put together and you put it in a shaker. It makes techno. So jazz, for me, it's very clear. It's always been part of the roots of techno music. Not just about the music. as well the way of thinking, the forward thinking about jazz, you know, the idea of making music for out of space, because this was very present in jazz, you know. All these elements aside as well as the music, which I found quite similar. So at one point... I don't know, I did a lot of dance floor stuff. And then at one point I thought, I want to go further. And I started doing some live shows. So I met some jazz musicians because I wanted to have some musicians with me. By meeting these people, I kind of listened to more and more jazz because, you know, I got to talk a lot more about jazz because I had jazz musicians touring with me. I told them lots about techno and they started listening to techno and they told me about jazz and then they played me stuff I didn't know. Because I'm kind of a curious person when... When I start to like something, usually I want it all. I'm a bit... All or nothing. Well, I'm a bit unsatisfied as a person. So when I discover something, I just jump on it and say, I want it all. I want all these records. So it's very much like my character. So, you know, meeting great musicians which were really very... They had a lot of knowledge about jazz. It was great because they gave me references that I never heard before. And then, of course, I listened to a lot of stuff. So my live show evolved a hell of a lot. I don't know what I was searching for. But the funny thing is, if you look at my live career, not the production career, but my live career, the live kind of influenced a lot what I did afterwards as a musician. But I always thought that the live versions were better than my records. You know, if you take the latest live version of Man With A Red Face or... Even Acid Eiffel, which is a really old track, or stuff like Damakunji, the live versions, when we've been playing them live like 50 times with the boys, the live versions are unbelievable. Can I just interrupt and ask how you play Acid Eiffel? as a live jazz? It's very simple. I have a flutist. I have a 303. I have, you know, all the, all the normal 909, 303, sample. Well, the 303, I have a real one, but then the rest is like 909 samples and stuff like this. And then you have a percussionist. You can write a theme so the horns can come in. So you can have like saxophone, you can have anything. We used to do a version that started very, very mellow, very soft with a flutist. And then there was a percussionist in there. And then, of course, I had a keyboardist. So the keyboardist was playing Rhodes and building it up more and more. And then in the middle of Acid Eiffel, which is one thing I've loved doing for the last 10 years, is basically play two tracks in one and have a track go completely in a different direction, which is a very jazz thing. You start with a theme or you start with something which people know. Then you switch to something else. Then you get a little bit darker. You go a little bit crazier. And then at one point, you switch back to that. And I've learned that in jazz and I've done it a lot live. So Acid Eiffel was going into a much more techno track, really trippy, really, really, really super trippy. And then the saxophonist was coming in and doing some really strange improvisation, very, very much like Ethiopian jazz. So it's more like psychedelic. And then we were ending it up back to acid iPhone. You can play anything live and you can bring any. live instrument in it it depends how you're going to build it that's it i mean it sounds obviously like you've kind of perfected this live performance um and but i was reading as well that your first live um performance in a jazz context was the montreux festival in 98 yes this is where i wrote man with a red face right but the question i i have was i'm more interested I'm interested in why they decided to book you for that festival because looking back, it's hard to see why they would have gone with a booking like that. So I'm just wondering whether you can give me a sense of what was going on. I agree, but any big festival now, which... used to be well known for being rock and roll festival, they have dance rooms now. Dance music, I'm talking generally, but dance music now is part of your festival life. So Glastonbury, you know, Carcox performs at Glastonbury. Glastonbury has always been known as a rock and roll festival. Now there's techno or electro or dance rooms everywhere. There's always a dance room. So, I mean, Montreux Jazz, the guy who used to run Montreux is unfortunately dead now, but he was a very open-minded person. I mean, would you think that Deep Purple was performing at Montreux Jazz? I wouldn't be surprised. Well... Well, you're wrong because Deep Purple actually, it's not just performed at Montreux Jazz, but they performed a lot at Montreux Jazz and they actually wrote Smoke on the Water during the period they did the Montreux Jazz and they were in a hotel in front of the lake. And then one of the band members opened his window and then there was a boat. burning in the middle of the lake and this is where they wrote Smoke on the Water. So actually the famous song from Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water, comes from Montreux Jazz. And Montreux has always been open to all sorts of bands. You know, Montreux Jazz, you had before me, you had some techno bands playing, you had some rock and roll band, psychedelic. Everybody was performing there. So when they booked you, I mean, if... It was not the first time. Not the first time. No. Do you... I mean, getting thrown out of a... Like, getting taken out of a club context to a completely different context, it must be incredibly challenging. Like, almost panic-inducing. Well... When I started my first live show, the idea, that was a long time ago. I mean, we are talking, I think, more than 15 years ago. The idea was to do something different than my DJ sets. The biggest mistake would have been if I would have taken a turntable on stage. There was a lot of people already did not understand what a DJ was. Of course, the people in the techno scene knew, but, you know, the normal people, they didn't know what the hell was a DJ. So, you know, with my friends, with Eric at F-Com, we started thinking and, OK, I've released an album. I'd like to take this album live. what machine do I take? And Eric said, no turntable. You have to switch from one thing to another. You have to make a difference between the two things. Otherwise, you will confuse people. And I said to him, you're right. So not... I'm not going to have any turntable, but I'm going to bring some people with me. So I'm going to have some live musicians. So this is where I met Philippe Nadeau, you know, the saxophonist. I had a violinist at the time. I had a percussionist. And we started playing. We started playing together. And the first really strange gig we did where we felt that we were getting some new doors opening for our music was when we did a live show at the Olympia in Paris. The Olympia is a very well-known concert place in Paris. And it was more like for chanson française. So when they opened the door to us, we were the first one to come and play electronic music there. That was a revolution. Going to Montreux Jazz was not... What year was that in the Olympia? I need to check, but I think it's in 1994, 95, something like that. That was a real strange thing. Then going to Montreux Jazz was less surprising because Claude Knops, the guy who did Montreux Jazz, was a very open-minded person and you knew already that some DJs had played at Montreux Jazz because he knows very well that Miles Davis would maybe be in electronic music now. So it was not such a big thing for him to start inviting DJs or people playing live. But still what was strange for me in my career as a live performer was when we did this live show in Paris in a place called La Salle Pleyel. Salle Pleyel is the equivalent of the Royal Albert Hall, which is the biggest classical venue. That was strange. That was three or four years ago and for the first time ever. we actually came into that room and we played electronic music in a place where they just have orchestra and that's all they have. Or maybe jazz once in a while, but not the crazy jazz. And I know a lot of people were very shocked that we were going to play there and it was a concert which was absolutely amazing because I brought more musicians, it was ten of us on stage and it's a sitting down room and I got everybody to stand up and going crazy. So that was bigger for us as an achievement than Montreux. I'm interested also in the dynamic that... I mean, you go from a studio, and correct me if I'm wrong, but you go from a studio where you are kind of in control of everything and the processes, and then you move to a stage and you're dealing with musicians. But not only musicians, your work with the free jazz, Birgit Wesseltof, like... he's a free jazz improv guy you know so how is an electronic musician where you are so it has a rigidity about it. So in control, you mean? I had to find my space. I really, really had to find my space. And that took a long time. At the beginning, I was not leaving enough space to my musicians. So I kind of left them space. And then after that, I gave them too much space. And I was not in control anymore. I mean, it took a long time. I released a book, you know, and I talk a lot about this. It was 10, 15 years of struggle and problems. And only the last three or four years of my live shows were really good for me because I kind of find my space. I kind of found who I needed to be when I was live on stage with my boys. It took a long time because first of all, we needed to find... a way of talking, you know, on stage. Then I had to give them space. And then sometime I gave them too much space. So they were kind of taking the thing and, you know, where I should have directed the whole thing. And the last four or five years, I've toured with two or three musicians, which I felt very strong with, you know, very close. I had a very close relationship. And I've learned one thing with Boggy, because you're mentioning Boggy. I've learned one thing with him is there cannot be two captains on a ship. They can't. And with me and Boggy, it was good, but there was two captains on stage. And I met another guy after Boggy. Well, actually, during the time I was working with Boggy, and it was really funny because I met Ben. And he came to do some kind of a battle with Boggy one night. And Boggy saw Ben play. And he came up to me and he said, Laurent, I think you found your boy. I said, I think I did. I think I did. And I saw that tonight. And Boggy saw it as well. Boggy knew very well. He was going to go back and carry on his own thing. And he knew it was a stage. You know, we worked together and we... We're very good friends and he's a very clever man. So when he saw Ben, he said to me, I think you found the right person who you need. And when Ben arrived, everything changed because Ben and Philippe, my saxophonist, taught me how to direct properly. And then they said to me, you should be so free on stage. you know, but you need to direct us. You can do what you want. You can take us anywhere you want, but you need to be the conductor. We need one conductor. And I was never a conductor before because I was too shy because I thought, how can I be a conductor where I can't even, you know, jump on the piano and make this guy cry? And they can make me cry with their instruments. But then I understood after all these years that even the greatest musician... Sometimes if he's not directed or if he's not put into the right environment, it doesn't work. And I've learned that, but it took a long time, a lot of experience and a lot of, you know, hurtful experience. And then when Ben arrived and... And Philippe, and then I had another Philippe, and then ScanX arrived as well. It was five of us on the band. I had time because ScanX was as well doing the machines with me. And I just enjoy myself. And by starting to enjoy myself, I was running around, you know, on stage and trying to whisper some notes to the boys and going, yeah, try to do... And then the guy could not hear properly, so he was trying to play it. And then, of course, it was in tone with a track, but different than what I was singing. And we were creating live. And by starting to do that, something happened. Like we were a full band. We were a full band. We were completely improvising, improvising techno music. but with a jazz feel and I was directing the whole thing. So I was still in control of it. And this is where everything changed completely. Can you, do you have a memory of that moment where it kind of just clicked? One of the, funnily enough, yes, because, and it's funny because you mentioned Montreux, one of the gigs we did at Montreux and we played with the boys and then we actually grabbed a French rapper. The guy is called Abdal Malik. And I said to Malik, we've got this track, we've never really done it before, but we've kind of rehearsed an instrumental we've never been able to play it. Would you like to come and perform with us? And, you know, slam, do your thing. Then a guy came, and then by bringing somebody fresh just for one track... I don't know, something happened on stage. And all the gigs after that became easier, much easier. And sometimes we were doing very small rooms, so we were going crazier because we knew we didn't have that much pressure. And all this, I think within two or three months around this gig in Montreux, so that's about five years ago, it became easier. And if I can pinpoint... One live show because I I think it's very important for you to know that Because you're talking about all my jazz influence you have to understand now I feel like I've turned the corner and I've gone somewhere else and this is very important I think I was searching for something. I didn't know why I didn't know what's what I was searching for something I felt very comfortable for the last three years on stage and I really, really thought we were doing something super creative. And I love that. And I absolutely had a great time doing this. And then we did this concert at the Salle Pleyel, which was a very hard concert to do because it was supposed to be the last one of a whole tour. And then when we decided to do it, because it's Sal Playel, you don't do Playel like you do another room. So I said to my agent, we need to have some projection. We need to have a structure. So we spent a lot of money just for one concert. And then I said to him, we need more musicians. So we asked the slammer, Anthony Joseph, to come with us. we are some different people we never work with. So we had one scratch, one guy did the scratch. One of the guys from the Crazy B is from, shit, what's his band? The Birdie Nam Nam. He's one of the four guys from Birdie Nam Nam. And then I had four horns, so I had two trumpets, saxophone and trombone. Then I had a percussionist. I had Ben. So it was like 10 of us. It was quite a lot of people. And we put a show just for one night. And we worked and worked and worked and rehearsed. And we did the best live show I've ever done in my whole career. I mean, so, so much better, so much stronger, so much. more professional and free than everything we've done before because we worked hard. The downfall after that was super, super tough because we really felt that we all worked for one thing. We absolutely had, you know, we... completely came on stage, like a sexual thing. We came on stage and when we left, it was very violent. And I think after I passed that, this is where I had to do something different and leave the jazz aside and go and explore different things. This is when I started LBS. I wanted to carry on, play live, carry on, be free with my music and carry on. experimenting but not in the same way as like a jazz live show so this is where we went back to clubs there was no saxophone there was no no microphone we were coming in plugging our stuff and playing five hours we were doing super long sets and and the idea behind it was to make people dance So the big difference between live show and DJ, when you DJ, you play other people's music and you make people dance and you can switch. If something doesn't work, you change the track and then you play another one. That's easy. When you're live, you have a track list. You can't play around with your music because it's too difficult. So especially if you're not a rock band, if you're incorporating machines. So if the live show doesn't work... You have to go on right till the end. So it's a very tricky thing to do the live show. And sometimes, you know, you're performing in the wrong place at the wrong time or you're not good on stage. you can't switch. You can't take another chance to try to rebuild it again, which you can as a DJ. So I thought, I want to have the best out of the live show with LBS, but then I want to be as free as I can when I'm DJing. If one track doesn't work, I'll stop you and then I put a track and then I'll just go somewhere else. It doesn't matter. If one night we're only going to perform 45 minutes live in a five-hour set, it doesn't matter. But maybe the day after we'll perform three and a half hours. And we usually ended up... performing three and a half hours live but you know within a four or five hour set but um i i switched to some you know i came back to something else and the funny thing is now i'm sorry i'm talking a lot but the funny thing is now i really feel with with the new projects with the music i'm making it's really weird because i'm i'm on the process of really listening to everything i've done music wise And I feel like I'm completely coming back to what I used to do 15 years ago. Simple, dense floor music. Not too complicated, not too much themes and stuff like this. I'm going back to my roots because I think I've done my jazz thing. Now I'm going somewhere else. Full circle. In a way, yes, definitely. But I needed to prove to myself that some way, somehow, I could become a musician. And now I don't have this frustration of saying, I'm not a musician. I don't consider myself... as a great musician. I can't, as I was saying to you, I can't play piano and make you cry, that's for sure. But I think with everything I've done in my career, somewhere, somehow... I must have a musical ear. So I feel a bit more comfortable. It's, I mean, to get a little bit more philosophical, I guess it is an issue of, I feel within electronic music, there is a almost, there's a credibility issue at stake when it comes to be seen as musical, you know, like, and it's good that you prove that to yourself in one sense, you know, like, yeah, it's one. I did it for me. Exactly. I did it for myself, not for people. Because if I would have listened to people, I would have had to stop from the first month I started playing live. And it's a big risk as well. I mean, when I started, having a violinist was crazy. Then the first drummer I had, he was a crazy motherfucker and he didn't help me at all. So I had to change him. And then the violinist left. I mean, my first years, my first two years of life was complete hell. I was dealing with crazy nutcase. It was hell. I was not in control of anything. Too young. Too young, too stupid. Then it took slowly, but I know very well that the saxophone is a really hard instrument. And I didn't want to travel around the world and paying one guy for just playing Man with a Red Face. So I said, if you're here, we're going to start writing themes. So we're going to try to incorporate you in your live show. And I know very well that saxophone can really piss people off. And I got a lot of really bad remarks of, you know, Garnier and his live show and his saxophonist. For fuck's sake, I wish he would stop. And I carried on. I carried on because I felt that I wanted to go somewhere. I wanted to do something. I didn't know exactly what, but I felt that I was going to get somewhere, you know, somehow. And I did when I did this live show in Playau. It was not that big. I mean, we had 3,000 people and... We did a DVD. We didn't sell any at all, but it doesn't matter. I did it for me. At the end of the day, it was for me. And now I know. I know I was right, which is good. Well, looking back again, just looking through the kind of chapters of your musical journey, you get the sense as well that you're not going to cut. anything out of the future so you don't know in five years where you'll be or what you'll be producing or with who you'll be working i know what i'd like to do um i'm going to be 50 in three years so you know i i wrote this book called electroshock which came out 10 years ago which we wrote a brand new chapter the book came out again two weeks ago with like 130 page extra talking about the last 10 years. Getting older in a business where we're catering for young people, for people which is half of my age now. They could be my kids. If you want to carry on in this, you need to ask yourself a lot of questions. I've been, for the last 10 years, asking myself and all the people I work with, Am I still coherent? Do I still mean something? Do I have to carry on? And if yes, what should we do to still be doing something good? I don't want to be an old artist playing my old tracks just to please the older crowd. Because I don't think that's healthy. I think when you start doing that, you can do it a couple of times, but I've never done it yet. But you can do it a couple of times, but I don't think it's healthy. Not looking at the future and only, you know, sitting down and say, I'm comfortable. I could very well carry on for the next 10 years, play Crispy Bacon, Man with a Red Face, do two-hour sets, and people will come and see me as As a dinosaur. He's a dinosaur of the techno story, but we respect him because he's been there since the beginning. I don't want that. So what I'd like to do, knowing that I'm going to be 50 quite soon, knowing that I have some really interesting projects coming. We've released a book, released a comic novel, a graphic novel this month. I've got, you know, from January onwards, I've got this four or five singles coming out, which are not all dance for Ollantayt, but at least three of them are. Then they will be at some form. Is it going to be a new album? I don't know, but at least there's a lot of music coming out. It's not a secret to anybody, but we've been working on the film of Electroshock for the last six or seven years. I'm writing the scenario. I was actually with the two girls I'm writing the scenario yesterday and we've got the story. The story, I'm 100% super happy now since yesterday with the story. That means now we can move on and going to get the money, talk to the actors. We're going to act two of the film thing. It took six years to write this bloody, bloody scenario. Now we've got it and we feel it's super strong. So I think we're going to shoot the movie in 2015. So saying that for nine months in 2015, I'm going to be working on a movie. I'm not going to be DJing. So after that, we're going to 2016, which I'm going to be 50. What would be nice is to do a nice new live tour. But maybe not with a lot of musicians. Because I think I would need to carry on do something quite fresh and exciting. So maybe me and ScanX or me and two guys with a lot of projections and do something really cool. And maybe after that, this is the... The stage side, okay? Maybe after that, do a more thought about jazz, big band thing like we did at Salpleil, maybe for different rooms. But that's, you know, 2017, so that's quite far away. I'd like to start working with musicians. And actually, I have a couple of people approach me and they ask me to produce their new album in a completely different field than techno music. And I like that. I've already done it with a contemporary choreographer and that worked really well. I've already made some music for some documentaries. I even made music for a documentary about sports. It was amazing. I mean, the documentary is amazing. It's really beautiful. What's the name of the documentary? Play. It's called Play. So it's just about sports. And you can actually find the DVD and it's quite crazy because there's one hour and 15 of music and the documentary is one hour and 20 minutes. So it's a lot of music. It was very tough to do but we did it and I think it's a very beautiful project. So I'd like to work more with different people and start to collaborate with a rapper, with maybe a rock band and bring some electronic to their music. I want to collaborate more, yes, for sure. I was kind of hoping for a follow-up to your album 30 for your 50th birthday. It's a good idea. It's a good idea. But it's not going to mean as much because what I liked about 30 was the size as well of the vinyl. It was 30 centimeter. Yeah, right. So this is why as well I call it 30. 50, we're going to have to do different sizes. And I don't think they exist. 50 megabytes, maybe. I think it would be quite sad to do an album called 50 because you're 50. It's really a proof that you've gone older in a scene which is still very young, still very fresh. I might do, I don't know, because I'm not scared of my age. It doesn't matter. And as long as you're still coherent, it's fine. But I don't really look at the past too much. So I don't think I'll do something like that. But maybe, maybe it's a good idea. Maybe you've put something in my head. The one thing that I'm also interested in is your new club as well. Well, we found this place, which is an amazing place. We got the opportunity to do something there. And I think we got to a point where we're all quite serious people. And we thought maybe we're going to do something in a way we'd love. to see it so you know put a really beautiful sound system in this place which is quite quite amazing because it's right on top of a building and then you can see the whole of the city of Lyon and we've got a huge terrace so in the summer you can listen to music and be outside in this in middle of a city and Lyon you know you got two massive big river crossing Lyon so We have the water around and we're not disturbing anybody. So it's quite nice. It's a nice place. And it's a young city as well, right? There's universities. It's a city that is changing a lot. And Lyon is changing in a really, really good way. And it's growing. Compared to Paris, Paris can't grow because Paris is closed by the periphery, by the doors of Paris that is keeping Paris the size the way it is. Lyon is a city that hasn't got a periphery and they don't have doors. So the place is growing up. And I think the mayor of Lyon is really good and is really changing his city very much. And you have a lot of exciting... people living in Lyon and it's the center of France you know it's in the middle so it's perfect place wise and yeah I think the you know we've done this club to be able to have a nice small live venue so we catch up like eight or nine hundred people have somewhere where we could go and brunch on Sunday afternoon and bring the kids and listen to music with the kids. So we do quite a lot of things in the afternoon on Sunday. You know, something nice. Like you have in Berlin. In Berlin, you have hundreds of places like this. In France, no, it's difficult. It's very difficult. I mean, and, you know, the sense that I also get having spoken to you for maybe the last 45 minutes is you're not cynical or jaded in the way that many older heads would be, you know? About what? About, I guess, like the state of affairs. Like there's very much a vision looking forward. As you said, like you don't look back, but there is, you know, there's this kind of... It's very easy to get eager. It's, but it's, you actually leave yourself going into that kind of state. You know, oh, it was better before. Oh, I know it all. And the new kids, they don't know fuck all, blah, blah, blah. I think it's a state of mind. I've always been excited about the music. Music is my complete drug. It's everything. I need it. And I think there's never been as much exciting music than what there is at the moment. And I see what's happening in France. It's super exciting. There's still a lot to do. Of course, if you only follow... the normal route and you go to Ibiza, which I do once in a while, but what I mean is if you follow your little route, you will get eager and you will get sour. I don't. I don't. So there's so much. There's so much to do. And I still love what I do. And I've always done it with my heart. This is why at one point I did less gigs. Because for me, I wanted to still be alive. So I did less gigs. But I still, you know, like tonight, I can't wait to go and play at Panorama Bar. because I love playing in that place and for me it's a privilege to go and play there. I take it as a privilege to be able to be part of that place which is world known and everybody wants to be at Panorama Bar. I'm so fucking lucky because I get to play there two or three times a year and they ask me to come back. They could very well say, he's old, he's passed, we want fresh blood and it would be so normal and they still call me and say, Laurent, we want you because we love you here and I feel alive, man. I feel super happy. It's great. It's brilliant Thank you.
