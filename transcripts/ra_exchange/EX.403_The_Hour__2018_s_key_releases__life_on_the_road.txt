You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour. This is RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. My name's Martha. I'm the producer of The Hour. Coming up on this month's show, Resident Advisors review editors Matt Unicombe and Ray Philp and RA contributor Emma Robertson will be discussing some of 2018's key records so far. But we begin this month's show by looking at the artist's life on the road, and more specifically, how they occupy themselves in the countless hours between shows. Angus Finlayson spoke with Caitlin Aurelius. Smith, Nabiha Iqbal, Martin, Zia, and Nathan McKay, the artist formerly known as Buana. Angus is now going to explain what got him thinking about the subject. When we think of our favorite musicians, we often imagine them doing what they do best: performing. We here at Resident Advisor expend countless words and hours of podcast time discussing what happens when an artist steps up on stage or into the booth. But for most musicians, these crucial moments are only part of the story. A set might last an hour or two, but it can bring with it days spent in airports, hotel rooms and unfamiliar cities. The busiest DJs might spend more time on the road than they do sleeping. So how do they fill all this time? Are there things they always read, watch or listen to on planes and trains? Or places they try to visit in every new city? With a helping hand from RA's producer, Martha Pacienti-Caden, I went on the hunt for tips and insights. Let's start with travel. My name's Nabiha Iqbal and I'm a DJ, producer and radio presenter from London. One thing that I always do when I'm on the plane, which might sound weird, is that I only watch the flight map. And yeah, like a lot of my friends are just like, what is wrong with you? But to be fair, I just, I just find it so interesting to know, like what the altitude is and if there's a headwind or a tailwind and the max speed and to know exactly where we are. And if there's no clouds, then you can look out of the window and kind of see what the terrain looks like and then match it up with where you are on the map. And I know it's like super geeky, but it really is my favourite thing to do. And it's like the year before last where I did a lot of travelling after my last record came out. And I remember in that year I went on 51 flights and on every flight I was just watching the flight map. and didn't really take advantage of any of the movies or anything. Maybe I should have. But no, I always go to the flight map, always. Martin, a Dutch producer and DJ living in the US, regularly crosses the Atlantic for gigs. I wondered if he listens to music whilst on the road. Sometimes, but nothing sort of, you know, remotely related to music I play or music that I make. And I also don't make any music on the road because I just can't, you know, do that. sort of laptop thing like that so so you're never tempted to use that time to go through promos organize your music for djing or anything like that no no no never i don't know i just um i think First of all, I think it's much better to do that sort of stuff at home before you actually start traveling. And second of all, I don't know, it just stresses me out when you're sort of always in work mode in a way. You know, it's much nicer to just sort of step away from it and just be in work mode when you need to be, which is during the gig. I asked Caitlin Aurelia Smith. If there's something in particular she likes to read or listen to whilst traveling. I read a lot and I like to write a lot. So I usually bring, right now I have four books with me. I like to like read a few sentences and then close it and think about it for a long time and then write about it. So I like to... bring a few different books that are, I don't know, I guess I'm like magnetized towards and then I'll open up a page and just read a sentence and then try and connect it to what I'm thinking about and build off of that. That's a really fun thing for me. Is it always things that relate to your music? No, it can be anything. And I like to try as much as I can to keep my mind very open to what kind of stands out and bold to me each day and then just follow those rabbit holes of whether it's like what actually happens to your body when you exhale. like what does the queen do in England or like what are the different currents in the ocean and like how do currents work or it's just kind of like anything someone says if there's like a moment where it feels like it's in bold then then I like to follow it and usually it will somehow end up connecting to what I'm learning about that day and what I'm gonna write about I've perfected the narrow space between the bed and desk hotel workout at this point. Here's the Toronto-born, Berlin-based Nathan McKay, formerly known as Buana. As well as being a producer and DJ, he also works as a personal trainer, and he told me about bringing his fitness regime on the road. I do what's called a high-intensity interval training workout, so it's spurts of high energy with short little rests in between that you can do in really tight spaces and I'm sure I annoy you know my neighbors or the people below me with a lot of jumping around but it definitely is a good way to kill time and also get you ready for the night ahead what about when you're not for whatever reason, doing something active. I gather that you're learning Japanese at the moment? Yeah, so I have my little book, Genki. I'm on Genki 1. I'm still kind of a beginner. Yeah, I bring that everywhere with me. If I have a few moments, even in the airport sitting down, I'll generally just take it out and try to practice writing kanji or something like that. I find the writing of Japanese characters to be unbelievably relaxing. I mean, I'm sure many people are the same with sketchbooks. They bring sketchbooks everywhere and just zone out and practice their craft. Not that I'm anywhere near proficient in kanji calligraphy. Does it make you feel good to feel like you're progressing in something or you're doing something kind of constructive with that time? Absolutely. I mean, travel, it's not a time waster because obviously it's... to an end to get somewhere, but I marvel at people who can just go in airports or planes and they don't look at anything, they don't do anything, but yeah, at least I'm doing something. I mean, sometimes if it's the second gig in a weekend or I'm on a long flight, I'll just zone out to the Netflix. I mean, it's good to at least feel like I did something in that two hours. when I get to an airport early. I should preface this by saying I never had a smartphone until about a year ago, just out of principle. And then I got one. And though I don't have many apps, I realized you could now download Netflix onto your phone. And so I'm watching tons of stuff. Are there particular kinds of program that work really well for the zone out that sort of help? to shut out that slightly alienating plane or airport environment. Yeah. I mean, a good example was I played in Italy last summer and it was a particularly late gig and a particularly early flight and I was just so dead and I started watching the O.J. Simpson murder crime drama and I knew nothing about the story since I'm Canadian. It totally just engrossed me and made that flight fly by. Things like that can help. Nathan mentioned that killer combination of the late set and early flight. I sat down with Berlin's Zio, who shared some techniques for keeping travel stress under control. What you were saying to me before was kind of about how when you travel for gigs, you're mostly thinking about keeping... of exhaustion and stress to a minimum. Would you say that's accurate? That is accurate for sure, yeah. So did you find that when you were traveling for performances these sorts of things were getting out of hand? No, not as much as I think it's like when you start traveling on a regular base like this. I mean I was before always on tours in vans like forever. So right now it changed to like me on an airplane. So I think technically it's like it starts with like leaving the house on time and like how to get to an airport. And sometimes I was just like sweating so crazy in the bus because I'm like, oh, my God, I'm going to miss my flight. And like this is really stressful. So right now I'm just like trying to, first of all, take a cab because I'm lazy, but also because it's so much more. relaxing and then like I know how much time it takes to get to certain airports yeah to just like be on time like first rule I think At the airport I try to sneak through security in an easy way. I wear clothes that don't beep, for example. I try to pack my suitcase so I have my computer and my liquids. It's really easy to take out and be really quick and my shit. Sorry, quick question. What kind of clothes beep and which ones don't? I think the metal. Okay, yeah, of course. So everything that doesn't have metal, plus like sneakers and stuff. I figured out once I'm just like sometimes flying to a place and then in the end of the night, maybe I have like a drink or two and I'm really just blurry in my mind and like in some sort of a haze. And I then try to research what flying does to a body and stuff like that. So I think one of the tricks they said was like be hydrated. So I try to really drink a lot. And it also said like if you're a little bit dehydrated or like even a little bit hydrated, it fucks you over being up in the air and like the pressure and stuff like that. Yeah, trying to be hydrated. That helps, definitely. And also, I mean, wear earplugs. The earplugs, are they for shutting out the noise? No, they're just like for, after 20 years, I was smart enough to finally make the decision to get proper earplugs. And now I'm a little bit like, oh, why didn't I do that earlier? But they do something on the plane. They filter it out altogether. It's not like noise-canceling headphones or something. which I haven't tried. You arrive in a place where you have a gig, you check into the hotel, and then you have a few hours before whatever, maybe the dinner or before you go to perform. What do you do in that time? I actually think a nap really helps. If I have the time to go to sleep again, I will do it. And also, I'm going to try to prevent to be at the venue too early before I play. I think altogether it's all like... circling around keeping up energy in general. I lose my energy if I'm at a venue too relaxed even. I think I play better if I'm really stressed. I think I need to have some sort of tension to being able to play well. Being at a venue five hours before you play is really deadly, I think. I wondered what our artists get up to if they have a chance to explore the cities they're passing through. Here's Caitlin. I usually walk around or do some research to find like a park or some sort of nice like outdoor area. Depends on how much time I have to research it, but definitely always walk around and like. get a feel for what the energy is like in that place. My mindset is like trying to bring awareness to what I can learn from it each day and especially watch like how my energy is reacting with the new place. I like to get kind of the four different perspectives from it. of like what's my individual reaction that's like internal and then what is like the interaction of me in this place what is this place like the community feeling and then like what is the community feeling in perspective of the last place I was in the place I'm gonna go to and like Kind of the overview. I like to observe what's going in and what I'm putting out and try and be mindful of it. The record shopping thing is big for me. Here's Martin. When I used to play out. a lot and would use Serato and I wasn't really sort of interested in buying a lot of vinyl. I never really went record shopping that much anymore and I really missed it and also I noticed that you know as soon as I would go record shopping I would always be able to sort of talk to owners or people that were selling records that could sort of give me a little bit of an insight of you know what people are interested in what people are buying um you know i just make more personal connections with people um also in regards to my label and you know to know where my music is going and who buys it or if people buy it at all you know and um i noticed that that was actually um something that um uh was really sort of gratifying and I started to spend more time in record stores and that sort of turned into full-on you know digger mode and especially the last couple years I you know I literally look up before I go to to a certain city especially if it's a newer city um you know where the record shops are what kind of stuff they have there and then just sort of pick one or two that i really like and just uh yeah and just spend the afternoon there you know and um it's actually um it's funny because sometimes i ask promoters as well you know, what are the good record shops and they usually give me, you know, a more like an answer about, I don't know, a record store that sells kind of current music or like techno store or whatever. But usually it's the secondhand ones that even they never really visit anymore that have all the, you know, the true gems in a way. So, yeah, so it's fun to even to go with locals that don't necessarily go digging all that much to see what their own record shop in their own city has to offer, you know. I think the only thing I might add is that I have a thing with churches. it's not really because I'm religious at all, but I've always been really interested in like different religions. And so if I go to major cities, especially, like I said, ones that I've never been before. You know, if I see like a cathedral or a big church or something like that, for some reason, I just gravitate towards it and always want to sort of take a look inside and see what's going on. And, you know, I also buy a lot of sort of religious souvenirs and things like that. It's funny because usually if I'm with promoters, they're kind of surprised by it because obviously not everyone asks. to go to the local cathedral. But like I said, you know, same thing as with the record store. If you just hang out with some people that are local, you know, I always find it kind of interesting to experience something with them that they themselves don't really experience on a daily basis either, you know, even though it is in their city. Maybe it's more about the spiritual places, you know, just... Places that are not all business, but, you know, have some sort of spiritual value in a way. Maybe it's because like a club is also kind of a spiritual place in a way. Even if you go to places like Japan where sort of a lot of religious sites are in, you know, parks and in forests and things like that, you know, you always have this sort of moment of peace. Although you're in like in the middle of Tokyo, you go into this park and you're in nature, you know. And so, yeah, maybe that has something to do with it, you know, just to sort of take a break from airport life and tax. Taxis and hotels and things like that, you know, that sort of hustle and bustle feeling. Yeah, maybe it has something to do with that. Here's Nabiya. One thing that I really enjoy doing if I've got a spare few hours in a certain place is to visit the botanical gardens. I just really love foliage and stuff. And like, I think that... Being in the botanical gardens can be a nice juxtaposition to the kind of like the hectic club environment and, you know, playing shows and things like that. So it's nice to have a few hours where you can just completely decompress. And I've seen some good... botanical gardens actually from traveling the latest one was in Moscow um it was so cool it was also the first time I've ever seen pumpkins growing which because I'm a city girl like I was really excited about that but the people I was with just were like just chill out it's just a pumpkin and um in Tasmania they're really nice Cape Town Sydney it's always interesting in different countries because obviously the flora and fauna vary quite a lot and it's nice to see how it's done across the world. Thanks to all the artists who spoke to me for this piece. Touring musicians might be some of the most experienced travellers out there and they all have plenty to say on the topic. I'll most likely be trying out a few of their techniques myself next time I'm twiddling my thumbs at the airport. thanks to all the artists who shared their stories. We're now nearing the end of April, and 2018 has already seen some fantastic music released. As we always tend to mention on this show, electronic music moves extremely fast, so we figured it would make sense to take stock of some of the key releases of the year so far. I'm Matt Unicum. I'm one of the reviews editors at RA. I work in the Berlin office and I look after the singles section. I'm Ray Philp. I'm another reviews editor at Resident Advisor. I work in the London office and I look after the albums. Hi, I'm Emma Robertson. I'm a Berlin-based music journalist and I contribute to RA occasionally. So we're here to talk about some of the big records of... the year so far we'll talk about some albums and we'll talk about some of the singles that we've liked so ray you reviewed the bruce yardy album pretty dark would you say Yes, in a sense. I really enjoyed it. I found the record really dense to get into, even though it's a sort of 40 minute record, because in each song there's like a very kind of heavy mood hanging over this album. And I think that is probably a reflection of the sort of both like the tastes of the artist. For example, she has a radio show called... The Dreamcatcher, which I really enjoyed digging into because there were lots of tracks from episode to episode that really gave you an insight into the sort of musical world she inhabits. And I think that those moods fed very much into the album. Like I mentioned... I reviewed the record in April and I sort of noted that some of the radio show had songs by Led Zeppelin and Nico Pulp. And, you know, that kind of like melancholic, slightly mournful tone kind of like pervaded the album. But I think... The other thing to note about this album was just the sort of musicality of it. Generally, a lot of people compare it to a lot of 80s sounding genres, like Cold Wave, EBM, in terms of the music that she did in the past for Komemi and Correspondent. But as Mark Smith, the tech editor, recently did a feature with Borussiade. where she explained that her influence came more from classical music and the Baroque period. And I felt that was interesting because it sort of showed to me that her music is less about emulating a style. For her, I sense it's more just about conveying a mood. And what I found really impressive about the album was that it was just... very musical, the sort of melodic and harmonic aspects of it were extremely considered. more so than in your sort of typical electronic music album. And I found just the way that she stitched all of that together extremely impressive. It was a pretty moody record for Kamehameha, I thought. Or are they releasing a lot of stuff like this now? Like when I think of Kamehameha, I think of like Matias Aguayo and like... goofy house slash disco tunes. Yeah, exactly. That's a really good point. This is certainly not like the sort of record I'd expect from that label. Yeah, it's an, like, I think there's always been like a sort of darkness in the undercurrent of a lot of these records. It's not like, I wouldn't necessarily say that Kamehameha records are happy, happy. There's definitely like a kind of, you know, some kind of like vibe underneath that. that speaks to something else. But yeah, certainly a bit of a left turn from them. Did you like it, Emma? Yeah, I mean, I liked that, as you said, that the melodic elements... of really stitched everything together. I felt like there was a lot of nice variety within this record in total, but everything sort of felt held together by this kind of like loopy sort of swirling sounds. And personally I really loved the vocals. On "Dormant" especially I thought it was really nice that the vocals were just kind of like words, like words just kind of coming out and there was a lot of weight to it. the meaning wasn't quite so like literal, like not really verses, you know, just words. There were words that were in English. Yes. Yeah, I think you make a really good point there. I liked the way that like... Her voice is this quite broad, sort of flat monotone a lot of the time, but she managed to kind of convey quite a lot of interesting moods and emotions through that. Actually, there's one track I want to talk about specifically called Breathe, which I thought was generally fantastic. You know, it's just got this like really dramatic kind of feel to it. There's lots of like... complex like textures and melodies going on but then like once she starts singing you know it's it really just kind of locks everything into place and uh felt like you know i was listening to like some incredible cold wave record that like i'd never come across before and It just had this mystery to it and this hard-to-define quality that also made it not really a Coldweave record once you actually listened to it. It didn't really fit that style. It was definitely my favourite song on the album and definitely one of the most memorable things I've heard in quite a while. I thought those two opening tracks really set the pace for the rest of the record. like the vocals were quite haunting and it was a bit sort of spooky in its vibe and I think that's like a nice sort of opening to the rest of the record. you You told me once you're haunted It haunted me since then Dreamed away your demons Was not enough for them I told you once you're learning You'd believe me hard since then I've bathed in all the To fill the flames with the light You said we're never lonely. Am I listening? So next we've got Daniel Avery's song for Alpha. ambient slash techno record from a pretty well regarded producer. For me the interesting thing it reminded me of the Steffi record from last year. Like a similar kind of mood like club producer, club DJ turns to like a slightly more intellectual kind of sound and I really liked it. Just these kind of records like especially compared to, I don't know, more clubby albums. It just makes the records more cohesive and like a nicer listen from start to finish. So yeah, I think it was a good move from him. What did you guys think? I mean, so I read the review that Angus did and I really agreed with his description of it as sort of bleary. For me, it's kind of like very morning vibes, a lot of these tracks, like after hours, morning vibes. Oh, not on the way to work But generally, I didn't really be honest. Like, I thought that it was quite familiar sounding in the sense that, like, I didn't really care to listen to it because I felt like I'd heard it before. Like, since... sensation especially I felt was like quite random and out of place which track was that that was the kind of faster more techno-y sound yeah in the middle yeah yeah exactly um so when I got to that I kind of was like how much is left of this record for me to listen to sort of thing um yeah I mean I thought it was good but it lacked a lot of interest for me. Did you like the, my favorite parts were like the acid-y kind of, there were a few like acid kind of tracks. The more psychedelic sort of sounding ones I liked. Yeah, me too. Generally, I thought that the ambient tunes were quite boring. Sorry. That's okay. What did you think, Ray? I think it's one of those records that isn't doing a lot of new things. I certainly think it leans on a lot of like classic sounding ideas. I think it's just executed really well. If you love a certain style of ambient and or techno, I mean, a couple of records reminded me of Plastic Man and Angus had noted that there was some William Baszynski sort of stuff going on. So I think, you know, if you love those sounds, you would definitely love this record. and I found a lot to like about it personally as well. I loved, again, the melodies I thought were really absorbing. I felt the flow of the album was also really interesting because it's kind of ebbing and flowing quite nicely from sort of a clubby style to an ambient record and all the things in between. And, you know, I think one of the things he noted was that this album was inspired by just, you know, this kind of transient life of going, of a DJ, of like going from like... gigs to airport car cars and hotels and all the rest of it that doesn't sound particularly inspiring for a record but actually I found you know this actually seemed to capture that quite well and it has produced some like really good music It's interesting, like, there aren't so many records in dance music where you can see, where there's, like, an arc that you can really, like, hear. You know, usually, like, it's just a few bangers. But this Avery one, yeah, it starts ambient. It's got the techno, like, the techno in the middle and then eases down. Yeah, exactly. I like as well that it's clearly a different record and character and tone from Drone Logic, his last album. And I think that he's really tried to go for a different approach is quite notable and admirable. Somebody commented... on the review that it sounds like music to sort of walk around the city to, like you said, this kind of transient sound, which I agree with, but personally I don't find that that interesting, you know, like I think that's totally apt, but I think it's just like I can think of a lot more interesting ways to describe music. ways that I would like to listen to music. Have you listened to much of his past stuff? No. His past stuff is way more energetic. I don't know. It's like techno, but it's got a pretty unique sound when he produces dance music. It's like, how would you even... describe it like it's like techno with like i don't know it's all these zapping synths and like yeah it's a very for me i find it like a pretty unique sound yeah i mean i guess for me um there's probably like some root in like um like you know synth pop records and and possibly even like sort of shades of the electro clash thing But it's definitely sort of far removed from both of those things. I wouldn't readily associate Daniel Avery's music with either of those genres. But yeah, that all gave his previous records a really interesting sound. But I think his... what he's done on this album kind of moves on from that quite a lot like it's it's all you know as you say it's a bit it's a bit um it's not quite as energetic and it's sort of flows much more smoothly i guess you All right. So we've got Alvin Oto and his latest, you know, I guess, how many albums has he made by now? It's got to be like... Far too many to count. Yeah. And it's called Unicave. I don't know. How do you pronounce this one? The requisite pronouncer of things. I tentatively bet Unicave, but we need to ask Kirsten Nicolai to confirm. And you really like this one, right? Yeah, I did. It's not often that a straight-up techno album gets me really excited, but I've found a lot to like about this. I'm a fan of Alvin Oto's music anyway, and I really liked this because it just combined his signature clicky... ultra-minimal sound design with, like, a really interesting array of, like, techno, like, beats. And I think, you know, another thing that impressed me about this record was... that I wouldn't necessarily, I don't necessarily think that a lot of people think of Alvin Oto and think banger, but there's a track on there called Uni Blue that I think fits that description quite well. really anthemic um really kind of um really interesting element it's got this electric guitar thing going on that is um like really cool and a bit like out of his usual realm um and i generally just found the album from start to finish an extremely enjoyable experience i thought so too i really liked it um but i thought it was like sort of easy to forget about the other two records in this series so I kind of went back and listened to them and I think that the kind of journey or connection between them is really nice really nicely done but for me I felt like the best tracks were the ones that sort of built into nothing like that didn't really do anything other than just kind of be a little bit ambient a little bit atmospheric with a little bit of kind of beats in the background like uni uni clip and uni normal I thought were both really well done. And like you said, Uni Blue I thought was also really great even though it was a bit more aggressive than I would normally like in a track. I think it was accomplished quite a bit with sort of very little. It was just kind of glitchy and weird but also really well done. But for me I thought the weakest track was DNA, Uni DNA. because I think it reminded me a bit too much of stuff that he's done in the past, like U7 from that 2008 record in the series. It reminds me of old Adam Thiem songs kind of thing, quite German sounding, with the vocals that I didn't really love, and it felt a little bit dated, but for the rest of the record I really liked it. What would you say was the difference between this album and the previous two that you did in the series? I think this just feels a bit more contemporary somehow, just in terms of production and in terms of how it actually sounds quality-wise. I think it's just a bit more today, I guess, if that answers your question. Probably not really. Yeah, I think it does. Another thing I noticed about this record was that, because I listened to the past two as well, and I don't know how you felt about it, but I thought this one was slightly more accessible. Like, there seemed to be, you know, some ambient tones that sort of softened the atmosphere of some of the tracks. I think the last song on the first album is just a lot of white noise sort of tones, which felt indicative of, I think, the direction in which he was going with it. It was clearly, to me, a more experimental... even though ostensibly the premise of the series was that it was more dance floor tuned. But like, yeah, I found like this latest one more like a techno album, you know, like more like a sort of really nice balance between an Alvin Oto sound and like a techno record. Yeah, for me, it felt more like music that you could actually play somewhere out versus music that you would just kind of listen to at home or something like that. Body music. Yeah, for me, when I think of like Alvin sonotan it's very precise there's not much melody of course there are some like exceptions but yeah this album i can really see how it's like one of his one of the more successful things from that like camp just like lots of like tones and i don't know like it's very like feeling heavy you know so yeah i also liked it What did you make of Donato Dotsie's Mindless Fullness? I liked it. Cleo's the hit for me. It's like 140-something BPM. Did you notice? Yeah, in like weird half-time. But I don't know. I'd love to be at a party where Marco Shuttle plays this because isn't that the story behind the track? Like, he's been playing it out for ages. He's the only one that's had it. I was going to say, so the story Donato and Marco often send each other tunes and Donato sent these two tracks to Marco and he's been playing them out and Donato hasn't even played them himself but apparently Marco is always sort of checking in with him like giving him a kind of report from the dance floor of how they're going and apparently Clio as you said is like the the hit for sure and for me that's the hit too I think it's just it's so hypnotic and weird and like kind of like it's quite fast but also it has this weird kind of like syrupy sort of atmosphere to it that is so trippy I think I also would really like to see him play this for me like it feels like a like it's almost like a clubby I get the same feeling uh from this as I get from like listening to Voices from the Lake like this like I don't know slightly melancholic trippy big bass line you know of course this is like way faster and way more intense But yeah, it's just very emotional techno. It's also very like psychedelic. And yeah, I don't know. I almost like I like everything Dozzy does, but this is especially good. And I guess for Marco Shuttle, like I haven't, yeah, I haven't seen him play it. But yeah, I can imagine like playing this at a party would produce like a pretty... big effect. Maybe tonight's going to be the night. Spazio night at Burkine. Oh, really? Could happen. I probably would. Yeah. I loved it too. I think I'd agree with both of you in saying that I really love Cleo. When I was listening to it, I thought two things. I thought I could listen to this for like half an hour and just not get sick of it. And I also thought like this would be like the perfect track to like sort of like close out some like really long eight hour session at a festival, you know, just like this really uplifting. um kind of sunrise sort of thing and um i thought it was really beautiful it's funny it's rare that you can you would think that about a track that's actually so fast and actually so energetic yeah exactly you know yeah i had closing track written down as well yeah underlined yeah it's hard for the next guy to mix And the other tune is also pretty trancy. It's got to be one of the most trancy, like, dozzy cuts. This, like, twinkling, you know, it's like twinkling. That one just has a straight beat. Yeah, I mean, nothing really happens in this track, but I really loved this one as well. Yeah. So what do you think about the name Mindless Fullness? Is that dozzy, like, commenting on, I don't know, our... society seems it seems like he's having a dig at the yogis out there yeah techno yogis yeah surgeon you know surgeons are yoga guy yeah that's right maybe they have some beef yeah maybe surgeon will send for him This has got to be the biggest, well, one of the biggest EPs of the year so far. Peggy Goo once, out on Ninja Tune. It's the first release on Ninja Tune for her, right? She did one already on Technicolor. This Goo tracks was on Technicolor, I think. Or Goo Talk. It's got to be the most varied Peggy Goo so far. All the rest have just been pretty tech house-y, atmospheric. rolling tunes but this one yeah three very different tracks yeah I've got to say of those three tracks like the hit which is called it makes you forget I have to say I like that one the least it feels very of the moment like this deck mental summer like a blend of like house with disco and then I don't know some obscure Korean disco tune. So yeah, I like it, but the other two were the hits for me. And most people in the office liked Han Yeon, the beat too. I liked that one as well. Yeah, with the fat bass lines. But for me, I thought in this first one in It Makes You Forget, I thought the vocals were by far the strongest element for me. I thought that was the most interesting. But in this Han Yeon track... thought it was like, I really love the vocals as well and it sort of felt like one of these tracks where you hear it in the club and then you're singing it in the cab on the way home, you know? Yeah, it's just a cool tune, like everything about that track. It's also pretty minimal. It's just the bass line, few like synth sounds, then her like rapping slash talking. What track did you like best? Or if any at all. That's pretty presumptuous of me. No, I really like this record. I'm actually a sucker for It Makes You Forget because I just, you know, I'm a sucker for great melody and vocal one especially. And, you know, it's just one of these tracks that makes you smile and it leaves you with a, like, you know, you sort of, you can whistle it sort of in your head. And I think that's always like a great sign of a track that has like an immediate emotional connection. And yeah, you know, I loved how, even though she's sort of trying out slightly different styles, there's definitely like a happy, uplifting emotion here. And it feels very much like, you know, like the sort of thing that she would play in her DJ sets. It's not like, it doesn't feel like sort of like way left, like out of her zone. I think that's... you know, obviously she's DJing a lot and that feels like a natural thing to observe. I mean, I haven't seen her DJ before. Have you guys? No. No, no. Yeah, I haven't. Yeah, I barely knew anything about her like before this EP. Like, other than that she was huge. Well, she'd been making some records from about 2016. And so I've listened to a fair few of her records. And I think what's impressive about this one is that she seems to have taken quite a lot of these classic sounds. There's electro in there, there's house, there's boogie. especially in that electro tune, funnily enough. And she's just kind of managed to make it her own in a way that I don't feel she really achieved on previous records. Like I actually thought like the Gutalk record was pretty decent and had been... like the best one that she'd done but she's really feel like this this felt musically more complete there was just like a few more details in there that really kind of gave it that little push from being a good record to like a really great one and I've generally been happy to see like an artist who is like as well as obviously playing more and more gigs each year is like really developing in a musical sense and I think that's been really like it's generally great to see artists who are really like pushing that side of things I've been thinking like I wonder if that's what happens when you link up when like a house producer links up with like a big label it's like all of a sudden just like functional house tracks it's not going to work for them they're not just appealing to DJs they want to make they want to put out songs in a way Because, like, this electro tune, you listen to it, man. Like, even though, like, it sounds, like, pretty laid back, that's a really complex track. Like, every few bars is, like, a little change. Like, it builds up and down. Like, yeah, it's a very complex track. And I wonder if that's just what happens when you work with, like... these high-end A&R is that they're saying like okay we need something like at this point this hi-hat needs to do this this bass line needs to go away and come back again you know because yeah it's such a step up from like the last records which are just like cool functional like house tunes like a step up in a good way you mean yeah yeah absolutely the other tunes are good but these are just like they're not just dj tracks or i think most of the records before have been yeah i'd go with that i mean i um i'd hesitate to to to say that um it's been a result of like a and r because it also could equally just naturally be a um you know a sort of eureka moment that artists seem to have at some point where they just like unlock this like secret compartment in their brain where all of a sudden things like just fall into place. And, you know, that, that was kind of what I was thinking with this record. It was more like, okay, like there's obviously some breakthrough happening here, which may or may not be pretty intangible, but like, it's definitely audible. And I think. I was generally just really happy to see it because I'd been listening to older, as I said, older records. I liked aspects of them and thought there was a great deal of promise there. And I'm just happy to see that she's heading in a direction where... that really seems to be being fulfilled. Definitely made me interested to see, like, what's next from her EP-wise or release-wise, for sure. She's got another one, but it's back to functional, like... She's got a new one on Phonica that's just, like, rolling atmospheric house. Two tracks. Oh no, one original, one remix. It's cool, but the Ninja Tune one is still by far the best. And there's, I think it's on Phonica White, which again suggests it's like, you know, kind of framed as like a straight up dance floor thing. Respect to the Pegatron. One shot, two shots, three shots, four shots, five shots, six shots, seven shots, eight shots, nine shots, ten shots, eleven shots, twelve shots, thirteen shots, fourteen shots, fifteen shots, sixteen shots, seventeen shots, eighteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots, nineteen shots Enjoy your night. The next one we have is Crystal Clear, The Division. So this seems to have been like a pretty divisive record in the office. I love it. Ray, what do you think? I was on the fence about some of this. I think I and a few other colleagues sort of dismissed Neutron Dance initially as this just sounds really like Inspector Norse. But actually, as I, you know, I could see that a lot of people loved it. You know, there are also a lot of people in the office that love it. And I think, you know, after having listened to it a few more times, you know, I recognize the differences between them. And it's ultimately unfair to compare them because I think the thing that they have in common more than anything else isn't about like composition or... or anything like that. It's more just about the mood that they evoke. And I think there are very few, there are so few records that are just purely elated sounding that like it's possible that like anything that sounds like that. happy and that like uplifting is you know inevitably going to be compared to like one of the most uplifting dance records ever made um so you know so that that's maybe ultimately where i'm sitting with it right now my favorite track is actually shockzoid um on the b1 i love that just because it's it's actually like a much simpler kind of sort of track it's it's just like kind of reminded me of like some synth pop tallow crossover you know it's just like uh i remember like hearing it on the on the speakers at work and it just feeling like you know just like instantly made me really happy uh i was like just pumping oh like cheer dancing away to it and um and i felt i i felt like a a much like stronger connection to that to that record and you know I would basically lose my shit if I had you know if I was listening to that on a dance floor I would be super happy to hear that what do you think Emma who's sorry on my note oh well it didn't do it for me Neutron Dance didn't do it for me sorry Matt It's just, listening to it, I was like, at first I was like, okay, I'm going to give this a chance. And then there's like 75 breakdowns, all this white noise. And it just didn't feel like, it felt like a lot was going on, but not a lot was happening. If that makes sense. Like, I just, it was so many things happening at once. And like every so often it'd be like a different track was playing, you know, I just was not up for but at the same time, I just, it's not for me. I'm happy. I've got to say I could also have done without the white noise. And I wonder if it's like the biggest tune that ever releases on Running Back. Like, is it the cheesiest ever? But the last Tiger in Woods also had like this white noisy kind of thing going on. And I wonder if it's just like because of Gerd's, he's like a pretty huge DJ now. These are the kind of tracks he needs Yeah, it's hard to gauge that. But I'd say, yeah, I mean, I don't think there have been many running back records that have been talked up in this way. Or that have... blown up so much but yeah I mean I think I'm kind of like with you on Neutron Dance in a way because you know thinking like I was listening to to it and was trying to figure out just yeah just trying to figure out basically and there's I think there's like, there are quite a lot of focal points. There's not one thing going on. There's like, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's one type of drum here and then there's like a drum roll here and then the melody comes in and then the bass line does this and then da da da da da. That's hard. It's hard and it's, it's impressive, but it doesn't necessarily make, you know, it felt like a lot of pyrotechn going on when I don't always feel like feel connected to that. You know, I felt this was a very impressive track, you know, from a like maybe like a technical standard or like and it was definitely like an ambitious sounding record. You know, I can I can I can feel the what he's trying to do here. But I just, you know, I kind of like, the reason I like shockzoid in contrast to neutron dance is just like, it feels more focused. There's like, you know, it's a bit simpler. And I just felt like it felt less forced ultimately. And I vibed with that a lot more. Yeah, for me, I agree totally with that sort of unfocused thing that you said. I just felt like with neutron dance, there's something in it for everyone and I can see why people really like it. But for me, that just comes off as like you trying to fit everything into one. But I remember that's what you said also. You said something similar, Ray, when we were first discussing it, saying it felt like too forced or, I don't know, maybe that's what you were hearing, like he's trying to do too much. And I guess that's why Inspector Norse is just a cut above. Inspector Norse didn't need all this, like, in a way it was like a lot simpler. Didn't need all the white noise. Didn't need the crazy breaks. Well, I still like it. I'm very happy that you do. Yeah, I don't know. I just like respect to Crystal Clear. But he was also working with Gerd Jensen a lot on this tune. I was surprised that you like... Like, yeah. This isn't like your typical minimal burner. I don't know. I just think it's so like... Yeah, I don't know. I just think it's so unashamedly, like, huge. And compare that, like, and somehow, like, to make a tune like that only with melody, okay, he's got some white noise. It's not like some big techno booming, really obvious, like, rhythm track. Like, he's done it all with, like, crafty melodies. And I think respect to him. It's hard to craft, like, to make a melody, like, make melodies like that. It's worth saying that I still found a lot to like about this record. You know, there's, it's, like, super well produced. I think, like, the, like, the tracks are generally pretty evocative and, like, you know, they're really dance floor friendly and I think... You know, it's certainly one of the most distinctive records I think he's done. And I think I would definitely be curious to hear where he goes from here, because these are basically good tracks. And, you know, especially Shockside for me is like excellent. It feels like a DJ could play that in all sorts of ways. which might make its arrival in a really unexpected moment even more special. The bass line is so huge. It's still like a rhythm track. Gotta say, it's pretty good for EPs so far this year. We've only discussed three. This Dozzy, Crystal Clear and Peggy Goo. There's three huge records in just a few months. It's only April. Yeah. I mean, it's interesting as well because the fact that we're talking about a 145 BPM record and we expect DJs to play it is a really good indication of where we are. We now expect these faster tempos and I think that's an extremely healthy development. ♪ Thanks to everyone who contributed to this month's edition of The Hour, and thank you for listening.
