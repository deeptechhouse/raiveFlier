Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Rolly Porter loves bass. It's the defining through-line of the music that he once made as part of Vexed with Cueto, and now under his own name. Otherwise, those tunes would be worlds apart. Porter has stepped away from the world of dubstep to create something altogether more curious, a mix of avant-classical noise and bass-heavy sonics that marks him out as a singular producer. As part of our live RA Exchange Series at this year's MUTEC Festival, we talked to Porter about his history in electronic music and his unique approach to production. you Thank you for coming to the second RA Live Exchange Tumitech Festival this year. I'm Todd Burns, Theater in Chief of Resident Advisor, and I'm joined by today, Roley Porter. Thank you for joining us. It's a pleasure. I guess I wanted to ask you first what you're doing. tonight at the festival. You recently put out an album last year called After Time. Is it going to be mostly work from that or is there new stuff involved? So it's going to be about 50% material based on material from After Time. It's very meta. So, and then 50% approximately like new material, but it'll all be kind of elements melded together. So, yeah, about that. Is there a lot of improvisation in what you do live and on stage or is it pretty planned out well in advance? This is kind of... an area where I've got a lot of mixed feelings like the kind of the whole discussion about you know live sets like DJ sets like how an artist is performing sort of thing. It's just different, you know, different ways of presenting music. I'm not really one of the kind of people who will stand up on stage and say like, oh, you know, this is amazing what he's doing. It's just like, you know, either I'm experiencing music that I enjoy or not. So what I kind of try and do is just find new ways of entertaining myself, like while I'm playing, like new ways of presenting. different ideas. There's... Yeah, there's two tunes that I literally just will play because I spent so long on them. You know, they're complete. I can't carry on editing them. And then everything else, this sort of remaining 45 minutes, is the kind of constantly evolving blend of multiple elements of different tunes put together, some processing during it. So there's enough... improvisation to sort of keep it like a flexible process for me and then where it isn't going to actually add something then it's like a stable thing. You recently came back after a long time making music. Has it been constant now? There's just a stream of stuff coming out that you're just like... - Totally. Yeah, I think, it's difficult to say, but I think it was like two years of not doing anything at all. And now that I've started again, yeah, it's great. I've just got totally re-energised. I've got so many ideas for projects that I want to do. Even if none of them come into fruition, I think it's just so important to have... If somebody says, so what could you do if I gave you this space and this amount of money or whatever, just to instantly go, I've got this crazy idea. I mean, that was what I kind of... ran out of before was just the desire to keep having new ideas, not necessarily musically. but about projects or compositions. You ran out of ideas for a bit. I didn't run out of ideas. I felt pressured to repeat the idea that I'd had. What was that idea that you had had that people were asking you to repeat in your mind? Actually, people were specifically just asking to repeat one tune. It was my least favourite tune that we ever produced. This is as a Vex project. Yeah, we kind of made the mistake of... well no, not a mistake it was a fun thing we wanted to do of making like a kind of reese sort of noise break thing that was really great when we were drunk and late at night and unfortunately that was kind of became like too closely associated with our name like kind of tagline for the kind of music that we were anticipated to like expected to produce and it just became further and further from what we had in mind. I remember you saying in an interview that your favourite bits of the Vex songs were before all of the beats came in, basically the ambient. sort of lead-ups and everything. Yeah, definitely. And that could be said about almost any genre of music that I've enjoyed in the past. Like when anything was broken down, like Jungle or whatever, into build, drop, build, drop, I quickly tired of it. I need a bit of, I don't know, space and tension. You mentioned Jungle. Was that the first... style of music that you really got into? Well, like blues when I was a kid. But like, yeah, yeah, jungle. How did you get into it? That was my dream to like run the jungle game. How did you get into it? That is a good question. I don't remember. I just do not remember. We were really young. You were in Bristol. No, we lived... Me and Jamie from Vext, Kudo, Jamie, grew up together in about 20 miles outside London. So we had lots of access to, you know, the jungle scene there when we were young. What were some of the nights that you were going to? I think that... The absolute highlight musically of my entire life would be the early Blue Note sessions, the metalhead sessions at the Blue Note. They were kind of, I think it was on a school night for us or whatever, but they didn't run that late. I think it was like 8 till 12, and it just absolutely condensed that idea of, like the introduction thing we were talking about, it had like... Elements of jazz, like ambient, you know, this amazing space in the music. And also it was a really bizarre collective group of people who would go and we'd... just yeah that was that that's the highlight that's the sort of level that i won't that i haven't seen like attained achieved by anyone else was it immediate after you know going to these nights that you were like i want to do music i want to make these tunes or i want to be a dj yeah was it both of those things um I never particularly wanted to be a DJ. The production thing, yeah, straight away I was like, this is what I want to do, especially as it began to change, especially as it began to decline. That was the kind of fire that really drove the Vex project. Everything had gone pretty downhill in my scathing opinion. We were like, we've got to make music for her that we want to hear. We've got to make the music that we want to hear because it isn't happening. If you were going to these Blue Notes sessions, it must have been a long time before Vex started. Oh yeah, many, many years. I guess at least five or six years, I guess at least. So what was happening during that period? Were you and Jamie starting to make music together? We were starting to make music individually, but we lived together. Well, actually not at that time because we were like 15 or whatever, but then we began living together after we left school and making music individually. What kind of music were you making starting out? What did it sound like? Mine sounded very, very bad. Very bad indeed. I don't think it's really got a genre name. Jamie's was really good. He was always quite intricate. He would spend weeks over a single tune or a single snare, you know, a single tune. He was doing... He did some good jungle tunes, never released. Yeah. I think... I think prior to actually getting our ideas properly together, we both had a kind of, I suppose somewhere between DJ crust, bomb the bass, I don't know, just, it was bad. It seems like though you were thinking about things and what you wanted to hear, and I wonder what was going on in the scene, drum and bass at that time, that you were like, we want to do this. or I want to do this, I want my music to sound... Oh yeah, the set target was this kind of Soul in Motion-esque DJ Crusts full cycle, that exact sound. So following on from the Blue Note sessions, I suppose the next big stage, exciting stage musically was the... full cycle nights some of the early ones at the end were amazing DJ Sub, DJ Cross that kind of really spaced out you know no I don't think no Amons really That was the problem, the kind of energy. The problem was the energy. As soon as it became energy music just to get pumped, I was like, hmm, this isn't really working out now. But yeah, that kind of really obscure, one beep sort of every 20 bars, and you'd just be like, whoa! So when it... got a little bit more commercial, a little bit more crass, that's when you start to lose interest. Yeah, but that's a good thing because from there I stopped listening to just one type of music and began to understand a much wider range of music and that's a much better place to be. I remember in that same interview that I read, I think you said that you were only listening to John. for a while. That was pretty much it. For a long time. Why were you so militantly only listening to that stuff? I think... Obviously at the time, house music and techno music were my mortal enemies, but I think the same... When you listen to so much of something, it became the case later with Dubb, I kind of sympathize with people who listen to that religiously to house or whatever. When a tempo, and I suppose kids now with 140 music or whatever, when a tempo gets set in your head... and it just feels natural. You can actually, it seems alien thought to me now, but I would have jungle playing for the entire waking hours of the day. I mean, you can have something, I can't do it anymore. But yeah, just once it's set in your head, that tempo just feels completely natural. And there were so many ideas around it as well. It wasn't just, you know, there were so many types of music being released. at that tempo. The same as dubstep eight years ago or whatever. There was such a wide range of music, you know, you could say, I listen to dubstep, but it could have meant, not so much now, but eight years ago, it could have meant so many different things. It seemed like the drummer bass scene seemed to... solidify at a certain point. Was there a moment in which you kind of lost interest or thought that it went the wrong way or something like that? You talked about the energy. Yeah, I can't remember exactly when that was, but I watched the exact same thing happen from a personal point of view with Dubstep, but obviously it happened a million times faster. Yeah, I can't... It is difficult to put into words, but that kind of... When something... Obviously words are difficult, descriptive words, but if I say, oh, you know, that tune is dark or something, it can... Listening back, they don't actually have... A lot of the tunes that I love don't actually have amazing production values. They don't have this kind of overwhelming bass... They've got a lot of bass weight, but they don't have this kind of super high produced weight that... you know, people anticipate or expect from like big drop tunes in drum bass or dubstep now. But they've just got this like brutal coldness that is just overwhelming. Like that, that's what I think is heavy. The brutal coldness is what you're looking for. The coldness is what I'm looking for. When you started exploring other genres of music, you... What was, was it everything, basically? Or were there certain things that really caught your ear? The first and kind of main point of transition was the dub sound system thing, because that had gone kind of unnoticed to me. And I thought, you know, these jungle raves or drum bass raves were the sort of peak of dancing, the peak of bass, the peak of like... how to experience sound system music. And then we were actually at some festival, a bizarre, I think it was called a sensual festival, so it was one of those weird festivals in the day in London in a park for one day sort of thing. And we walked out of a jungle tent and there was... I think Manasa sound system thing. And it was just like seeing a professional, you know what I mean? It was like, it made Jungle just seem like not sound system music. This was, the bass was so overwhelmingly loud. And then, you know, to go on from that to sound systems like Abishanti, which is my personal favourite, and just... like bass as it should be done by a professional who's been doing it for 40 years, like, so powerful. For those who don't know, tell us a little bit about sound systems, those types of sound systems in that culture in London. Yeah, I probably can't. It's a difficult one because I probably can't speak that knowledgeably about it. And culturally, there is a strange thing because I was coming from like rave music and often there is that kind of religious element like, you know, a rastafari. of music or whatever, but... if you see like abishanti notting hill carnival in a kind of carnival situation just watching i mean one dj he's got one turntable like three foot above his head i don't know why he puts it so high and he puts on like one seven inch and he'll play it like basically straight then he'll play it like with the vocal or whatever and then just then with the bass and it's just so brutal i mean it's just the level I don't quite understand why other genres can't achieve this level of like bass. It's just unbelievable. But something about that religious element, I'm personally not religious and I'm sure there's many aspects of like the Rastafarian faith that I'd have issue with or whatever, but something about like taking that level of bass weight. and calling it like a religious experience and using it, and calls of Jara and stuff like it does. you're joining in with that element of it. That is how I felt about bass music always. It is a kind of totally insular religious experience where I'm just in a world of my own thoughts. So they just take it to the next level. One of the most compelling things about your album, I thought, was that But when I heard it on a proper sound system, I was like, there's an enormous amount of bass in this modern classical music. It was really interesting to listen to it on headphones or something like that and kind of enjoy the... the melodics of it and then to get this physical reaction in another way. That was obviously a name when you were trying to write after time. Yeah, definitely that was a clear aim. I think from a technical point of view, one of the... advantages of that are if you kind of put the off time into genres of sort of noise or industrial music one of my personal difficulties with like engaging with a lot of those genres is that it's quite harsh you know it's quite difficult to listen to and there's something I've never been in a situation where there's been a sound system that's producing too much bass for it to be personally uncomfortable, like physically uncomfortable. And it evens out those other frequencies. I mean, you can pile so much more sort of amp guitar distortion, like mid-range distortion, into something if you've just got sub rumbling away underneath. So a lot of bass gives you more freedom in the frequency spectrum. It gives you more freedom. It gives you something to engage with. It gives you a kind of, you know. overwhelming kind of feeling but if you just got those mid-range frequencies or if I just did the kind of classical thing then yeah you've got the problem of like it being physically uncomfortable to listen to and also then it being set much more clearly in an ambient kind of genre where I'd have to compete with people composing you know other composers. I don't want to compete with them. I just want to compete on a sort of base level. Who are you competing with? Well, fortunately, no one. Otherwise, I'd be more stressed out. Yeah, no one at all. As I said, I didn't listen to any relevant music when I was making it. To go back a little bit, when did Vexed start as a concern, like a serious thing? When did you, Jamie, decide, let's team up? I'm not very good with dates. He came up with a name. But it was clearly after the sound. system breakthrough. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It wasn't actually, from him coming up with the name and us making a proper effort to get it together, there really wasn't actually much time gap between that and getting signed to Planet Mu, it was quite... We were surprisingly lucky and the whole process happened really quickly. You said he's really a perfectionist, working quite a bit on tunes. What is that working relationship looking like? You're bringing the badness to the table? That would be unfair to say that. He's certainly got his fair share of badness. I would have a sort of drunk fit of... energy, which he would then spend weeks cleaning up, would be a fair way to describe it. So you were bringing ideas and he was refining them? Yeah. We kind of, we didn't argue about this, but it's a kind of point of difference. We once heard that that Dillinger never spent more than eight hours working on tune. I was like, that is the, you know, that's the way to do it. I don't think we ever spent less than eight months working on a tune, so I don't know if that is the way to do it. But then, you know, listening back, I'm still as proud of, like, well, I mean, I'm really proud of those early records. I think they still sound good, and that's mainly because of his diligence and hard work. It seems like, especially when they re-released the record a couple years ago, I guess. or there was something in a plant you did a lot of people were saying this is dubstep before people had a word for it or something like that would you agree with that? It's really difficult to use that term and kind of I saw the strangest thing I've ever seen recently, which was, I think it was a car advert for... Euro 2012 football featuring some kind of dubstep. So it basically combined everything that I don't understand in the world. And that, I think, is why maybe it was a precursor for some people or whatever, but you could say that about anything. You could say that... I don't know, music that came 15 years ago. It just happened that several artists who we were kind of grouped with at the time then went on. I mean, Digital Mystics and Scream. Were you hooked up with them? I mean, did you go to the same parties and stuff? Was it a creative scene? And were you part of that? We were. Certainly, it was a really small... small group of people. We were most definitely the outsiders. We were at the same parties. We didn't play events like nights like Plastic People, the Forward Night. I can't remember. We did maybe do one DMZ, but we certainly were not pushing that sound. And I think those artists had a much clearer idea of where to move in that scene early on. But yeah, at the beginning, it was a very small group of people. Did you know where you wanted to move with things? We were pretty happy where we were. I don't think we... We had ideas that just didn't become... like viable. When we originally set up, I really wanted to release, and Jamie really wanted to release, each 12-inch would be like the tune on one side and then the ambient version of it on the flip sort of thing. So kind of like the after time. It's quite possible to imagine certain tunes on after time with beats. So there would be that. That's why I'm glad to have done this now. because that was but you know those kind of things and those kind of ideas just the if you want to call it the burgeoning dubstep scene that just ran out of that kind of room you know when things started having that kind of wobble and that kind of production weight like there was less room for those ideas Yeah, I mean obviously any scene, once you kind of have things that work really well in certain ways, that becomes the aim. You mean like two elements? Tell me about the after time recording process. I mean you... it seems like you had a very strong idea of what you wanted to combine, what things you were bringing together. Did it take a long time to figure out how to make those things work? No, I was lucky. It was really easy and it happened really quickly. I guess the thinking about it took a while. Realising it was a million times easier than I anticipated. I spent a couple of weeks recording this instrument that features heavily on it, the On Martino. My answer player of that, Cynthia Miller, and so I went to London and spent a week or ten days just making multiple recordings of that. Tell us about that instrument. because it's quite unique. Yes, it's an unusual one. But again, I'm not going to speak very knowledgeably on it, but I'll give you a rough idea. So it's a monophonic keyboard. It's very beautiful. It's made of wood. Good. The keyboard itself is kind of floating, so it's quite difficult to imagine, but if you imagine, you can actually, if you hold down a key, you can actually wobble the whole, you can tremolo. the whole keyboard. Then in front of the keyboard is a ring kind of attached to a wire called the ribbon. So you've got your finger through this ring. It's monophonic, so you play a single note, but then you can play the entire length of the keyboard by kind of sliding your hand up and down on this ring. Strangely, you don't actually trigger the sound by pressing a key. In your left hand... and there's a kind of box which has a like a velocity on/off switch thing, so it's kind of unintuitive to play, I imagine. The most sort of exciting thing from my point of view are the speakers. It's got three primary speakers, I think, traditionally. One of them's a gong with a speaker driver kind of mounted in it. One of them's like a spring reverb, and one of them's... called a palm and it's, if you imagine like a palm leaf shaped kind of dulcimer strung instrument sort of thing, each of the strings, I don't know how many it's got other strings, side, maybe 12 or 14, each of them tuned to a specific tuning. And the speaker is supposed to resonate them in some way and produce some... I don't know how well it works, but it's very, very beautiful. And your aunt is doing a lot of performances with it? Yeah, she's been playing it for many, many years, doing performances and kind of... composition. She used it in lots of film music recordings and things like that. A composer, Messiaen, wrote a couple of pieces for it. I think "Tirangleela" is the main orchestral piece where it's actually integrated into a full-scale orchestra. And you just spent ten days sort of every which way trying to... to get as many different sounds out of as you could. Yeah, there are a surprising number of sounds you can get from it. But it's more about the... It's more about kind of, you could quite easily, you know, map the sound, you could quite easily create like a similar sound, but because of the various unusual ways that it's played, it would be quite difficult to replicate like as a sampler instrument and actually play it in what sounded like an authentic way. So it's kind of more the intonation and the stuff in the way it's played that makes it particularly interesting. interesting. And you've played with her live as well, right? Yeah, we did the whole album. We were commissioned by Auburn Music, which is really great, who run a thing called Fast and Sound, where they get collaborations between electronic and classical artists. So we were commissioned to write a new piece for them and perform after time, live. What's it like? playing live with your aunt? It required a bit of balance because obviously I wanted to just drown everybody out. and they equipped me with quite a decent sound system so we had everybody there obviously everyone involved in that is mostly sort of in the classical world it's big classical kind of don't quite know how to describe it but it's like a kind of classical organisation on the day before the concert we got a few people in from their organisation and said this is kind of how I'd like to, volume-wise, because everyone was a bit concerned. And they said, is it going to be loud? I was like, yeah, it'll definitely be loud. So they said, oh, we'll do a test. Got everyone in, turned all the lights off, and I said, this is how I intend to present it. And after a few minutes, they made me turn it off, and the main guy said that he'd come and talk to me about it in a few minutes, but he But actually as it happened, the hall was so beautifully designed acoustically and it was quite interesting playing at a slightly lower level. it gave the ond a chance to shine in certain quieter moments. I guess I was going to ask what the classical community's response to your work is, but I guess I got the answer. It made me quite sick. It made them a little bit sick. But yeah, quite good. I mean, there was a 90-year-old woman at that event, and she was very... She spoke kindly of it. It's interesting music because it obviously has elements of that but clearly because of certain other elements you're not really hitting the pleasure spots of any audience in a way dubstep people will be like it's a little bit I don't know what they'd be like I don't want to speak for the dubstep But this is the kind of thing, I mean, if you take, for example, the piece I mentioned, Tarangalila, the on piece, I went to see that, her performance in Bath a few years ago. I could remember the name of the piece that they played first. But I was sitting in a cathedral surrounded by middle-aged, old classical fans in suits or whatever. I always kind of thought the music I listened to was difficult to listen to, like a lot of weird electronic music and kind of strange, what I considered to be avant-garde ideas. This classical music these people listened to was mental. I couldn't understand a single part of it. There was nothing. to get hold of. It was just the most mental 40 minutes. I was like, this is unlistenable music. If Aphex Twin or someone put this out, people would go like, this is too mental. But they were just normal people loving it. It's a mystery to me. So I think the only stumbling block you have with an audience like that is the physical discomfort of the... sound and it was a bit absurd they were handing out like full not just earplugs in your ear like you know full like ear defenders from a building site and I was like I don't think you can actually hear anything But anyway, whatever. What is your ideal space to do what you're doing? This sort of thing. I really like the look of... What's it called? Downstairs. Monument National. That looks great. My only kind of fear of that would be... I'm still getting... Coming to terms with the sitting down thing. And I tend to like lower-ceilinged, totally pitch-black rooms. So you went somewhere between a rave and a church. Yeah, yeah. We did a launch party for the empty set album, Demiurge, and a kind of subtext recording party thing in a church in Bristol. And that was a really good event. We were a little bit worried about the sound. We were told it would be okay as long as there weren't any lead windows. It was like a 15th century church. All the windows were made of lead. But it survived. That was a good event. Yeah, it's difficult. To know how to present this is kind of new ideas and we're still trying to find the perfect forum. I think it's a place it seems like you want to be though in a way because you know when things as we were talking about earlier with genres, drum and bass dubstep it's like when it becomes something that's easily sellable that's when you kind of not interested anymore Yeah, I can't, although it's difficult to imagine the future, no one can guess what kind of next music will sound like. I can't see a way that they can make that happen with this current music that I'm producing. I'd be pretty surprised if it becomes any more popular. Are you working on more stuff like this? Obviously you made this stuff for tonight. Yeah. The album After Time was kind of a coherent thing. There's not really a follow-on to that because it's got a start and an end for me, personally. So the next project is similarly unusual or out of genre or whatever. But it does have... I've not been so strict. This has got kind of rhythm. There is some... elements of rhythm come back in. There's some beats. Well, you're here. Hopefully you're here tonight. Yeah, you're here tonight. Yeah, you're not going to dance. But there's some beats. One of the things that you've said in the past I found really interesting was that what you were looking for with the last album at least was... figuring out how to get momentum, I guess, without, you know, without not being techno and not being, forget what the other one was, but it was just figuring out a way to get a rhythm without these normal things that denote that. Is that sort of also the aim with this new one as well? No, bizarrely by introducing, trying to introduce rhythms again, I've actually kind of gone the other way. I think Aftertime kind of moves more naturally and has a kind of more forward, more natural rhythm than what I've recently produced without any beats. I don't know. I was listening to a Rameset recently. which I really enjoyed. - This is the group of Blackest Ever Black. - Yeah, two guys from Blackest Ever Black. Their whole set was so tightly sticking to this. They got quite a minimal attitude to rhythm, but it was like, and I found it really hypnotic, and it was kind of the first thing I'd enjoyed that did have beats like that, in a kind of techno, it's not techno, but you know. that kind of sense of being hypnotised I kind of really enjoyed and I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed beats and then I went back to the studio and listened to this kind of brutal, chaotic onslaught of beats that aren't in any rhythm or time and I thought this is even harder to listen to than the last one but we'll see. I find them really interesting and similar in a way to your own music in that you both sort of come from this junglist background and it seems like, at least from an outsider's perspective, that you found a way to capture that idea or that spirit, but it doesn't really, unless you told me that, oh, I was really into jungle listening. your music, I'd be like, I never would immediately hear that. I wonder if that's something that you think about at all, that spirit of exploration, I guess, that a lot of this UK music seems to have. It's strange to feel... strange to feel a kind of connection with artists who are writing completely different music and it kind of does hark back to that era I was talking about you know with those so called dubstep artists I feel yeah I felt a real connection with what Rain were doing we were building on the same night and it flowed completely it felt completely natural it felt like a really interesting like diverse kind of event Like the Subtext label, like Empty Set, I don't know how to describe their music or whatever and it's pretty different to mine, it's kind of inhuman I suppose. But it just feels, you know, when I play and then they follow it just feels really coherent. That's completely different, you know, it's a completely different thing. So, yeah, really difficult to put into words, but there is definitely a kind of, there is definitely a large amount of undescribable, but similarly realised ideas. You're living in Bristol now. Yeah. How did you end up in Bristol? You were in London for a long time, right? Poverty? No. Actually, it just is genuinely a nicer place to be. But I think the London... I love London. It's one of my favourite cities in the world. And I think writing certain types of music, like... I think if you take Jamie's album, Kudo, the Severance album, that kind of music couldn't really be realised without having lived in cities like London or something, big cities, and having that kind of futurist, dystopian... kind of idea. Bristol, yeah, lots of drinking. There's not really, there's not an amazing kind of futuristic cityscape to look at. It doesn't have that futuristic vibe. But there is an enormous amount of creativity there. It's kind of a mystery why they have a kind of dub roots thing which kind of drives it. Coming from London, it's just kind of like the countryside. Do you think your own music is informed by being in London or being in Bristol or both or neither? Yeah, both definitely. But yeah, I mean, I did, you know, obviously I don't want to, it did have like a sci-fi vibe, you know, I was thinking about like the future after the humans have all gone. Yeah, it's supposed to be about the future. Do people need to know that to enjoy it? Because I feel like I never got necessarily a narrative out of listening to it or anything like that. No, I don't think you have to know that to enjoy it. It's a difficult thing. It was kind of, you know, some of my favourite pieces of music I could read and... they would have maybe a different idea to what I'd had about it. I don't think that matters. It's music with no lyrics. There's no vocal content. People can talk endlessly about what their electronic music is saying. So where do the titles come from? They are Planets in June. There is a specific sci-fi connection. there. I love June. But it was more... That wasn't intended really. It was more about they just... There was like 11 words there. How many tunes are there? 11 or 12. I should know. There's 11 or 12 words there which are all from one universe. They're all not real things. And that's kind of more the point. It doesn't necessarily matter that... It's set in Dune world or whatever. It's just 11 non-real things from the same world. from the same universe. It's quite difficult to track names is a weird thing. You can call it the bassy one or the stringy one or whatever. But to actually find 11 words that are completely from one universe is actually a surprise. I struggled with it a bit. So it was a relief to think of the June thing. I wanted to open up to questions. if anyone had anything that they wanted to know. - What was the point at which you knew that Vexxed was over? Was that something between the dynamic between the two of you or was that the state of the kind of music that you were making? Those two things are actually kind of interlinked in that unless you're both kind of moving forward with an absolutely coherent idea I think as is quite clear from our two recent albums like it would be a long time before I kind of stop the pure noise you know wanting to have you know wanting to resort to noise at some point Jamie's found a way to kind of express like the same kind of ideas but with I don't think there's a single distortion plugging in this whole album. It's like a really cleanly produced thing. And I think that kind of perfectly illustrates the differences that we're having. Also... He moved to Berlin, I moved to Bristol. We thought romantically about going over once a month, but I think it's been once in five years or something. I think that some of the parts, like the Qudo album, and the After Time album together are better than the third Vexed album would have been. Doing the Cloud Seed album was a kind of... strange thing in that it was lots of music that we wanted to release but we knew we were releasing it not necessarily too late but into a kind of into an irrelevant it was kind of an if you're looking at like genres and you know progressing forward in scenes it was kind of irrelevant to what was happening around it whereas Degenerate had some kind of basis in an evolving scene so Cloud Seed kind of felt like a retrospective, even though we hadn't really stopped then. But that made it quite clear that it was time to move forward. Was there a different time then when you started to... You talk a little bit like you definitely got alienated from where that scene went. Was there a different point at which you started to feel like you no longer associated... with that kind of early post-Garage dubstep and crossover thing? I can't really clearly remember. I wish I could think of some sort of artist examples, but I think it was more... I wouldn't say it was more about finding that I wasn't really part of it. It was more realising that, as an artist, the early tunes that I really liked... that I couldn't actually like emulate it if I'm being honest. Like there was this kind of, if you take some of the really, like really minimal, just, yeah, when it still sounded kind of like Garage, but just with totally sort of amazing, completely minimal bass lines. And that was the type of music that I really respected and really wanted to kind of be part of, but just found in studio experimenting that I couldn't, there wasn't an actual form of that music that I was comfortable producing. So yeah, it was more a failure to join in, I suppose. you
