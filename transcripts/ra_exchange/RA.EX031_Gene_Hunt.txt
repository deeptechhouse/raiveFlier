♪ you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief at Resident Advisor. Gene Hunt isn't one of the first names that comes to mind when you think of Chicago House. He may not even be the 30th. But early next month, his contribution to the genre will become apparent when Rush Hour... collects some of his tapes that he's stored away in his archives for years. In a scene that seemed to elude proper documentation, he's one of the few that tuck things away just in case they might be of interest to future generations. R.A.'s Aaron Friedman recently talked with Hunt in Amsterdam about the early days in Chicago, as well as what else he has lying around that record collectors should be getting excited about. you Can you still remember this moment when you first thought that you wanted to be a musician or you wanted to be in music? I mean, my grandfather used to be a DJ, so I guess when I was younger, he used to always be on his turntables. you know i'm not really noticing that you know that was gonna be my passion of any sort but you know just just start taking her and touring around with something and you know i always had a fascination about about music i mean like even when i was a kid um you know my mom would say i was always walking around the house with 45s and you know it's like a little small lps and you know i would always like to have records and mess around with records so that was my thing as a kid you know so uh i guess as time persisted um some friends of mine like we're you know dj on some turntables and they was like we're about to go over friend of mine's house and i'm about to mix and i'm like mix what's the records i said man can i go well he took me with him So I'm sitting up there and they got these turntables and they're blending records in and scratching and doing all this amazing stuff with these two turntables and these records. So something just triggered me right then. I was just like, this is what I want to do. You know what I mean? I was about maybe 12, 13 years old. I started off young, so by the time I was about 15. I mean, 15, 15, 16 years old, you know, I'm starting to actually like do parties with guys who I've always admired. Like, you know, there were a lot of radio personalities, guys that made tracks. I mean, Ron Hardy, you know, Frankie Knuckles, Farley, Steve Hurley, Larry Hurd, Robert Owens. I mean, I can just name a gazillion people that. played a big magical piece of the puzzle. You know, Lil Lewis, I can name, Chicago really had a definition of music was very strong in its content. You know, we had Marshall Jefferson, Adonis, and, you know, making No Way Back, and, you know, Marshall making Move Your Body and all that stuff. So when we started doing stuff like that. It kind of gave everybody an opportunity to say, well, hey, I can go in the studio, get me a drum machine and make me a record. So all that inspiration was great. I mean, we had WBMX, so it was a radio station where they would play all the music and you can go to the shops the next day and go get all the stuff that you heard on the radio. We had house music from 8 o'clock to 2 o'clock in the morning every Friday night. So all the DJs back then, the CD wasn't made. I mean, the CD wasn't even invented. We had like a casino cassette tapes. We would record the mixes from eight to two o'clock and we would go through all the tapes to see all the stuff that we liked. And the next day, you take the tape down to the shop and buy everything off the wall. When vinyl was at its purest form, when it was at its purest content before the technology changed. So, I mean, I would have to say, you know, that, you know, Chicago was at a real nice peak. Everybody was putting music out. Armando, I mean, so many different people were, you know, Future 303 came out with our different sound in reference to that. I mean, there were so many different things that were coming out at that time period. I mean, so inspiration anywhere from, you know, from like... 83 on to like 86 or 88 it's like you saw that transitional period of the music you know started to increase from all the you know the jesse sanders you know with the on and on tracks and fantasy and You know, I mean, the list goes on and on. We just really had a good, persistent lineup of artists that gave Chicago the scope that it needed. You know, at that moment, I just really caught a good break. And it just gave me a good opportunity to be able to expand what I was doing. Then once I started getting the DJ part down with the blending and learning the records and so forth, and kind of stopped doing it. Then I ventured off and started making my own tracks. Playing around with a 909 and a Juno 106 and a 303 and syncing it up with the 707, just making real abstract rhythm tracks. And these abstract rhythm tracks, I would make them and then... the nights that I DJ, because I'm still in high school. So I'm going to high school, and on the weekends, I'm DJing parties every weekend, and I'm DJing with, you know, Lil Lewis and Ron Hardy and Andre Hatchets and, you know, guys that at that moment had, you know, had caliber. They were like the top, you know, like the top guns, as you would say, people. out there on the DJ circuit and here I am, this 15 year old kid, and I'm doing parties with these guys on the weekend and then Monday I got my book bag on going to school. And to be able to fit into that equation of doing that was, you know, that was kind of a little overwhelming because I brought something different to the table. well, I can analyze all these guys' elements. And they're looking at me like, what's this kid doing? I'm like, wait a minute, I see what he's doing. And to be able to get embraced by these guys was the great thing. When you were very young, was it already around as house music? Yes, yeah, it was already around. It was already around. It was already kind of like in the phase where... You had your disco records that consisted of live drummers and live instruments. So it's not as accurate as you like putting on a record that's being programmed on the drum machine where you have a steady rhythm and a steady count. You actually have a drummer sitting there. You're trying to blend something in, thinking it's going to have the accuracy. It takes a certain person with skill to be able to play disco and to be able to, you know, finagle disco in a certain way because there are so many different shifts and transitions based on the fact of a drum machine. So I almost like the difference between a DJ spinning and playing on the decks. playing on CDJs versus a DJ playing on Serato or Final Scratch or something of that nature, it gives it a totally different texture. It might be more simplistic for somebody to play on a Serato or a Traktor or one of those programs or whatever in nature, but spiritually to somebody it might. feel right for them to still play their vinyl and for them to play CDs and keep it at their limit because they want to kind of have a, they want to kind of get the feeling that they're doing something more or less being pacified by something that's easy, that can be easily done and replicated. So it's a difference to each his own. Everybody likes what they like, but it depends on... It depends on your soul when it comes down to the content of how you want to go, and that's what house music is. It's just a nice little pinch in your soul or something that gives you that. Sense that there's nothing wrong. I mean, you're doing your thing. I mean, I'm enjoying myself. You're hearing music that moves you. You're trying to get away from all the madness of what you've done in your day. House music is like that little aspirin that you take to just get you away from it. Did you have the feeling that you had to escape from normal life? sometimes into house? Did it really help you cope with problems? It was like my safety net. I mean, sometimes, you know, when I felt like all the things that were outside of what I do, for some strange reason, I can always... Just, you know, put some headphones on, go work on my decks or work on a track. At least I got somewhere to go to take me away from the immediate problem or irritation that I'm dealing with. At least I know that I got somewhere I can go to kind of relieve that and take some of the weight that I'm feeling about this nonsense situation and apply that. towards either making something or doing something musically because it's not going to be that type of notion for me not to think that something that makes me feel so good is almost, sometimes it can make me feel so bad. But once you realize that you at least got a choice besides not having a choice at all. your chances end up being a lot better, a whole lot better. You played in the music box, right? Yeah. Yeah, I played a couple times. Yeah, I mean, of course, Ron Hardy is still a legend to everybody. Bye. Can you tell a little bit about this friendship and how it started and everything? Well, it's kind of interesting because we did a party together, but it was my first time ever. So the place was the High Park Athletic Club. I'm sitting up setting up the equipment, and I'm pulling out my records, and I'm about to get ready to get started because I know by me being the bottom guy was Ferris Thomas, Ron Hardy, and myself, Gene Hunt. We had a promotion called Gucci, and Steve Poindexter was like the vice president of Gucci. Not only did he make tracks and DJ all that, but he was the vice president. So this is how it all started. I had a demo tape. I put a, what do I mean by a demo tape? A cassette tape, not a CD. CDs didn't exist then. Only had cassettes. So I did a mixtape and I melded with the mixtape. Steve Poindexter called me back and said, yeah, I heard your mixtape. And, uh, I wanted to know if you wanted to do this party at the high cart athletic club. So I'm like, yeah, I'm going to do this party. He said, well, who going to say what? who's going to be DJing with me? He said, it's going to be you, Ferris Thomas, and Ron Hardy. I said, just me, Ferris Thomas, Ron Hardy? He said, yeah, I like your tape. So you want to come on and get down with Gucci? I'm like, yeah. So I go. I got this little bag of records. I don't know. It's my second party, but I got this tape deck with me. It's the tape deck again, huh? Yeah, I got a tape deck and a reel. First time I had the reel-to-reel with me. I had this big Pioneer 909 reel-to-reel, like this big digital blue light LED screen, reel-to-reel. So my buddies are carrying the reel-to-reel. They hook it up. So Ron Hardy walks over to me, and we never met before, and he was like, he was like, what you about to And they said, do what? I said, I'm about to use it. I'm about to mix with it. He said, oh, really? I'm like, yeah. He said, I'd like to see that. He said, I'd like to see that. So I'm like, okay. We were sitting there. He said, are you like the sound man? I'm like, no, I'm going to say my name's Gene. He said, oh, yeah, I heard about you. He said I said it's my first time for me to have heard a whole lot about him. So I'm kind of like wow wow, you know. So now I'm nervous, you know what I'm saying? Now it's like, you know, oh, wow, I'm doing a party, you know, with him. So he gets there early. So I'm thinking about him being, you know, about him being a big name and so forth and all the things that I've heard about him. I'm thinking that he's going to come and close the party, you know, let me like close the party out. Because I know I'm opening. I know I'm the first guy there. So when people start coming in, at least they'll get a chance to see me, you know, hear me. I know I'm opening. But it just so happens that everything kind of went in reverse. He said, well, I don't have to be at the music box until later on at night and work. So he was like, he's like, you know what? He said. Let me play first, and then I'll play after you. And I'm looking at him like, so there's more pressure. It was like he already had it in his mind in reference to how we were going to be able, because I honestly admired him. But it was in such a little way that, you know, we just kind of, it just kind of phased in because he was real curious to see. He said, no, I'm going to stick around for this. I want to see, you know, I really want to see what you can do. So I'm going to sit here and then I'm going to check you out. So I'm going to go and spend early because where I got to go, I don't have to be there for a certain time. I said, I really want to rap. So let me get, but I got to get out of the way first because I don't have to be at the box. The music box don't open at 12, 1 o'clock in the morning, so it wasn't a big deal to him. So he played first. And then I got on, you know, and I started, like, playing stuff off the rear of the reel, like stuff that he didn't have. Like, he was looking at me. He just walked and put his arms on my shoulder. I was like, mm-hmm, I done made a new friend now. I'll see you this weekend. We're gonna be doing some music dubbing. and work with you. And I was like, yeah. So right then and there, I was in there. That was like one of the most fascinating, high-nitied lifestyle a teenager could ever have is to have somebody of that caliber, you know, to take you up under their wing and, you know, show them, you know, some remarkable things about just the skill of DJing and just the room, the people. just all the other things, not just the technical issues of how to play and timing, but for somebody to just, you know, give you that influential, you know, push that you need and that step, you know, that kind of father figure, you know, type of feel, you know. How much older than you was Ron? I don't really have an accurate number. But I can say that I was probably like maybe 14 or 15. And he had to be like maybe in his early or mid 30s. Oh, really? Yeah. Y'all about to say that. Yeah. Y'all about to say that. What would you say is the most important thing you learned from him? It was all about timing, being patient with certain things and not, you know, trying to be overboard with it. I mean, he showed me like a whole lot of influence as far as taking something and just making it so big. Let me give you an example. It can be one DJ that can play the same track that you play, but it's something that you do to the track that makes it sound different than what he does, what the other guy does. It's able to put spiritual continuity behind music when you play it. That was something that was remarkably what he showed me and what I grabbed on. you know, the extension of playing the record. If the record is created and made a certain time frame, then let the people hear the record for the duration of the time frame of the record, you know, instead of, you know, just being very patient. You know, Frankie taught me a whole lot about And this was like one-on-one with these guys. It wasn't like me just outside of a window shop of this imagination. This was me having one-on-one time, you know, with some of the guys that I feel, you know, that are the most remarkable was guys from House Music. I've got an opportunity to be able to have one-on-one with all these guys at their young age. That was, you know, from Lourdes to... Steve Hurley to Farley's to Joe Smoove's to Larry and Robert Owens to Marshall to Adonis. I mean, to everybody that was creating music in that time. I had relationships with these guys, but with Ron, it was different. I mean, he'd come over to the house. We'd do splice mix and edit, and he'd show me how to splice mix on the reel-to-reel. We'd do edits. You know, sometimes we'd get on the drum machine, play around, make tracks, and we spent a lot of time together in reference to, you know, just the different things. Like, you know, Throwback 87 was a track that when we worked on it, we made the track and then we said, we need a little bit more to it. He played it at the party. He played it one night, and we just saw the response of it. And then we just started, we made other versions of it. So they're like other versions of Throwback 87, which is one of the tracks that's on Rush Hour. But, you know, we tinkered and messed around with the drum machine, the keyboard. You know, we started on stuff, but we didn't really get an opportunity to finish it. But, you know, it was still like a lot of stuff that we just sit and tinker around with. We just take it to parties and just experiment with it and just play it. And it would work. So a lot of that stuff is being, you know, retrieved. One thing about me, I'm glad I'm a pack rat. I still got my grade school report card. I still got old tapes and reels, you know, from back in the day because those are things that I cherish, obviously. And some of that childhood and put it back in today because, you know, it's a whole new generation of house music. There's no reason why the people that are in the game now don't really get an opportunity to, you know, to hear some of this music that we used to listen to, you know, when I was their age or whatever the case may be. It's like a whole new tutorial of showing them a different frame set of house music from a... professional and from a dedicated more chibi perspective so yeah so this you you call it pack rat but um i would say maybe librarian is also a yeah a junkie librarian with a with just a closet in your house just full of high school jerseys and You know, your first place trophies, just all your relics, you know, all the stuff that you accomplished back in the days and you just kind of put it in a trophy just to maintain, to keep it type things. But some of those things, like you say, are some of the most valuable things in the world because what you think, all that stuff is sitting there, it's very valuable. It's like treasure. So it's like a... a real good thing that some of the stuff that we did record and a few things that we did record, I was able to still retrieve it and still have it, you know, for it to be reinvented because, you know, those are like different sides of how we got out, you know, as far as our relationship is concerned. You know, he was just, I mean, just real good on that. Just, you know, being able to be punctual, try to be on time for things. You know, don't be afraid to take new things and break them in. I mean, don't just try to always count on this and count on that. Learn how to be a little bit more inventive because once people start seeing that you're inventive, you're playing it. and you liking it, then they're going to grasp on what you're playing. And, you know, they'll get used to it and they'll start learning how to be able to just adapt and do that. And I think that was one of the most. most wonderful things that I learned from him was just timing and just showing how to be able to conjure small things and make them big. I mean, it must have also been rough at times because he was living quite a rough life as well, right? Yeah. you know drugs and I mean how how how was that as a youngster hanging out with such a you know someone with such a dynamic life lifestyle at the time I mean just sitting back and just being with him at times you know where he'll have to play like you know he might have to play at best maybe three or four parties a night and we'll just like go from party to party to party. before he had to go do the rest of the night at the box. So you have to think throughout the course of that night. I mean, he balanced it. I mean, he balanced it in regards to what he did. I mean, he always chastised me about I don't ever want to, you know, he was always on my ass about not ever doing nothing. You know, so, I mean. He stood on me. I mean, for real. Like, you know, I don't ever want to see you do this. You know, you do this, do that, whatever. But don't ever, you know, I don't ever want to see you do this. And then there were periods when, you know, he went through that phase. You know, I was able to acknowledge and see that we maintained what he had to maintain. But then it got to a point to where I've been around him when he was completely like clean and, you know, no drugs, nothing. So I got a chance to see all shapes and capacity of my mentor, you know, in such a way that, you know, I was able to embrace that. And now that I've came this far. completely understand the transition and probably what he had to go through back then at his point and by me getting to my point. So I can completely understand, you know, throughout the course of years and decades, you know, people in the party, they party, whatever they do, whatever they do, that's fine. But at the same time, you know, all the pressure that he had to deal with. four gigs and, you know, this and that. Obviously, there were reasons in reference to, you know, why he did what he did or whatever the case may be. But, I mean, I'm definitely blessed and I'm thankful to be able to have a tutelage from him and, you know, for me to be able to, you know, reprimand and represent him and the fact that, you know, he was somebody that was special to me in reference to. not just being a good friend to me, but also giving me some of those skills in reference to learning how to not think about the technical issue of DJing, but the passionate part of it. That's what makes the DJing so remarkable. And once people can get to that... that spiritual level they can really maturely get a chance to embrace it but you know anybody has a technical side everybody has a spiritual side everybody has a physical side it depends on the way they play music it's different elemental ways of how every DJ and recording artist express themselves Musically. I mean, this might be a bit of a tough question, but how did you feel when he died? And I mean, of course you felt horrible, but was it like everything collapsed for you? Well, no, not so much as collapse. Everything, it was just kind of like, it was kind of like a devastation because at that period, you know, house music just really took a tumble. I think Lil' Lewis at the time had just put out French Kiss, so he left Chicago. I think Frankie Knuckles had just either did Tears or one of those songs. Robert Owens or it was something, I think it might have been a whistle song or whatever. One of those songs, then Frankie moved to New York and left. Ron passed away and then the scene just kind of, everybody just kind of, the scene just kind of got at a standstill because everybody was venturing off into what they were doing. And then I was kind of like at that point to where it's, you know, my desire for it, you know. I mean, I started getting into producing rap music, you know, with rap groups. You know, I got a call to come out to California at 18, 19 years old to produce a rap album with a female rap group that has a record deal. So I'm like, I'm out of here. I want to learn how to make rap music and hip hop. So I chilled out from house music for at least about... anywhere, I would have to say, for about five or six years. I just kind of, you know, just took a break from it. Was that also because of, you know, just bad feelings about how everything went? It was just kind of like, you know, it just kind of like, it kind of fades. out. It was something, you know, he had great expectations for, kind of phased out. So I got more into making the record thing. You know, like, you know, let me start making, I just started making tracks, you know, still producing and putting music, like records and stuff out. But not so much as DJing, you know, per se. Once I got on the, you know, I started, like, you know, I took a little break for a minute. I started making more records So once I started putting records out and dealing with different labels, they'll fly me out to come play. So I was just doing more parties overseas, not the country and stuff like that. But I really didn't have a home base. I'd maybe do a party here and there. So back then it was kind of like a slow period, but I was doing more producing and less DJing back then. I just kind of cut it out for a minute. Because your first record came out on Trax, right? Yeah. How was that experience? Because, I mean, it was... pretty known for its, how do you say, how do you say, Trax was, Trax was notorious for the way they worked, right? Right, exactly. How did you, how was your experience with that? Well, I mean, I guess I can be one person to say that all the business that I've done with them as far as, you know, living in the land and everything, it was always fair business. They paid me on time. I got to. I got my residuals. I mean, I've heard some people that had some really, some really bad, you know, experiences. But, you know, for the most part, every time I've done business with track records, I've always got paid. I've always got paid. I've always got my residuals. You know, one time I worked for Larry and Larry didn't pay me for working a whole week at the, you know, at the factory. But other than that, I got paid, you know. and that I got paid. Yeah. And how was it when you first held that first piece of vinyl in your hands? My friend I was working at Import Records at the time, and that was like one of the hottest shops in Chicago. So he called me. He was working behind the counter. Man, your record just came in. It's on the wall. They're eating it up. I'm like, are you serious? He's like, yeah. I said, man, go get me a copy right now. Put it behind the shelf. He said, I already got your copy behind the shelf, but it's almost gone. I'm like, are on the wall and just saw it there and I was like, wow, it felt good to be able to see, you know, my first release, you know, on the wall. So, yeah. I'm interested in this period where you say you, you, you, You got out of house music, you moved into rap music. What was the difference in the, did you notice a difference in the way, in the scene, in the way things were done, in the way everything was produced? Yeah, it was completely, I mean, it was completely different. It was, you know, it was a total flip of what I, you know, what I... Just gotten out to. I mean, I was just kind of taking a break from house music. I know I didn't like get rid of my records and sell all my equipment. I still kept everything. I just decided to just wanted to do something else at that time. You're a teenager. You want to expand your horizons and try some different things. I mean, I felt good. I got a chance to do that. And, you know, I can come back to that. Hopefully, but here's some other things that I want to kind of try to knock out too. You know to see where I can stand in those areas and you know it was a real good experience, you know dealing with two inch tape and you know, automated mixers and automated faders on the mixers and SSL and Neves and things of that nature, just looking at it, just hands-on right there. All these rap beats and 808 kick drum coming out the speakers. I mean, I thought that was kind of cool at that moment in time. So I got an opportunity to work with... a female rap group by the name HWA. So I lived out in LA for about six, seven months. I thought it was a good experience. For my first time going to California and working on something like that, that was a real good experience at the time. I took a decision in going out and doing it. And that's when I started learning how to use the Akai MPC. That's when I got introduced to the MPC. So I never had the instructions. Just turned it on, just started playing with it. And over the course of time, I just kind of learned how to use it. areas and spots I'll get into that I'm confused about but like a lot of my friends had them so I could just call them and they would be like oh now hit that button hit that button hit this button but okay it works now then as I do it for a while I'll just ultimately memorize it working on the rap music you know it's one thing I lived in California I just moved to California for like six or seven months and I started working with this group so I lived in the valley and I I wasn't really into the house scene like I was once I started working with them. I came back home and started producing, working on my own stuff and making beats. putting my studio together, you know, so I can record my own stuff. But my thing was always trying to find my sound niche. A niche to be able to have good quality recordings and learn the actual technical aspect, you know, like hooked up to mixing boards and learned how to, you know, sync the drum machines and the keyboards and stuff together. So I started getting more into learning the production aspect and not being... and being a little less of a DJ. and start putting record and stuff out. So in that little down period, once things started to pick up doing DJing again, before you know it, I met some guys at Stockholm Suite, and they had a label called Hybrid and Planet Rhythm. So I met Carrie and started hanging out with them. And once I met up with those guys, they were like, are you the guy that made Living in the Land for Trap? And I'm like, how do you guys know about that? They're like, man, that's You want to come out here and play? So they flew me out to Stockholm. Nice. And I played out there. My music was a little bit different then. My tracks were just a tad. bit different, but I still had the soulful style. I make all my housey stuff. Then I had this whole other style that I came up with that was more techy, more dark, different, more trackish. So it just showed just another one of my elements as far as me being able to go back and forth because that's the area I learned from. We used to play tracks and then play disco and all that stuff together. We would play all that together. So it was never... It was titled We All Considered It One Thing. Everybody considered it in different genres. Now, if you listen to it back in our day, we didn't even question to think about it. Like, you know, we're going to play this banging-ass acid track with this disco record, and they throw an edit in, and it's house music. Bottom line, I mean, what do you say? Now they would call it techno or they would call it acid house or something else. It was all house music to us. You think the climate has changed where it's harder to mix these things together? No, not at all. Not if you know. what you're doing for one and for two um it's so easier now for people i mean it's so easier it's so easier now for people to mix and you know to match something together i mean we have the technology now where it makes it a lot more simplistic for people to become djs as opposed to finding the music is not hard because we have the internet now. We have access. Back then, we didn't really have that technology for us to be able to say, well, what's the name of this song? You can just put your phone in front of the speaker at a club and it'll tell you what the name of the song is. I mean, we didn't have that. We didn't have that kind of technology, you know, to be able to do that. The natural way is fine. I mean, it's good to be advanced and to be based on the times and that's what it's for, but it's a lot easier and more accessible to get something that you always wanted. Ooh, I always wanted this record by Blase Escapé. You go on YouTube. and it's on there or whatever. You have access. I didn't know it was video to that song. I mean, there were so many things that were being done and now we're all getting a chance to expand on that. And I think that that's completely awesome to be able to have that access and then by me still being able to have the technology of when I first started to still have that, to still have those cassettes. to still have those old tracks that I did when I was a teenager and to be able to effectively bring all that stuff back to life now was, I would have to say, one of the smartest things that I've ever done as far as, you know, maintaining and being able to have some of the material that was never heard out of the... a club that was never ever played at a club. Just stuff that was recorded that was never ever heard. You know, to be able to put stuff like that out, I think that's real cool. Especially for today's generation. How do you feel about the recent How do you feel about the recent renaissance of all this old Chicago house stuff? I mean, there's a lot of people who are using it or rediscovering it. How do you feel about that revival? I think that is great because a lot of the artists didn't get a chance to get the recognition that they truly deserve. And for one, the reason why I'm doing the Volume 1 compilation is basically to give thanks and to pay big respects to those guys that scoped and mentored me as far as giving me that drive to be able to make a record. I mean, Steve Hurley and Farley's. Larry Hurds and the Marsha Jeffersons and Joe Smooths. These are guys that made records that were inspired. I mean, not to mention they were great friends and they always had open arms and would give me material to play and, you know, things of that nature. And, you know, to have somebody like a Craig Loftus and a Mike Dunn, I mean, you know, I got guys that's on this project. that have meaning to me, inspirationally on the recording aspect, on the friend aspect, on the DJ and the music aspect overall. So it's kind of like a commemorative compilation that I'm doing for Rush Hour. Consistent of all Chicago's between the 80s and that year, these were the guys that were making some hot tracks and these were like the dance. These were the dance floor. These were the dance floor getters. So that's something not to be sacred. That's something to be shared, especially in this point in time right now to see. Can you tell us something about this collection that you have? Because you say you were collecting everything. Where did you store this? Was it in your basement somewhere? Yeah, it was just reel-to-reels. Reel-to-reels, like when I was out DJing and playing parties, if I didn't have my cassettes, then I had my reels. Sometimes I would come to parties with just my tape deck and my reel-to-reel, and I wouldn't even play on the 1200s. I would just go from reel-to-reel to tape. tape to reel to reel back and forth. Just kind of like how guys now in this era use the CDJ-1000s or the 800s. So, you know, something of that caliber. I mean, back then I had the choice of playing on the turntables and I had my tape deck and I had my reel to reel. So I had my full ensemble right there. So if I was playing a two, three hour set, I got four different units that I can operate. on the mixing console and do my thing. So now it's a little bit more simplistic for me where it works out. I can still take some of my old material that's on the cassettes and reels. They got remastering programs now. I can remove tape hits and clean it up and make it sound as close as now as possible. Pop it on a CD and play it at a party and get a chance to see if that track still holds its value. There are some tracks that a lot of these Chicago guys have made that still hold their value on the dance floor. There are some of them, like, you know, a lot of the Jamie Principle stuff is like, just, it's flawless. I mean, that's all I can say. It's flawless. And to see, you know, to see. To see some of that music from back in those days, the Chippies, the Tommy Jacks and his house and all that kind of stuff, stuff like that that holds its weight, always lasts on the dance floor because it has that authenticity to be able to go up on a shelf with this piece. The Jesse Sanders on and on, the fantasy, stuff like that. It was flawlessly done. How do you feel about the current state of house music? I think that it's good. I think it is good at this point right now. It might be a little bit too overbearing, but I think it's good at this point because it's a lot of energy. So if anything falls off, there's still some extra energy that'll compensate it. I think it's doing all right right now. It would be good to see guys getting back into the shops and you still got your dedicated guys that come and buy vinyl. I still love my vinyl lovers by no means. I mean, go out and support them. Buy your wax. Don't ever get out of that. That's just the sound quality of a record coming out of a sound system. It's so much more than a 128 KBS MP3. It sounds completely different coming off of a laptop versus some 140 gram weight vinyl. You know, guys, they really take their stuff. They will really take the pride in what they do. Just keep it real, you know. So, I mean, in that aspect. yeah but on the other hand i mean isn't there also a lot to say for the fact that because it's lower quality, at least it's more easily spread to other people in a way? Well, not really so much easily spread to other people. It's just that, you know, when you have a vinyl record and it's rare and they only have 500 copies in the world, you are one of them people that have 500 copies. If I got an MP3 of a song and I can just download it, there are millions of people that got that, so it doesn't really hold its value. as that vinyl record was, you know, I got it right here. Well, I got it on MP3, so it doesn't matter, but it don't sound like this. Wow, I didn't know that there was flutes and guitars and all that in the record. Yeah, because you got a low-quality MP3. I got the real thing. That's the difference. Yeah. That's the difference. Yeah. you So you actually go out and buy records every week still? Yeah, I still do record shop. I have a pretty nice collection. I mean, just as far as not just me buying house music, but I'm a jazz lover. I like acid jazz and regular jazz, and sometimes I like a little alternative and stuff like that. So I go collect records that I wanted when I was younger that was hard for me to find. I have like a wish list, and I go and try to seek out. some of the stuff that I've been looking for. You're going discogs and everything? You know. Yeah. And then it's just, like, now it's trying to, now what I'm going to have to start doing is I want to organize all my music. Like, you know, put it, like, in a big shelf. Uh-huh. Like, this real big shelf from Ikea or something. And I want to just, like, organize all the genres in my music. So if somebody says, Top shelf to the left. I want to be that organized. Can you tell us a little bit more about the upcoming series on Rush Hour and what we can expect on it? Pretty much, it's a mixed CD with some of Chicago's greatest musical DJ killer assassins. From Steve Hurley to Mike Dunn. to Farley, to me and Ron Hardy, to Larry Hurd, to Robert Owens. I mean, the list goes on and on. Craig Loftus, I mean, it has a very commemorative, like, tribute and dedication. These are some of the guys that, you know, have shaped the game in a producing level that... I just got some of the things that they did in their beginning stages, all of us in our beginning stages, before all the other stuff came along on the vinyl movement, the stuff that we used to play on cassette, the stuff we used to play on tape, just old artifacts of tracks that... that we made and ideas that scoped it into, you know, that what we would call today classics. You know, but, and then there was some, there were some tracks on the other project that never got heard in the club. They never got an opportunity to get any exposure. You'd be like, oh, I didn't know they made that. Right, because this was stuff before you knew about the records that they made, before you knew these, before these artists became artists. You know, it's them in their beginning stages. Did you actually have, because I'm sure you've communicated with all the guys that you wanted to bring out or most of them, right? Did you ever have some of them say, oh man, I don't even remember. uh making that anymore and did they get reminded of it because of your tapes a couple a couple of them did they were like sure you know they was like oh straight up yeah g man yeah because you know i called everybody you know most everybody let them know like hey i'm doing a tribute like commemorative you know chicago like volume one volume two just, you know, representing the city as a whole and some of the guys that did such a remarkable job in that era, you know, for people to be able to see how remarkable they were as far as the Steve Poindexters, Joe Smooths, and like a lot of the other guys that I mentioned. I got a lineup of some really, you know, I mean, it's like an all-star lineup. on this compilation with the mix because you get an opportunity to see all these guys with different styles and how amazingly they constructed and produced their tracks back in that time frame. You know, I mean, just to name a few artists. It's definitely going to be a very interesting project to show you the different dimensions of how we created house music back in that 80s era, but it's kind of like in a more raw, uncut form. So be on the lookout for that Rush Hour. That's going to be a nice one.
