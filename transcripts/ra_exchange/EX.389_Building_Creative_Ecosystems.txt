*Dramatic music* you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. The inner workings of three artist collectives were explored last November at Ableton's Loop Conference in a series of talks titled Building Creative Ecosystems. This week's exchange was recorded live with Disc Woman's Shy Boy, student and DJ Haram, who discussed how the collective's commitment to amplify each other provides a banner of visibility and strength for female and non-binary artists. Moderated by Andrea Gertzker, the talk asks the question of how collectives make decisions, how they overcome challenges, and the ways they provide artists with a community context where they can thrive both as individuals and with their peers. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. Building Creative Ecosystems Exchange is up next. Good morning, welcome to Loop. My name is Andrea Goetz. and I'm the moderator for this panel on building creative ecosystems with Disc Woman. And in this series, we are kind of looking up from the instrument into the environment around us and to the other people. And we'll talk about... different collectives who shape their environment together, support each other in different types of structures. And the first group is Disc Woman. I'm happy to welcome students. Hello, what's up? And Shy Boy. Hello. And DJ Haram. Hi. Very nice to have you here. Thank you. Before we start talking about Disc Woman that you are all a part of, you're also part of other collectives. We're going to talk about that in the next hour. I would like to briefly look into all your individual creative practice. I think that's important to understand first. who you are as artists. And so I would just like to do a brief round of introduction, what you are currently interested in in your practice. So student, you're a DJ, multi-instrumental artist with training in jazz piano, guitar, and sampling on turntables. And you also teach creative production, right? This is true. giving the keywords and leave it to you for the... Sure. I started in music when I was a lot younger and kind of... got forced into it, like the way a lot of parents force you to start an instrument and kind of learn to love it just through practice. And I started on guitar and piano and fell in love with both of those things. And when I got to college, I kind of stopped with it and started getting interested in electronic music just from clubbing in New York. And only really in college did I start experimenting with electronic production, synthesizers, DAWs, and Ableton. And since then, I think... Ableton has been my primary tool for creating or just like where I put all the stuff that I use whether it's guitar or piano or like a hardware synth or soft synth it's pretty much my main medium and I also DJ yeah that's kind of it okay Shyboy, you're a DJ, producer, visual artist and curator. Yes. And I leave the details to you. Yeah, so I'm a multidisciplinary artist. I do video and sound installation and performances as well as DJ and sometimes produce when I have free time and then when I have other free time, I curate. I think a lot of my work comes from... Just trying to break down and understand what's going around me and creative output is the best way for me to do that. It's the best way for me to learn personally. I love to research, so researching new topics, researching how to use new software. new instruments, new mediums in general is just like how I go through my everyday life and it allows me to, I think, be a better person but also a more calm person who just wants to, you know, drag you into my world for an hour and a half, if so much, or, you know, longer when I'm doing a set. DJ Haram, you're a DJ, producer, curator, party organizer, radio host, and zine writer. Just for the keywords. Yeah. One of my favorite songs right now, the intro is one of my favorite rappers, Booty Chain. They have a quote that says, who has time to have a job when you have several jobs? Highly identify with that. I feel like I have all of the jobs and all of the... avenues in music are places that I'm interested in pursuing. So yeah, I started as a improv noise artist playing music. I started DJing after that. Producing on software, hardware, throwing parties. I manage and represent an artist. I've done some scoring. That's like kind of in between the lines of soundscaping and producing dance music. I do whatever. All right. We'll talk more about all the different things you do and are interested in also then when we talk about collectives. But let's now look into Disc Woman. And we've brought a little clip that gives you an introduction. So lots of things have been said about Disc Woman. And those of you who don't know about it get an idea by this clip. There needs to be more diversity, yes, on the stage, and sometimes that needs to happen behind the scenes too. What we see a lot of is whitewashing within electronic music. Most festival lineups are usually like 10% women. You're like, wow, there are so many women who are like doing really amazing things. I'm starting to notice that this is like an actual pan of... just not being diverse lineups in our media community. There's a lot of people behind the scenes that are giving these opportunities to a generic white man crowd and DJ. And that's what we are really having this conversation about. This Woman started off as a two-day showcase in 2014. We had 12 woman-identified DJs. They donated their time, and we donated the proceeds to a local nonprofit. But now it's kind of broadened out as being an agency and platform that represents people who don't fit the sort of white male cis field in music. We're just trying to combat the heavily male-dominated music industry in all sorts of creative ways. The model of drawing from your local talent and offering a more diverse lineup was something that we could copy in other cities, and other cities reached out for us to do it. We were like, oh, maybe there's a way we can make money for artists and be able to give ourselves a little bit of change too. We all care about the artists and what they need in order to do their jobs. And that's what keeps me up. And like, I want to make sure that everyone's good. Their work is important. And that's really what it's about. There's so much pressure on like venues to like make back. that they just sort of surrender any kind of creative integrity at all. They just want to put in big acts. The more examples you see of someone like you doing a job that you didn't think you could do, that's really encouraging. So the more variety of diverse bodies that we see in these jobs, the more I think others will be inspired to feel that they can be in that place too. We're constantly trying to grow and push each other and bring out more people and managing all the new artists we want to bring on and support. Any conversation we're having about diversity at large, it's always going to be ongoing. I mean, someone like Frankie, she's so vulnerable. and having these conversations and like Emma actually doing it and like being on stage and creating her own spaces for that. We all do that in our own ways and all of our artists do that in their own ways. I'm really just trying to focus on like staying as sort of like humble and grounded as possible with all of this change and like press and all this kind of stuff. A lot of it is just getting started and If we can encourage people to try and to believe that they can have a place, then that's really ideal. That's a cute video. But none of you is in the video, actually. So you are not among the founders, but you have joined Discwoman at a later stage, I think. How did you join Discwoman and why? What was your motivation? I don't want to speak for everyone, but I feel like I had a relationship with Christine and Frankie and Emma prior to joining Discwoman. kind of knew each other in the scene, in the music scene in New York. I think that in New York, it is kind of easy to get to know people once you start going out. And especially if you're into like a particular kind of music, techno or club music. So we had a relationship beforehand and it felt kind of natural. Like we actually got along. We sincerely care about each other. an actual vibe. It's not like a transactional relationship. And so it kind of just happened naturally. Like, we were friends, and then it kind of just made sense. I think I was also looking for representation and had a hard time figuring out what made sense for me, and I didn't want to commit to anything. Not like selling out, but just like I didn't want to co-sign or be involved with something that I had. that I didn't share the same values with, if that makes sense. I think that with a lot of agencies, it can feel really distant or it can feel like you're not really sure if whoever is working really cares or understands your needs as an artist. How was that for you? I did a few Fashion Week parties for the label Chromat that Becca McCarran runs, who is Christine's wife now. And then I think there was like a period in time where people kept asking me or I would be doing parties and they're like, oh, we're going to put this woman on it. And I'm like, I'm not part of this woman. But I think people just automatically assumed I was part of this woman. And then Frankie and I had a conversation. She was like And the same thing with Izzy. But just knowing these people one-on-one and having a relationship with them made me want to join because I personally wasn't necessarily looking for representation for various reasons, a lot being that the music industry can be very insidious and evil at times, and I wasn't sure how much of myself I wanted to contribute to that process. And then just being around Frankie, Christine and Emma, them caring personally about me as an artist was what made me join. If I'm having a problem right now, I can call. one of them, and they're going to try their hardest to figure it out. Whereas I have friends who are part of other agencies where, you know, their booking agent doesn't care or the company doesn't care. They just want to, you know, make money and call it a day. So having that personal experience is really important for me. How is that for you? My origin story with this woman is a little bit different than student and shy boy. I was, I think, the fourth artist to be added and the first artist that's not based in New York to be added to the agency's roster. It's kind of a funny story. The very first time that I met Disco Men and kind of even knew who they were was... One of the first, if not the first, Disc Woman Showcase they did outside of New York, which was in Philly. I just got an email from a local promoter who was like, we're doing an all-women DJ showcase with Disc Woman. I'm Googling them and not much is coming up. I'm like, okay, was that one of the biggest nightclubs in the city? So I wanted to play on that sound system. So I was like, all right. And just for other reasons of the circumstance, I was just not in the right place to just throw down a great set. They had booked me to play the opening set and there was no one in the club at all. And I was like, so annoyed. I was like, even Disc Woman won't notice me. And I was still playing on a controller and a laptop with a sound card and, like, all this clunky stuff, like, next to the CDJs, being an amateur. And not once, but two times during my set, the sound just, like, stopped playing. I think, like, one of my cables came loose with my, like, second-hand equipment. Like, all the sound exited the club, and I just, like, looked at Disc Woman, like... And then I feel like a couple months later they just they hit me up and they were like Yeah, I don't know if you know but we're an agency and this is what we do like more on the technical side besides throwing parties and at that point in my career I Want to say this is like 2015 At that point I was a little bit more on kind of like my punk DIY way of thinking about music. And I was like, yeah, I play noise. Yeah, I'm a DJ. I'm trying to make music. But I don't want it to be my job because I don't want it to turn into this thing where I'm motivated by money or something. And then this woman approached me and I was like, you know, I don't have a high school diploma. I don't have a college degree. I don't have any other kind of institutional. support or association in music. Like, you know, I didn't go to any music school. I don't have any mentors. And I was like, wait, this is my chance, you know, to like have someone besides just me. Just because how my career was going, I was depending on music and also really happy that I could use my gigs to also pursue my creative goals. So I just went with it. Okay. Well, all of you mentioned you kind of are coming into Disc Woman because Disc Woman operates as a booking agency. And it's always said it's a collective. and a booking agency, or is it a collectively run booking agency? Can you explain a little bit, or is the booking agency kind of the focus of it, or is there anything more around that makes it kind of different from a regular booking agency? The best way to put it is that this woman is the umbrella. So Discwoman, the collective, Discwoman, every one of the members, and then DW Artists, which is the agency, is like a leg or an arm, a part of it. It's an offshoot. But they operate in conversation with each other. So Discwoman is a platform. It's a collective. We put out music, mixes. We do it all. But also, aside from that, operating collectively, there are... multiple people managing artists as well. How many of you are you in Dispelman? Like on the entire roster, how many? I think there are like nine or ten of us. Nine? collective, like, Discwoman as the platform is, like, what people know the most. It's, like, what has the most branding opportunities. It's what people see in a magazine. It's, like, the platform that can sponsor other people, even if they aren't necessarily on the roster. It's, like, it's how we achieve our messaging. It's, like, a medium. I think that's, like, what the Twitter is, what the Instagram is. Instagram is, it's the way that Discwoman can articulate what it's trying to do within the music industry. So I think it's less about the artists, it's less about us as the roster, and it's more about... the ethos of what's in the video, like trying to push forward a different narrative that's not the same straight white cis male behind some CDJs playing some boring tracks at 120 BPM, you know? Oh, I'm sorry. I like the kind of motto that you have, amplify each other, which I think is kind of a nice description of mutual support or a nice image for this, but also could mean, and this would be my question, is it also being meant as a kind of political statement? like amplify each other if you say you amplify the voices of women of queer people people of color like it also some kind of a political act i feel that from the video this is also something that this woman aims to to make a statement kind of in the music industry or is it more like really about this group of people supporting each other I think it's both. I think that it's weird to separate the personal from the political or to think that things that you do or believe aren't political, especially music. So I think that it's kind of the same. What you're saying, the idea of amplifying each other collectively or supporting each other is political in the sense that... queer people, marginalized people, women, don't get the same resources and support that other people do. And so that is inherently political to give your material labor, emotional labor to someone else and to believe in them enough to support them and push them and believe in them, even if other people don't. And I think especially in music, there's a tendency to feel... like there's a scarcity of resources just because it's so hard to make a living and make money off of music and any creative endeavor. I think especially for marginalized DJs and musicians, because I think a lot of times people think, oh, one person can get in and then that's it. And then that's just a go-to token of like the week or the month. So instead of... abiding by those rules, it's like, first of all, there should be no door for you to close. There's space and resources for all of us to be here. So yeah, pushing against the narrative that there has to be one... like black queer DJ or like one trans DJ producer, you know, it's really, it's like tacky to like tokenize people like that and think that, I don't know. Yeah. It's just like, there's so many people who look exactly alike. and do the same thing and nobody has a problem with it. But once it's someone that doesn't look like anyone like that, it's like, all right, we got enough of that. Fill a quota, boom, checkbox. And it's like, that's so, it's like gross, to be honest. Maybe this kind of leads to the question of the headline for this panel, Building Creative Ecosystems. What does a creative ecosystem look like for you, ideally? I mean, I'm glad that Shaiba brought up the topic of scarcity. I think that has a lot to do with... Or that's like, yeah, that's a central idea of the purpose of collectives and the idea of collectives as a tool against individual pursuits. And in this case of like creative expression and forming creative ecosystems that are sustainable. So I think essentially like a creative ecosystem is something that where there are sustainable resources, where it's not. you know it's not like gig to gig that's not really an ecosystem if you're just like hopping around by yourself trying to make ends meet yeah I think that ecosystem is composed of like networks of support which is definitely what Discwoman is I think what you said about sustainability is super important because it's just hard if you're like navigating the industry or yeah, just the music industry on your own. When I think of creative ecosystem in terms of Disco Manor, just in general, I think that it's funny to think of just music and creative expression as just what you see at the DJ booth or when you go to a show because there's so much behind-the-scenes work that goes into it. having a creative ecosystem or having a system of support, creative system of support, is like being able to turn to someone and honestly be vulnerable and have them be able to be honestly vulnerable with you back and give you the truth about... promoter or another artist or you know definitely about checking in too you know it's like yeah especially after one of my friends come off from tour i try to hit them up get in contact with them because touring is hard and you know you're in a place that you've never been before you're by yourself it's super isolating right then you're finally back home and then I know it's a lot of my friends once when they go on tour and then come back to New York, they stay by themselves even more just because they've gotten so used to being in that isolated environment. Emotional support, I think, is also really important within a creative ecosystem. You know, just checking in, going to the movies, a face mask, you know. You know, it's like, it's not always just, oh, I'm going to accompany to your gig and make sure someone's there, you know, dancing, you know, to like warm the crowd up. It's so much more than that. It's a creative ecosystem is your friends. These are people you work with. with and you love and you get to do amazing things with, but this should also be your second family as well. I think kind of what I was getting at was that there are so many different kinds of creative ecosystems. All these people in this room probably have their own idea of what that is for them, whether you're a musician or whatever way you express yourself, you exist in a backdrop. And I think there are ways to navigate that alone. Resources, I think, are at the basis of it. A very functional creative ecosystem could be one person who can afford studio time or their own really nice studio and can afford to do things like go to a therapist and go to a masseuse and that kind of care after tour. that be their ecosystem. But I think if you're thinking about or considering engaging or want to build a more collective model about that, the resources is where it has to be. start and I think collectively sharing resources and also redistributing resources are like an essential part of that. I think the collective model or the idea of working collectively acknowledges that people aren't treated equally and therefore people don't have equal access to resources so yeah in my opinion it's just for show if it you know resource wise isn't. you know what I mean and within Discwoman how are you organized then so for example you come back from tour and are there people within Discwoman that then call you up or you can or you give each other feedback on how you're doing and so on how does it practically work we're like all actually friends. So it's kind of just like having real human interaction. Being like, yeah, you're my friend. What's up? I want to hang out with you. But in terms of actual organization, it's like we do meet up. We have dinners. Every time somebody gets added to the roster, we make sure that we like... have a dinner and like actually hang out and get to know them besides like just knowing them on the internet. And in terms of just support, it's like we're all talking all the time, kind of just checking in, making sure that everyone got to their flight. I feel like it's just like the small things to know that somebody's like thinking of you and supporting you just in very small ways that like make a difference. You know, someone just remembering like. I don't know, that you had a really tough time and then you're flying all the way to Moscow. We all flew to Russia first to come here for some reason and it was just so weird. Frankie called me to make sure that everything was okay because my flight was super crazy. You know what I mean? It's things like that that are nice. It just makes you feel like, okay, someone's thinking of me and I'm not alone. Yeah, I think another thing as far as like sharing and redistributing resources is like Disc Woman kind of, people can't conceive of it. They're like, what is this? woman like I'm wearing a disc woman jacket so I'm disc woman today you know it's like I'm gonna go with it because no one knows what's real so cool but it's like with that kind of like mystique I believe in myth making I think it's a great thing to do as an artist to just build the myth and go in the direction you want to because the truth is going to escape everyone anyway And I think with that, people approach Disc Woman, just Disc Woman in general, with opportunities for things like production, commissions, gigs, creation opportunities. People project a lot of things onto it because it's just so amorphous and it's like, what exactly is it? It's everything. Right, but it's the thing that is very identifiably about gender and promoting. and pushing women and non-male people. So it's like they identify that, but they don't know exactly who specifically they should be working with or where these opportunities should go. And I think Disco Man does a good job at spreading that around through the roster and even through other artists that they work with a lot in New York. other cities that they frequent too. Yeah, it's like if an opportunity comes in, it's like if it's kind of like open, like it'll be shared with all of us and it's like... we'll ask like is anyone interested in this and if not it's like we'll be like okay like well do you know anyone that might be interested in this or can like benefit from like this kind of exposure if we get opportunities and like if we're not available or like to do a gig then we'll you know talk amongst ourselves and like okay so who are some DJs in our city that we really like that we think would really benefit from this opportunity then we'd like pass on that opportunity to them. Yeah. So it's even bigger. I mean, because you also bring in all your networks and it's kind of, I think a student in Scheiber, you are also part of another collective called, how do you pronounce it? KUNK. KUNK. K-U-N-K. Do you want to share? Because I think it's also interesting. I mean, KUK is kind of similar in that it's like an amorphous identity collective group of people who are multidisciplinary artists. It operates a lot less visibly than Disclement. It's not really, we don't like to like brand ourselves. We don't like... have an official Twitter or Instagram. It's more... I think we're all too mysterious. Yeah, we don't have an investment in being hierarchical or being... It feels too much to force any of us to be concretized what our relationship... to each other and what we do is, it's kind of like, we'll get together and do an interview or something, but we're not really invested in making merch or having a weekly party. It's more kind of, it's similar in that it's like a group of friends. - Group of friends with shared leftist politics. - Yeah, and yeah, a little bit nihilistic, I'd say. - A lot nihilistic, for sure. - Are you part of any other collective? structures as well? No, I'm not part of any other collectives. Like I do throw some events in Philly with friends, but it's not really like formally a collective, but it is something that we do. We like, we function and operate collectively and like share all the tasks and that kind of thing, which is kind of how I approach most projects, you know, that I'm doing with my peers. I think a lot of people actually in music, uh, artists like operate collectively and it's what's challenging is to be a collective and then to get so big like Diskelman and like get compartmentalized in a certain way where it's like people only know like the founders or like people only know like some part of the roster because they're like into techno or like know some you know and so it's to keep the collective identity sometimes when it gets to a certain level because people... And we're so spread out too. It's like Xur and Mobile Girl, they're part of Disc Woman, but their Disc Woman agency represents them for their North American bookings because they're both based here in Berlin. And then... Juana is based in DC, Haram is in Philly. We're kind of spread out all over the place. Does that change Disc Woman somehow? I think it started in New York and then now it's spreading all over the place with now even members in Berlin. This weekend we're on three continents. Yeah. Which is really cool. I'm Fang and... Christine are doing a show in Chile for a festival. We're here for Ableton and Bearcat is holding it down in New York. So to see it manifest this large to the point where like, holy shit, we're like in three continents right now. That's really cool. But does that also change how Discwoman kind of operates internally if you start having people like all over the place? I think it's more challenging because... I mean, obviously, it's like a very material, tangible thing where it's like, how do we communicate and organize when people are traveling and doing so many different things? have competing schedules and how do we think about adding people to the roster and who do we add. I think as anything gets bigger, it just becomes more challenging because there's a certain bandwidth that everybody has with their personal lives and creative pursuits. Discwoman is only so much a part of our identity and lives. Just by virtue of it getting larger, it's... It comes with different tasks and challenges. Do you actually discuss everything? Do you do decision-making together? Is there some kind of things that only the founders decide on? How does that work? No, I think that we do try to talk about additions to the roster. Even before that kind of happens, it's... we communicate about what we think about people who are interested in joining Disclamen or people that we're interested in bringing on. I think that it's not like we're totally clueless about anyone that comes on, I think, if that makes sense. It's like all of us are kind of in the loop or know who the person is beforehand. I feel a little bit less in the loop because I'm in Philly. So I miss eating and stuff like that. I miss your dinners. We've never had dinner in Philly. It's cool. I have dinner. You're in New York like every week. I know. You're always in New York. I know. But I think one thing that is important to acknowledge both about us and just kind of the idea of collectives and their goals and how they work, you know, realistically in a context that doesn't support collective organizing and sharing of resources that encourages us to do all the opposite is that you cannot pretend that you are functioning with your group in the ideal circumstance. So some would say, like, the way a collective should be operated is by consensus, and everyone has to consent to every decision that has to be made. but we're also trying to function. It's just not realistic. Right, we're trying to get things done, and there's so many things coming in and so many people going places that no one cares to contribute to every decision, and I think that's an important functional detail that people do have to negotiate in collectives, and that... is easiest done when people have real relationships with each other so that no one's assuming like, oh, it's okay if I do this or not checking in enough or checking in too much or something like that. So I wasn't complaining that I miss meetings. I'm so glad that no one expects me to come to New York. It's two hours away for those that don't know. Like if I went by car and I don't have a car, so not going. But I contribute how I can. I think that's a good thing. People bring what they want to and aren't necessarily obligated. There's not a bullet point of things you need to adhere to and if you don't, then you get kicked out the club. It's very late. back as it should be. What you just said kind of reminded me of something you said before to me where first I was reminded of like just the fact that we have real relationships and that requires trust and not having to be a part of every decision requires trusting the people that you work with but what you said reminds me of when you talk about transparency and like the need for transparency and collectives in order to like have that trust and know that If I'm not participating, the collective... best interest is still going to be pushed forward without me having to physically be there. Yeah. So are you also using the collective kind of on an artistic level? Are you, you do all your own kind of music and it's not like a, there's a kind of just woman's sound or something. I think that's at least how I see it from, from the outside. Are you also giving each other feedback on the artistic side, or is that also where you're collaborating? I mean, if someone sends me tracks, I'm more than willing to listen, offer my critiques of what I think is good, what I think needs to be improved. I think we collaborate a fair amount. you know, like, we DJ, I feel like all of us DJ a lot together. I've DJed with you a couple of times. I've DJed with you a couple of times. That's true. I feel like we share stuff all the time and, like, give each other feedback. In particular, like, I feel like we talk about how to use our synths when we don't know how to use them, which is nice, and, like, just having somebody as a reference point or just, like, For me in particular, it's hard to share my work. And so having Disco Man are like, especially these two, like people I trust and whose work I actually value and know that their values are similar to mine and that they're not going to lie to me about if my work is fucked up. Like it's... If it's bad, it's bad. And you have to be objective about that. Yeah. Yeah. If it's fucked up, it's fucked up. Do you feel that... you could go even further with Disc Woman, like in your collective organizing? Or do you think it's already good where it is? Or do you find there's kind of space to do more or better? I think also resist the idea of like Discwoman as having as much as I said that I think what we do is like inherently political like I think that applies to kind of everyone like artistically but I also want to push against the idea of like Discwoman becoming like the token for like gender equality or race equality you know what it's like It's like we're all just artists too, like really good, talented artists. And it's like it doesn't have to be all the time. We have like some weird agenda to like make you a better person or like believe things that you should believe on your own. It just so happens that like, yeah, that like applies to us. And it's like maybe you should just think about all the other things you care about and why they don't care about the things that we do. You know what I mean? If that makes It doesn't have to be all the time like we're activists, you know? Like that's not an onus to put on us. It's just we do that as people because we're real. Right. I mean, I think like just on that, this isn't really answering your question, but just going off what Suna was saying, I think it's just like there have been people saying the words and talking and writing theory about gender and race and class. and the intersections of all of that that are more nuanced and thorough and radical than us for decades before we were doing it, you know? And I think an essential part for me... is not doing as much talking about these ideas and kind of just putting that materially into the work because I think what needs to happen is like, you know, people need material to advance forward. Like people, like we need structural change in the industry. If people want exposure to ideas about... why patriarchy is bad. They can find that easily. People are just ignoring if they don't want to hear. You know what I mean? And I think it's like... And you should just be inherent in your work. You shouldn't have to... Right. You know, it's like every time I DJ, I shouldn't have to be like, I'm a queer black Jamaican woman who moved to the United States and I rose above. Like, no, I don't want to have to do that. That's so It just takes up a lot of time. It should just be inherent in your work. It shouldn't have to be this thing you have to say over and over again because also a part of it is once you normalize it, then you see how regular all of this is. It's just like, yeah, we should be more radical thinkers. We should want to do more. We should want to be better. And we should want to help each other without it being like, oh, I'm doing this good deed today. It should One thing I read in an article about the Kunk Collective was an interesting idea that you were using lo-fi audio or that you were pushing that forward maybe under the idea of... in our work, what we stand for. I thought this was an interesting point. Do you maybe want to talk about that? We're talking about Vogue and ballroom music in particular, right? I believe in the article. In a lot of big clubs, you have to play wave files or it has to be a minimum of 320 and stuff like that. Izzy, Student, and Rizla brought up in the conversation that by pushing forward those standards, you eliminate so many people, and it typically is marginalized people. For example, if I want to play a lot of dancehall music from the early 2000s, those aren't available in WAV files anywhere. It's going to be low frequency. But just because it's not of a high quality that's acceptable by the global North and Western powers doesn't mean that the audio or the song is not good. It just doesn't have the same... These people just don't have the same resources to create a nice, shiny mix and master song. So pushing forward that lo-fi is also a part of it. the underground it's also just like giving testament to like how people can work without having all of the systems are available to a lot of people that especially and I think we were also speaking to just like vinyl culture and just the way that like yeah it's just like it's absurd that there's like so many like like hierarchies and like you know kind of like gradations of like what is acceptable and like what is good and like if you do this you're a bad DJ and it's just like you know who made who the fuck made that up anyway like who cares what they think like like you know what I mean it's like not everybody like can like get a turntable or like have vinyl or do all these things and it's just like creating like like just a barrier like it's just absurd I don't know it seems silly and it's like Like you said, there's just so much music that's like, it's not, it doesn't exist in these forms and it becomes like a process of erasure that happens, that happens in so many other ways and it's just another example of systematic erasure. and saying people like this isn't valuable and like you don't like what you do isn't like worth our time even though we're gonna like take it and like make you know Diplo's gonna make some like dancehall beat for like Justin Bieber and like everyone's gonna love it you know what I mean it's like it's fucked up yeah I kind of I like that example also in the sense of from the amplify each other, like from what you have in Discwoman, like I felt like it kind of came all together there for me to how you also like creating, create those ecosystems and be inclusive, like really inclusive, not kind of tokenizing those groups as you were talking about before. So we have... 10 minutes left so maybe we open up to the audience okay maybe we start here and then take turns i'll bet you have a lot of people that want to become a part of disc woman how do you decide like the criteria for like adding people because you you probably realistically can't add as many people as want to be a part of the collective. So how do you screen people out? Is that just a group decision? Or is there like a core values kind of thing? Usually we send a quest via email. And then you have to go, you have a map, and then, you know, you dig up six feet, and then you pull out a bag, and then it says, can you beat match these three songs? I think, okay. That's, I feel like that's the ballad. That would be good. We should do that. One, we're like not that involved in that decision-making process, but like I think the way it actually happens is kind of the way that, you know, in the way that we individually told our stories about getting involved, it's like we had a relationship, like a working relationship or friendship with the people who started Disco Men beforehand. And I think... we have working relationships, friendships with people that get added. Also, we're on the artist side, so we personally aren't actively scouting people, but if Christine or Frankie will bring up someone and be like, hey, I think they're cool, what do you think about them? It's like, oh, they're cool. Kind of check in, yeah. Hi, I represent another collective from England, the Yorkshire Sound Women Network. We've been doing this for a couple of years and... I recognise a lot of what you're talking about, but one of the things that I wanted to mention or ask about really is how the industry can be doing more because of the emotional labour, the physical labour, the amount of work that women are doing. I counted maybe 52 different organisations for women just in music technology. It's a lot of donated labour. And this ecosystem depends on, you know, you look around the room... and loads of guys have that privilege to not have to come here because it's not affecting them but loads of guys have come here which I really celebrate to come and listen to you talking about Disc Woman so what do you have any thoughts about this? How to wake everyone up to the economics the sort of bigger picture You can only save yourself Yeah, I can't. It's like, in some way, that's like, it's like, in some way, it's like reiterating the onus on women or trans people or non-binary people to be the change makers when, like, existing is like a political act in itself. And it's the people who have privilege and who have access that need to do the work. themselves, you know what I mean? It's like kind of like, you can't wake someone else up. Like I feel like there's been enough history that has happened for people to like care or not. And this isn't new. Yeah, it's not new. So I think Haram said it's like you gotta just do what you're doing and find people that support you and support those people and fuck everybody else. Hope people are into it and then like word just spreads organically. I mean you can lead the horse to force it to drink right like it's that kind of thing yep hi My name is Lily. I am a student and producer. And I attend a graduate program where there are very few women. I have been wanting to start some sort of collective, some sort of program where more students and undergraduates can get involved and become less intimidated by my music production and tech program. and I've been speaking a lot with my collaborators, and there's been some discussion about what is going to be the most effective and best way to kind of bring on more people, and some ideas have been thrown around. I really believe in face-to-face meetings and discussion, while some of my other collaborators believe in more social media, presence, videos, guest speakers. So I was just wondering your opinions on maybe what would be the most effective. Both. I definitely do both. I think... Being in a room with someone is completely different than only interacting with them online. And then that can hopefully bring a good connection between you or among all of you. It also makes people a bit less intimidated once you get to know them. And then having, I mean, just being able to sit down next to someone and, like, go through a DAW, go through production principles, like, do air training, you know, I think it's just really good. So use social media to reach out, find people, and then, you know, bring it back to the classroom for sure. Yeah. I'd also say, like, in terms of, like, if people don't agree on what is the best way to, like... approach it, it's like you should just allow people to do the things that they feel like they do well. You know what I mean? Do everything. Put people in place who feel like they can take on those tasks. If you don't want to do social media, don't put someone that doesn't want to do it. Just allow them to do what... If you're a person that doesn't like one-on-one stuff because you have social anxiety... because I'm right there with you, you know, like, then don't do it. Yeah, yeah. I'm curious if you guys can talk a little bit about how you deal with conflict within the collective. Like, maybe it's, I assume it comes up in some situations, like... if there's a gig and you're having a meeting or some of these opportunities that you talk about, what happens when there's more than, how do you resolve a conflict if there's more than one person that wants those? If it differs to hierarchy or just what your process is? I don't know any conflict that has come out of competition. That has never been a thing I've experienced over the past two years. Yeah. No, yeah. But... What do you guys think that is? How does that issue even get circumnavigated? I think it's like we all kind of do our own thing. Some of us get the same opportunities, but also it's resisting the idea of scarcity, resisting the idea that if someone... get something and it's good for them that you shouldn't be happy because you don't have the same thing. It's like, why would I? Well, if there's enough resources, you're not going to be upset that someone got a gig because you know something's coming up for you soon. Yeah. Disc Woman also is cool. Like the way it, like things play out is part of it's because all of the artists who are on the roster, no one is like. their thing is Disc Woman and they're riding the coattails of Disc Woman. It's like we all are like strongly in our own worlds too and Disc Woman is just like a platform for us. So, yeah, we are, like, so different. I feel like there isn't even that much overlap that it would be like, oh, we both want to be, like, the headliner. Someone has to be the opener. That doesn't really happen. I guess, I mean, I've been booked with other artists before. I think it's, like, important to, like, check in. When I'm playing, even with my friends who aren't on Disc Woman, I think it's important to check in about what resources you're getting and how much you're getting paid. Because I think that could be a big conflict. Always ask how much you're getting paid. I think that's really important. Because I've been on lineups with other people. I also have Disc Woman friends. And I'm like, wait, how much are you getting paid? It would be like my white male friend. And they're getting paid You need to call a promoter right now. We're having a three-way conversation because we're doing the same slot, but... It's a three-way conversation. Oh, I don't play with that. But for some reason, you're getting paid more. Right. That hasn't happened to me within this woman, but in other things, yeah, I think you should definitely always ask other artists who you're friends with how much they're getting paid to make sure everyone's being paid fairly. I've definitely pulled together my money for someone who I was playing with that I knew was getting paid less, but they really wanted to take the... gig so we would both take the gig and then like I would split we would like pull our money together then split down the middle to make sure everyone got paid fairly just to go around that system with the promoters. Hi I work as a designer for a company that makes electronic musical instrument and especially in this in this field like is much more male dominant, white male dominant, much more than piano, guitar, analog instruments. And even if we start with the best intentions, because we really want, we as designers, to reach out, to talk with different kinds of people and sounds and music, it's very difficult. It's very difficult and you end up in this loop where you want to change the audience, but the audience that is looking for that kind of instrument is white male. So my question is, like, is there anything that, I don't know, when you approach an instrument, this is so annoying, this is like... so predictable, so annoying in any way. What kind of instruments do you make? Like what, like your rack? I work for a company called Rolly. We do... Oh, yeah, okay. You do the thing that you... Yeah, the station. Well, you... I mean, didn't you just work with Susie Analog? Yes. That's really cool. Does anyone want to take this question? No, that's all you students. So I actually work for a year-over-act company. I'm, like, manager of a year-over-act company, and we talk about this issue a lot because I think, just, like, in a very tangible way, I think price point is, like, very important. Like, when I think about, like, the cost of one Euro rack module or probably the cost of a rolly, it's like, that's pretty inaccessible. And I think that if you aren't actively making your instruments accessible, like people can come use them and have the time to use them and make things with them. It's like, there's no way to change the audience. If you're not like openly inviting people. To like have a space to play with. So would you say like workshops? Yeah. People can use it. Workshops. Like figure it out. Yeah. If they can't afford it. Yeah. And also just like, I don't know. of this before on the internet where I think that like companies to just like give stuff away for free at a certain point or like be like hey we're gonna like I don't know give away like a certain amount of these things and like we're not gonna think about like the the cost of it to our company you know what I mean it's like I think about like how much we make on a module and it's like I don't know like 150 percent of the the like actual cost it is to make it and it's kind of ridiculous and so I think just like really being invested and being like oh no we're actually just going to give this away for free or like you know what I mean it's like that's kind of it you know workshops making it accessible inviting people and I think like you say it's hard and I think that might be true but I think you know you can just go on the internet and also just look at people and directly reach out to people and be like, hey, do you want to try this thing out? Do you want us to send you one? Or is there somewhere we can set you up to go and play with this thing? You have to be active. I feel like at this point there's also lists that are around of women in electronic music and websites dedicated to that. I think a Google search. I mean, this is within North America, of course, I don't know how it is here. Female Pressure, exactly. Female Pressure has a list of over 100 women artists in the electronic music scene. Flip through, send an email, be like, hey, what's up? Yeah, I think all of us are really open to working with... I would love to be hit up by more companies to try their things. Yeah, definitely. You know what I mean? That's awesome. I don't think anyone would say no to that, you know? Yeah. I think it's also a part of it. It's like, I think definitely what they've said so far is it giving people things and letting them do what they want to do with those tools is how you have to go. You can't give someone... a synth and be like, all right, you can get this if you do six workshops that are full of 50 women in every single workshop. Like, no, that's not how it works. Like this takes time. You have to invest in people's actual lives and careers. But I think a really big part of making, especially like production tools, not just something like, you know, something a little more complicated, I guess. is kind of like undoing the way or trying to undo the way that a professional or someone formally educated or an engineer would be thinking about these tools and thinking about music and how to use them and what the importance of an impact is of them. I just like feel like for myself personally, not having any formal education in music or otherwise. I approach music so much differently from people who are engineers or who have gone to a music school or even gone to college for psychology. It's just different for me. you know I know that my approach is just as valid as anyone who has like the technical know-how that they've gotten from whatever access you know what I mean and I think just like valuing what everyone brings in like a real way it's a big part of it and like not approaching people like you're trying to like save them or teach them But like that you want to learn from. It's like a genuine, it should be a genuine experience. Like, hi, I think you're good. Please try this product. I think it will only help you be better or like do weirder things, you know? Right. Thank you. Good question. Okay. I think we have to wrap up now. Time is up. Okay. Do you maybe just want to share one? Like inspiration for other people who want to maybe start a collective, something? I'd say meet people where they're at. And by that I mean like, kind of like speaking to this... Can you meet me halfway? Right. If you've really invested in someone, invested in an artist, invested in a friend or whatever, it's like you got to be willing to like meet them where they're at, like with the resources they have, with the knowledge that they have and like take that seriously and like honor it for what it is. Because if you know, it's like people do as much as they can with what they have. That's real. Yeah, definitely. I would love to piggyback off that, you know, because like Haram, I don't have any musical training whatsoever at all. I can listen to music, can make music. I say you make magic. Thank you. You know, it's like, I remember when I first started trying to collab with other people and I didn't have the language to talk about music in a professional way. Then I realized that people would then talk down to me because I wasn't using the correct language that one is supposed to use in a production studio. You know? But it's like, if you can make the same product without the same language or without the same experience, then like, what... like how valuable is that language other than to prove that, oh hey, we both know this thing, you know? So I think getting rid of all of these preconceived notions of how music can be made and how it should be made needs to be completely removed because it just eliminates so many people and isolates them and maybe doesn't make them want to. go forward. Yeah, totally. You know, so definitely meet someone halfway and, you know, give them the resources that you're giving, that you have too, you know. You didn't wake up out the womb, like, knowing how to use a doll, so don't treat... Don't act like that's how it works. Student definitely popped out the womb. Student came out the womb knowing how to use a doll. People can. They gave it to me. That was your twin. Student was born with modular synthesizers, but not all of us are so lucky. Yeah, I had two things to share. One thing that's a little more specific and technical on the topic of doing collections. collective organizing and working with people in collectives, I think it's really important to identify real goals you have. So it's like the goal is to promote all of us and make the music industry better. But also you need to identify specific goals you have, things that you can accomplish and like undoubtedly be like we did that. And your actions needs to be leading up to those, but also consistent with your bigger, you know, transformative goals. And then on a kind of more general tip, yeah, I think people, like if you are approaching this kind of work, which I think I encourage everyone to do, whether you're someone who feels like you could benefit from having more access or if you feel like you're someone who has a lot of access and you should share, I think everyone should. engage with kind of working and whether or not you're in a collective or not you should be sharing what you have access to or asking what for what you need just stay away from being a savior and thinking that you're gonna like change everything and fix the music industry because you know what I mean it's just like you're not going to see those things happen and Like I said, you can only save yourself at the end of the day. You're not going to be like the hero. So if that's where your mind is, that's your motivation. Well, that shouldn't be your goal, you know? Yeah. Your version of saving is not the same as someone else. Right. Yeah, I mean, I just think there's like a lot of people who are interested in this idea of like operating collectively. So I think I'm just, what I'm trying to say is like. be true to what you're saying you're trying to do. Don't just like have a crew and run with them and then abandon them when you get an individual opportunity, you know. Thank you.
