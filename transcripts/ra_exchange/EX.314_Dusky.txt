Thank you. We're in the air Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Dusky. Within five years, Nick Harriman and Alfie Granger-Howell have grown from music hobbyists into to one of the most popular acts in club music. Their break came when Swamp81's Loafer played a track off their first release on his Rinse FM show. But nowadays, they're on a major label and collaborating with the likes of Wiley and Gary Newman. And in conversation with R.A.'s Carlos Hawthorne, the duo describe the challenges and processes behind their highly anticipated second album, Outer. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Dusky is up next. So yeah, we're sitting here and the album announcement literally came out today. How does it feel to have the news finally out there? It might be in full. Yeah, it feels good. Yeah, relief. Yeah. It's just good to have a point where it's like, okay, now we can't make any more changes, you know? It's like, okay, it's done now. It's starting to, you know, obviously only a couple of singles are out there at this point, but it's, you know, yeah, it's done and dusted, so it is quite a nice feeling. When did the process like, what was the kind of first day, how far back does it go? There's actually one track on there that probably the idea actually formed. like years and years ago around when we were doing our first album so probably about five years ago really like it's completely changed since but yeah I mean since then we have just been sort of setting aside ideas that we feel are appropriate to album compared to just you know EPs um so yeah it's been a it's been a long while well it's just been an idea that's like been germinating for for a long time something you've had kind of in the back of your mind That's an objective. Yeah, I mean, I think the actual, you know, from the point where we decided we're going to do an album up to now has been about two years. But the way we work is we have lots of different ideas on the go at the same time. So we'll start an idea and we'll think, oh, actually, I've got that little part from this track, you know, however old it is, might be five years old, might be a couple of months old. And then we kind of mix and match So the album kind of process proper was two years, but some of the ideas and bits and bobs have been evolving over a long period of time. I mean, how do you reflect back over the whole process? It's been some kind of difficult points, but I think in general it's been enjoyable. Yeah, it's nice to be able to write music which isn't strictly for the club. which is obviously kind of what most dance music producers, that's kind of part of the reason why they do albums, because you can express yourself in a slightly different format. But there were difficulties with, you know, working, partnering with a major label, which we've never done before, and everything that's involved with that in terms of A&R. Which, you know, I think we were kind of putting pressure on ourselves rather than putting pressure on us. They were quite hands-off about the whole thing and let us do what we want. But you have that feeling in the back of your mind where they just, you know... they're kind of notorious for just being like oh actually you know we'll just bin your album we own all the music so that's kind of niggling in your mind in the process like oh you know I don't want to put all this work into this music that someone else owns and then um and then they just chuck it in the bin kind of thing because up until now we've always owned everything we've done I mean, was it an easy decision to partner with the major? No, well, it wasn't an easy decision, no. I think, like, I mean, there were, like, things in the contract that we had that the music would eventually revert back to us if they didn't, you know, if they didn't release it after a certain amount of time. So we kind of had that as a get-out-of-jail-free thing. But it was still a tricky decision, you know, because there's still the risk you can, you know, lose a lot of creative control. You know, so it's something we didn't take lightly. But so far it's worked out well. As you know, as Nick says, you know, we kept all the creative control. really get in our way so yeah seems all right so i mean what was the vision for the album when you go sometimes when we're writing music we try not to think too much about you know like how it's going to be received and even how it you know how it might work with other bits of music that we've done So there wasn't really a kind of a concept from the very beginning. It kind of concept became clearer and clearer as we went on. But essentially, it's just kind of a representation of kind of sounds that we're interested in at the moment, kind of things that relate to the dusky stuff that's come before, but also incorporating some other different. kind of inspirations, different influences from different genres. I mean, yeah, it's always been quite a loose concept, really. But you were keen for it not to just be an album of club tracks? Yeah, absolutely. I think, I mean, all the tracks are like, well, with the exception is one kind of beatless one, but I think everything else does have elements of kind of being for a dance floor. You can work on a dance floor, but yeah, we wanted it to be. something that would work equally well on the dance floor but also just listening at home kind of thing you know and that's basically I think what all the tracks have in common from our point of view. Did it feel like? Did that feel challenging? Because I've heard the album and some of them are kind of songs rather than your kind of classic club tracks. I mean, did that feel like something you'd never really done before? Yeah, it was definitely a new thing. How we've worked in the past with vocals has always just been much more sample-based. So it was definitely a big learning curve getting vocalists into the studio and the whole process of writing. you know, trying not to fall into the kind of standard songwriting cliches, but it's pretty much impossible because everything's a cliche now. You just have to make a decision, like, do you like it or not? And kind of let it stew for a while. And if you think, like, yeah, actually, this is all right, you just have to put it out there and see how people react. Like, you can't overthink it too much. You just got to... do what you're happy with and then put it out there and that's it. So, but, you know, trying to get to that point where the vocals, we had the vocals on there that we were actually happy with took quite a while. Yeah. A lot of like kind of. discussions about just nuances of syllables and just stuff that you just pedantics which are really just unnecessary but I suppose it helped us get through the process a bit part of the challenge of working with vocalists must be that you know you're working with an artist who you know isn't there an artist in their own right and they're doing their own thing but you're also trying to bring them into kind of your project and ultimately it is your work. So the kind of push and pull of that must be... Yeah, I think we were quite careful about who we chose to work with. So we had faith in the people that we decided to work with that they were going to do something we would like. So we didn't try and force them to do a certain thing. We went through plenty of demos with people that we thought would work and they just didn't end up working. We didn't go back to them and say, oh, we want you to do it like this. We were just like, if it's not working naturally, it's not working. So the people that we did end up having on the album was quite a natural process. We were happy for them to do their thing and we didn't have to make that many changes at all to what they had written. apart from getting in there and trying to make it as best as we could with them on their terms. It wasn't us saying we want it to be a certain way. And were there collaborative processes in terms of they were in the studio with you, it was face-to-face? It was a bit of a variety of... The Gary Newman thing was done remotely because he lives in LA. And then Solomon Gray, they were in the studio. Pedestrian was in the studio. Wiley wasn't in the studio. I think it's quite hard to get into the studio. He lives in Cyprus, so that was just all done remotely as well. How did that one come about? We had the idea. We'd made the track and we were playing it out just as an instrumental. And I don't know, we got talking, I think, with some of the management stuff and just thinking about how it kind of... fit into that world of like sort of warehouse techno but didn't have a very like kind of strong grime influence and I can't remember who had the idea of like getting an MC on it but I mean I think really like Wiley was like who we wanted really I think like we kind of didn't really have a sort of um a backup really because it just felt like um I don't know if I don't know it just felt right to have him as such an innovator at the scene. But to be honest, we weren't really sure if he was going to be up for it or not. We were quite surprised, very pleasantly surprised he was up for it. I think the link as well with Wiley is just from the whole jungle side of things because even though it's a techno track, a lot of the pad sounds and everything. percussion is very much referenced from Jungle and that's how Wiley started and that was the kind of you know what Grime developed out of so it just made sense for him to you know if we were going to get an MC on it it had to be Wiley and luckily it worked out I think if it had been anyone else we wouldn't have done it I mean one thing that stands out about it is that you know he says some really interesting things in the lyrics He could have just done a kind of wearing my Rolex thing, which is just like, you know, really good, but just like kind of empty lyrics and like club lyrics or whatever, where he's actually gone and said some really just like important things about grime and how he feels about the scene and stuff. Yeah, exactly. I mean, it fits with... track it could very easily as you're saying could very easily have kind of been a bit of a shit show but you know if it had been we wouldn't have put it out so but we think there is merit to it it's quite an interesting tune and what he's saying is you know works you know it's interesting to hear so you mentioned that in the press release i mean autos mentors and exploration of many sounds moods and influences I wonder if you could just touch on a few of the records that kind of inspired this. I guess a lot of it, a lot of the tracks are quite inspired by Belgian techno sound, basically. It's a lot of the classic electronic acts, or electronica acts, as they sort of got lumped into from the 90s, like Orbital, particularly. I think Ingrid is a hybrid single, Orbital, a big influence on that. I don't know, acts that kind of like to push boundaries a bit, I think quite influenced by the first Moderat album. It's quite a big influence. The use of vocals on that and kind of different textures. Future Sound of London as well even though they kind of sounds much more experimental but the way they kind of bring a lot of different worlds together and make it sound really cohesive when you listen to their albums it's definitely something that's kind of to aspire to If you can achieve it, then it would be great. I mean, because it's kind of dusky as you've never seen them before, I mean, how are you feeling about the reaction about that day that the record finally launches? I feel fine about it. It just is what it is. You know, once it's out there, there's nothing you can do about it. I think I'm quite happy with it. I think it's solid. It was fun making it and hopefully people will get some enjoyment out of it There's nothing else to really worry about. Did you create the live show, I mean, did you create the kind of album first and then think about the live show or did they kind of happen at the same time? It was very much album first and then struggle to make it into a live show afterwards, yeah. I think if you set out writing music with those restrictions of how it's going to work in a live setting, then I don't think it would work for us in the way that we work. I think maybe if you have a whole fully hardware studio and then you're planning to, it's a very jam-based, tracky music. And you can just kind of transfer that into a club situation and that makes sense. But the way our songs are arranged and stuff. You know, you want it to work as a song primarily or as a track and then think about how it would work in a live setting afterwards or how you would recreate it. I think that's generally the way most electronic artists work in terms of live stuff. Obviously, if you're in a band, it's completely opposite. You know, you're just practicing and practicing on your instrument and, you know, through rehearsing together, that's how you build your songs and it's kind of much... more of a you know much more of a thing in that sense but it's quite two quite separate things for us in terms of the creative process. What does the live show look like? What are you guys doing up there? Basically, it's all running off Ableton on one computer, so most of it's running off Ableton. And then we have another laptop running main stage, which has all the patches on it. Alfie's playing piano. and has like a MPD sampler. And then on my side is some of the Aria gear, the Roland stuff, TB3, TR8, another sampler, controllers for Ableton, and then some Strymon guitar pedals for effects. And that's essentially it. It sounds quite a simple setup, but once you actually try and get it to work... It gets a bit more complicated. There's a lot of variables. Yeah, a lot of variables. But I think it's something that's new to us and is exciting and interesting to do. In terms of... I mean, you've only done... for you so far but in terms of how you guys feel up there on the stage how does it compare to DJing? Just bricking it basically. I really enjoy it I think but then in a way I feel like maybe I've got the easy side of it because I grew up playing keyboards and because of that I think a lot of the time when those have laid down quite obvious keyboard parts in some tracks that A lot of time I played in, so there's a piano track of ours called Yoo-Hoo, and I just sort of can just play that live. Obviously I've had to kind of get my fingers back up to scratch to what they were when I was kind of growing up playing piano, but it's funny because I thought I'll maybe kind of switch it up quite a lot and sort of do a lot more kind of improvising. you know, changing the keys parts. But actually, I think kind of just sometimes doing that in rehearsals didn't quite feel right. And I think people are going to want to hear the original parts of it. It's something so obvious, like a, you know, piano part. But yeah, I think in that sense, for me, it's kind of like I've been really enjoying it because it's sort of, I don't know, I can just sort of get to enjoy the actual performance and doing it sort of, it's just very different to DJing. There's a lot less time, I imagine, to... Yeah, decision-making, that's the thing, because I started out DJing first before I got into production, and Alfie was the opposite. So for me, I quite like just, you know, making decisions on the fly about DJing and what we're going to play, whereas a live show is very much like you have your thing to do and you have to do it correctly at the right times. and kind of memorise it and just keep doing it over and over again. So it's very, very different to what I've done in the past. So I think it's going to grow on me, but it's definitely been quite a challenge. So is it the kind of same show every time or is it improvised? No, it's pretty much the same show because... We have video and lighting stuff that goes along with it. So we did think, you know, we'll probably try and incorporate some sections into it where we can jam a bit. in future but so far we've only had an hour you know to present it at festivals and um we've got quite a lot of music that we want to fit into that from the new album and some of the older tracks from us that people will want to hear so it doesn't really allow for you know just to kind of us to noodle about on drum machine for half an hour even though that would be fun so is the plan to kind of do a massive live tour of the album I don't know about massive but we're definitely going to be touring the album doing live shows yeah but just in terms of like DJing is going to kind of take no not at all I think DJing is our bread and butter really The live show is just a way for us to present the album in a different way than we've done before. And it's something new for us to experiment with and try and see how we get on with it. I think DJing... always going to be there that's you know we enjoy that as equally as much so going back to the album you alpha you contributed vocals to a track called marble um is that something you've done before i have done it once before in the past on our first album actually We'll stick by this, which kind of went a little bit under the radar because it was the first thing we ever did as Dusky. But yeah, still quite a new thing for me, singing. And it did involve a lot of studio tweaking. I have to admit, I'm not like a trained singer. So I didn't, it's definitely, I'm not a one take wonder. Yeah, it's fun to, it's definitely felt right to sort of have a go. Just laid it down as a demo at first, not necessarily thinking that it was going to be me singing on the final version, but it seemed to have worked out. Yes, I mean, you've got this album, which is kind of moving away from the kind of, you know, just more club-focused EPs and stuff you've been doing. You've got this new live show. I mean, is the idea. to still be balancing bigger shows with smaller club gigs and still to be doing both. Yeah, definitely. It's nice to have a bit of variety in your work, isn't it? Sometimes it's fun to play on a big festival stage and other times you just hate it and you just want to go and play in a dark club to 100 people. and, you know, do extended sets. I think if you just do one thing, we're not, you know, we're not going to turn our back on that at all. We enjoy it. It's like what we've grown up on, what we love. So obviously, you know, if the album is a success and there's more demand for a live show, then, you know, we'll do as much as we can, but we're definitely not going to turn our back on DJing at all. Is it important for you guys to always be pushing yourself and trying new things and taking on projects and challenging yourselves? Yeah, I mean, if you didn't, then you would just get bored, wouldn't you? You know, you could easily just stay DJing and be doing really well and release great EPs. Yeah, I mean, I think on the DJing side, I sort of see that as quite different in a way to... to what it's like in the studio. I think by definition, DJing, you know, you're always playing new music all the time, so there's always difference, you know, because, like, you know, like, from week to week, you know, you get sent different tunes, so you're playing a totally different set. Whereas in the studio, you know, that's when it becomes... I think both of us just get bored quite quickly, so that's why we kind of like to try out different production techniques and use different bits of... software and things like that so things on the production side that yeah that more applies that kind of probably gonna keep trying new things and wanting to do that because i think yeah as nick says you just just get bored otherwise you mentioned the first album there um it's interesting that yeah that was the first record you released um which is not kind of not often doesn't often happen um how do you feel about that album No. Yeah, I haven't actually listened to it in full for a little while. I mean, yeah, I still look back on it and I'm pleased with it. I think like we took a similar approach in terms of it kind of wanting it to, most of it to work well on a dance floor, but also, you know, be as much of a kind of listening experience as much as a dance floor record. but yeah there's definitely some good moments there I mean yeah again it's kind of it's definitely a lot more varied stylistically than the kind of everything we've done since then up to this album you know I kind of EPs there were some different tempos there and things like that but yeah I mean I should just go and listen to it again actually yeah I tried really not to listen to stuff that we've made really after it's done I kind of put it to one side unless you have to play it in DJ sets but you know it kind of it feels like of that moment when you're making it and then that's the enjoyment for me is that you're process of making the music i don't really want to go back and listen to it and kind of you know pick holes in it about you know oh i'm you know i'm pleased with that or why the hell do we do that you just beat yourself up about it it's better just is what it is leave it and just work on something new yeah i suppose with the club tracks as well you listen to them enough kind of in their own environment You know, because it was interesting that I interviewed Lone and he said that he really enjoys listening to his own music, you know, because he's like, I make this music for myself kind of first and foremost, almost. And, you know, no one kind of likes it more than me. So, which is interesting because you never really hear artists say that. It's either like... It's either they hate it or they're so sick of it because they've had it in their heads for so long. You do have that when you're in the process of making a track, you know, as it's coming towards the end and you'll listen to it over and over again in headphones or you listen to it in different places, partly because you're really enthused about it and you're excited about the music and then partly because you're working on the mix and stuff and you're trying to gauge how it's going But that's the time when I listen to it the most. It's in the process of making it afterwards. I don't really tend to listen to it. Personally as well, sometimes I'll start an idea and I'll just kind of be, I don't know, we're not working to a deadline or anything. Recently we have been with the album. But when I haven't been, sometimes there'll be times where I just sit down and try and write something on a total blank canvas. And actually it ends up going in a direction that actually is just for my own listening, really. I sort of think there's a certain point where, well, actually this doesn't really, you know, I don't know if other people are going to kind of appreciate this, but, you know, I'll follow it through. So there are times when I do just, it is a purely, you know, making it purely from, I don't know, my own enjoyment kind of thing. Is that your secret drill core alias that no one knows about? Yeah. So will you guys work on ideas separately? Yeah, we do. So more now because we're travelling a lot. So we'll just start ideas on our laptops kind of thing. And then when we get back from tour, we'll just share the ideas in the studio and say, you know, this is good, this is bad, and then try and build stuff out like that. But when we were first starting out, we weren't gigging as much. We would sit in the studio together and work on ideas like that. And now in our studio, we've got a booth and a kind of While one of us is working on the track in the main room, the other one can be in the other room jamming on ideas or going through promos and stuff like that. So you had to get a bit more efficient about the way we work rather than just both of us sitting around all day just noodling. But that is fun as well. We do that from time to time, but we don't get as much time to do that anymore. How has the way you work together changed since that first album to the new one? I think probably because I'm from more of a production background, an engineer background, Alfie's more from a musical composition background. During the first album, those kind of roles were much more distinct. But as we worked together more, we started to learn more off each other. So those roles are starting to become more intertwined. And I guess that's probably the biggest difference, apart from the way that we start the ideas separately. That's been the main thing that's changed in the process, I think. I imagine the kind of feedback... process between you two is really important and that's kind of constantly happening yeah exactly I mean you can't be precious about these things I mean that's like you know if I play an idea to Alfie and he says it's crap I don't really care I'll just start something else you know what I mean you can't be too you know you can't be too precious about these kind of things and equally you know you know we value each other's feedback and it helps the creative process you know sometimes if you're just trying to build something by yourself it's really difficult to see it through so you know just want to bounce this off someone who has actually his opinion trust so like lucky to be in a position where we can work like that because i know some other people who work by themselves and they're constantly kind of beating themselves up about you know their ideas and even though they're brilliant but they just need someone to tell them that they're brilliant and then they're like oh oh yeah okay actually yeah maybe this is all right yeah yeah i mean you know from the way i work like just a tiny little confidence boost or just you know what wonders yeah exactly or there's something we know when you listen to something over and over again for like maybe for weeks or months and you just start to lose sight of something which you know is integral to the track and that's the important thing that you need to change you lose sight of it and we need someone to come in and be like oh won't you just take that out it's kind of you know or just stick one of these things stick something in and then And then you're just like, oh, right, realisation. And then the whole rest of the track just flows out. How long have you guys been working together? Well, as Solarity first and then... Yeah, since school, really. We met at Sixth Form College in Camden. So what year was that? That was like 2001, I think. Yeah, when we met we were kind of both just starting to get into production and going out raving and stuff. So it was just a kind of shared interest in music and enjoyment of going out raving. and DJing. And it was built from there, really. It was just much more of just working together for fun and then it slowly, slowly started to develop into a full-time working relationship. But first and foremost, we're just mates from school. Yeah, I mean, so that'll make it kind of 15 year anniversary this year. Yeah, it's crazy. Are you going to celebrate at all? Have a romantic dinner. We do have quite a lot of kind of like mandates while we're away on tour. So I think we've got that covered. I don't think we need to do any more. I mean, what is the secret to it? You know, because you are a duo and, you know, people will say don't work with your mates and make a I mean, what is... How do you make it work so well? I think you just don't really see it as business. I mean, it's just a hobby which we're both into. That's the basis for it. You know, we're just mates and we have the same interests. So we just literally just get to do our hobby full time. And I think that's why it works. Yeah. I mean, I think there's a gradual process as well because... It was a long time, you know, up from, you know, when we met, it was a long time until we actually released music properly on, like, a record label. And then, and even from that, it was a while before we were like, OK, let's try and, like, do this properly as a career, you know, and a thing. And so we had a bit of time then to kind of, you know, we'd do some shows together and then, like, a little bit of touring And I think through that, I kind of just learnt how to, like, what, I don't know, learnt what riles each other up and things like that, you know, and, like, how not to push each other's buttons kind of things like that. So I think how we've just been, like, thrown in there, I think, and if everything had kicked off quite quickly, then, I don't know, we might just be... might just hate each other by now but I think because it's quite a gradual you know process I think yeah so you still get on alright yeah that's it you know we're not away on tour you know if you've got a weekend off we'll still meet up and go to the pub do you know what I mean it's not like right see you later, you know, see you in a couple of weeks, you know, Heathrow kind of thing. I think that would be quite weird if you're in that kind of working relationship. I mean, at least, you know, compared to the way that we work, I think I would find that quite strange. Do you think it's also important to have separate lives? Yeah, well, we've got all the same mates. I mean, you know, we grew up in London. We still live here. My brother lives around the corner, my sister lives around the corner. All my friends live in the same area. So maybe it's important to have separate lives, but our lives are pretty intertwined in terms of our friendship group. But it's not a problem. It's fine. So, Camden Town 2001. I mean, what were the raves? that you were going to? What was going on in the club scene back then? You were going to Bagley's quite a lot, to stuff like United Dance, One Nation, big drum and bass raves, and then garage stuff at Turnmills. I used to live up by Alley Pally in Muscle Hill, so they used to do big raves there, like Sidewinder. One Nation again. So we used to break into Alley Pally through the toilet window and go to the big raves up there. So that was one of my weekend pastimes, breaking into Alley Pally to go raving. Mostly German bass ones, I think, but occasional hardcore ones as well. Something like old school, like Rain Dance and things like that would be old school hardcore. But there'd be proper 180 BPM hardcore ones. Was it Elation? Yeah, Future Dance, stuff like that. Future Dance, yeah. It was all a mix of stuff. There was so much good stuff going on, you know, that we were kind of cutting our teeth in terms of finding out what we were really interested in. So, you know, that's what's great about living in London. You can go to all these different clubs and see all this amazing music. You know, you can go to a different style rave every night of the week if you want. And at the time, Bagley's as well, you know, it wasn't just drum and bass for him. It would be drum and bass room, then like a jungle room, then old school hardcore room, and then downstairs would be garage. So there's always a bit of variety, even within like one rave, but you don't seem to have those clubs anymore in London, like kind of four or five room sprawling club where you can have, you know, so many different things going on. Now it's much more concentrated in places like Fabric, where obviously they have to keep the music policy a certain way to make it work. You don't have that freedom that they used to have or seem to used to have. Maybe I'm just out of the loop and I don't know where the good spots are, but it definitely feels quite different in that sense. really go to raves which have that you know psy trance room then like a chill out room then like a acid techno room and then you know drum and bass and stuff it doesn't That's more of a festival thing now. So you guys were, so you were both DJing when you met? Yeah. And you were kind of DJs on the house party circuit? Yeah, exactly. Around Kentish Town. And from there you just started making tracks together and just kind of grew from there? Yeah, I started out kind of making like really kind of shit hip-hop tunes on Fruity Loops. Because when I first got into DJing, I was speaking to hip-hop and those are the first records I bought, stuff like Executioners or the Turntablist style stuff, like Pete Rock and CL Smooth. So I was really interested in that and I wanted to make hip-hop kind of thing. And then as I started going out raving, I was just like, I want to make some dance music. I'm not that interested in making hip-hop anymore. I was enjoying going raving so much. then getting into DJing drum and bass and stuff more. So yeah, that's how it developed really. So how did you get from that point to making the kind of proggy house of Solarity? That was kind of... I was at uni studying music production in Brighton and then Alfie came down. We used to kind of meet up and make tunes at the time we were making kind of breakbeat and garage and drum and bass, just whatever. It was all just for fun kind of thing. And he played me this tune, Eric Prid's 1984, 1983 Remix, Paolo Mojo thing. And I'd never really been interested in house music. I was like, everything's got to have like a break beat or it's got to be two-step or whatever. I wasn't really that into kind of 4-4 stuff at that point. But then I just thought, yeah, this sounds really fresh and interesting and I'm up for giving it a go. It sounds like it'd be fun to try and make. And then we were just doing it for fun. There wasn't really a scene for it at all, especially or like people in Russia playing like Total Wipeout or something. I don't know. There definitely wasn't a kind of scene like there is for house music now in London. I mean, people weren't really interested in that style of like quite deep progressive house at that point. It just wasn't a thing. So we were just writing it, but not really playing that many shows. It was just purely for fun. And then eventually one of the tracks got picked up by Anjuna Deep, which is how that whole relationship kind of grew. And then that went on to be the first, and after that was the first Dusky album. So you guys were kind of collaborating together, even though you're in kind of separate cities and separate universities. Yeah, because I was doing big house parties down in Brighton. Yeah. So people would come down, my mates would come down from London to come to the parties because we had a whole house and we could do whatever we wanted for the first time. It's like you're not trashing your parents' house. You can rent a proper sound system, put it in the basement of a house. and piss off the neighbours and you can just get away with it. It was great. But also we were both studying music at the time, so it made sense to just on the weekends to come and... Because I remember as well trying out... You could use the facilities in the studios on the weekends and stuff, and over the summer when no one would be there, I remember coming into the downstairs basement studio where I was. and using all our gear. But back then, a lot of it was just kind of, it was just a sense of just, like, doing it, messing around for fun. There was never any plan. There was never any kind of, like, feeling of, oh, let's finish this track so we can, like, release it, put it on a record label or anything like that. It was just totally just like, oh, do you want to come and hang out? You know, we can just, whatever. There was kind of no one, no influences, no people in your life where that was happening to them, they were releasing music. It just didn't seem like a kind of progression. Not really, I'm trying to think. I feel like today, because of the internet, it's just like... it's just more known you know it's like there's like there are steps you go up and like soundcloud x amount of plays but then maybe you're just messing around and one day like someone sends you an email being like i like this or yeah exactly i think that was kind of i think they heard it i think the anjuna deep people heard it through some kind of I don't know, Russian, like, podcast or something, I don't know. But then we just got a call from James Grant, who runs Anjuna Deep, and was like, oh, this track's really cool, we want to put it out. So that's, yeah, it wasn't, we didn't really know that many people who were putting out music. At the time, so. I'm a bit hazy about what the internet was like in those times. I mean, obviously it wasn't as advanced as it is now, but... It was really slow, dial-up. No, it wasn't that bad. But it was like MySpace era kind of thing. Early MySpace era, I suppose. That's when we first started releasing stuff. Yeah. Probably before then. There was music going back and forth on, like, LimeWire and Napster and stuff, but there wasn't... And there were some forums and stuff, but I didn't really go on them. It was, like, big drama-based forums. Yeah, it wasn't, like... No-one bought music online. It was all still vinyl kind of thing. We were still buying records, going to the record shops every Thursday around Camden to, like, know-how and places like that. Yeah, it wasn't the same. Like the kind of whole beat port culture didn't exist at all. I mean, knowing what you know now about the internet and just everything that comes with it, do you feel like it was an advantage kind of having it in its early stages then? Yeah, I mean, in terms of learning how to DJ, I think it definitely helped learning vinyl. you know, and also valuing music in the sense of, you know, you've only got a certain amount of money to spend on records and you go there and you sit there for two or three hours and you come out with two records rather than just being like, oh yeah, you know, I don't really like that but I'll just buy it because it's only 50p or whatever and you just get a load of crap and then you listen to it afterwards and you're just like, why did I just buy all these tunes and just bought two tracks and you'd keep playing them for six months rather than just something you're going to play for a week and then discard it. So from that perspective, it's definitely a positive thing when it was just more about just record shopping and not so... it's quite difficult to find music online I find it quite hard it's just too much there when it was just you know you trust the guy behind the counter at a record shop and you come in he'll know what you're interested in listening to and it's yeah it was just much easier and more enjoyable from my perspective I mean obviously now you must buy a lot of music online obviously you get sent a lot I mean what are your filters for kind of finding the good stuff the best stuff tends to come from people that we know now and we just have they just we just get it sent it direct on emails you know and someone's like I'll just finish this thing and send it over and then so that I don't know that just tends to be the stuff that gets most excited you know and then yeah just through the kind of promo systems but yeah just still trawl a lot through like through beatport and juno and they're all sorts really just kind of um i think you you have to dig deep and it takes a long time you kind of have to find the like diamonds in the rough so it's a very time-consuming process especially on beatport there's just so much so much crap out there you have to sift through But there is stuff there and that feeling as well when you find a track that you feel like it's gone under the radar a bit. Because you can see on the internet, you Google it and you realise, no one's been playing this, why not? This is a great track. It's an amazing feeling finding that and then playing it out and getting a good reaction. It's pretty good. Yeah, and there's also certain labels that you can trust and artists that you'll look for. If you're looking on Beatport, I'll just have my saved labels and I'll just check those and generally don't really look at anything else, if I'm honest. But yeah, a lot of stuff through promo. Do you ever go back for your own record collection and rip old vinyl? and play them? Most of it's drum and bass and garage so we don't really actually play that much. I can't remember the last time I played a drum and bass set and also we're playing less and less kind of garagey sounding stuff. over the past couple of years so if we do rip stuff it will normally be new tracks that we've bought from the record shop which you can't get digitally kind of thing and we'll rip those and then just play them digitally because we don't travel around with vinyl it's just too much of a ball ache. Do you feel like learning to DJ drum and bass? I think what it taught me a lot about was just learning your records and taking time to understand. how the tracks are arranged and, you know, knowing where you want to mix it kind of thing and taking time to do that. Because if, you know, with drum and bass, if you mix a tune at the wrong point, then it can sound really, really bad, you know, and you need to test a lot of tunes out because the beats can be so hectic that some stuff just won't work together. It will just sound too messy. So stuff like that, you know. from that perspective learning your tunes and taking time to really understand the tracks that you've bought helps in that sense but you know the quick mixing style I don't really do that anymore but it's not really suited to the way we play or the music that we play now but it's just another kind of string to your bow isn't it I don't know play drum and bass for so long probably struggle a little bit now have to go back and have a practice a bit I mean do you feel like it's more difficult DJ drum and bass there's definitely some clangers definitely more more more chance of clangers but I wouldn't say it's more difficult you just have to practice I mean maybe it's a case of like You know, I remember there's always a story of Pele used to do kick-ups with, like, a melon. So when it comes to football, you know, you're like... I always say his feet are more delicate, yeah. Well, I think for learning to mix, more than it being drum and bass, was learning on belt drive, sound labs. where nothing stays in time kind of thing. So that learning how to kind of keep two tracks in time for a decent amount of time on belt drive turntables definitely helps with your beat matching. But that's not really what it's all about. It's more about your tune selection, the time you spend looking for music. So in 2011, you put out Stick By This, which is your debut album as Dusky. I mean, what kind of led to it? the decision to stop being Solarity and switch over to something new. It was about halfway through the process of making that album. I think we stopped and looked at the music that we had and we were working with doing it on Ange and Deep and it was them that pointed out at the time, you know, suggested us doing an alias because it was quite different to all the previous stuff we'd done. But it was just quite a sort of snap decision at the time. We were just kind of like, oh yeah, probably, yeah, maybe we should. But I mean, we did take quite a while. I remember trying to choose a name and work out a logo, things like that. We did deliberate over a lot. Yeah, I don't know, it just kind of made sense really. I think the sound at the time had become so... removed from the celerity stuff it just just made sense so was a reflection of your tastes changing yeah taste but also just like you know I was saying before about wanting to try different production techniques you know I think that That's something, you know, we were starting to just change the way we were making music, you know. So all sorts of different changes, like the way the beats were made, more of a kind of old sort of sampled kind of feel of kind of older house tracks, things like that. So yeah, lots of changes, you know, going from that stuff to the first Solarity tracks we're doing. We're like, hold on, this is, yeah, totally different. And once the album was done, that kind of felt like, you know, this is a new chapter, we're leaving that old stuff behind. Yeah, yeah, definitely. You know, after that album got kind of picked up on BBC a bit and people were playing it, and then we started to get gigs. Before, with the Solarity stuff, we were just kind of putting it out and not really playing out very much. It was just a kind of labour of love in a way. There was no way we were ever going to make a living out of it kind of thing. So after that album kind of got some momentum, we started getting some bookings and we were like, you know, we should pursue this because it's fun. And it sort of kind of developed from there. After the album, we had a couple of tracks. One on Dogmatic, on Alex Arnout's label, Taito Alba, and that was getting played quite a lot by Jamie Jones and that kind of crew of people who previously might not have been interested in the first album because that was more of the kind of buffer between what was Solarity and then what became Dusky. And then after that album, it was more just, all right, let's just focus on making some club tracks. we're getting these bookings now, we need some music to play. And yeah, so we just kind of got on that tip of just making club EPs and the momentum just kind of started to build from there. What kind of shows were you playing just in the UK? Yeah, mostly UK, like student-style gigs. This was at the time it was when dubstep just sort of dropped off the edge of a cliff. and no one knew what was going on. It was kind of post-Dubstep era where people were playing a lot of garage and what's become Future Garage, I suppose. And then stuff started moving more housey after that. So it was around that kind of period. So it was a mix of... parties really some more kind of like i suppose like classic house music promoters and other stuff would be like bass music promoters people who are moving who used to book dubstep but we're now kind of moving on to something new because there wasn't really a demand for it So it was a mix of stuff, but yeah, mostly UK. And was that transition into kind of playing regular shows pretty easy? I mean, you had so much experience DJing before that. Yeah, it was good. It was fun. Yeah, it was like, you know, people were paying us to go to clubs. It was amazing. Drinking for free. It was like, you know, we got a bit overexcited about that at the start for a few gigs, definitely. Yeah, free booze. Get rid of this bottle of vodka. I can't take it on the plane on the way back. Yeah, exactly. Having that kind of luxury for the first time was definitely kind of a bit dangerous for our health. But then after we realised that you don't need to drink your whole rider every time you go to a gig, then it started to get all right. bit yeah definitely definitely um you mentioned dogmatic there and in 2012 you put out a flow jam which is kind of probably when i first heard of you um and i imagine a lot of people the same um does it definitely feel like kind of you can chart like dusky before that and dusky after that it's a kind of major shift I think for our booking, certainly, that's when we started to become actually busy. Yeah, but it felt quite natural to us. I mean, I think probably from the outside, people were like, oh, you know, that's where, you know, that was how they started kind of thing. But for us, it was a very gradual process from, you know, from when we started at school to making music all the way up to the point where we finished the album. and had those Taito Alba and Flo Jam. But I guess it was because I think with Flo Jam, he got picked up by Loafer. He was playing it a lot on his Swamp show on Rinse. And at the time, that was like a real tastemaker show. You know, Loafer was the person that took the punt. on stepping out of dubstep before everyone else and he had a kind of head start, I suppose, in terms of, you know, the music that he was pushing and what he was playing was quite ahead of everyone else. So people would listen to his Swamp Show to see, you know, what's the interesting stuff that's going on. So that was a massive boost for us, you know, having that kind of seal of approval from LOFA definitely helped to take our name out to more people. you know, than we had had before through the Tito Albert release on Dogmatic before. And you mentioned Loafer there, that's kind of one end of the spectrum in terms of who was playing it and then the other end there's like Calvin Harris famously, which is amazing. I doubt he's played a tune like that for the last five years. Yeah, I know, it's strange but, you know, that's kind of part of what we were saying earlier about, you know, what you do once a... Once you put the album out, how do you feel about it? And it's just, you've literally got no control over it. I mean, Calvin Harris might pick it up and start playing it in his sets, in which case everyone's going to be like, oh, I don't like this anymore. It's not cool, whatever. But, you know, you have no control over it. You've just got to put it out there. And, like, Flowjump was one of those ones that just seemed to have It's definitely a boost to our career at the time. You mentioned there that you guys kind of landed, started doing the dusky thing. More seriously, when dubstep was kind of fading away or when it completely dropped away, do you feel like you kind of really hit a kind of sweet spot in terms of timing? Yeah, I think that was just pure luck. There wasn't anything planned at all. It was just the kind of shift, wasn't there, in the kind of musical zeitgeist at the time. It was just like, you know, dubstep had become this bastardised kind of American trashy stuff that, you know, the people that were originally interested in dubstep, especially in London, you know, were pretty much born, no relation to it whatsoever. So, yeah, people just lost interest. And we were just there at the right time. It was pure luck. As an artist, can you get a sense of what it's like to be in the eye of the storm, in terms of something's really taking over? I wasn't really that conscious of it at the time. I think looking back, you think, oh, yeah, actually, this was kind of... There was a lot of stuff popping off, you know. And for us and for other artists who were quite similar to us at the time, like George Fitzgerald and Huxley and Bicep Guys and Midland, Pearson Sound, kind of all the house camp, that was like a real big time for all of us looking back. But at the time, you're just kind of going with the flow and you're not really thinking about it. I mean, I wasn't really thinking about it. I definitely didn't see it as... oh, wow, like, we're in, you know, we're in the middle of this really hype kind of scene or whatever. It just didn't even cross my mind. Now I look back, I think, oh, wow, that was actually quite an amazing time, but never thought about it. But there were no worries that, shit, the bottom could fall out of this as well? I think you always have that kind of thought when you're self-employed in any kind of work, you know, whether it's anything else you know if you're a freelance journalist stuff might dry up you know you have a speciality and you know if people aren't interested in it anymore you have to either adapt or move on to something else so it's a risk but I think we just concentrate on what we're interested in and we enjoy and hopefully that kind of shows through in music and that's all we can do I think for you though overthink it and worry about oh you know the bottom's going to drop out of this and try and change what you're doing just to work to that then that's not a good way to to approach things in terms of the sound that you guys were making then i mean you're incorporating a lot of rave influences and bits of hardcore how are you doing that were you just taking samples from old records you had or It was mostly all just done on synths. A bit later after Flow Jam, there were some tracks that would be actually sampling old drum and bass tracks, like an intern, things like that. Oh yeah, intern, but more just vocal stuff, not pads and bass and everything like that. It's all just done through synthesis, but vocal stuff definitely is sampled out of old tracks, yeah. Because you guys don't really use hardware. No, no, it's all in the box. It was interesting, actually, because we were having a conversation. We met Matthew Herbert the other day on a gig in Dublin, and we were talking about the differences of how we were spoiled growing up in an age where software production... and how he had to start out buying a £3,000 sampler. It was much more difficult to produce or to have the means to produce when he started out. But he mentioned the thing that we were most spoiled with and that was having the recall, so being able to call up any track you want off a digital system which never existed before. And that is a massive part in the way that we work. you know because we'll have maybe 20 ideas going at the same time always be working on something messing about and if you get bored of it we'll just open up another track and it's just all instantly there whereas in the past that was never possible so uh yeah that's uh you know a massive benefit of working in that software world you don't have you know you don't have that issue with having to recall tracks you know lay everything out on a desk and write everything down on paper kind of thing so yeah it just works really well for us and that's what we've grown up on that's what you know that's what we enjoy so we haven't really felt the need to kind of branch out into you know investing in lots of hardware at the moment it's just the way our workflow is on software works fine for us and also we're travelling all the time just being able to start ideas on our laptops and then just plugging it in but then also taking that away again on tour you know we could tweak it in the studio but then take it back on the road with us and then tweak it on the go I think that's really important as well you know with the way we work which we wouldn't be able to do if we yeah used loads of hardware I think hardware From my perspective, if I was going to invest in it, it would purely be from a point of trying to inspire some ideas. Sometimes you are sitting there clicking the mouse and you feel a little bit, oh, I just need to do something else. At the moment, I'll just go out and go for a walk or whatever, but I could see myself buying some hardware and I'll just noodle around on that for a bit and maybe some ideas will start. but I don't think I'm going to reinvent the way we're working and move over to hardware. It's just unnecessary. Alfie, with your more traditional musical upbringing, you mentioned you played piano growing up and stuff, you didn't feel... that that was felt more natural to kind of be actually playing stuff. I don't know, it's weird. I mean, I guess because, as I mentioned before, that I do so much of the stuff playing on the keyboard anyway, so that's quite a tactile thing a lot of the time anyway. So, yeah, I don't really like, like, when we go on tour, sometimes when it's just totally focusing on the... on the laptop and having to use the laptop keys to put in notes. I really hate that way of working. But I guess because half the time my kind of way of working is having one hand on the keyboard anyway and messing about when I'm working out parts that you can play on keyboard, not for drums or anything. But I guess, yeah, perhaps there's less kind of desire or need for me to kind of have that. that that hardware kind of you know tweakable kind of um yeah features and yeah tweaking knobs and stuff like that it's more to do with the sound though as well rather than having some knobs to tweak because if you want you can just buy a MIDI controller and assign everything off the software to that if you really want things like machine essentially you're working with hardware but it's all software based so you can do that if you want you know, what's interesting about hardware is the way it sounds rather than kind of, you know, being able to twiddle some knobs. you
