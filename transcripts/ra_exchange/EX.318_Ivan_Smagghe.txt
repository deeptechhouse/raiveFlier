Thank you. you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Ivan Smag. Fed up with the domination of house and techno, he co-founded the Kill of the DJ club night and label in the early 2000s. He became known for his eclectic mixing style, but in conversation with Orion Keeling, he displays a refreshing ambivalence toward club culture. His take on its boom and bust cycles indicates a broader perspective on music, which is borne out in the details of his fascinatingly varied career. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at resonantadvisor.net. And follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Yvonne Smog is up next. How optimistic are you feeling generally about nightlife in London at the moment? I mean, it's fairly obvious that nightlife in London's had a clamp down. The Danston Hall situation, which is a smaller club in Dawson, was exactly the same. You know, they didn't shut it. What they did is like, okay, no, you know, a license is usually for five years, I think. So they had a late night license and suddenly their license was like kind of normal license. So they had to show it to. And Dan was like, well, if I show it to, I'm not going to make the cut. This model is not sustainable. Yeah, it's not sustainable. So, oh, it's gone. Then you get places like Shapes in Hackney Wick. It's shut because the licence was only temporary. And, you know, they didn't... The problem with London is that it's the city... It's my favourite city in the world by far because of the people, but it's also the city of greed. So you have the land. And the buildings, like in Hackney Wick, I don't know if you've been to Hackney Wick recently, but it's been flattened. It's like Hiroshima, you know. And that was the place for a lot of parties. And it's gone. It's gone. All the warehouses have gone and they're building condos. So we'll see what the mayor position is on that because... Ultimately, there's been also the shift from London, which was the capital of nightlife, I'd say, up until the 2000s, the noughties, and the shift to Berlin, where the city is actually exploiting. We can come back on that idea, which is, for me, then I've got another issue there. It's because it becomes corporate clubbing. in my view, a little bit. It's like the whole city is kind of arranged. It's like there's a board of tourism for clubbing in Berlin. So that's been taken. And I've had talks, for instance, with the authorities in Paris, and they tell you, no, no, no. If you want to go clubbing, you go to Berlin. Here it's not like that. Of course there's clubs and you can do parties, actually more than in London now, but London's got a fight against money. And against the constant gentrification of the urban space. We've seen that in Shoreditch. We've seen that in Dalston. We've seen that in Hackneywick. So what, clubs are going to be pushed back in Walshamstow? Or, you know, in Lewisham? You know, I mean... Does part of you think that that's just a natural byproduct of being in this subculture that we exist in? You know, do you think that's the reality of putting on parties in London in a way? Well, I mean, yeah, I was going to come to that. I mean, there's a lot of the reality of parties in London is about being illegal. I mean, I can support fabric, but I also support throwing an illegal party and not asking. And London's been pretty, and especially the police, has been pretty lenient over the last 20 years with that. I mean, I've seen them turning up and going, all right, well. That's the last time. Their policy here is that they will come and tell you, right, you need to turn it down, but they won't arrest people, they won't shut it completely because they don't want chaos. So there still will be parties. There will be parties. You know, an illegal party means no medic, means no security. If something goes wrong, something goes wrong, you know. It's part of the game, you know. It's like, I mean, festivals are taking over. Big clubs are in a weird position where some of them work, some of them don't. small parties will always happen it's just a bit tough for like smaller places like or mid-range you know places like um there also seems to be this line of thinking at the moment that younger people are less minded to actually go to nightclubs and are maybe preferring like other activities to do is that something you've maybe noticed at your gigs i don't know i'm too old um are you seeing fresh faces i guess that's what i'm asking no i do i mean well maybe they're not fresh but they look fresh to me I mean, I'm 45, so I'm obviously going to be a lot older than most of the people in the club, you know. What do they do then? I mean, so what, they're not clubbing? I mean, because you always hear that. I mean, we heard that like 10 years ago with like, oh, kids are not into electronic music anymore. They're into rock. You know, I heard that a thousand times. Sure. And then something new comes up. Some of the electronic music is less of a clubbing variety, maybe. Or more of a festival thing, of a live thing, maybe. So people think there's more of an emphasis on saving up for one-off events like festivals or going on a city break or something like that. Yeah, the city break thing, that's the Berlin Syndrome, isn't it? Or the Croatian Syndrome, or let's go to Sona. things like that, which for years was not done anymore, especially by English people. English people would stay in a club here. And it's true that more and more, I mean Ibiza is a different thing, but it's true, there's packaged clubbing, packaged holidays. You just go, you'll probably hear a lot more about it than I do. But yeah, it might be true that young people just choose to not go out every night. I mean, it's very hard for me to talk about this because I know... Everybody, we never pay. You know, we can go for five minutes. I don't even know how much it is to get into fabric, but I imagine it'd be, what, 15, 20 pounds? It's always tiered these days, so it could be anything between, like, 12 and 25 pounds. So it is, you know, if you, let's not be naive, if you top that with a few drinks and drugs, you know, it's not a cheap night. So, yeah. I mean, and people are skint. People have got no money. I know some young people, they've got enough money to go to work. When they come back from work, that's it. They've got money for food. So, you know, maybe they do house parties and things like that. Or, you know, they do like what every kid has always done, is they get into the scene and they get on the guest list, you know. Sure. That's always been like that. That's nothing new here. All right, let's put a more positive spin on things. Radio in London seems to be thriving. Yeah. Been on NTS for how long now? Two, three years. Why did you choose to work with NTS? Well, actually, my girlfriend had a show on NTS before I did. And I don't know, I mean, NTS is quite a crazy story. I mean, that's true to them, but it's just from being a little London kind of thing. to now being like a kind of global empire. I mean, Femi's opening, and Chess in LA, you know, they've got, I don't know, like about 400 shows on the radio. But I like them because they really don't care about the name of the person who does the show. Well, they do sometimes, they have guests and things, but it's not... The thing about the music and any type of music, I mean, it's not Rinse FM. We're talking about a different approach. It's not an electronic music radio. No, no, no, not at all. It's a misconception. And for me, it's great because I've always completely split up radio from DJing. It's not the same thing. I don't know anything more boring than doing a DJ set on the radio. I hate it. So I don't. And they let me do that. I do it with Nathan Wilkins. We don't mix. We don't play club music. Well, we do if we want to, but it's not... I mean, I'm going to say Vince FM. Sorry. It's no dissing. It's just, it's not about DJs playing club music on the radio for you to... turn up when you know then there's podcasts for them I mean this the radio situation has changed so much as well there's so much available at any time of anything but NTS is actually quite nice as a real radio meaning something you just turn on that's what radio is radio is not oh I want to hear the latest Ben Clark set And I'll go online. It's not on demand, is it? No, it's... Well, you can have on demand on NTS, but it's not about that. Yeah, it's not about that. It's about, oh, I like NTS because I'm just going to turn it on, leave it, and I'll probably be surprised. You know, sometimes I'm not going to like it, but so many shows. It's great. I mean, they're doing a tremendous job, I think, out of, like, room that is smaller than the one we're actually in on Gillette Square, you know, and now they've got LA starting in September. I don't know. It's great. It's great. What do you do on your show? Tell us about it. What do you play? Channeling with Nathan Wilkins. Well, I've known Nathan for about more than 20 years. We're very old friends. It's kind of a non-serious diggers programme. We both record diggers in some ways, but there's something very always a bit serious and a bit pedantic about record digging. So it's not about that. It's just about playing records we like, old or new. very serious or very stupid. I mean, life's too short when it comes to music. You know, there's always some new stuff that you would like. There's always some old stuff you haven't discovered. You know, it's so endless that why would you... I know some people who generally only like one style of music. or who for all their life have only listened to house music. I know people like that. Do you ever feel anxiety over what you just described? You know, this complete open-ended thing where you're constantly discovering and obviously, like, the world has opened up so much and we're discovering music from, like, all different continents. Like, does that ever overwhelm you or, like, concern you that you're not going to get to this shit? No, I can totally see your point. I can totally see how it could, but... That thing that I probably had when I was younger, that I wanted to have everything, is now anywhere out of reach, you know, because of the digital, because of internet, because of the fact that, you know, you can get any record anytime you want pretty easily if you know the right people, if you go online, you know, so... There's instant access, but instant access also means infinite possibilities. So, you know, you've got, comes a point where you go, no, it's fine if I miss something. You know, when I used to work in a record shop in the 90s, if I'd miss a record... I'd be absolutely fuming. We would have fight over records, you know. That's gone, you know. I don't care if, like, have you heard this? And I'm like, no. Well, it was out two weeks ago, and I'm like, well, can I hear it? It's fine, you know. That cult of the new. In a way, it's been centered by internet and all the digital availability. But in a way, it's been downplayed because it's like, well, there's so much on that, you know, who really cares? And I mean, I've got my own ways of finding records. I'm a big Bandcamp fan, for instance, more than any other platform. But that's because of the discovery aspect of things and not. So, no, I can see why it could, but, you know, ultimately you cannot have everything. I know some people who got, like, that kind of thing, but for many reasons, I mean, I lost loads of records back in the days as well, in a fire, which put in a kind of, like... my material world was a bit my thinking yeah my relation to the actual collection of records for instance I always say I don't collect records I will buy a record I like of any kind even a very rare one sometimes for quite a lot of money but I'm not anal about it you know how many did you lose in the fire about 30,000 So it's not like I need to have everything by then. No, I do on some bands, but it's not... I would say now it's more about the music than the actual objects, and I don't like paying loads of money for my records. I can do if I'm really after something, but, you know... What's the most you've dropped? or what's your upper bracket would you say my upper bracket I mean if I have to pay more than £100 for a record it's got to be you know it's got to be and I don't think I have for a long time no I did recently actually but it was like it was around that you know if it goes above that then you enter the realm of like super rare record that everybody wants and where is the point now I'm more interested in something that no one knows and that I like than the holy grail of that that no one has I know some people like that like Dave Hill he used to run New Phonic Records I'm talking about him because I met him again the other day And he's got the most insane record collection, especially reggae. Like, that literally means that, you know, some of his records are, like, should be in a safe. You know, like... Like one of two copies or something. Yeah, or acetates from Bob Marley. Yeah, OK. You know, or, like, things that actually don't even exist. They were never made. So I'm not like that. I'm not like that. It's more like I hear something and I'm like, this is so good, I really want it. So I'll find it. But it's not about, oh God, I need, you know, I'm not obsessive anymore. Just going back to the radio thing quickly. I know that you've been doing radio for a long time, but I don't know too much about the details of how you got started and where you got started. I mean, I did radio for, yeah, probably 10 years. Like, a bit less than 10 years on Radio Nova in Paris, which still is in many different ways. We're talking end of the 90s, early 90s. I finished radio, I left radio in 2000 when we started doing the club. I mean, I was a record shop assistant. You know, it comes from there. And they needed people that knew about music. That was when you were working at Rough Trade? Yeah, in Rough Trade in Paris. So I started doing little vignettes in other people's shows. I got my own DJ show. I did another show with the main guy and then suddenly one year they were like, right, well, we need someone to do the musical show, which is like... two and a half hours every day, 7pm till 9.30pm. And I had to do that for three years. That was just me introducing records and having guests and, you know, like what they do on BBC Six, but only every day, not every week. And it was quite intense. Those were quite intense two years, especially I was going out a lot at that time. But they're good memories. It was good fun. I did 400 interviews over the space of three years, from Ennio Morricone to Iggy Pop to... and small bands, you know, anybody. But it was in those days on that radio, I had total freedom. I mean, as soon as I signed on for that, I never had anyone saying, no, you can't play that or you need to play. this or that the only rule I was told was like right the first record of the show don't play something that's eight minutes please you know that was it we had total I had no one you know I could swear I mean I used to do all the translation myself you know it was it's not to be it was not the BBC it was just you know and then I did radio for the French BBC as well a little bit And then... So radio was like your main gig for a while. I mean, I was already DJing, but that was at the weekend. So... could do both but it was my job yeah do you have a style do i have a style like a presentation style or like is it someone you look up to well i didn't know the thing is i was thrown in the water you know i'd never done proper radio when they said well you're gonna talk you because it was not it was not dj it was like actually playing one record and talking so No, I mean, my producers to last days of the first shows, they're dreadful. I'm like, so no, it's just style of like. Well, my luck, because it was in France, my luck was that I was fluent in English, so I could translate and make it work as an English-French thing. Well, maybe I do. I've got a nasal voice, I know that. It was really fun because there was no one to tell us what to do. So, you know, if someone was rude, you would tell him. If someone was behaving badly in an interview, I would just go, well, can you leave now? Why was your English so good? I had an English girlfriend in the 90s. In Paris? Yeah, in Paris, yeah. I pick up on accents, weirdly enough. I used to be known to have a Brummie accent because of my friends are Brummies. Living in London with a Brummie accent. That was before. That was when I used to live in Paris and all my main friends, including Nate. and people who used to run Ideal Distribution, where all my friends, and they were from Birmingham, I can put it on, I can put it back on if you want. It's gone because of London, you know, because I've been living here for 10 years. But it was very strong, very, very strong. So I guess the main thing that's going on in your life at the moment is the release of the It's A Fine Line album. Yeah. I don't know if it's the main thing that's going on. It's always weird. It's been occupying your thoughts at least. Yeah. It's a weird thing when you make a record, especially someone that took so long, but not for bad reasons to make. What were the reasons? Because it sort of became a thing, didn't it? People were asking. Yeah It's just because we didn't want to rush and it was just the way we were working and we were like, oh, well, you know, then now we want to do this and we want to do that. It was not about, you know, making the perfect record or like, I mean, there was a lot of procrastination, that's for sure. But in a good way, it was just like, right, we're not. in a rush we don't need to put that record out if you know it's not going to be a dj record so it's not a simple record we want to make and we want to make it the way you know there was no pressure i mean up to a certain point it's true that at some point it became a bit silly because We thought we had done it and then we'd come back on things. But I didn't mind that. But, like, for instance, I did, like, I've just finished another one, Not It's Fine, a different project, and that took me six months. Can you say what that is? Yeah, it's Mag and Cross, because the other guy's called Rupert Cross. We've just finished it. I don't know when it's going to be released. There's also that. There's also the time between... I mean, it's a final album that's coming out now, but it was finished about a year and a half ago. Oh, OK. You know, there's always... So that's why it's kind of... It's on my mind, but other things are on my mind. When you work and you make records, it's usually not the one that's coming out that is on your mind. It's the one you're making now. Yeah, it's more the release process that's on your mind rather than actual production. Yeah, the release process is a game. I've played quite a lot in the interviews and the promo. I think, in a way, I'm lucky because... I can answer questions, especially written questions, very quickly. And usually in a way, it's, you know, some people are made for that and some people are not. Do you enjoy it at all or is it a chore? I always say that, you know, the interview depends on the interviewer. You know, it depends on the journalist. It doesn't depend on you. If you ask good questions, it's very enjoyable. If it's a chat, it's more enjoyable. But, you know... Ultimately, I've got, I mean, I've been doing this for, I mean, the DJing and the music for like 20, more than 20 years. So you've got, it's kind of almost like you can feel the questions even before they come and you've got this little set. pieces in my mind that always come back and if someone one day reads all the interviews I've done they will be able to see it's not copy and paste I just do it naturally it's like staples of my my attitude towards music and DJing. So there's little things that always come. Yeah, I mean, you could say you're consistent in your thinking. That's it, yeah. But it's consistent also in the way of putting it. Like when I say there's only two types of records, good and bad. That's something that's probably in every interview. When people ask you, so what do you like? How would you describe your style? The day I will describe my style, I'll be dead. That's something that we always come up. Because I don't like describing my style. I think it's not. I mean, I don't mind and we can get into it. But so you get this mechanism of like the presentation of yourself, which is part of the job, you know? Yeah, of course. Is this why when you've put out... press releases and stuff in the past the actual genre descriptors that have been attached to the music have always been like super wacky well yeah that's me making them up kind of like kicking against yeah that's me making oh you mean the gay biker house or the frozen bannering thing there was some connected to the fine line album as well that i can't bring to mind oh yeah it's just fun you know yeah i mean it always comes back to the what and where you're coming from. I mean, my dad was listening to a lot of music in the 70s, and I started buying records when I was, like, 12. House music didn't exist. And it feeds from so many things in the musical universe, you know. There's some music I don't like, but then I change, you know. I never listened to classical music. very experimental music when I was younger. I kind of do now. And I listen to a lot less of club music. So it's a matter of not putting yourself in your own box. I would leave that to the journalist if he wants to do it. You know, if he wants to describe the record. or my style, or whatever I'm putting out, as this, this, this, that's fine. It's just don't ask me to do it. Sure, sure. That's digging your own grave. Yeah, no, no, I do understand. It was interesting, though, you'd name check people like Connie Plant, Martin Hannett, Giorgio Moroder. What have you learned from guys like that? Well, I mean, I'm not sure I've learned from them. It's just, well, I techniques actually actually it's funny that because you you mentioned but i didn't write that and that was some as a friend of mine who wrote all this so the references is not they're not where they are mine but have i learned anything from connie blank no i haven't learned of a name so yeah it's a fine line it's something that I always say that's where the names come from because I always say that you know it's a fine line when how do you describe something when you don't want to so it's all about hints so you know I mean if you say if you say Giorgio Moroder and you like I mean if you listen to the record it won't sound like Giorgio Moroder yeah it's just um uh Connie Plank's probably a lot of a stronger influence in terms of um But at the same time, if you say Connie Plank, if you listen to the whole Connie Plank disco, it's very hard to pin down. Maybe the drum sound would be a kind of something. But from Daft to other things, he's done very, very different things. But he was a producer. A producer is another thing. It's like you work for other people and you adapt. That's a game you have to play, but we're trying not to... And obviously the record is... If I would be asked honestly to try and describe the records, I'd be so fucked. It's very hard to talk about your own music, for one, and especially... when 80 albums got no style and probably there's like three styles crammed into each song and someone from Vice just did the review and he said that it's an album that raises more questions than it gives answers. You like that, yeah. Yeah, I kind of like that. Yeah, sure. I kind of like that. The fine line name, it seems to be more than just a name in that I'd looked over an old, I don't know, it was a press sheet or something connected to one of your first records. And there was just this like succession of lines where you're saying things like, it's a fine line between rough and cheap, moody and dark, independent and arrogant. Yeah. I mean, what is this to you? Well, yeah, that's the definition of... how you make music and what you want to express through music. As Andrew always says, if you're not on the edge, you're taking up too much space. So basically, there's two ways you can try and fit. or you can want not to fit in any of the styles. You know, I totally respect, and I've done it in the past, and I probably would do it again. I'm going to sit down and say, right, I'm going to make a techno record. Whenever we've tried out with It's a Fine Line, it always ended up completely not where we started. So, I mean, then it's about the murky waters, things that are in between genres, which are always things I've always liked personally in terms of other people's records. I like records... that maybe you would think a disco, but they're not, or, you know, the mixture of, like, rock. records with electronics so it's all about that that was the strongest influence all those things where you're not sure exactly where you are or where the listener will be you know and ultimately when you make music you can worry about the listener's reaction That's fair, for instance, if you want to make functional music. And I think dance music needs to be functional, because it has a function to make people dance in a club. You need to worry about that. If you're making a record like the one we did, you can't worry about that. You just got, you know, you can worry about other things. You just want to make the record. It was really a conscious decision to make, OK, we're going to make the record the way we want. I'm not saying we've succeeded, because I don't think you ever make the record exactly the way you want. and the way you want changes over time as well. But we didn't worry. You said you finished it like 18 months ago. I mean, how are you feeling about it at the moment? It's great. I mean, I like it. It's also very hard. Listening to your own music is something I'm not very good at. It's a bit like playing your own records when you're a DJ. No, that's another. Here we go, the quotes. There's two types of DJ. Yeah, there's two types of DJ. It's not the one I normally say, but it starts the same. But, you know, DJs who play a lot of their own music, I don't. I always have this thing. It's not about because I don't want to self-promote. It's just because I know it. I don't know. It's just not exciting to you or something. Yeah, it's not exciting. And usually the music, some of the more recent stuff I've done since is a lot clubbier, but it's not necessarily made for clubs. And I don't think in terms of that. And it's a fine line. We were not thinking in terms of clubbing. No way. We were like, okay, you know. And he was also... because I was DJing a lot, you know, and DJing... I understand if you're a producer who's also a DJ that you want to make music to play out. I understand that. only I'm in the opposite because I was DJing so much, making music, and I've always thought of them as two separate things. Like I'm a DJ, but when I make music, the DJ thing disappears. I mean, I do make club music, but I don't sit down and go, right, we need to make something that will be able to play out. sure it happens but is that to do with maybe you hitting like your tolerance level i don't know if tolerance is the right word but you know you you're you're sort of absorbed in this club culture and this djing world and you get your fill of that and then when you're in the studio you want to kind of like please yourself another way there's there's that and there's the fact that for me music is not limited to dance music or to even like closer to electronic modern dance music sure you know it's not limited to a nine to nine kick and it's true that you know if you every weekend you're in nightclubs and you hear Good music, but it's also the same. Because, as I said, it's functional music. And I love it, don't get me wrong. It's not me slaying modern dance music. It's just that... in the studio i've got maybe other things to say as well i mean but i totally admire people like in the studio i'm at the moment my like studio next door ben sims you know who's and he that's what he's doing he's making and it's great i mean you know he's making functional dance music And he loves it, you know, and I admire it. The set-up is different, the way of working is different, you know. So someone like Surgeon is probably one of my favourite artists in that world. You know, there's, like, people very, very good at doing that, and I love it. And actually, Surgeon is a lot more experimental than what people think, but... You know, I've got immense respect for not all of them, but a few pure electronic modern dance music producers. Sure. It's just not my thing. For me, it's got a lot of rules and it's got a lot, you know, the kick needs to be that and the thing needs to be that. And it's probably because I'm not able to. I'm like, or it doesn't amuse me to spend hours on a kick drum so that it sounds great in a club. I wish I could do that. I mean, I know how to do that. You know, a lot of people also have their kind of old set up things, you know, so. But, you know, is that the way I want to make music? Not really, because when we did it... fine line or even when I do that it's like you make that's the way we worked and that's the way it's still at work we make one track and then we erase everything you know it's it's uh I mean I think that James Alden I've got when he did his album did that in an extreme way meaning he would make one track then would destroy the machine you know like the modular it would unpatch everything and then build something new for the new track. That's closer. I mean, that's an extreme way, and I can't do that. I'm not technically able. But that's the idea of, like, you've got a clean slate. It's not the idea of, like, all right, I'm going to... And I don't need to make 20 remixes that sound the same and are going to be great in a club. It's not me. I mean, my agent tells me that I should. Of course. Yeah, you know, and bless her, she's totally right. But I always have the feeling also that if I would start doing that, people would also go... what why is he why is he doing that yeah sure what so you know once again it's a fine line it's a fine line it's a fine line yeah i mean the name comes from realities no one made the name that just popped up to my mind so it's a balance thing it's a balance also between you know getting gigs, because obviously, you know, if you want to DJ, I mean, the issue for me is different, because I suppose I'm older, and I've got a kind name. I mean, I'm not making millions, I mean, that is for sure. But, you know, I can live on it, with ups and downs, you know, sometimes this, sometimes that. But... You know, people, especially younger, they need to make records in order for them to be played and then to get gigs. I'm a little bit out of that loop. I mean, I still do, and I probably will, but... I mean, it seems like, I don't know, something maybe I did... detected in interviews I'd read with you was that maybe you had something of like an arm's length relationship with DJing. You'd sort of talked about like, you know, the loneliness of DJing and how that, you know, functional music as a subject was a little bit tedious or something. I don't know, if he translates it that I'm a bit, I need to tone down then because it's not, I mean, I do like it. But it was more like, okay, let me phrase it in a different way. I do like it, but it's not all good. No, no, of course, but maybe you were suggesting that the discourse surrounding club music and, you know, maybe it was more. Oh, damn. I totally agree. I mean, you know, like, DJing is very simple. You don't need a dissertation on it. It's just, I'm just a guy playing records. Hang on a minute. You know, there's no, like, absolutely do not believe any philosophy of DJing or, like, the cult of Larry Levan or, you know, even friends of mine, Harvey. Hang on a minute. It's just guys playing records, okay? Cool. In some ways, you know, and I don't think it's actually only the DJ when you say, oh, but Larry Levan, it was magic. Hang on a minute, it was not only Larry Levan. It was Paradise Garage. It was New York at that time. It was the people. It was the records he was playing. You know, you always forget. They always forget that. It's like, you know, it's not the guy. The guy's just... I mean, there's only a limited thing that you can do when you play a record. And especially back in those days, you know, there was no CDJs, no loops, no added thing. You know, it's just like, so... I don't think there's any need to talk about DJing. That's what I mean. Or very little. So what? Then we're going to get into tricky things. How do I listen to promo? How do I pick up the records? That's so boring. DJing is about being in a nightclub and just having a guy playing records for you. But there are lots of people out there who want to know about DJing. that stuff you know that would be interesting to hear that i do i do it's just um just for you personally yeah no it's just i always wonder why do they want to know you know i mean things that always say you know like just stay true to what you like it's just like something that is very important don't i mean no it might work if you try and like um copy or if you try and fit in into the sound of now I know some people who did that really well, or follow the sound that is the sound of now, over the career. They also stay at the top. I don't know, it probably comes from my lack of ambition, or maybe my misplaced sense of ambition. My ambition is not about making money. being on the top of the poster of every festival. But it's also not your main thing. I mean, it's not that it's not your main thing, but you've always done... Lots of things. I would even go as far as to say that music might not be my main thing. So what would you say? I don't know. It's a combination of things. I watch a lot of movies. I'm a movie freak. I read a lot of books. I love books. I like records, but most of the records I really like, I won't be able to play. Sure. So DJing, I like it. It's great. It's probably one of the best jobs in the world. It's got its tedious aspects, the loneliness, the going away, the Friday night moment where you don't want to leave. All that is true, but it's still great most of the time. There's bad parties, good parties. But I'm lucky enough at least to kind of be in that circuit, which is a smaller circuit in a way. where what people expect from me is not fully, because that is also a mess, that you always play what you want and that's what people want, you know. But it's at least quite close, you know. And, like, for instance, it's really rare that I get booked in the wrong place anymore. You know, you don't get that. Or, I mean, when I'm doing the beats, it's a bit weird and things like that. And I can adapt. You know, DJing is also about compromise, you know, between what you want and the feedback you get. I'm not saying I'm playing for the crowd. Well, you, but see, no, I am. I am. I am playing for the people. You know, don't believe anybody who says he's not. And he's a bad But I'm lucky to have a crowd that is probably more open-minded to what I'm going to play than others. At this point, people know what you're about and roughly what to expect. Yeah, exactly. But it's not a given that it takes time. Yeah, absolutely. It takes time. I wanted to talk about maybe another... fine line and that was this idea of um you know the dichotomy of bands and djs yeah okay so you're someone who has been like you know creating pretty fluid lines between these two worlds you know you've always been kind of like going between them it's like you know dual identity or something have you felt resistance on the club side of things to the idea of guitars playing a leading role in dance music is that like a tension that you felt over your career well i mean that was why and we started our own night killer dj and a label in the early 2000s in paris at perp So we're going to use the bad word, which will soon be, you know, I've had loads of talks about that recently, which will soon be the word, which is, let's call it electroclash. You know, let's call it the electroclash days. That's why we started that night, because we, and I especially as a DJ, was fed up of... going to a club and hearing house music or techno at night. So it was not any, all happened. I mean, it clicked. It was what we call an era. You know, it all clicked. We opened the night. Then, you know, LCD sound system, like, you know, output, I was sounding output. LCD sound system releasing records. There was like a galaxy of people and Andrew was like then was leaving the techno world. Weatherall. Yeah, Weatherall. Yeah, was wanting to leave and starting playing weird shit again. There was that whole galaxy of people who were a bit like me. It was all different. Errol is another one of like, you know. OK, dance music is not only about house. It can also be guitars. It can also be... Or it can be darker. It's not only about New York or Chicago. or Detroit, which, once again, I've got enormous respect for, but it's not my culture, as you can see, or people consider me, I'm not black and I'm not from Chicago, and for my culture as a kid, I was not listening to black music, I would be lying if I would say that. So there was that need for us to express something else. So that's something that stayed. I've seen it go up, like, through the roof, probably, like, for that biggest part of the 2000, at least the first half. Then now it's probably... It's not at... Like, it was at its lowest, let's say, about two years ago, when, like... everybody, every single kid, the only thing they want is records, house music, records that I fought against, you know. It was really funny for me because it was like that retro house, that 90s house sound was exactly why I started. It was not against, actually. because I do like those records, but it was against the dictatorship of one thing in a club. House music had to be about this. About if you go back to the... You know, I don't like the word Balearic, because for me it's linked to an era, but I come from that angle of things. And that two or three years, it's coming back a little bit. Things are changing recently. But like two years ago, you know, like that's, we were back to what we were when I started. But now you get the mix back. People like Red Axes, you know, who play everywhere are completely doing exactly what we did. Sure. 15 years ago. So you're saying at this moment in time, it's a little bit easier to be weird. It is definitely, I mean, there was, I think, the big kind of trend that went from minus to retro house, as I call it. retro you mean minus the label yeah yeah so so so the big from like two you know when electro clash ended yeah or died on its own hours because it became really i mean electrocast was never a thing anyway it was it was about we play what we want but then it became a formula and he became bad and everything. I'm not, you know, and I don't consider myself, you know, they always call me, like, they always link me to that. It's fine. But then Minimal House came up. I mean, I was... kind of liking it. It came up at the end of the pub and the club and we had that as well, but like the early days, like Super Pitcher or the early compact days. And then you got Minus and the big minimal thing, which translated into... retro house or whatever you call it like the pure house thing like or the pure techno thing yeah that's two things yeah you have bergheim or you have 90s chicago house you know jacking whatever whatever yeah so but i think this year or the last year things are changing and there's so many people listening to different things you can you can avoid that and i'm not part of that thing of that circuit of the big you know the big house thing but I've seen also people who I admire you know at some point um I had loads of admiration for especially DJs who right now only play like kind of like records that I know and that were big I don't know, records from the 90s. It's very weird for me, that whole thing. To hear it coming around again. Yeah, especially that I didn't really like it the first time round. You know, it was already not what I was into then. And it's coming round, and it's a bit like the vinyl fetishism by young kids. And I understand it, because it's an object, and you want that. But, you know, I was there the first time round. kind of thing. I'm not. There's something, I love old records, but I don't really like when something old comes up and takes all the space. I've never played only disco. Or when, like... 90s house becomes the thing, you know. And even records were made now, like, they're trying to emulate, and usually badly, the way records were made in 89. Well, they've got to remember that the way records were made in 89 was in 89, and they were like... It was accidents. It was accidents. So you can't copy that. You can't copy what happened in Chicago in '89. You know, because it was an accident. It was something. You know, it's the same thing as about the Larry Levan thing. No, it's not about only that. It's about a lot of things. It's conjecture, you know. I don't see the point in trying to emulate something. I mean, if more people were getting it wrong... it might be more interesting. I am a firm believer in that. You know, a lot of my favourite records are records that are wrong or have something... Try to do one thing... Yeah, they try. I mean, you know, New Music, for instance, which is a pop band, and then they do Warp. You know, what is this record? There's loads of stories, loads of examples of, like, those records were not made to sound like that. Even, like... temporary secretary you know if you read the story you know it's just it was not meant to be like that and it's a mistake and then or they forget they actually forget to play one part of the song you know so it's this is interesting or like you know obviously the birth of like Chicago House you know the 303 that people buy for like so much money these days was like the cheapest piece of rolling equipment. It was made for people who could not afford a bass player. You know, so that comes into the game. and the thing that creates, you can't emulate that. You need to look for what's happening now. What's happening now, it might be what is feasible with a computer. For me, it's a lot more interesting in a way than having an 808. or looking to have the most vintage thing as possible. It's funny that that pursuit, this thing about exploring the computer, never really seemed to become a widespread ambition or something that was particularly cool. I think it's because it doesn't look cool. But people would be very surprised how much of like... For instance... a fine line record which I suppose to people won't sound like a computer record a lot of it has been made in a computer but you know what a computer is a machine a guitar is a machine a synth is a machine you know And now, especially for the last two or three years, what you can do in terms of sound with a computer is getting absolutely insane. And I think people don't like it because they want to have cool modular synths, which I love. Don't get me wrong. Once again, you know, and I've got a lot of real synths and blah, blah, blah, and there's some things you can do. But... The computer. I'm 100% sure that if the Chicago guys had access to it in 89, they would have gone for it. they would not have looked back and said, oh, no, we should try and do this with a real bass. Actually, the good thing came because they went for what was available and cheap. And at the moment, if you want to make music, the cheapest way is a computer. where some people then it goes too far then you get people who only use like loops and sound banks and ready made stuff and I don't agree with that but that's different but But yeah, the computer has got this image of like, oh, it's not analogue. Oh, come on. I mean, I don't even want to go into the analogue digital debate. I wasn't intending to go into that. No, no, it's the most boring thing. And it's a fake debate anyway. Let's talk about your record label. It's quite provocatively titled. I was wondering if this in any way points to conceptual aims or, you know, its output or anything like that. Oh, you mean the dark prince image and all that? Yeah, sure. Like the bad drugs and the dark prince. No, actually, that was a joke about that. Because Les Dix de l'Amour, in English, it sounds like death records, okay? Which it is. But in French, when you say Les Dix de l'Amour, it also means it's a killer record. I see. Yeah, it's so good it kills. So the direct translation is like Discs of Death or something. Yeah, but it's also a killer record. Yeah, I see. So it was the game because I've... I've got this reputation or image that is partly based on truth but very exaggerated of the dark, moody, whatever, which now is a character I can slip in if I want to. It was a joke. I think it's a good name. It's a better name in French than in English, actually. Tell us about the people you signed to the label. Who are these people? I've got... It's style of no style or the rule of no rule. Only that I need to like the tracks, you know? Yeah, okay. There's no... There's a few ideas, for instance, when we do a remix, we try to have a different sound than the original rather than, you know, having things that fit together. And I'm not, I've got no kind of ambitions of like, oh, I need to make a big sound or I need to release that many records or this and that. It's just... comes quite naturally you know so I haven't got a plan I know I've got an album and I've got things ahead of me obviously and I also like signing people that people would not expect me to like if I turn to DJ or the last one who's a guy from Marseille who used to be in Troublemakers on Guidance Records, probably one of the labels I hate the most. Right, I see. Was this the one that had the radioactive man remix on it? Yeah, that's exactly the one. He also releases on Honest John. He's a jazz head and African music, which I love, but which is totally not what people think. I would put out. And I'm going to probably put out his album, which he just sent me, which is amazing. But people were like, why is he releasing a record by that guy? That's the year to know I've got this thing that's a bit childish, the provocation thing, you know. But apart from that... There's no rule. I mean, apart that it's hard. If people want to run a record label, it's not an easy thing. Why do you say that? You really rarely make money. It's a labour of love, let's put it that way. Yeah, I see. I know some people do, but I mean, the physical cells these days, you know, people always like, oh, vinyl is back, vinyl is back. I don't know, you know that, but people might not know that. If you look at the cells of vinyl... 90% actually reissues of big bands like The Wall, Pink Floyd or the new Coldplay album. Sure, it's not people buying new dance music. Well, it is, but that's a tiny bit. That's like a thousand labels doing 200 copies. Like the bulk of it is not that. So if you do 200 copies, you're not covering your costs. You know, the limit would be 300. If you do below that, you know, but then... for a lot of people it's a vanity thing as well you know it's and for me it's not a vanity thing but I don't mind if I'm going to lose a bit of money on one you know so what's your exact involvement with Kill The DJ at this point or what's you know your sort of like day to day stuff that you're working on it's always been A&R It's always been A&R. I mean, the office is in Paris, the people dealing, so I'm on the A&R-ing. Probably a bit less now that I've got the other label. And, I mean, it's a different thing, Kid the DJ. It's more of... like artist development and albums and even pop, you know, it's even less like electronic music and less and less. So, I mean, I did produce quite a few albums for them as well. And that I do as well. Or what you call executive producer. That would be my job usually for the label, meaning... If we've got a project, we've got to find the right way of doing it. After it's out, I don't deal with that. That's the other people. Is A&Ring something that you take a lot of pleasure from? Yeah, I mean, it depends. It depends. More and more... I quite like the hands-on thing. It's like what comes after the A&R-ing. Like how, if you get like someone who's written great songs on... piano or you know it's got a weird universe how do you translate it into a proper record arrangements i do with my friend rupert who i do smug and cross with you know like things that have been more musical maybe or about production or about thinking how to make this into that It doesn't mean it has to be me. For instance, the next car album, I did all the first ones and the Baton album. I did that. And this time I decided not to. So we looked for another producer, which is Steve Osborne, funnily enough, who's in his 60s and has done Simple Minds and did remakes for Happy Mondays. And it's being finished at the moment. And that's really exciting. It's about connecting dots and making things. It's sometimes a bit ambitious and you can fail. I don't know, but it's interesting. I like that. The executive producer or the way, OK, who's going to be good for that? Where shall we take that? Because it's very rare, especially if you deal with album and younger artists, that you actually get an album that is completely finished. especially if it's songs and songwriting and things like that normally you will have the core of it but you need then to produce it and mix it and that can bring a lot to a record something that interests me actually finding the people it's not very interesting they usually find you you know if you go by an r-ing like fighting with other label over projects or something i don't know yeah it's not i don't i mean some people are good at it i know some people are very good at that But it's not interesting for me. What is interesting is how you take something and bring it to what you think is the best. At first, not even necessarily for the label, but for the project itself. I've got a tendency to think for the project itself. It might be... commercial failure afterwards that's that's another issue that's an issue i don't really deal with you know well maybe i should but you know you can't choose not to yeah i mean but it's just yeah i mean it's rare that you get something like on the diesel i'm off and then the save album that came as completely finished But because I knew Mark from Calder and he had this record and I know Craig, who's the singer of Parano, London, and who's the other part of Save. And I didn't have to do anything there. That was pure A&R. That was like... It was sent to me and I was like, what are you doing with that record? I like it. I'd put it out if you want. It's straightforward. Sometimes you have great songs and you can see something in the artist or in the project, but it's not there yet. you need to work. And there must be a particular type of satisfaction to see the potential in something and then help another artist realise it. Completely. And that is a non-selfish thing and I really like that. That's something I'm really interested in. Have you had any particular rewarding projects? I mean, to see where cars are probably about to go, but that's my girlfriend. it's a lot more at stake than that but yeah I mean this new thing Kid Adige is working on which we're not there yet but if it goes the way I think it might go I'd be very happy as well because It's very unrelated to what I normally do. You know, she writes songs on piano and she's a drummer. You know, it's very... What's exciting is when you kind of go out of your comfort zone. But... It's trying, so I go out of my comfort zone, maybe the artist will as well, but you build a team to make it work, you know, a good engineer, a good producer, it might not be me. That's something I like, yeah. AI is not about signing people, it's also about, right, I think you should do that, or maybe we need to do that. What help do you need? Why are you stuck? All of this kind of job. I like. Are you heavily involved with the visual direction of the label? Which one? Kill the DJ or both? Both. I just wanted to bring up the subject of aesthetics and how you think about that sort of thing. It depends. I mean, Kill the DJ had a very, very strong graphic chart for years, which is changing. I mean, it's a fine line to take it out. I'm very happy, for instance, with the video. and the album visual and that was me and an artist called Gareth Mcconnell who's a big photographer who's a friend, I mean, he did the video, but we had long talks, actually, about why his universe fitted into our world, and he spent a year listening to the record whilst he was being made and finding things. and the starting point was one of his books. And I said, well, I think it really kind of works with that music. And he agreed. the movie then we did all the choice of the pictures so yes the imagery i'm really interested in i mean the ladies de la more is always the same guy but it's more simple you know it's only 12 inches but when it comes to a proper record or like my album i did so fine nine and it's funny because like after this meeting because i'm working on the smug and cross thing now I'm going to go and see Trevor Jackson about visuals. He's obviously, you know, people don't know that, but apart from being a musician, he's like an amazing graphic designer. I mean, that's what he did, and he still does. We've had him in here. He's talked about that. Exactly. So, I mean, I was signed to his label, so now I'm going back for the other thing. Yeah, I see. You know, I'd like him to take care. But even if I want someone else to take care of it, I'm always very, very interested in the visual side of things. Is there a point at which it typically starts to appear in your thinking, the visual side of things? From the beginning. From the beginning. Okay, that's interesting. I mean, I'm a movie freak. Probably nowadays, even probably more than a music freak in some ways. And I've got this thing that music or track you make or record, it's not only about musical influences. It can be movies or images or books or things you've read or things you've been through. So, yeah, the visual thing is there from the beginning, always. It might not be an image, but I have a tendency to think in terms of image. Like for me, it's very easy when like someone asks for a track by track to give an image for a track. It's very easy. It's like, you know, and Garris for the It's a Fine Line, it was so strong as a universe, but it fitted. So I need something that fits. And I love. talking with designers if they're good you know and it's not necessarily only about graphic design it's about you know giving references and like this is what like and it's also interesting because you need to change with each thing you know i mean it's a fine line i don't know if you've seen it but it's very psychedelic all the imagery is very psychedelic so I need to move on from that for the next one. I need to go somewhere else. For the next video? No, for my next project, the other project. I see, I see. So I need to completely then switch and find a new visual world and identity. It needs to be different. I can't go psychedelic again. Psychedelic is just finite. maybe just as like a finishing note I wanted to ask you about the future yeah obviously an obvious place to end this but um are you someone who does plan ahead have you you talked about this project you have in the pipeline but like are you thinking about long-term goals and stuff that you definitely want to still achieve. No, no. I'm definitely not someone who plans ahead. But I think that's, in a way, part of the condition of being an artist, probably. Yeah. You know, we don't have any retirement plans. We kind of do what we like and love. So if that's what you mean. It's not business. Well, it is, but it's not. But you're not thinking about it. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, the next thing, yeah, I mean, I've got that Smag and Cross project. It's going to be the next thing I'm going to work on for a while because we've finished an album. I don't know where I'm going to release it. We did it all on our own, so we're quite free on that We're doing an ambient album as well for Ransom Note. I mean, we're just finishing it and just doing remixes for a load of people. It's a different way of working. it's a lot faster and a lot more intuitive and it's like okay well that's this one is this one if you don't like it just do another one instead of like you know trying to achieve something shaping something yeah it's a different way it's a different way of working so that's that I mean, the label is going to go on. The labels are going to go on. But I don't think goals... That's a good way to be disappointed if you set yourself goals, I think. I'd rather have a good surprise than like... I think I should maybe write a book at some point. That's been the ongoing affair. That's sort of as concretely you think about it? No, it's in me somewhere. Yeah, I see. But by the time I do it, that could be in 20 years. I've got no clue. So you don't know what it would be about at this point? Certainly not about music. Yeah, I was going to say. That's one thing. Or maybe it will. I don't know. I don't know. It's just I like writing. I like writing, but it takes time. And I'm not there yet. I'm not there. It's not ready yet. It's not even ready to come out. I don't even have an idea on what it would be about. I know it's probably what happened. Let me try to make something in your life. Let me try to make something in your life. Let me try to make something in your life. Move. Move. Let me try to make something in your life. Move. Let me try. Let me try to make something.
