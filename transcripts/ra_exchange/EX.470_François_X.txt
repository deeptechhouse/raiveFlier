*Sounds of a bird* Bye. Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resi... advisors exchange our series of conversations with the artists labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape my name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resnaa Advisor the exchange this week is with Francois X between a residency at Parisian Club Concrete regular sorts at Berghain and the dark, warehouse-ready sound of his label Demented, it is all too easy to categorize Francois X exclusively as a techno artist. But this sells him short. Learning from French electronic veterans DJ Deep and DJ Gregory in the 2000s gave him a lifelong love for soulful music outside of techno's confines. A pro athlete in the making, he first turned his persistence and discipline into a successful stint in finance, before launching himself into a music career. With a new label, Demented XXX, launched for slower, trippier material, and a tour schedule packed like never before, Francois let Gabriel Zatten into his world at Resident Advisor's Paris Community Connections event earlier this year. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Francois X is up next. Thank you. Thank you. Hello to listeners on SoundCloud in the future. I hope you're enjoying the future. It is another Resident Advisor exchange. We're live in Paris for the Community Connections event, and I am joined by Francois X of many, many, many things, which we'll get on to. Francois, I would like to start by asking exactly what I asked an hour ago. You're sitting next to someone at a dinner table who doesn't know anything about you. How would you explain who you are and what you do and what you stand for? Okay, big question. So, hello everybody. My name is François Xavier and I'm playing and producing DJ as François X. XX means Xavier because some people say things it's like for you know like expo but uh mainly I'm into this uh music business uh since a long time ago as a music lover like maybe Like now I'm 36. It's been like 20 years. Not as a professional, but as, like I said, like a lover in a way. And like many people before me and many people after me, I became addicted to house and techno and electronic in general when I came into a club the first time, you know. Basically for me it was not the club itself, not the people, but just the volume, the sound volume was so loud. Maybe it was the first time for me that I could hear something that loud. So it was very physical, you know, so it checked my body and I was instantly in love. So for me, if I have to define myself... The club is a big part in my life. It's a big part of the way I'm feeling the music, the way I'm feeling the scene, the movement, everything. I am like you said, many things. I became at first a house lover because in Paris, at the end of the 90s... The techno was not so big. It was mainly house and I was like really attracted to house music and for sure to this fantasy about house music, you know, like the classical, dense American music, you know, like the clubs like Paradise Garage in New York, like Chicago with the Music Box and the Power Plant, and all this fantasy, like... there is my friend Julien in the place. We had this simple word for that, it's called the dream, you know, we always dream about that era. Club house music, then techno music. Maybe we're going to cover it after. In a way, I'm just like a guy who wants to vibe in a club, who wants to feel the atmosphere, who wants to get laid in my head. I don't know if I could say that, but... spiritually. I want to have experience. For me, electronic music is okay for some people. It's like a fight. But for me at first it's just like a vibration. I stand for vibration. I want to really have the groove in me. In a way it's just like general words, not very specific. When I'm defining myself it's just those spiritual words and those feelings in a way. It's interesting to me that you're talking about these grand concepts of what dancing means and what the best clubs of all time mean. Because you were training to be a pro athlete. I think you were playing tennis. Yeah. And then you worked in finance for 10 years. So you're at one end of the spectrum that is not tripping in a club for 10 hours and it's not playing for 10 hours. How did you kind of realign your sensibilities? How did you come from... that side of the world into a world where you felt comfortable working in music like was there a point where you want to take the jump or was it just a slow process of realizing what your heart and your head were telling you? The thing I can say is that I practice a lot of tennis. I play tennis at a quite high level and doing finance at a normal level but the common things between those three mediums are like the feeling. For example, when I play tennis, even nowadays, you know, when you play at a good level, you can experience fear, exhaustion, depression, many things. When I was trading, in a way, it was the same thing. It was about feelings. It was stressful. It was like euphoric. I don't know. And music is the same, you know. So for me, from the outside, it's like completely different things, you know. But for me, it's just... The theme sings. It's like really about the feeling. It was just a natural process, you know. Okay, at one point, music was on the side, but it was really a strong passion. Tennis also. Finance, for some people, it could be strange, but for me, it was really interesting, you know, about geopolitical things. I'm like a passionate guy, you know. When I'm doing something, I'm going deep, deep, deep. So there is no difference. It's funny you just mentioned deep because I was going to say someone that probably changed your perspective was DJ Deep. You've spoken a lot about your connection to Deep and to Gregory and to Detman as well outside of France. And I don't want to spend too long on this. But these guys clearly gave you something that you've taken into your career as it's gone up and up. What were the lessons you were taking from them? I could say that from Cyril, DJ Deep, he told me how to love. sometimes in a really hard way, but to love and to cherish this legacy of pioneers in electronic music. He made me discover a lot of things. You know, he's like Merlin. You know, he's like a wizard. He knows everything. And he lived everything. So he taught me how to... really dig your roots. For me it's really important, you know, to know where you come from, to know your roots, you know, to move forward. For me it's like the basis. People like Gregory, you know, he's not really like a teacher, but he's more like a... funny character. You know, we have this guy, this French actor who's dead now, called Michel Serrault. He was this funny character in a way. And Gregory put this like, maybe like funny and like comic way of behaving in his music. So it gave him this kind of grandeur. I don't know if it's correct. And so I used to go to see him a lot playing at different parties. And for me, it made me realize that, okay, you have to be serious about your roots, but you have also to be super vibey in a club. You have to bring that craziness. So Gregory taught me that. And then Marcel Detman maybe taught me how to be more professional because he was like a big DJ at the time already. So, you know, when I started working with him, it was the time, it was at the moment I was like quite quitting finance. embracing my DJ and musician career. So yeah, in a way it was like more to be more professional, more having a vision, you know, of your profile, of your job. When you talk about a vision, it seemed to me, and this is looking back, so I wasn't obviously there at the time, but when you were running events and beginning to promote and put out music on the label that became Demented, at the Social Club, you were booking artists that maybe were not seen in Paris at the time. I think I pulled up... So you guys must have had a vision to do something different. Was it a challenge to execute that? Were people coming and enjoying it? Did you think that it was going to go as far as it did? Or was it just piece by piece? It's a bit of everything. I think when I started doing, I mean, when we started doing parties with Julien, my colleague who is there, it was, I think we were lucky because it was this phases, moments in Paris when we had that, you know, like French touch minimal and then a bit of emptiness in the club scene. But the social club was running wild at the moment, you know. So we started the party at different locations. And then, I don't remember exactly why, but it was just a matter of luck or just like opportunities. We were asked to do parties at the social club. And like you said, it was not famous for that kind of sound, for that type of music. But the club, I think, was doing so well that they didn't care about the change of lineups. So they trusted us. And maybe the first party we did with Social Club was not at Social Club because at the time it was under construction. So we did a party in another location. And it was with Maurice von Oldswald and Tiki Man. And the party was like super big, super successful. And the first one we did at Social Club was with Joey Orbison and I forgot his name, Scuba, who was at the time like the king of dubstep. And Joe Robison, like you said, it was just like a new act. He was just done his hit, Hype Mongo. I don't know. Hype Mongo? Hype Mongo, yeah. And so... The little seed that planted the big, big, big tree. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, and the first part, it was like, went so well. It was not a surprise, but not even like... something we planned for. It was just like, but I remember that maybe with Julian, we did like a lot of communication. We were like really promoters, you know, like, so maybe it was just like being at the right time at the right moment with some rock, you know, like, and it went well. So there is no like, there was no secret. There was no planning. It happened. The people that we're talking about now are international artists, but what you're most... well known for internationally is being part of a Parisian or French techno scene. There must have been a point where you were changing from booking international artists to trying to bring up people around you. When did that shift happen? Is that the vision that took over or is it just again just circumstances? No, no, no. Maybe I'm going to add something. The line-up we've done at that time it was because we were like so often into the record shop you know we were just like great diggers so for us it was natural to invite them but also the French act we had it was like a bunch of friends around us and because they played most of the time warm ups or lives you know like the first live act It was at the same time, in fact. It was not like, we're going to book international DJs, and then when it's going to be a bit more successful, we're going to invite French acts. No, no, no, no. It was at the same time. And that led to the creation of Demanted, if I'm correct. The first party we've done was in some random location. artists' warehouses. And we did like, we've done like three or four parties with Wojcicki, Polo Inesha, Julia and myself. And it was maybe the most interesting parties we did. So for us, when we went to social club, We had that in mind. So there was no international versus local. It was just artists we like, and we played together, and that's it. So why did you develop it into a label then? What was the genus of that? You know, when you start DJing, or when you want to play in bigger clubs, I mean official clubs of your city, sometimes you have to organize parties. In a way, we were half DJs, half promoters. After two or three years of promoting parties, we were done. We had invited all the guys we wanted. So for us, it was like, we have to stop. On one side, we have to stop because it's not a real job. Because after that, you have to develop. other skills and on the other side we were like okay like you like i've told you the the life from polar inertia the music from dcr dcrd or a voice key of the people around us they were so good they had so many stuff ready we decided to stop the party or maybe to run it more slowly And then, okay, let's do a label. It's the time, you know? And it was not just for Julia and me, myself. It was, okay, the guys are so good. They were literally killing the dance floor. I remember one live of Polar Inertia. It was amazing, you know, mind-blowing, you know? And so it was an actual process to stop the party. start the label you know so there was no magic it was just a family thing bunch of friends living the the life of great diggers of love electronic music lovers and we were like okay let's set up a label gonna release music and nothing special you know I think you've said before that a lot of the people that release on the label live close to each other. People are just like a street down from each other. Was that just like a circumstantial thing or is that just where people live? No, no, no. We didn't live close to each other. We live in Paris, but Gilles and myself are in the posh side. The other guy went south of Paris. We are just friends. It doesn't matter where we live. I mean, in Paris, yeah, nowadays you have people who are living in a certain area. No, we were like really separate. The reason I was going to lead up to this is you released with Antigone and this is jumping a few years forward now, but I thought the title that We Move As One was misinterpreted. People thought it meant you were making a statement about the scene. But it made so much sense that it looked like the correct answer. You guys spent most of the 2010s, the last nine and a half years, and it seemed like every time each step was taken as one. And this whole group of artists came up because of the label Demented. but you were doing shows around the world together. The sound was quite similar. You must have felt like there were six of you against the world and you were kind of slowly going up as a movement, right? Yeah. Yes, at the time, and sometimes no nowadays. It's the way of developing yourself. Sometimes you start as a group, as a common force. But yeah, at that time it was really like a dream because we have a bunch of friends. There was no plan. It was just about the feeling. the love following our operation. So, yeah, when we did that record on Demanted, it was, I think, the peak time for this community. I mean, we had the same vision at the time, you know? We were in this kind of bubble. No pressure, no harsh feelings. It was really this paradise in a way, you know? We were like having dinner, lunch all together. I'm doing music with Antigone on the weekend, playing in other clubs together, meeting Julien during the week, having lunch, even meetings, but really random meetings with all the label artists. It was that force. But in a way, we were a bit isolated, in a positive way, because we were in this kind of friendship bubble. Nothing could happen to us because we were like cool. I mean cool for us. We were like just feeling. the purest essence of this utopia we had for this music. How were your musical visions changing? Because we're talking now about a strategic thing, about how people becoming aware of you. But you were surrounded by creatives and friends that you respected. You were playing on bigger and bigger dance floors. You must have had a different perception of the music you wanted to play. What was it like? Eight years ago, what's it like now? How's that morphed? Good question. Eight years ago, I was more inexperienced in terms of driving a dance floor. It was more like playing what I liked, playing no matter what the crowd. will think about it or will react, how the choir will react, but it was more like playing the record I want to play. So musically, I was in the, eight years ago, maybe like 10 years ago, the scene itself was changing, it was morphing, you know? When I was into house, it was really like dance music, like the roots, the Chicago, Detroit, New York axis. And then it became more like a bit cheesy. Then I started to play more like this kind of in-between when you had like Dixon and Inner Vision guys at that time, not nowadays, but that time, you know, because for some people, but no. But at that time, you know, the music was a bit more, became more techier. So everybody was playing this kind of in-between sound. And then... When I started to play more bigger dance floors, I was playing mainly techno. But it was a bit darker than what I'm playing nowadays. Maybe over the years, I learned how to drive a dance floor, you know? How to ease people, to get people in a... give a rush of adrenaline. So nowadays, I think I've become more mature, more experienced. I think I have the skills now to combine all my influences, you know. So if you take that plus my more diverse way of playing nowadays, I think I can read a dance floor better by playing more deeper stuff. more personal stuff and I can drive between more emotions. So I didn't change my music. I just changed my perception of the dance floor. think I'm more experienced and more mature to really be myself you know the other thing that I thought of when I looked at we move as one was you're talking about the dance floor because when you make comments about playing with crowds you're talking about this unifying factor. You say, we go on a trip. We were in that moment together. We were feeling it. And I noticed the way you speak is someone that spent long, long hours on a dance floor looking out at someone looking back at you and kind of reading the crowd. Do you think that playing all night sets and playing at different times of day all across the world has led you to kind of have a different understanding of... what makes people tick? Can you see a crowd and understand what they're going for? Because you have, as you say, a diverse pool of playing and you have music. Do you think you can now cater to different crowds with different mood sets and that's something that can only be learned with experience? Or do you think that's you tapping into their passion on a human level? What is it that works? For me, DJing is a long road, you know? So, in a way, it depends. For example, nowadays, I think for me, the most important thing in a party, in a club, is the warm-up, you know? If the guy before you, or if I'm doing a warm-up, this is the party, the section of the party. where you have to put a mood, you know? You have to prepare not to deliver. You have to prepare the crowd. to be ready to listen to everything, you know, to go from point A to point B, C. And sometimes for me, when I play in a party and there is a guy banging at the beginning, I'm not feeling comfortable to play what I want, you know. The crowd is already rushing into the dark mood. It's like really, the tempo is already hard. Yeah, it's like so energetic. So I cannot play what I want. I cannot travel, you know. I cannot make people travel with me. For me, the warm-ups are really important. So when I have a good warm-up, when the people before me are doing that good warm-up, I can be myself, I can play whatever I want. So those moments when I can do that, sometimes I can feel the connection, I can have... this kind of a bond with the crowd. And this is a thing I'm feeling recently, maybe since two years. And before it, I think... I wouldn't be able to feel that because I was not ready, you know, in a way, to be free of any judgments, any kind of pressure. So, I mean, like, let's face it, I'm 36. I started teaching at 16, even if it was not professional, on a professional level. It took me 20 years in a way to really understand what is teaching and I'm still learning. So yeah, for me it's something you have in your stomach. but also something you have to practice, to see, to feel. Fine-tune. Yeah, yeah. We could say that it's fine-tuning, yeah. Constantly, you know. Depending on, because the more successful or famous you become, the more bigger the dance floor is. So sometimes it's, you also have to... learn how to play festival, you know, like this one hour and a half or two hour slot when people are, they already paid 60 bucks to have like this fantasy or this festival. fantasy utopia and I don't want to wait you know so you have to deliver like straight to them something like really powerful sometimes so it depends. That's gonna kind of lead on perfectly to what I was asking about the reputation you have for being a big techno DJ in the 2010s. Techno is massive, techno festivals happen everywhere from Bogota to Tokyo. and you play a lot of them and you're known on the circuit as a techno DJ you don't always get 8, 9, 10 hours and when we had a call earlier this week I got a sense of maybe frustration that your label and your personal style is characterized as dark intense techno how can you kind of reconcile wanting to give part of your character go deeper show a different side of djing while also being a techno headliner is it something you think about how you can break that perception Sometimes it's difficult to break people's opinions. Like you said, I'm known as a big techno DJ. I mean, big, you said big. Techno DJ. I could say that when I play long sets and I'm in this really comfortable chair where I can be me. I can play from, I play everything I love, you know, like house music, sometimes a bit of idea. sometimes a bit of electro, sometimes a bit of techno. If I could put some ambient in between, like classic. I'm not like DJ Harvey, you know, like this wide spectrum of music. But in terms of electronic, I want to play like this really wide spectrum of things. So I understand nowadays when you are big or bigger, promoters want to sell you. in the most profitable way, you know? So they have to put the word techno because techno means nowadays like, oh, cash, big party, boom, boom, and that's it. I mean, also techno is like a popular word now. It's pop music because techno is like for Marcel Detman to Pampa to Amelie Lanz to me to even like people, you can go to Beatport. Some tracks are labeled techno and it's like pekkaus or dipaus. So I think techno nowadays, it's a really sellable word. But if I wanted to reconcile people, I just wanted to say to them that I'm more than that. I have not a strong background, but a really diverse background. I'm in love with many things. So I would say it would not be fair to say I'm a techno DJ. No, I'm a house DJ. I'm a house and techno DJ. It's just François Higgs, you know, he can play everything. Let's say I want to bring some diversity, but also like a wide spectrum of emotions, you know. I mean, it could be interesting if nowadays we could not label artists and parties, but just on like music terms, you know, like techno, jungle. more about the feeling you're going to have at this party. Is it going to be a darker party? Is it going to be like, I don't know, like a white sexual party or like a nerdy party? We're going to come with glasses. and look on the floor and going to listen to music. You know, like, for me, it's better to say, like, okay, Francois is playing, like, this kind of really dreamy music, you know, like, it's a lot about emotion, about feelings. He want to embark you on a trip, you know. For me, it's like I'm driving a spaceship, in a way. So it's difficult because it's tricky. You know, if like we talk about it, we say now I'm playing house. oh, so François is playing house nowadays? No, he's not playing any more techno. No, no, no. I'm still playing techno. I'm still playing, I'm playing many things. So I have to find, I don't have to find a way. I would love to be recognized as me, you know, as myself, as François X. Is that partly why you started the new label? I say new, it's XXX, the side label of Demented. is that a way that you can break your own image and break the image of the label? Or maybe not break it, but add an extra arm. It's not about breaking, it's about, I started the new label because, I wanted to have my own platform, you know? Just my sole vision. So in a few months, maybe with time, maybe the releases are going to draft a map of what I like, even if it's not my music. So maybe yes, in a way, but like I said at the beginning of this interview, for me, I'm like, I'm really about feelings, just a natural way all the, all the long, you know, like. all along so my vision is going to be like more I hope clear for the people for the crowd for the industry so yeah in a way yes do you think your reliance on feelings and your your kind of your innate passion is why you connect so much to Chicago and Detroit house because they yeah they had ways of talking about sexuality about about people and community in they could do it with a really simple bass line but it hits you deep and that seems to be what you've taken from them yeah yeah like i said with julian we have always that using the word like the dream you know and so yes it's all about feelings even though i'm i know by heart all the history about this music when i for example When I'm in a mood or I'm in a part of my life where I'm lacking of inspiration, I'm a bit disappointed with the scene, with what's going on. I just have to look or to watch the old documentaries about Detroit, about Chicago, about Powder's Garage. And I dream, you know, I'm with the kids' eyes looking at it, watching it. I'm dreaming, you know, and it gave me goosebumps and just the fantasy, the utopia of it. So about it. So for me, it's, yeah, it's really deep. And I know it's just music. It's just like clubbing. There are like most bigger, like, and serious problems on the planet. But when I am, when I'm talking about it, when I'm, when I'm in this, I'm in this thing. It's just about the feeling. I don't know why, but it's just about the passion I have for it. I'm a kid in a way. Let's talk about how Concrete ties in with that. It's something we haven't talked about already in 40 minutes and it's something that people associate with you first. How does that match up as a dance floor, as a crowd, as an incubator of talent? You're one of the two or three most connected people too. How does that fit with your idea and your vision, your dreams of the clubs back then? It's a tricky question, my friend. And the thing is, concrete for me was like the part of my DJ life where I started to be recognized internationally. So, and that was maybe my first residency. So there I had the opportunity, the freedom to really be in a spot where I could be. the most free guy on the planet. So it was a laboratory for me, you know. It's really difficult because my vision is my personal vision, my ideal, my point of view, my way of living. So sometimes you cannot mix it with others' point of view, you know. So it's always a... In a funny way, I mean, it's really a positive, in a positive way. I'm always, like, struggling, you know? It's like... debating with the guy at Concrete because when I'm like sometimes I have like a whole night long I want to like put some special decoration to recreate that vibe to have that belly like tickling so it's difficult so for me if I want to really develop and to set up my own vision I have to do all by myself so sometimes I have to compromise sometimes I'm yeah, it's difficult. The predominant thing that I get from you is like a sense of balance. And I think that might link all the way back to Tennis, that you're a big DJ and you tour and you play long sets or you play short sets, but you never seem to be, from what I can understand, on the cusp of burnout. It seems to be measured. You have a pragmatic way of looking at... the kind of ways you need to cut corners, the concessions you need to make, but you're still like eking out and slowly getting to a place where you feel happiest. To people that are listening in the future or DJs that may be starting out, how do you build that kind of endurance? It's a difficult game to stay at the top of and you've kind of become part of the furniture. if you can explain to anyone what it kind of takes to be a mainstay and how you need to check yourself now and again. You have to be me first? No, I'm joking. I think you have to be patient. Patience. In French, we say patience. Patience is a virtue. But patience is the mainstay. thing you know like you have to be ready to learn you know and i think also you have to be prepared and ready to get out of the noise you know for me the noise is like the i mean in finance the noise was when you had a big announcement, you know, like, and everybody in the industry was rushing, doing, like, stupid things. So when you're like a DJ, you have to be patient. You have to get out of that noise of, oh, nowadays this trend is, like, becoming bigger. You have to put that picture in Instagram first. Do your stuff. And if you believe in your stuff, if you believe in your... if your passion is true, it will create like a shape and this shape is going to be you, going to take place and people are going to notice it and you will become like, I mean, you will become you and the more quicker you are you, you are yourself. the more successful, I think the more successful you will be. But you have to be patient, I think. Because... not to become successful, to really learn about yourself, to really learn what you like, to really learn what you are made of, in a way. So it's like a long trip, a long road. For me, I think maybe just patience and believing in yourself is the main key to become a men's day, like you said. Well, I mean, it's going to be 10 years of Demented soon. You've been playing... For 20 years, you definitely made it a little bit longer than a lot of people in the game. On that note, with Demented and the 10th anniversary coming up in a year or two, what are the plans for the label? Because you now have a side label. We're talking a lot about you as a DJ, but you have a community of artists. You have a lot of music you've been putting out over the years. how are you going to reconcile your schedule and your search for your inner self with also running the label and the artists that kind of owe their livelihood to you? I think with Julien over the years we have become masters at DIY DIY. So in a way, we, I, with my agent Julien, we set up everything by ourselves. So we are pretty good now at doing stuff. I mean many different things at once. I don't know, it's like I'm playing tennis a lot. I think I have to be really prepared to cherish this light inside me. I think this light inside me is still illuminating my passion. So I can do many things at the same time. I don't have to reconcile. I have to just feel it, you know? So I can have like five labels, I can play like 10 gigs a month, I can produce an album. So the next things I will do will be like, you know, like... taking care of the label, having a strong vision about it, you know, like developing artists. Because I think also when you tour a lot and you're becoming bigger, you're becoming more, you are away from your city. You're not like really close to the local scene. And sometimes it's where the most interesting things happen. So I'm going to take care of small artists. I'm going to transmit my experiences doing other albums, doing remixes. You know, the usual. I mean, when you are passionate, you don't have any plans, you just do. So for me, the next move forward... for François X is like just living his passionate life of electronic musician.
