Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Matt Unicum and I'm a manager here at Resident Advisor. Simon Caldwell, perhaps more than any other Sydney selector, has always been referred to as a DJ's DJ. Since becoming a regular fixture on the Sydney clubbing circuit in the mid-90s, Simon has gone on to become one of the cornerstone figures of the city's electronic community, having held down long-term residencies at a variety of clubs and club nights, all while co-promoting Mad Racket, one of Sydney's most unique and well-known parties. For these reasons, he's one of the best and most informed people to speak to with about Sydney's clubbing history. So that's exactly what we did earlier this year. I remember you telling me that you moved to London at a pretty young age. Yeah, I went over there when I was 18. Not particularly for music or anything. It was just because I had a British passport and thought I might as well use it and get out of Sydney for a while and travel the world a bit. What was it like when you got there? Were you heavily into music when you were growing up? I was into music, but I wasn't really following that as anything kind of career-wise. I did get exposed to a lot of really good music when I was there and I did get, you know, a lot more into it. And by the time I left London, I was probably sort of starting to get a bit more seriously into it. And then by the time I... So I came back looking for that sort of stuff when I came back to Sydney, I guess. And you were listening to not necessarily house music? No, I guess the first sort of music that I really got really, really into would have to be like funk music. funk, jazz funk and soul music. I was lucky enough to have a flatmate who had a pretty good collection of stuff and so I just really became immersed in that and with the hip-hop that was coming out at the time and also a lot of the sort of more housey stuff as well, you know, there was all the hip house crossover for a start as well. You know, like it was obvious. where the samples and stuff were coming from, especially like, you know, tripod quest, Dallas, all those kind of where, you know, the samples, they dug a little bit deeper for the samples and then. So the whole thing just sort of had a bit of a continuity about it, you know? So it made sense to like the new music, but also to go back digging into what it came from. And the rave scene in London was very much based on an open idea of music, where, you know, it would be a funk record next to a hip-hop record, next to an early rave record or something, and there wasn't any kind of problem. with that. That was actually, you know, that was what it was based on. What sort of parties were you going to in London? I was just going to little, not very trendy clubs mainly. You know, I used to work in restaurants and bars and stuff and so we'd go out after work to little bars, clubs. you know, sometimes to, like, little gay clubs on, like, Oxford Street or around Tottenham Court Road or just little bars in Soho and stuff. But there was always lots of sort of, you know, that sort of dance music was actually the pop music of the day, really, so it was pretty unavoidable. Can you remember any... Are there any... gigs or parties that stand out in particular that really, I don't know, clicked for you? Probably some of the house parties that I went to, you know? They were probably the more fun things because there was a lot, I didn't really go to the big orbital raves, you know, but I heard a lot about them and then that sort of do-it-yourself party vibe was, you know, a lot of house parties were sort of like... So, yeah, they were the loosest. Well, I guess that's kind of like racket, this Mad Racket, which happens ten times a year. It's been running for... About eight or nine a year, I guess we do. It's been running for... About 12, well, over 12 years, yeah. I guess Mad Racket takes music away from a... away from the typical club environment? I suppose, yeah. It's a bowling club. That's like where the average age of people in the club would normally be, you know, over 50. So I guess we changed that a bit when we put our parties on. I think our average age is getting a little older as the years go by as well. Where did racket start? At a squash club? Yeah, the first two were at Waverley Squash Club, but it was a bit too small. So they were popular straight away? Oh, pretty much, but that was only like, you could only fit 150 people in there, so we fit 180 people in there. And then we knew about the bowling club and so we thought we'd give it a crack there. And it's been at the bowling club ever since? Indeed, yeah. That's quite a long time. Yes. So were you playing, were you a resident elsewhere when Racket started? Yeah, I used to be a resident at home, nightclub, a few years after it opened down at Darling Harbour. And for that, I was a resident at Chinese Laundry for about three or four years. And both of those clubs have gone through pretty... have gone through... Well, the Chinese Laundry's actually not changed all that much. Really? Not that much. I mean, the sound system's been improved and I guess sort of the demographic of the crowd has changed a bit. But home has obviously changed an awful lot. The layout of the whole main room is very different and it's just a different proposition. So home nightclub is pretty much the biggest. Capacity-wise, the biggest club in Sydney? Is it? I guess it probably is. When it was all one club and always run as one club, I mean, they opened one in London around the same time and that didn't last very long at all. That was apparently a bit like a shopping centre. Some people reckon the one in Sydney is a bit like a shopping centre too. I don't know. It was definitely the biggest purpose-built club in Sydney. What kind of DJs were playing in those days? Or internationals and residents? They didn't actually have quite as many internationals back then. They had mainly local residents, like Jason Byer used to play there. Goodwill used to play there. myself, a few other people, but they had a relatively strong music policy. And they had a big following. They used to get a couple of thousand people every week, which is pretty good going. It seems... It seems impossible to do these days, right? Yeah, with having locals only. Yeah, they would have internationals for maybe only one or two a month. What were you playing back then? I used to do the warm-up sets. I used to play the first three hours. So I'd start with, obviously, an empty room. And so I'd just kind of slowly, slowly build it. up to a point so it depends how quickly people arrived as well but i used to not play too too smashing hard or anything i'd kind of try and build the room they had a great sound system in there i think they've changed it now but um the guy from tunnel i think steve paris whatever his name you're wrong about that um he he came in and designed this sort of purpose-built sound system and he used to come back every month or two and retune it and when he just retuned it and you were the first person to play on it, it was like you could really hear the difference. It was a pretty amazing sound system actually. So what was laundry like? Were you playing there weekly? Were you playing both home and laundry every weekend? No, no, no. I had to move from one to the other. What was first? Laundry was first. So what was Laundry like back in, when would that have been? It was the late 90s. So, yeah, it was really fun, you know. It was a pretty terrible sound system, especially in the main Laundry part. But I used to play a lot of, you know, sort of Jack and Chicago house and, you know, even like Dance Mania sort of stuff. That was probably the best sounding stuff on that system because it was such a terrible system. Those drum machine sounds sounded pretty good and if they distorted well, you couldn't tell if it was the record or the sound system anyway. Yeah. So it used to be fun, yeah. Who was that? Was Chinese Laundry... Did Chinese Laundry have a similar policy regarding internationals to home? Or was it again like a... No, it was mainly locals again, yeah. And that seems worlds away now. There weren't... Yeah, I mean, it's... Yeah, I guess when you look at it like that, nowadays there's... There's usually like five or ten internationals playing every weekend in Sydney of all different sort of genres. And I guess that just wasn't the case. Sydney wasn't quite as on the circuit, I guess, as it is now. So obviously that meant that residencies aren't as prominent. in Sydney now as they once were? No, I think some clubs have pretty, seem to treat their residents pretty well. Like, you know, China's Laundry is probably not a bad example. Where someone like Matt and Thomas, you know, have been sort of cave residents for several years now. And, you know, that's cool. But yeah, the emphasis has changed. If you're constantly promoting internationals and people expect internationals, I think. Do you think that's led to a change in, I don't know, the make-up of DJs in Sydney? Like, has the dynamic changed? Yeah, yeah, it obviously has. I mean, it's a long conversation. I think, because it depends how you kind of look at it and everything. One thing that I've been thinking about lately is the whole fact that, you know, there's heaps of internationals, but most of the touring internationals aren't. A lot of them, at least, they're booked on the back of their production and they may or may not be able to actually, you know, they may or may not be. great DJ, that's what I mean. So, and they're usually playing DJ sets, not live sets, and even a live set by a great producer doesn't necessarily transfer at all. So I just think that in a way that's progressively diminished. the art of the DJ in a way. Because it's more just like, well, he played all great tracks and he couldn't mix for more than two bars, but it didn't matter because he played all my favourite tunes. And that's sort of, okay, that's fine, but that's never how a DJ used to be judged. It was always a bit more than that. And if you played a whole set. full of songs you'd never heard before. I would prefer that, you know? And I mean, there are some people who are great DJs and great producers. So don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to bag out all DJ slash producers, but there's a bit of a, you know, like the way things are promoted and... is not necessarily on that person's ability. When do you think that started happening? It's been happening for a long time, but I think it's got more and more prevalent. When someone asks you where they should go out in Sydney, what do you say? If your friend from Melbourne came up and said, hey, where should I go out? I think it's a totally week-by-week proposition, that one. There's no... There's no club where I could say, you should go there because every week that's just amazing. Did they used to be? Would you have happily recommended home or Chinese laundry? Back in the 90s? I probably should have, shouldn't I? But I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I guess for a little while the laundry was like, there was always a really good line up on the laundry. Home was a bit of a different proposition because it's just, you know, it's a big mega club. it's not like an intimate place to necessarily hang out with a couple of mates necessarily. Um, yeah, I think there's, there's usually something on every weekend in Sydney that I would be able to recommend to somebody. But, um, yeah, it's just, it's totally week, week to week. Cause there might be a good warehouse party on, there might be, you know, a club night on. Lots of really good bars to go to. Do you think it's like that around the world? How do you mean? They're all... It seems like they're... Maybe it's just based on Sydney's relatively small population, but there are places in... Well, I don't agree with that. Sydney has a small population. We've got nearly 5 million... We're about 5 million people here. Really? That's a big city. Yeah. You go around the world and there's not too many cities of more than 5 million people. Do you think, what is it about Sydney then that, what fosters these kinds of things that you aren't happy with in terms of? What do you mean? Like, the producer DJ thing. I think that's a worldwide thing. That's the way that it's a typical music promotion, you know, pitfall, I guess. Do you think Australia, Sydney, fosters talent as well as other places? No, I think we have a bit too much of an import culture. I think it's... a bit off-kilter, the balance, you know, there's certainly some good support. I think FBI's a good example of that, you know, where like 50% of the music they play is local and half of that has to be from Sydney, you know, because that's a reason to be there. to promote local music and to support local talent. And it is unfortunate that... Look at any festival line-up, for example, and on each stage, generally, there'll be two or three locals playing in the first two hours, and then there'll be, like, eight internationals, with no locals even playing, like, sets in between them, internationals. And to me, that's just... It's a little bit rude, you know? Yeah. Like, it's a little bit rude to sort of... see that there's no way a local could hold a peak time set or people aren't interested in seeing them you know fact of the matter is if you put a you know half the time a lot of people don't know what people look like anyway so they don't actually know and they have to actually just go by the tunes and So, you know, I just don't see why there wouldn't be a bit more of a mix. I mean, I don't mind if it's not me, you know. I'm not trying to just give myself a better time slot. But I just think that just would be a balance. And it just seems to me, it just seems like, feels like the right thing. Whereas having just... all about the internationals is not quite the right thing. You know, a promoter would say, oh, but everyone just wants to see the internationals. But I would dispute that, you know? And maybe that's because they've only ever seen the internationals at festivals anyway, because if you get there after about three in the afternoon, you're not likely to see a local. So, you know, it's sort of like a... it's a fait accompli, you know? So, and, you know, then I've spoken to Europeans about this as well, and it doesn't happen. I like that. I guess, because there are bigger acts who are locals, I guess, in Europe, right? But, um... Still, you know, like, I heard about some festival in Sweden, I can't remember which one, and, you know, they'd always get on the final set of the main stage, there would always be some, like, local, very local DJ who was just a DJ, just a DJ. Um... And he would always play the final set. And he knew the crowd, right? Better than any of the internationals. And so what better person to round out the day? with maybe some track that's been really big for that city and it's their special track. It just seems to me to make sense, apart from being like, oh, it's not fair that locals don't get it. It just seems to me you could actually create a better programmed festival that way. Did it used to happen when Parklife, for instance, started? A little bit more, yeah. I think it's just been a real move towards that, you know. That import culture, as you phrased it. Well, yeah, it is, it is. And I think in a way it almost used to be more. I mean, there's a little bit more happening here now and some people do get behind it and that's great. But I think it could be more of that, you know. Was the festival kind of... The festival situation in Australia is quite unique, I think. Would you agree? Well, I don't know, but I don't think it's really that unique. I think it's maybe a little different to other festivals because a lot of the festivals here tour all the major cities. It's like a festival tour. Circus. Yeah. Whereas, you know, like in Europe, for instance, it would be a one-off sort of festival, even if it might go for several days, but it's just in the one place. But apart from that, I think it's probably the same. There's a lot of the same things that you could probably say about what happens here and what happens there. I mean, it just depends on the festival and what the philosophy is behind that festival. And fortunately, you know, the festivals here tend to have a philosophy of, like, let's just... book the biggest artists we can and make the most amount of money we can, which is okay. There's definitely a place for that sort of festival. I'm sure there's plenty of that that goes on overseas, right? Like probably the majority of festivals. And then there are other festivals where, you know, they've obviously got a bit more of a different idea where, you know, they may not be quite so profit-driven and they might be a bit more kind of... arts driven or something you know and so they'll have a you know a different kind of sort of lineup and a different kind of crowd and you know um subsonic's a good example of that Yeah, I'd say it's probably a good local example of that. I think days like this was probably a good example of that. And possibly playground, you know? Back to Mad Racket. Why start Mad Racket 12 years ago? So first of all, who are the racketeers? Okay, so there's Jimmy James. Ken Cloud, who I did a lot of, I did a CD with him ages ago, so we've done lots and lots of DJing together. And also Zooty, the mysterious Zooty. We just started it because, well, me and Ken were doing lots of gigs, club gigs, and the other two, Jimmy and Andy, Zooty. weren't doing so many but sort of wanted to do good gigs and we just thought well let's you know we can't get to play exactly what we want necessarily every time we're playing down at the club so just put our own night on, you know, just for fun, you know. Why is it important not to have it in a night, in a, in a nightclub? In a nightclub. Yeah, because, Or why was it? Well, because, because if you do have it in a nightclub, first of all, the nightclub's got like history and, people associate it with this night or that night usually and we sort of wanted to get away from that but also just because you know you've got some other person's sound system that you don't have control over and you've got a bar manager or a club manager who you have to deal with right in whatever way even if you're putting the night on you don't want some asshole you know telling you this or that or giving you feedback about something that really not their business so well it sort of is their business because it's their bar right or their club so you just get away just to get away from that you know so we had complete control over it and how is it at the bowling club like So it's in Marrickville, which is a little bit out of the city. Yeah, it's sort of in a little industrial area just to the inner west of Sydney. It's only 15, 20 minutes outside the city. And it's a lawn bowls club. Lawn bowls club. Not a ten-pin bowling club. No, not a ten-pin bowling club. Lawn bowls. Yeah, it's good. You know, like with dealing with any... Any venue, you always have the ups and downs, but we're still there. Don't be thrown out. I think patrons drink quite a lot. Keep their bar quite busy. It funds them for a month. Yeah, it doesn't hurt them, that's for sure. Mad Racket attracts a type of loyalty that there aren't really that many. or parties you can really compare it to with regard to that. Why has that happened, do you think? On the RA podcast, for example, you said that a lot of our friends need to hire out babysitters now. Yeah, yeah. New Year's Eve was a great example. There were so many familiar faces that I haven't necessarily seen at a party for six months or a year who all managed to get sitters for the night and came out. I think people know that they're going to have a good time. They know that the crowd aren't going to be assholes. And they're of the age generally where they don't necessarily want to take a punt. You know, it's sort of like a safe bed almost in a way. It's sort of like, because people have been a lot of times and generally haven't been disappointed. I don't know, I don't know. I guess, you know, people must like it if they keep coming back, you know. What do the guest DJs, especially, well, the internationals, say when they get to the bowling club? Some of them have a funny little look in their eye before it's been all sort of set up and looks. a bit more like a club, they're like, oh, okay, yeah, right, no worries. But then the sound system turns on and they're like, oh yeah, that sounds pretty good. It fills up. And then when it gets full of people who are all screaming on the dance floor, they're like, yeah, this is pretty cool. What's it like being a vinyl DJ in Sydney? Tough. It's getting tough. People don't know how to service turntables anymore, seemingly. Or set them up. Or plug them back in. We may use their bloody Serato or whatever. Yeah, so... and people use turntable arms. For CD holders? CD wallet rests, which if they knew anything about turntables, they wouldn't do. But they don't obviously know anything about turntables, and so in a way it's better. At some places, like at the laundry now, they'll pull them out for you, but they keep them away in storage so they don't get... Trashed. Yeah, it is a good thing. But the number of just sticky, horrible, three-legged turntables I've had to play on in the last six months is pretty wrong. What's the word? Do you take CDs now as a backup? Oh, I always take CDs as a backup. You have to now. There's absolutely no way. You wouldn't dream of leaving CDs at home? No. Wow. No. No, it's a bit of a problem, really. But some venues are obviously a lot better than others. Where do you buy your records in Sydney these days? Spank? The Last Remaining. Yeah, I know you're a big record... Yeah, I still buy it at Spank Records. I'm going to have to give that Visa debit card. I'll start to give that a workout soon. But hopefully, you know, I do like to actually listen to records before I buy them properly. you can't really get a proper idea usually from the clips online and it's I do I like to support the local record store cheesy as that might sound there's something there's something in that maybe it's just because I worked in record stores for so long where were you working in Sydney I worked at a store in La Crosse called Warped Records. Yeah. And then I worked at Reichen Records. And I worked at Red Eye. And I worked a little bit at Machine Music as well. Yeah. Just that list seemed so... The fact that there were that many. It seems, I don't know. That's over 10 years, more than 10 years. But then I think I got over doing any sort of form of retail. It can be quite, you know, especially when you're mainly just sort of on the counter serving customers. It depends on the store, of course, but the general public can be pretty hard to deal with. No, you're a DJ. Oh, yeah. I just suck up for punishment. What's it like living off music in Sydney? It's not easy. It's obviously not easy because not very many people manage to do it. And I'm certainly not really accumulating much of a pension plan as things are at the moment. But it's okay, you know. It's alright. There were definitely worse ways to pay the rent. When did you... Did you play at all in London or did you get back to Sydney and buy? No, I was starting to collect music but I wasn't DJing at that point. So you brought them all back on the excess baggage? No, yeah, I sent them back. Yeah? Yeah, it was expensive. I hate to think what it would cost now. Yeah. It's quite expensive. How do you think staying in Sydney has affected your DJ career? I mean, I'm sure every young DJ has dreams of being an international, travelling around Europe or... Yeah, well, I mean, I've done some gigs in Europe. Tresor? Yeah, I played in Berlin and I played in... Barcelona and I played in the Czech Republic and in Hong Kong and yeah sure lovely to do that sort of thing but there's sort of two sides to it as well I think you can go over and become You know, I think in a way it would be harder to do it in Europe because there's more people doing it. And, well, I don't know. I don't know. I've spoken to a few people recently. Obviously, you know. very enthusiastic, like young, pretty young people and they're like, oh. Young Sydney-siders. Yeah. Who've maybe been DJing for like six months and then wanted, was like, I want to go to Berlin and DJ. And after speaking to people who live in Berlin and play there, like, it's really. not going to work quite that simply because every second person now in Berlin is either a DJ or a producer or something along those lines and in fact people don't make very good money doing it. in just in Berlin and it's quite hard to get bookings and if you do play somewhere they're just as likely to say okay no you can't play in Berlin for another three months because we want you exclusive. So, you know, if I went over to live there for some other reason as well, but I don't think I could do so much more over there than I can here. I just wish I would get to visit. go and visit Europe a bit more often, you know? Because that is the thing, I mean, we've sort of already spoken about import culture, but I did get flown over to Europe to play once, but people aren't offering tours to Australian DJs to go and play in Europe quite clearly. If you get yourself over there, you can probably get some gigs. But then we spend our entire time in Australia forking out airfares and sometimes way too big fees for European artists. So it comes back to that. be like, okay, how many times have I flown you out to Australia now? How about flying me back? Return the favor. Yeah. But I can't see that happening in a hurry. What has kept you in Sydney then? What do you... What's great about being a DJ in Sydney? Sydney's a good life. It's a good city to live in. It sounds kind of lame, but it is a good lifestyle in Sydney. I live by the beach at the moment. It's pretty damn good. is really bloody cold and quite miserable for a lot of that time and people sort of forget that there's all that side of life as well you know you go to Europe and it's cold and horrible and you know people are miserable for six months of the year yeah maybe you know if you could do six months here and six months there or three months there and then the rest of the time here i think that would be pretty ideal actually but uh someone books i haven't quite haven't quite managed to make that one happen yet um what kind of djs were were you going out to when you came back from London in Sydney? Who were the dudes? Well, I was actually going to a lot of, because I was primarily into like funk, jazz funk, you know, that. acid jazz sort of thing as well a bit you know the real dance floor music where you know people were having just as much fun if you know what I mean as at the rave parties and doing pretty much the same things but the music wasn't you know sort of breakbeat you know with you know Muppet you know vocals and stuff chipmunk vocals and you know all that sort of music which was fun music but I don't know if I could really enjoy it for a whole night it sort of turned my head a bit inside out you know um because they were big in Sydney back then well I guess they still are what like proper raves uh yeah they were big big big warehouse and like Yeah, big warehouse raves. There were lots. Yeah, it was very big. Yeah, but I was mainly going to like funk parties in little warehouses and stuff. And going to the occasional sort of ravey thing. Is there anyone still around from that funk kind of? Yeah, Trevor Parkey. Oh yeah, of course. Yeah, and Bernard as well. Yeah, there's a couple of people still around as well. You know, like Mark Walton was sort of doing that sort of thing. Stephen Ferris. Yeah, so there's still a few people, old buggers like us, kicking around. Who were your favourite DJs? Back then? Yeah. See there's a guy called Marcos who now does stuff in the UK under the artist name of Spiritual South. Maybe that's because he lives in Australia. And he's a great, great DJ, just really technically great as well as amazing music. There's always been lots of really good DJs in Sydney. Stephen Hawkins has always been good. Ben Drayton. Yeah. So you're a definite... You're a... You like someone to be technically... proficient oh it's proficient at least yeah yeah for sure which is important well maybe isn't as important now as it used to be well or to some people I've been told that you have to like mix like hard electro what they call hard electro music these days It basically has to be mixed within like sort of four to eight bars because you've got to get the mix in before the drop. Because you're a fan of the long mix. I am a fan of the long mix. Generally. It depends what style of music you're playing, obviously. But I do like the long mix. But yeah, I think the appreciation for the long mix is sort of... Dwindled. Is dwindled, like, severely. Yeah. Who are the DJs in Sydney that you rate these days? Look, I hate these questions. Do you? I hate saying, because then I always forget. I realize I've forgotten some of the best. That's okay, you don't need to. There's always lots of very good DJs. There are, you know, there really are. There's always heaps of great DJs. Some of them are like only playing like once a month, you know. Why? Seems like what you just said is a pretty common... I'll answer that kind of question. There are a lot of really good DJs that don't play out that often. And I guess for some of those DJs, it's not an actual... It's not a choice. They would like to play more. That culture of kind of do-it-yourself... Do you think that's exclusive to Sydney? Not at all. No, not at all. I think that's the same everywhere. If you're in London and you can't get a DJ gig, let's put on a party. Yeah, absolutely. I think that's what you have to do these days. You have to have to for quite a while now. And in fact, that's the only way to really promote yourself as a DJ now, is to have your own parties. And then once another promoter sees that you've X amount of people following your parties, then they go, oh, I'll have some of that. Come work for me and bring your crowd with you.
