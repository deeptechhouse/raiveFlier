Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith, and I'm the tech editor at Resonant Advisor. This week's exchange is with Henning Baer. After leaving West Germany in his youth, Baer moved to Berlin and founded Grounded Theory, which became a key... party in a city where a new brand of techno was beginning to emerge. Grounded Theory later grew into a full-blown agency and helped establish Bayo as a DJ emblematic of modern techno. But these days, his talents as a DJ, producer and label owner demand his full attention. In conversation with Matt Unicombe, Bayer describes the life-changing decision to close down his business in order to prioritize his development as an artist and his drive to make an enduring mark on the techno landscape. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Henning Bayer is up next. As you become a more experienced DJ, do you start to get a better idea about what's working where? Like you can listen to a track and straight away know that you can't play this in like a peak time set. Even though you really like it, you just kind of realize it's not the right energy, it's too weird. Maybe 10 years ago, you would have played that track in a peak time set and figured out eventually that it's not working. Yeah, well, I think obviously you develop a way clearer idea of what works when. I think you're getting more precise in, okay, I love this track, I like it, I would play it, but I would not play it, let's say, in a festival slot. peak time in front of a couple of thousand people. But that doesn't mean that you don't take it with you. So you keep it there. And I personally, I actually like to challenge myself while playing, especially with that type of tracks that might really dramatically, or you said drastically, change the vibe of a set. That is challenging to me, but also to the people. So kind of like getting them out of their... Four to the floor. Very... predictable dance floor vibe. I mean, obviously not ruining the vibe, but just like, you know, feed something in that is a little bit more challenging and then build the rest of a set again around that. Because I think it's always a good opportunity when you're playing that you drop something where you're like, let's see if this works. You know, I actually like that. But of course, I mean, there's certain tracks. that might be too lo-fi to play out and you know this will not make much sense, also in favor of the overall flow and vibe of a DJ set. Yeah, I guess that's the thing because you get more experience and it becomes like, as you say, maybe you don't always want to play tracks you know are going to work. Yeah. I never really thought about that before. I guess you're at the level now where you could play a totally functional set that you know is going to work, people are going to really love. But yeah, it would be missing this surprise thing. Yeah, the surprise is actually a good word. Because there's a lot of people who can play a very functional set that simply works. But then I think there's not that many who maybe dare to step out of their comfort zone during a DJ set. And I think that at least keeps it interesting for me, you know, changing rhythms, changing somehow, yeah, the tonality of a set. Yeah, I don't know, makes it interesting for me, especially when you play often, when you play a couple of times. during one weekend. That's the key, isn't it? Yeah. Like, how long have you basically been DJing a few times a month? For the last, or for the past two to three years now. And once this kind of starts happening, does your level go up immediately? I think you're getting more of a routine DJ. I think that does not automatically mean that you're getting a... better DJ I'm constantly working of getting better whatever better means better in reference to what I see you know where I maybe feel myself yeah you're getting routined yeah and maybe even I wouldn't say bored no bored definitely not bored because there's always adrenaline involved you know playing for people having people watch yourself expecting a good performance expecting to yeah to play a dope set So it's not getting boring, but you never play a complete new set. Because I guess you've been mixing for so long, you know the tracks, there's not much more to learn. Even though you say you are learning, maybe you learn slower once you're at this level. Yeah, I mean, also your performance is determined by external facts. let's say, technical situation. And also I had the conversation with someone actually past weekend when I played Fabric afterwards. It's also how good you perform is also determined by the mood in the crowd. You know, the energy they are giving you, how they make you drop the next record and drop, you know, just like, and every record is dope. Or there's nothing really coming back and you're like, what am I doing here? For you to feel good, you have to be getting some kind of energy back. Oh yeah, that's very essential. You know, especially like for me very much. I mean, I don't need, I like this, not looking at you or cheering at you. I get confused when people watch you too much. When they look at your hands, like every move you do, every knob you turn, they're like, yeah. It's a bit weird, isn't it? It freaks you out a bit. It can be very, very weird. And you're like, I had a couple of situations where I was like, I was mixing and you see a person being obsessed with watching you. And then you look up and you're like, why are you looking? This is a party, man. Just give him some drink tickets. Get yourself a drink. Just dance or whatever. But I think it is sometimes, you know, obviously when you're a DJ or when you are like more familiar with the scene, like people mixing, DJing, you know what they're doing. But I think sometimes people are just simply overwhelmed or cannot comprehend. what is going on, which actually is a good sign because they're like, what is this guy doing? It's not some weirdo trying to steal tricks. It's like someone who is somehow blown, like, whoa, what the hell is he even doing up there? Exactly, like watching your hands, watching your moves. What is the DJ doing here? And having obviously a good time. maybe a bit drunk, you know, but sometimes this is, it can be a bit bothering. Yeah. So I, I obviously like this, you know, cheering in the crowd or you just feel that people just like having an incredible time, just losing their self on the dance floor dancing. So this obviously is the type of feedback. like this instant feedback on what you're doing, which like makes you kind of like elevates also your capabilities. And sometimes you're like, wow, what am I doing here? It's just like, you know, you drop a dope track after a dope track after a dope. For me, at least, this is the instant gratification. for what you're doing as a DJ. You're on your way back to Berlin after a gig. How are you feeling at the end of each weekend? Maybe you've played on Friday and Saturday. It's a mix of being tired and fatigued because you didn't sleep much. You maybe had one or two vodka shots too much. When the two gigs were... satisfying which to be honest is not always the case when they were satisfying it's just like it's it's somehow very relaxed you know all the the tension maybe you had before or when you left Berlin because maybe you went to a new club, you've never been before, a new city, or you maybe didn't feel very well, you didn't sleep well, whatever. There was something on your mind. that kept bothering you. But then you go on the weekend, you play Friday, you play Saturday, you had great times. And then you're on your way back sitting in the airplane, maybe listening to some, I don't know, I have a certain ritual. I'm listening to Tangerine Dream basically on every flight I am. And you're like, you know, you let your mind just like recap what happened. That was actually very nice. And I get paid for it. And you get paid for it. Paid in terms of obviously in a monetary sense, but also in this gratification or the payment that is like, you know, a very emotional one. Because I've been thinking lately like about being a DJ. Like what other jobs can you go around and you're basically... Almost always, unless you play some horrible gig, the energy you're getting back from people is only positive. That is something actually I try to be aware of constantly, that this is something very, very unique. And not everyone is in the lucky position to have that type of job. There's a lot of people who hate their jobs, who really hate their jobs and feel like in a cage. But what we are doing, I mean, yeah, there's complaints about traveling. There's complaints about hotels and there's complaints about waiting at the airport. But when you break it down, it's complaining on a very high level. You know, it is something. that it's good to remind yourself of. And I think everyone, when you have a quiet minute, realizes in what wonderful position we are in. Were you... Doing the Grounded Theory booking agency, before you started DJing, as you say, you started getting more gigs two or three years ago. Your day job was basically this agency. Or were you also working elsewhere? When I started the party series, the event series, about seven years ago, together with my good friend Misha, I was obviously working another day job. And first we did the events and out of the events, the booking agency grew. The more and more busy the events, the agency and myself as a DJ got, then I stopped working that like normal day job. So when did you stop? That was about four years now. Is it a big life change? Do you feel better? Like are there downsides to just doing music? Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, obviously it is something I chose to do and something that developed into a very positive direction. And when you then realize you... do not need to do something else to pay your bills, you can just simply focus on what is like really the main element, the driving part in your life, then I would definitely call it like a very important changing point in your life. Has your lifestyle changed a lot? This is basically a Saturday for you, right? Wednesday. What day is today? It's Wednesday. It's Wednesday. So this is like your weekend. So I've pulled you in on a holiday day. Well, basically, because it is something I chose to do, I don't need that kind of like, you know, day off. I mean, obviously, you need a day off every now and then, but then there is no chance, no problem to like just work straight for like, you know, 10 hours because, 10 days, because there's always time. when you can relax or when you can step a little bit back. Because it is not a normal job where you're working for someone else that I'm in the urgent need of that. weekend that design of a weekend you know yeah you're kind of operating outside the normal social oh yeah yeah like also I mean I have sometimes I have a very weird like sleeping rhythm of course you know I go back I go to bed very late and I wake up when people are already awake since a few hours yeah I try to have a more normal rhythm that is according to everyone else rhythm. As much as I love the night and I love the vibe during the night and the energy flow during the night, I get a lot of stuff done during the night. But when you wake up at, I don't know, let's say 11 or 12, and then for a few people the day is already half over, you're just waking up. I try to get into a more normal rhythm. Maybe it's because you're a business guy for a while. You didn't have to do... Just DJing. You're more active. Yeah. Less lazy. Yeah, that's for sure. I mean, I'm restless. That is something that is a big element of my life. I like to make things happen. I was always driven by... by this need of doing something. I always had, like when you look at my career in that music business, I was basically doing everything with my very own hands. So I had to get stuff done to get it done. There was no one doing this for me. I mean, of course, I mean, I had together with Misha, we were doing the events together. But when it comes to the booking agency, I determined the success, you know. So I was like, okay, you get it done or you don't get it done. When you don't get it done, no one else will get it done for you, you know. So I was like... No gig that weekend. Exactly. So I was constantly in the position of, it's my choice. I want to do it. I want to work for it. You know, at the end of the day, I... Do not owe anyone a favor. I'm free, you know, and there was a time, I mean, this changed now because end of last year, I closed the booking agency. So the booking agency is now over because I found myself at a point, at kind of a crossroad. where I was like, okay, where do I want to go now? Because our all capacity and time is limited. And running an agency, even though I wasn't doing bookings as a booker anymore, but I was managing the agency. I had people, I had employees. Being there and running the agency in the background means still a lot of time and effort. And on the other hand, I got more and more busy as an artist in terms of producing music and DJing. So the 100% capacity was maxed out. But it was split between these two parts, like business and this creative life, which also includes business, you know. And I made the decision. decision because I thought and I'm still thinking you know the past seven years and the development and the split of my capacity and energy resulted in that I didn't I couldn't give 100% as an artist yet so I I made the decision to close down the agency and who is taking care of my bookings, I gave that to an agency I fully trust in. So I do not have to worry about this anymore. I do not have employees anymore, so I'm not responsible for them anymore. So I can 100% focus and concentrate on DJing and producing music. And I experienced the new energy and new capacity where I'm like, oh yeah, I wasn't aware of it. So you feel way better now. Yeah, I feel a lot of energy these days, especially when it comes to producing music, putting out music and DJing. Because there is... Nothing else I have to share my energy with. You know, there is no booking agent. business anymore, which resulted in more energy and more capacity for being an artist. So what was Berlin like when you started Ground and Theory in 2009? It seemed like for a while, you and Dystopian were the two main techno parties. Were there others around when you started? Actually not. I mean, of course, there were the established clubs, Tresor, Berghain. As independent promoters, there was only grounded theory and dystopian, as much I was aware of. I mean, I'm pretty much sure there were other event series going on. But in our universe, in our techno universe, there was only us, like the two crews. It was seven years ago, so we were all seven years younger, less experienced. And again, talking about innocence, we were all way more innocent. than we might be now because we have seen a lot of things going on. It felt very fresh actually. And outside of Trezor and Berghain, there was not much going on in terms of techno. So it was also kind of a challenging time. I remember when I visited or I met Norman Notch before our very first party, he wished us a lot of luck. that we are or that we will make this happen and that we can establish something because as far as I remember he was a bit I don't know everyone we spoke to were like well okay let's see good luck with that they were like these young kids let's see but then obviously we were at the right time the right place and I think we established something that inspired when you look at the landscape of promoters these days I think that inspired quite a few people with what they are doing now as like same as we got inspired by more of the club institutions, you know. Because that's the thing, I guess back then, I wasn't living in Berlin then, but there was the idea that like Berlin's a techno city. But actually, aside from the main clubs, like how many good techno parties are there on any weekend? Berlin is not as much techno. as it could be, I think. Do you think it used to be, there would be parties with Arkana Techno all over the place 20 years ago. It used to be bigger. I don't know it was bigger. I think it is quite big these days, you know, but definitely before Berghain, there was already like this scene going on, you know, and after there will also be this scene going on. And I came here 12 years ago. And when I came here, there was already this like the scene in full swing. I am not an original Berliner. It feels difficult to me to like really talk about what was going on in detail. I can definitely say that. where I came from, there was techno going on. So I assume and I'm pretty sure that in Berlin, it was the same case. Whereas I think that Berlin has always been very different to the rest of the country. Our starting point is seven years ago. I came here 12 years ago. So of course the times were different. That doesn't mean that they were obviously better or worse. They were just like different. And we took the chance to do something because we were driven by this, again, innocence. and believe that we can change something or give something back from what we have received over the years, that we were just like, yeah, let's give it a try. What kind of music was being played in other clubs? In 2009. Was it this Berlin Tech House melodic thing? I mean, yeah, you had Bar 25 and we all know what this stood for or still stands for. Because I was overwhelmed by what I experienced at Berghain. And so I was going mainly to Berghain. Yeah, I guess once you hooked on techno, you wouldn't be going to these random... Exactly, that's the thing. And it was quite a monoculture for me. I went to Berghain every weekend. Every weekend. I knew every stone in that building. I knew everyone. We knew everyone. We knew each other. So we founded this, like this, the basis. And out of that, we, as in Misha and I, we developed our idea of what we want to give back. Like I said earlier, you know, we had this, we came up with this idea of how to participate, not only as ravers. and living this like, you know, excess, you say excess, excess? Hedonistic kind of thing. You know, that has always been a very important element of it and will always be. At some point, we decided to create this. playground for the hedonistic approach of just raves, you know, and excess and like, you know, just living the moment and forget the world, you know. Yeah, I mean, I remember I went to clubs like Sternradio, Polar TV and there was this, yeah, you would maybe refer to it as this electro-clashy, very strong Berlin local heroes like Woody, Hausmeister and stuff like that. I remember those parties quite well. And that was a very good time, actually. But my heart was always beating Techno because Frankfurt was pretty much Techno City. And, you know, it was like that minimal era. Techno was somehow, it felt it was pretty far away. It was still going on, but it wasn't very present in the club scene. In Frankfurt. Here in Berlin, when I came here, it was like this vacuum, I think. And that's why the early years of Berkheim or the new emerging techno was also different to what we have these days. So it was like, you know, this transition phase from this minimalish... to like more techno-y style of techno, you know. So I felt this vacuum of like proper techno. So what's the difference now? What's the sound like now compared to Berlin in like 2007? I guess they were playing way slower. Slower. And I think these days, besides that it is pretty fast again, it's also very hard. there's a tendency at the moment that it's like this very like banging. This UK thing, right? Yeah, like really raging, like hard kicks and percussions. And that was different. I think when you listen to the first Burkine Mix CD, that is still a reference. of what was the sound back then. When I listen to it, it reminds me a lot on what was going on years ago. So it was definitely slower, more melodic. It was a different time and a different sound, but it felt as something new changing in terms of where the journey will go. Have you enjoyed the progression to where techno is at now? Yeah, of course. And I can say that I feel part of it, not only as a techno lover, a raver, I'm part of it in terms of an artist. I participate and I, that at some point I realized I have the possibility to produce content. to create music, to create art that is part of the scene. Yeah, you can add to this whole thing. Exactly. This is something very, very powerful that you become part of a movement and that you realize that with what you do... you give that your own personal twist in terms of originality, that you, yeah, have this very powerful tool of giving something into this like... machine you know and like feed it so when did you have that realization and why i was always playing around with synthesizers and software even before i moved here i i think i was like at the age of like 16 17 18 when i when i started like having a first contact to producing music but There was never someone who told me or showed me. There was no... I was basically kind of like an autodidact. And then things got more into the direction of hardware. And I enjoyed that quite a lot. But it was more like just playing around. There was never the idea of recording music and putting that out. Because there was like... I think I never thought about that. the chance to do that. But then when I met Milton, that was in late 2009, because he played our second party in December. I actually heard about the story, how you actually met, how you got given his record. Who is this guy? Exactly, exactly. I mean, I contacted him via MySpace because I wanted to buy... his third release on Do Not Resist the Beat because I got, Marcel Detman gave me the first Do Not Resist the Beat two minutes after Milton dropped the first batch of records at Hardwax. And I bought it without listening to it, just based on Marcel saying, you have to listen to this. Take this, dude. Take this. So I took it, took it home, put it on the record player and I was like. Damn, this is pretty dope. It's very nautical. You can refer to it as deep. But it was something like I maybe haven't heard before that like caught my attention. I didn't really. pay attention to who produced it. Just saw this Do Not Resist the Beat. Yeah. That was the time when there were a lot of white labels, you know. So white label was like white label releases were quite in fashion. So it was just another anonymous or white label project where you didn't really put attention to who produced this. You know, this like whack. It's like Marcel Devin selling you his own record. Yeah, take this one. You know, also the first MDR releases, they were just like hand-stamped white label action. That's how they, you know, described it on Hardwax, on the website. I bought like number one because of Marcel actually telling me to buy it. I bought number two and when number three came out, it was sold out at Hardwax and I got in touch with Milton via Myspace. We met up in front of Hardwax. He sold me his record. To that time, we did already number one, like GT number one, and we were planning the second party. I asked him if he would be interested in DJing. And I mean, afterwards, I realized that his main approach of like, or why he put out music was that he had a time where he was like very, very, he, I mean, he grew up with techno. And then he left techno for a bit because he wasn't, he didn't feel inspired by what came out. And then he started producing music and putting it out to basically DJ again. So I hit a soft spot and I asked him if he would be interested in DJing for us. And of course, he said, yes, sure. This is on the spot at Hardwax. On the spot in front of Hardwax. And this is then how our relationship... actually was initiated, you know. And he played a good set the first time? As far as I remember, it was actually pretty good. It was, who played? It was Don Williams, Convection, Oliver Ho, and... Milton Bradley. So you've always been into this UK stuff. If you had Oliver Ho. Yeah. I mean, I, before I did my own parties and before I put out my own music, I was, I had always a strong connection to, to the UK in terms of music. I was very, I was a big, big, big fan of this wonky techno. Neil Landstrom, Mark Hawkins, Michael Forshaw, like these very rough and nasty C-back. And, you know, there's this label Sativa, Subhead, Trezor. I still refer to it as definitely an inspiring genre. So my connection to UK techno has always been very strong and I enjoy playing that type of music quite a lot. Do you meet many people who have had this, like, see how you say Milton stopped being inspired by techno for a while? It seemed like it happened to a lot of people in the early 2000s, maybe. I've heard that story a lot. I just wonder what was going on that so many people didn't like. Well, I think there was this extreme hype of minimal techno and this loopy techno killed it somehow. So when you look at what was happening end of the 90s, beginning of the 2000s, there were like... very hard and repetitive loop techno and that just like killed killed the scene killed the killed the techno movement and then after that came this this very strong and uh you couldn't escape the the minimal hype and the presence of minimal techno everywhere so people who used to play downwards would then switch would have switched to like start playing minimal Well, I think, you know, some people changed and adjusted to what was going on and what was in fashion, because I think to some people it also felt fresh and you go with the flow. But I think a lot of people just either stopped. or kept on doing their thing, but they were definitely not present and not on their radar because no one wanted to listen to that stuff, you know. So when then techno came back, I think a lot of people somehow woke up again, you know. This, what you say, hibernation, you know, was over. You know? Yeah, they were like, oh yeah, I think techno is back. And then they started either doing music again or started their career after they have experienced techno as a raver years ago. Then maybe we're not that interested anymore in going out because the sound changed, the aesthetics changed. They were just like, you know, they were busy with something else. And then, yeah, I don't know, techno came back. And they were again inspired and took the chance. Or young... kids who had like no history or like let's say in the early 90s who were just too young I mean I was also too young to like you know refer to myself as a raver beginning of the 90s you know I was like nine years old or something you know so I grew up with that second wave of techno and or became part of the scene when did you start buying techno records? that started actually quite early I think when I was around 16 because my sister is eight years older and I remember my sister She got her driver's license in 1995. She drove to Mayday 1995 in Dortmund. She was going to techno raves, you know, she had a boyfriend who was a DJ. And actually he inspired me in terms of buying records and DJing. He also inspired me in terms of producing music. He was living in the city of... Essen, which is like near Cologne. And he was a resident DJ there. So he visited my sister and he brought his records. And I got into this, the art of DJing because of him. And I got my first set of turntables and a mixer. to a time when that was affordable. So I didn't, my first decks weren't techniques. I think it was like reloop players you could buy in a magazine called Elevator. And I started buying records. There were mail orders, but I bought them in a physical store, going to stores in Frankfurt. There was Delirium. I was actually quite active in terms of traveling to clubs. I was born or grew up and lived near Frankfurt, so we drove to Frankfurt to rave and also to buy records. We drove to Cologne to go to warehouse or to buy records in a Cologne store. We drove to Kassel where there was Stammheim. I drove to Hamburg to Vonnodrom, that was another club. Yeah, we were quite active in terms of driving through. the country and going to clubs. So if you're a German mom and your son or daughter gets hooked on techno and is traveling around to clubs, going to raves, in Australia, my mom would be terrified. It just seems like it's so much more accepted here in Germany. Maybe there wasn't this idea of like, oh, my son's going to go to a rave and die, you know? Yeah, well... What's it like? Well, I have to say that I have parents that gave me the freedom of doing everything I want. Because I think their strong belief is that they can't stop or couldn't stop me from doing it anyways. So they were like, Henning, if you think this is the right thing to do, then do it. If you fail... No problem. We will still be here. So I always had the feeling of whatever I do, my parents trust in me, you know, in every sense of my life. Yeah, when it then comes to techno, maybe they weren't really aware of what it means, you know. Not that they were like... crazy things going on but I think if they would have known what in detail happens in a club or at a rave they would have been more concerned and more nervous lying in bed knowing their son... Where's our Henning? Exactly. So it was a combination of simply not knowing what was going on with their trust in, okay, if this is his thing, you know. then it's his thing. So is the guy that inspired you to DJ, does he know what you're doing now? Does he know you're a DJ? Well, it's actually very funny. I produced my very, very first techno track. In a studio, he was running with his friend. I think I still have, because I visited him where he was living and reproduced his track. I think I still have it somewhere on a tape somewhere. Well, that was about it. Like I said, he was inspiring me in terms of like DJing and also this whole music thing. He split up with my sister, so he was away at some point, you know. But then, thanks to social media, I got contacted on my artist page through his friend, who sent me a message like, oh, are you the brother of Julia Henning? You remember me? And I was like, man, yeah, I do. Actually, I do. So we got in touch and we spoke and we were having a really, really great conversation about what was going on back then. And then he also put me in touch with my sister's ex-boyfriend. Yeah, we had also like a short conversation. So, yeah, he is aware of what we are doing. And I actually told them. think because of you of you guys i am doing what i am doing and um that was actually quite yeah that was a very very nice moment you know after all these years that's yeah like 16 years ago i guess there was probably nice for him to hear as well yeah i think so i mean he from what i know is that he has no connection to techno and like whatsoever His friend Rudi, he is tour managing, more into like a commercial side of electronic music. But Timo, that's his name, he is doing something completely different. Yeah, but nonetheless, I mean, it was a very interesting moment when you reflect and all of a sudden realize, because yeah, I mean, I was very young and I... You know, I didn't think about what was basically going on and what like what am I doing now is like has where the connections between 16 years ago and now are. But people from like I grew up with, they contacted me and they told me my first girlfriend, she also reached out to me and she said. Oh, it's funny to see that dreams can come true. I was like, what do you mean by that? She was like, you always wanted to be a DJ. And I was like, oh, did I say that? So, you know, the puzzle is coming together. For me, it was never a hip thing to do. I was just following what I felt. There was no concept of, okay, I have to do this and that. It was this very natural, ongoing evolution. This is the purest thing. This is what the best DJs are like. They're not doing it. for ego. They're not doing it because it makes them look cool in front of their friends. It's just somehow inside them. That's why there are so few really good DJs, because most people are doing it for other reasons. Yeah, exactly. Because I think, you know, these days, artists, DJs, producers appear different than they did like years ago, I think. Let's say a 21-year-old boy or girl might have a different idea of what it means to be an artist than I might have had with 21 or even younger. The definition of what it means, well, also back then, might have been different for everyone else. But the way I experienced it, because I never had the idea of making this my career. becoming a professional DJ or producer. I was just like enjoying it. I was enjoying myself. I was enjoying, first of all, going to raves, listening to techno in a dark room with strobe light with my friends, buying records. spinning records, playing around with software, having a certain interest in synthesizers, even though there is no musical background in my family, you know. It really came from my inner whatsoever. There was no one who showed me this, triggered this or whatever. And then like, yeah, 16 years later. You speak to the guy who took you to his studio and you produced a track with him. And you're like, yeah, man, now the picture becomes kind of like complete. Do you still have many friends that aren't into techno? Like that aren't deep into this whole thing? Like old friends from school? Or is it the further you get deep, the deeper you get into music? Maybe the less you interact with people who aren't. Well, I have to say that I had to escape where I grew up. Escape in terms of that, I was always very different to everyone else, I think. I didn't have an easy time in school. I was always the one who made the most trouble. I was always the one who did not understand the concept of authority. I was the one who nearly got kicked off school. banned from you know school trips what's the worst thing you did at school anything that's i don't know just just stupid stuff mischief Yeah, I mean, I didn't fit into the system. Like many others. I had quite a tough time to go through all this. And like I said, my sister is older. She moved away. She always wanted me to leave as well. So what's the town you're actually from? It's in between Frankfurt and Cologne. It's called Koblenz. But I had to escape there because at some point after I finished my school, I had the feeling that the sky is falling on my head. Because it is very West German, I wouldn't say countryside style, but just not a very inspiring surrounding for maybe a character like me. So I was like, I need to get the fuck out of here. And my sister, she moved to Hamburg. And she was a good example or she was actually, she was a reference to me. Yeah, then I moved to Berlin with 21. I never lived alone before. I was living with my parents. And yeah, then I decided to go to Berlin. I think that was... a more difficult time for my parents than knowing her son is going to techno raves with like 16 or 17. Yeah. So for them, this, was more challenging because obviously the distance, 600 kilometers away and like the big city of Berlin that gave them more sleepless nights. Yeah, so in your hometown, was there an idea of Berlin being this weird place? I do think so, yeah, yeah, yeah. because that typical design of a West German city beginning of the 2000s was very different to what was going on in Berlin and they had a clear view or idea of what is going on in Berlin. Yeah, it's like this, you know, the capital, you hear a lot of stories on, you know, news like crime whatsoever. Going to Berlin or going away from there to Berlin, for me, it was very, very needed and very essential. Otherwise, I would have been caught up by this or I would just have been the guy. yeah I'm still making trouble I found my peace here I didn't want wanted to be the guy who will always stick out of everyone of the mess you know but down there you know you do something and I saw you and then he avoided him again But here, I came here and I realized no one actually cares what you are doing. And I found this very, yeah, that gave me peace. That gave me the chance to just sit back and relax. And then obviously also doing this cut and cutting off all the connections to the people. allowed me to realize who I am really. Then finding techno as this main element of my life. making your hobby to your career, your job, you know, that was like very satisfying and fulfilling. What is actually important to mention in terms of my evolution as an artist is that I always enjoyed and I always will enjoy that business part of it, you know. I think those dynamics in the scene, when it comes to the people in the background, that is something that interests me a lot. You know, I was always, like I said, interested in making things happen. doing my own thing, doing it maybe different than other people would do it. It is something that I always wanted to leave my footprints because I said, when I leave this world, when I leave this planet, I want to say that I participated and I, you know, something that I did might have had a relevance. to some people that might have affected other people, inspired other people. Might it be business-wise, let's say, the event series that inspired other people, but also music-wise. I want to create something that has a relevance and that inspires other people and that overlives time or people can refer to as something. as part of technosy, the creative world. With closing down the agency and starting my own label and having this platform to release music that I feel is important to put out is something that's somehow a second spring of my personality. Because again, I cut. So I cut things off like, okay, I stopped the agency, something that was actually a main element that took a lot of my energy and capacity and I got rid of it for good, you know, because I believe in that sometimes we have to let things go. and put things to an end and be challenged. Same like in a DJ set, when you play that record where you are a little bit unsure of how this will go, but it is good to do so because then you, first of all, you cannot say you didn't try and you just went the conventional way. the way that works, you know? So yeah, closing this down and saying, okay, in favor of myself and to experience this, the new wave of creativity, I shut this down before I lose the grip, you know? That that's what I what I experienced throughout my life, that I have to keep it fresh for myself. Otherwise, at some point I just get bored, you know. So, yeah, having this this new platform, closing down quite a few things made me think of new possibilities for the future, you know. This is mainly in creative sense. When you talk about performance, why not working on a live set? Why not working on an album? You know, all of a sudden, all this because of having the time to making your mind about things and new things and new possibilities to express yourself. become relevant and you're like yeah that sounds like a good idea instead of doing emails exactly yeah I do not write I mean when I look into my like the inbox not that long ago I realized man I'm not sending a lot of emails anymore this is great you know what am I doing oh I spend a lot of time in the studio I got an even clearer idea of how I want to produce music. I can simply focus on being an artist. This is what I always wanted. And I was aware of this, that I come to this point already a few years ago. You know, I wasn't done with creating that like business part, the agency part, the event series part. But I was always aware and I spoke about it with Misha. I was like, yeah, at some point that decision has to be made and will be made. And I did this last year, end of last year, and 2017 for me looks, it looks very inspiring and it looks, it feels very good. What was the decision to shut the agency down like? Like, were you thinking about it for weeks and weeks? Or you kind of, it just came to you and think, this is what I have to do. The more and more I got busy with like touring, the busier the agency got. I realized that I cannot give 100% for either the agency or for myself as an artist. And I had a situation where I was touring Australia for the first time. And I sat in the hotel in Melbourne and something happened here in Berlin where I was like, you know what? I think I should be in Berlin right now, but I am not. Because... You're the furthest possible place from Berlin. Exactly. And that gave me the feeling of, okay, I don't want things to go... wrong just because of me not being present because running and managing an agency means you have to be there yeah even though you have people working for you yeah there's there's the need of someone who's like you know supervising it whatever and I felt this like yeah but on the other hand you know Obviously, I enjoy being away, touring, playing for people, going from here to here, to Japan, to the US, to Australia, touring Europe. Yeah, but that will affect the agency work at some point. And then I had the chance to sign up with a new agency. Actually, the process of thinking about it was actually quite a longer process of like weeks and months. But then the actually, okay, let's do it. That happened quite quick because I just took the chance, explained this to everyone else, everyone involved, the artist, obviously. Luckily, and I'm very thankful for that, is everyone understood what I was talking about. I guess they could see your position. Like if you want to do one thing. Exactly. Yeah, I think everyone can refer to the situation and realize, yeah, we understand you. I mean, obviously it had an effect, but luckily everyone found a new home. So no one was left behind because that was also my responsibility to not just like say, oh yeah, Henning wants to move on. Goodbye. Good luck. Did you consider like just stepping away and letting the agency kind of run itself? Well, therefore, I am too much of a person who wants to have control over what is going on. Either I run it or I shut it down. That was the only two options because I enjoy being part of it and I enjoyed having this agency because now I have this experience with running an agency. I could do that again at any given time. That also gives me this certain security. You can do things after, let's say, your artistic career. based on what you have done before your artistic career. That gives me, again, the confidence to say, OK, full-on 100% artist. One thing I wanted to ask, but we didn't really get around to it. How do you look for music now? Obviously use a lot of digital media to discover stuff. And obviously you're getting sent lots of promos. Lots of promos. Sometimes I get a bit overwhelmed because I collect the promos I get throughout the week and I put them in a folder. And when I then open the folder, I'm like... god damn it there's a lot a lot of new music so it takes quite a few hours to go through it select it obviously you have to give feedback to download the music. So yeah, new music I get through promos, older music obviously through, I love YouTube. You dig deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper. Discogs is great. Record stores, I have to say, I could spend more time in record stores. But based on my experience that I buy, I bought a lot of records used in record stores. And in the end, I didn't play it out. You know, I spent a lot of money on records that just ended up in my record shelf. And I cut that down a little bit. And I get more efficient when I discover something online and hunt it down than in the real world. Yeah, because I guess in the real world, you're more excited. You're like, oh, yeah, I'll take it. Sounds good. It's instant buy. Kind of you just take it because you think, oh, maybe I'll play it. Exactly. And I realized that this, maybe I'm going to play it. Okay, no, you better leave it here because you won't play it. I would say that I'm more present online. I then take it. offline so to say go to a record store and from there on you can then again discover and dig deeper but like the initial like kind of like search search for new stuff happens for me at least mainly online because I also got over you know you go to let's let's say, record loft, and you're in front of thousands of records. And you're like, oh, yeah, basically, I have to listen to every single one because I might, you know, miss something. Yeah. You know, and that gives me the feeling of, yeah, I'm overwhelmed by the sheer amount of music I do not know. And I just cut it off. not look at it because then I'm not aware of... Ignorance is bliss. Exactly. That's exactly the thing. This is how I channel the amount of input we got. Well, okay, online there's also a lot of stuff, but it goes quicker. That's what I think. And with experience and the longer you do it, at least I developed a very efficient system of not getting lost online because this is also what can obviously happen. I have my channels where I find I don't waste too much time actually. I would say I waste more time in record stores than I waste time online, I think. And you're playing a lot of new stuff. Yeah. Because I've been thinking, so many good house DJs are only playing old stuff or mostly old stuff. But it seems with techno... The top people are still... There's lots of great techno still coming out. Oh, yeah. And I wonder what that is about techno. There's old techno that... obviously is still and will always be unbeatable. But I get so much new music, which fits together with old music, because obviously new music has reference to old music these days quite intensively. When you look at older downward stuff, there was a time when there was a lot of new downward styled techno. But I find new and modern techno actually quite fresh, you know. I enjoy playing that out and combining it with older stuff. Obviously, we have to refer to the past to understand the present and also to create the future. But only playing classics. Techno was always about, you know. Evolution, something new. That's what I was thinking. That's how techno has escaped this totally retro thing. Because there's still this idea of the new. Exactly. And I think these days we have the possibilities due to technology, software, but also new hardware. to create music that is future sound. I mean, okay, there's the saying that there's nothing new under the sun. But as long as you somehow think that what you are doing is new, then we should work on that and use the chance and use the possibilities to create something new. of a reference to older stuff but yeah let's look into the future and yeah play out classics but Do not rely on what people have been doing years ago. Just like, yeah, I don't know, find your very own way. I think it would be boring to play only modern and new stuff. And it's also boring to just play classics, you know, because you're not a jukebox. You're not a hit machine. You're not, you know, just combine it. And this is the way I enjoy it the most. The combination of also. playing records, playing CDJs. The combination of the formats is something, and again, technology with CDJs. You can do things you cannot do with vinyl, obviously, which is actually something very interesting. So I try to combine the old world, the new world. And create something. That's the thing. Because when you're combining it. That is creating something new. Yeah. And I think this is. We're actually living in very great times. And people are very open to stuff. And people are very interested in hearing new stuff. And it is challenging to make great new stuff. That has an impact. And that is the challenging part of it, is what actually makes you as an artist feel alive and obviously challenged to create, to do your best. you
