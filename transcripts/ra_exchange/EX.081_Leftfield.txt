you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Saoirse Ryan and I work within the London team for Resident Advisor. British duo Leftfield's beloved electronic music is an amalgamation of early house, reggae, breaks and more. Gone since the early 90s, they still to this day have only released two albums, Leftism and Rhythm and Stealth, the former of which has been consistently cited as one of the best albums of that decade. One of my first ever electronic CDs was Leftism, so you can imagine my excitement when I was asked to come and meet with member Neil Barnes for the RA Exchange. I wrote down many questions, none of which I got to ask. You know, when I was asked to come down and meet with you, obviously I did my own changing of the jokes and looking back at past interviews and one thing that I really, really noticed, yeah. That there were the same questions reappeared again and again. Like for instance, what's it like to work with John Lydon? Yeah. Or, you know, you, what were you doing for the eight years when you weren't touring with Left Field? What does it feel like to be back? Oh, yeah, yeah. We know that you were working on adverts, demos, your own composition, everything like that. And that it was great to be back as left. Yeah, suddenly it was great, yeah. Just magically sprinkled some fairy dust over it. And there you go. And then we were out there again. Yeah. It was a bit like that. Yeah, well, there you go. So we know that now. Well, if anyone who didn't know, they do. Yeah. I think what I wanted to, what I was really keen to find out was how you got to, before any of that, the kind of aptitude of production skills before leftism, or before left field, sorry. Oh, right. So, you know, before you became left field, as you became left field, what kind of level were you at then? Absolutely. But I mean, it was a very different world. I mean, it was like 1986, 85. I mean, I'd been interested in music. I mean, I was sort of, I mean, you did sort of, I did an apprenticeship in music, really. in terms of just listening. Right. What does an apprenticeship music like in 86? Well, I mean, can you imagine what a fantastic time to be sort of young between 1979 and 1980, you know, right the way through the movement of sort of punk and new wave and disco and neuromanticism. I can't imagine like what I was there. Electro. I mean, I was there. As a matter of fact, I went out with a friend the other day, an old mate of mine, and we were talking about the fact that from about 1979 to about 1983, we went to see a band nearly every night. every single night, I just was obsessed. We were obsessed by music. There was nothing else to do. There was no, you know, we liked films. I remember we went to see Alien and we were talking about going to see Alien and how much effect it had on us then. I mean, things like that were just, there was no internet. There was hardly any... television the the cinema you know you there were just scenes which is what's different about you know now everything feels like one large scene it's very hard to create a unique feeling these days it's very easy attainable by everybody I mean actually I sort of feel like revolutionally if I was young you know, I would ban the internet. I would not have my music on the internet. I would not. Because it's too accessible. I think it's too easy. But in those days you had to go, you had to work to find, and there were all these different scenes all over the country. You know, you had the Sheffield scene, which you got, you know, sort of OMD and all the wonderful bands. come out of Sheffield electronically, Manchester, you've got New Order and Joy Division, you've got the whole Scar thing in London, the punk thing everywhere, disco, Manchester, some really interesting, and we were, I was at those gigs, I swear to you. You were travelling around. Well, mainly in London, I swear to you, I mean, I saw so many monumental musical events. I saw the Pistols, I saw, I saw the first time I saw Joy Division when they were, before they became Joy Division. I saw them as Joy Division. I saw the first New Order gig. I saw the first time Bambaataa played. I was, I saw everybody and everything to do with music. So I had a really, really clear. I mean, I gave up being in a band because I couldn't afford a drum machine, you know. Well, after we went to see Bam Barta, we went to see him and we were just blown away by it. And we just saw this mad machine. And it was like, and we were, I was in the band and it was like quite a public image to me. And we were, it was quite good. It was quite. guitar but funky disco because we were into disco and then we went to see we thought we've got to have one of them what is that got to have that drum machine so we went to ask about it three thousand pounds that's ninety three grand like so expensive so we stopped I stopped the band because that's it forget it forget it what's the point we can't we can't make that music until the technology you know and so I stopped making music in about stopped in about 1982 I just gave up I did other things I was still buying music and then I I was teaching I got I was a teacher I fell into teaching god knows how teaching what further education high you know so adolescence yeah and I I was I I was into percussion so I learned congas and I was interested in that just because I wanted to. I know I could never be a conga player. I was not... I was sort of... following it yeah then i i for some i don't know how it happened or what it was i started to read about technology and i started to think about sampling i heard this word sampling and i knew there were records that like um oh god there's that famous record that oh there's so many so i'm not nine well 19 obviously no no no 19 and sampling It started to creep in. Yeah. And I bought an Akai S950 sampler and I took it home and I set it up in my studio. I nicked a keyboard off my brother, which I've still got, a Juno 106, and a desk, and this magic thing called MIDI. Suddenly, after about a week of just not, what the fuck am I doing? I was suddenly realizing that I could sample up things. And I had this little sequencer, so I'd... I had two little sequencers. I had an HHB Alesis drum machine and an MMT8 sequencer. How did you know how to use them? Because nowadays people just go on tutorials on the net and everything. Basically, the guy in the shop sort of roughly showed me and then I was trying to figure out this MIDI thing. And then gradually, I mean, you just keep doing something and eventually suddenly the penny can drop. And it's very simple. I mean, all it is is like a MIDI really is telling, it's just telling the computer when to start and when to stop playing things. When I understood that concept in my head, I started to say, okay, so. The sample is over there. I put all these samples in there on different MIDI tracks. Then when I press a key and I forget that onto the same MIDI track, it will play the sample. Yeah. It was like, that was like magic. Because there's nothing actually in it, MIDI. But it was just suddenly, for years and years, you've been someone that's interested in music and the only way you could get to do it was to go into a really expensive studio and get told by someone that you couldn't do something that way. No, no, no, you can't have the bass drum that loud. No, no, no, you can't do that. No, no, you can't do that. You can't gate up vocals and make rhythms out No, no, can't do anything like that. So you just like, it just felt like a place that was the, there was a language of the priesthood. So were you just like, well, I'm going to do it anyway? Sorry? Were you just thinking, no, I'm going to do it anyway, I don't care what you say? I suddenly realised that I just wanted to get something out of my system. And so I went away. to Australia with my now wife and I said to her I said well when I get back everyone's got everything she keeps saying to me she says to me you said to me that you everything was going to be different when you got home yeah I don't know what I thought about that I didn't know what I was doing and then I and I said apparently I said that to her so I got my MMT8 my sequencer and my and I started sampling up music and I made a track called Not Forgotten on it. It's the first thing I did. So that was just you that did that? Yeah, yeah, and it's the first thing I did. I just did this really raw thing. A bit like how stuff is now. No effects. I didn't have an effects unit. Yeah. So it was just samples looped up. And the idea of it was, I went to see the film Mississippi Burning. And I thought, well, I do an alternative version to Mississippi Burning. So I sampled up bits of Mississippi Burning. Yeah. what's wrong with these people, there's a bit in the scene, where he goes, and then I just put this track together, and I played it to my mate Neil Cole, who actually became, Jum Jum because I knew he was a conga player he played it to Rhythm King and for some reason I had this whole big headed notion in my head you know that I was I remember I sent it to Pete Tong there's a copy of Not Forgotten on Pete Tong's desk somewhere but I never heard back from them and then I took it into Rhythm King and I played it to them and they went oh yeah it's quite good come away when you've got some other stuff so I thought oh yeah and then they came back and they said to me oh no no we want to do it right so that was it so I went into a studio like this and I did it and with this engineer who was doing things like what's what? Revert? What's going on? compression stuff like that which was still and um yeah so that was just everyone was oblivious to it at that stage it got really raw if you listen to early but the funny thing about it is that um I was on the same label as Warp because the early Warp was was connected to Rhythm King so all those early Warp records LFO yeah things I knew those guys so I was on out of rhythm they were on warp and we were actually making electronic music at the same time at the same time I met Paul yeah and Paul was in a band called a man called Adam and he had a final did you mean him just through percussion because we went and we used to play percussion in clubs and I met him and we hit it off immediately and he was not happy with where he was going and he had a far more clubby understanding of club music and although I was into all the records he had I didn't get this club I suddenly started to get this mentality of hang on making music for DJs or making music he got hold of Not Forgotten Remix We remixed it together in the studio and then I left it. We used to cut things up on tape. So we had tape, reel-to-reels, and we had quarter-inch tapes. I'll just never forget this image of walking into... I was doing a track in the main studio. It was a youth club and it was actually in Covent Garden. It was an amazing space. It was a bit like this. It was like a youth place where people, and we talked our way in there. Really? Yeah, we talked our way in there. And then I was in the studio doing this other track. And then I remember walking into this little cubby hole with Paul, like, with a tape machine, quarter-inch tape machine, pair of headphones, tape all around the room where he'd cut bits off. Don't light anything. It's fantastic fun, though. It's fantastic. There's nothing like editing using tape. It's such a wonderful experience and it's so easy. Really? Yeah, it's easy. Once you know how to do it, I'll show you how to do it in 10 minutes. And it's easier on half-inch machines because they move at a slower rate so you've got more space between the beats. In quarter-inch, it's moving faster. So you basically just find the bass drum. Because I've seen a few DJs do it, like Greg Wilson and everything. It's a doddle. Basically, you just find the bass drum, you get to your edit point, roughly, and then you start doing it. You move it, you find the click, you take it out, you mark it. You count on 16 bars, find the next click, cut it out, and you've got 16 bars worth of edited material. Obviously the bass drum has to be in the right place. And then you join the bits up, and you make an edit. You never know where it's going to sound. That sounds so raw, though. It's really nice. And that's how the Beatles worked. That's what the Beatles did. That's how the Beatles created so many different things. From using tape. Backwards. Strawberry Fields Forever is the most famous example of editing ever done. They did it themselves. They edited from one version to another. Slower tempo and the wrong key. they brought the temper down they brought the key up and they managed to do this mad edit if you listen to Strawberry Fields it's quite an interesting bit of producer nonsense but about 1 minute 16 into Strawberry Fields you listen to it and you get home if you listen to the beginning of Strawberry Fields all the snare and the drums and everything is different you get to 16 and they edit out one minute 16 they edit out of this version into a completely different version later in the song you'll hear that completely different sounding track really and that's all done with an edit yeah they used tape creatively because they didn't have much else they didn't have sampling they didn't have you know they just had a very simple setup it's a sunny tape so that's how well they used to sort of do things like um well he did it the tyres backwards guitar they they they record a bit of guitar at double the speed yeah roughly try and get it right put it back to the normal speed it'd be half speed so it would run really slow and then turn it round so you'd cut the tape and turn it round and it would come backwards and there's loads of backwards guitars on Beatles records I mean they revolutionised all of it everything we do the majority of what we do they did that's what's so radical about Beatles whenever people stake the Beatles off they've done all they're talking about because basically they revolutionised a lot of the effects putting amps in the outside which everyone does now to get different sounds they did that double tracking vocals Lennon which invented that they did that first time he didn't like the sound so they figured out a way of coming out of one tape machine back into the tape machine and he'd sing over it and record them both together so you get a sort of double that's how you get that sort of it's a fast delay yeah yeah i feel it feels like it's it's double track what it is I invented it and now that's a standard procedure. Nowadays you've just got a plug-in. It's too easy these days. Speaking of plug-ins, I was just going to talk to you about nowadays you can go out and spend let's say 200 quid and get Logic and have a studio full of virtual instruments. Do you think that... youngsters these days are blessed with that or do you think it's a negative thing? It's a double edged sword. sword isn't it yeah i mean on one level you can say that you know these things are just tools yeah aren't they they're just they're just there to allow us to to do our art yeah and it's what you do with them and and it is so easy to i mean that's the problem with all plugins all plugins and and is that you know everyone tends to use the same sounds yeah I'm a great believer that you can actually get a bass player, a drummer and a guitarist and a keyboard player and make something completely new with it. It's just how you do it. And I think it's completely and utterly possible to use plugins and come out and... and come out with it and people are doing it all the time look at Rusty people like that completely turning things upside down and you know every day you hear someone's done something different with it and it's very necessary well you know I think it's hard to find sometimes there's artists that so many artists that, you know, are doing the same thing and then every now and again someone comes out and does something a bit different and it's like, wow, do you know what I mean? I think, uh, but it doesn't happen as often as it should, really. It's hard. It's hard. Because we're all using the same ear. It's hard. I mean, it's just very, very hard, and it's becoming harder to come up with new ideas in music when so much has been trodden before. I mean, it's almost like that's the thing that can destroy you. You're sitting in a studio as an artist and thinking, oh my God, how can I reinvent the wheel? Well, you can't. Because basically someone's already done it before. All you're doing is nicking Mozart anyway or something like that or the Beatles, you know, some melody that they've already done. So what we have to try and do is to try and sort of satisfy ourselves and move things on a bit. You know, I mean, now and again, someone just comes and breaks a mold, but it's And it really is, you know, I mean, it's like... And it's harder and harder because things don't have an opportunity properly these days to grow. They're overexposed maybe too early. That's the danger, I think. You know, things need time to sort of develop before everyone descends on them. If you descend on them too early... You'll have one particular sound, let's say, for instance, take Example Change. Blake and when he first came out but within a very short period of time everybody was on this you know certain types of vocals and everything like that I think nowadays if someone does do something slightly unique then everyone's doing it within a week if it sounds good because they know how to manipulate it or how to imitate it and everything like that I mean, yeah, it was hard. I mean, maybe we all loved Chic. I mean, I still think it's the greatest sound, the most wonderful sound. But I mean, you couldn't copy it because it was just the mastership of these amazing studio musicians. and you could not copy sheet. There were some great electronic records at the time that were made by other people that was good, but it was a unique sound. But that's an example of something that's very hard. You couldn't copy Joy Division, although loads of people tried to, and New Order, there were loads of people that came along. Maybe, yeah, I mean, maybe a technique comes into play, like that sort of vocal technique that's on every American record, you know, everyone uses that. Yeah. And it's just like, you just want to kill someone, don't you? I want to kill myself. If you ever hear it again, you just want to go, oh, fucking hell. Please, I hate music. That's when I say I hate music. That's when you start to say things like... That's not right. And I sometimes actually consider myself blessed when I listen to the pop music, let's say, for instance, that was out when I was maybe 12, 13, in comparison to what it is now. It's like, Jesus Christ. I feel so lucky to even... Back then, what I thought was crap is 50 times better than what's now. what's meant for you why is that why is it I mean it's all types of things you know it's you know you can look at our culture and say there's something happened that's you know I think one side of me thinks to myself I mean I struggled to get successful really struggled from coming up for a sort of working class background and I just wonder these days whether you know people young people Unless you come from money, it's hard to actually devote time to art. I sort of feel like, I know this is a, that, you know, all the people, most of the people I hear about working in music, a lot of people are quite privileged. Absolutely. They're coming from good backgrounds. They've got parents that are successful. They've, you know, they don't need the money. So maybe, maybe there's a whole group of society now that can't afford to make art. so they're thinking about working and that's one thing when I think about it I think to myself oh my god that's such a terrible thought I don't know how true it is but most people I met in Radio 1 are public school boys I mean I've got nothing wrong with being a public school boy but I just think to myself well when you look back at the older bands back from the 80s they were a lot of working class so there were some great great you know you know there's bands nothing wrong with that I mean I know you know sort of the bands that come from that area that have come out of private school, but also there's the great working class bands like the Pistols and the Clash. Yeah, exactly, yeah. You know, you need that energy, that street energy. Why do you think that is? Well, is that what I say? Is it just because maybe young people are also interested in other things these days, maybe music isn't so important. They're interested in games, they're interested in... you know, television is so, there's so many other areas maybe they want to go into. But I think it is another great, really hard to spend time on making music if you've got to eat. Yeah, or the media has made it be so kind of apparent that the most important thing is having a career or something like that. Yeah, I mean. Or having money, yeah. Yeah, I mean, or being able to. I don't know, I mean, if I was you, I don't know how. happy I'd, you know, my daughter wants to be, you know, she's a drummer and she's involved in it all that. And I just think to myself, well, I can just see it all happening, you know, okay, so how are you going to earn a living in five, you know? Because at the moment, everything, you know, as soon as your stuff goes on Spotify and how are you ever going to sell a record? It's a sacrifice. How do you get anywhere? Yeah. I mean It's very easy to go in and say, oh, there's nothing wrong with people stealing our stuff for nothing. They can afford to say that. There's nothing to them. They can put out an album on vinyl only and sell 100,000 copies and everyone is mad for it. It's the new artists that need to step up, that need to... You invest so much into production. Yeah, expertise of your time. And then suddenly there it is on Spotify and the record label's taking a massive cut and you're getting nothing. And that to me is like robbery. It's going back to where we started. from it right it's actually putting the artist again getting slagged getting sort of done over yeah you know and i suppose if you if you don't need the money if you come from a background where there is someone to help you then you can put up with that. You don't have to work to earn any living, but maybe some, a lot of kids, they, you know, maybe people give up. I do know a lot of people have given up, actually. Yeah. People I thought were really talented, I know, have given up because they can't, they can't sustain. You know, the record label can't sell any records. because they've all been downloaded for nothing, they aren't big enough to get any interest. I think about quite a lot of people like that at the moment. So it isn't great. It's not a huge opportunity when you're younger. I mean, I know that... You mentioned that your daughter is a drummer. Yeah. So did you encourage her as a youngster to get into music? Yes, I suppose I did. I mean, you know, she did piano and... She came out on the Lethfield tour when she was only five. She was there. She saw it all happening. But she's a really brilliant percussionist. Naturally brilliant rhythm. I mean, actually much better than me. She's just really good. I mean, she was obvious at five that she could be a drummer. We took her into the studio. I remember Paul was showing her. sort of snare bass and she was playing a sort of bass drum and snare pattern like yeah so I mean it was like inevitable but she plays a Cora as well she's actually very interested in other cultures yeah she went to so I mean would you ever consider a collaboration absolutely I'm thinking about it at this very moment brilliant yeah she's that good yeah she's that good but she's busy because she's working with Quez and you know, she's got a tour, she's going to South by Southwest, they're going around the world. Oh, well, she's working in it. Because I have to say, like, if it wasn't for my mother, I don't think I'd be working. in this industry now because she really actually it's funny the first cd that we ever bought together was leftism oh really yeah amazing really ancient oh well thank you very much i was really young um but no but if it wasn't for her you know i think uh but again it's not guaranteed security you know so It's kind of like, you choose, yeah. But I suppose, I mean, maybe that's what being an artist is. You make a choice. You have a very, very rich life. My son wants to become a dancer. I mean, he's really there. He's probably very, very creative and very out there, very good. And, you know, that world is like that. They sacrifice for a young, short, quick career. Yeah. But very rich and wonderfully exciting. And I can't... I've had a wonderfully exciting time with it. Yeah. You know, I've been blessed with the luck and... I'd say you've seen it all. Yeah, yeah. Good times, bad times. I've seen the whole thing. You know, good with the bad and struggle and... artistic struggle and having you know not been able to go near music actually you know completely lost it for years on it and I just don't want to know anything about it yeah I want to feel like music should be a part-time occupation you know oh yeah I do I still feel like it's wrong to see it as a career I think you need to dedicate yourself to it though so much that it's impossible to do that yeah but like it's a really good hobby you should be able to dip in and out of it because that's how you get your inspiration living and experiencing and listening and then you go back into it yeah and I just feel like maybe I've had 10 years out of it really even though I've been working I've never really actually wanted to make electronic music actually for 10 years particularly although I love Love it. Yeah. I've been doing other things. You still listen to it? I listen to it. I'm obsessed with it. Yeah, obsessed with it. I'm obsessed with music. You did DJing and... Not much. Paul was a DJ. Paul DJs all the time. I'm hopeless. I'm too eclectic. Yeah, you won't be able to have a journey. And I just get annoyed with the rigidity of it and I haven't got the discipline. I'm not very good at it. I admit it. I'm hopeless. It's not because I know what records are wicked, but I think it's a real skill putting it together in that way. I mean, it takes me ages. I have to think for hours about tracks and where I want it to go and how it fits in, you know, because I think that's what an album is. I like to make a body of work. And I think DJs are... I just admire what they can do. But I've never been able to do it. But I accept that the world that I'm in is for each. attached to them so outside of doing gigs yourself did you spend a lot of time in clubs yeah endlessly yeah my whole life yeah you did the whole ass against the ears thing not so much because I was actually I did see a bit of that that's the one thing I didn't really because I was actually into Latin music I was just into percussion and rhythms for about For four years, I just immersed myself into that learning African. I was just really into that. But I was aware of what was happening. You can tell because there's a lot of African influence I felt in Lefebvre's work. It's sort of rhythm. It's rhythm. I mean, we just play. I play keyboards like percussion instruments. In fact, I can't play keyboards. And I'm really pleased I can't. You can't? No. Isn't that what you... No. I was a liar. I just do it. I make it up as I go along. Adam can play keyboards. I can't play keyboards. So what exactly are you doing then when you're up on stage? I'm playing keyboards. Yeah, but you're not. No, because I can't play them properly. Okay. I mean, if I'm playing a keyboard line, like the ones I've invented, I do it in a really sort of like ridiculous way because I don't know how to play keyboards. Right. I've never taught how to So is it like when you're on stage, is it plugged out? I just whack the fuck out of them. Because I don't know. I mean, I'm really musical. I'm really a musical person. So I can think of melodies. I find melodies, you know, I find melodies, but I cannot play music. If someone says to me, could you play me something on the keyboard? I can't do it. No. I have no idea. I have no interest in learning chord structures. In fact, I break it all down. I go the reverse and say, the only reason I've had any successes is because I can't play an instrument. properly. I used to learn violin so I know how to read music in a way. I understand about I was really good at violin and I but I but I just didn't like I couldn't the discipline of it I got bored with it because I was going to punk clubs and things like that yeah so I've obviously been there and and you know but I'm just really heavily dyslexic as well so I have impossibility in learning basic things so I can't remember I've learned it's ridiculous thing to admit right I cannot remember the names and the notes on the keyboard even though I've learned them a hundred times. I still forget. Really? See, that's why you just bang away. You know, I know where it is and I make up and so it goes to me, what key is that? and they'll go, I don't know. I'm not telling you. Sounds good, doesn't it? Sounds good. And I can find it. Oh, yeah, it's in D. Yeah, yeah, D. Big deal. But I can, I mean, Georgia can do that. And Georgia can sit down and play chords and all that. I sort of work out chord structures, things that I think work, by just shapes. And I go, oh, that's good. Oh, I like that. And I Then I sort of like build up tracks. Right. So what's... I... Fuck it, you know. When you go into the studio, let's say. When you sit down and you go, right, I have an idea for a track, how does it start? Is it like, I have this sound, I have this melody in my head? How do you programme? What does it start with? Or do you just start jamming away? Depends what mood I'm in, actually. But, I mean... There's lots of different stages to it. I can't really explain what comes first, really. Okay, so it's never a set kind of template. I actually do think sometimes you can do that. An actual fact, the best things I think that we ever did together, we had a very firm idea before we started what we wanted to do. So I'd say that that's what I do. Like I know, like what I'm doing at the moment is just jamming. I'm doing hundreds, I'm doing demos chucking out ideas. It's all coming out, which is wicked. So every day I'll do two different demos. And what I do is I work on, I've got this really wicked machine, which I'm not going to tell anyone about because I love it too much. But it's a brilliant, brilliant machine that I use, which I just love. And it's just, I'm writing on it the whole time. So everything else in the studio is that. out the window. I don't even, don't go near computers. I'm just not interested. It's just my one box and I, I can do everything on it. And I write rhythms. I write rhythms. Oh, it's real. It's a machine. Yeah. And I just write rhythms and music on it. And little. chunks and now when I get something I can do that for a few days and then I think to myself well you know I need to do what am I doing here and then I'll go back and I'll go yeah I want to do a track with Jim Jim yeah and then I think about okay so I'm going to do a track with Jim Jim what it might be a bpm i'll start with and i might listen to some african was the vocalist from afro left yeah no i might i might go okay so what type of song what bpm was that at and i'll listen to that and i'll listen to some african tunes yeah and things that i like and i go well hang on a second i'll do a six eight rhythm with him instead of a four four type of thing that could be interesting or and so i think it's the concept is really important because otherwise what can happen is that you can just get lost and i mean that can work yeah i mean you can just sort of sit in there and just fuck it oh yeah yeah that's good baseline right record that i mean that some people are really good at doing that in studios And sometimes a producer can get you through things like that. If you're stuck, you know, hang on a second, what's that called? Let's record that, let's record that. Before you know where you are, you've got something. It's brainstorming, it's good. Is there anyone in particular that you collaborated with that really kind of blew you away the way they worked? Um... Well, I mean, we were such a sort of closed shop. Me and Paul. I mean, we were in our own world. I mean, we were just completely and utterly just me and him. So, I mean, I'd say that, you know, the only person that's really amazed me is Paul, really. Yeah. Actually, as... I mean, I can't... I'm not experienced enough. This whole thing of sharing things, I'm terrified of that because I've never... I don't come from... I've never done that. Yeah. It's a bit hippy I've got to make sure that someone's on my wavelength before I start sharing stuff with them, you know. But anyway, I could... I mean, nearly all the vocalists I've ever worked with, I've just gone, yeah, I've got really, really admiration for them. I mean, John Lydon, admiration for him as an artist in the studio is just really amazing. I was so surprised. I know you've been asked probably this before, but how... At such an early stage of Leftfield, did you manage to get John Lydon? Because I knew him. Oh, you knew him, okay. Yeah, I knew him. I was like, how would you do that? I knew John. I knew John through another... See, this is my connection to my other life, you see. I knew the four Johns, which were the famous four punk Johns. Sid Vicious, John Lydon, John Wobble and John Gray. John Gray is my favourite, my Okay. He's got the biggest record collection in London. Really? Yeah. What's his address? He's got the best reggae collection in the world, John Gray. Better than anyone, I swear. No one can touch him. His reggae collection's worth millions, I reckon. And he can just about... He lives in this tiny flat in every road, every... face is squeezed in with amazing vinyl records so I knew him I knew John Lydon through him yeah although I didn't know John well I got I got him I went to I went when I was 17 the first time I ever took drugs I went to yeah I went to John Lydon's house and spent a mad weekend on speed with him listening to reggae Yeah. It seems like a bit of a polar opposite to deal. Yeah, no, but I like John. But you see, John, I mean, it was my idea to do a track with John when I was on Rhythm King. Okay. And they thought I was a nutter. They just said, what do you want to work with John Lydon with? And it was obvious to me that... and then oh god I forgot the name of the record there was this German record that sampled him I forgot the name of it because Paul remembered the name oh fuck but I thought about working with John and it just seemed like a very natural thing to do and it was just easy it wasn't easy because it was fucking hard nothing I've ever done has been easy yeah that's the other thing it's always a struggle a good track together. I always believe if it works too easily, there's something wrong. Well... I always feel it has to be a struggle. Yeah, you're probably right. Sometimes when it happens easily, it's a bit scary. You're like, what? Yeah, I'm trying to think, has it ever happened easily? But actually, I think that that track just suddenly became that track. It was very bizarre. It's a very bizarre feeling. But I suppose it's because there were quite a number of years worth of ideas into it, you see, because I'd thought about it so long ago. I really started working on it. And even though that was not right and it took working with John and Paul to make it right, it was already a lifetime worth of ideas. Really? You may have heard this comment before that left feels music was ahead of its time. What do you think of that comment? Yeah, I mean, I think that... you know, you can sort of be big headed. Yeah, but it's a hard question to answer. It's very hard one to answer because it makes you feel a bit awkward. I mean, we just wanted to, we sat in the studio making the best record we could ever possibly make and, and we're not interested in, in, in anything else apart from the creative process. Yeah. That's the honest truth of it. And, um, We just, it just poured out. It poured out of us. Years and worth worth of frustration, me and Paul, I reckon. Years worth of listening to different music styles. I mean, there's two, three albums in that album, really, if we'd have been sensible. We could have spread it out and stretched it out and we just piled it all in there. Love for reggae, love for hip-hop, love for drum and bass, which was just hitting the scenes then. Love for... It's just what we felt an album should be. We come from that. An album should be a body of work. And I think that people chuck albums out now. so easily and I just think it's not an album three tracks on it and the rest of it is just the same you know and that and I suppose we we just we we toiled and we struggled in that studio to make it the best thing we we were surprised as anyone that it did so that it did so well really yeah and the best moments, the only moments that ever meant anything to me were in the studio when it worked. I mean, I'll be honest with you, as soon as that was finished, it was finished to me. Yeah. And it still is. Now and again I get nostalgic about it and people go, oh, isn't that wicked? And I go, yeah, great, it was great. When was the best moment for you? Okay, the best moment was hearing John Peel play my best, first ever time John Peel moment first time I ever heard open up on the radio that was a great moment that was it yeah that was it nothing else meant anything to me apart from making the album about the it's the it's the feeling in the studio of when something works that's what you're like it's just so excited it's It's amazing. It's better than any drugs. It's better than sex. It's the best thing in the world. It's the success of what you do. And it's very rare. I mean, it's only happened a few times to me. And it's that wow moment when you know you've cracked something that you've been struggling at. And then after that, it's gone. I seriously mean that. And after that, you just run for me. I run for the motions. And when I hear artists like, bigging themselves up, I just can't get it. I don't get it. Yeah. Because I don't understand why they can do that. To me, it's dead. It's finished. You've done it. push it out there, it's your baby, it's out there. And I really appreciate everything everyone says because I think it's wonderful and I really, really think, wow, good for me and Paul, pat on the back, all that work was wonderful and everyone loves the album and that really means a lot. It's not like I'm trying to be sort of difficult or arrogant. But it doesn't mean much. Yeah. Because I don't really believe it because underneath it all, me and Paul were not very confident. Neither of us are very confident and we're both very, very critical. We were very critical of ourselves in the studio. There was no, there was no patting each other on the back in the studio ever and saying, oh, that's good, that's good. we were just hard on them. No, that's shit. That's shit. That's shit. That needs to be better. That's all it was. People coming in, it was a very miserable experience. Really? Yeah, people come into left field sessions and they'd be turned up and they'd be blown away. They'd just be blown away by the sound of it and two miserable bastards sitting in the back. So you're saying you're rare to be confident because I was thinking, 95 was when it was released, wasn't it? I think it was, yeah. And that was actually quite a big year for the electronic groups. You had the Chemical Brothers, did Exoplanet, Moby had everything. Yeah, I liked Moby's. Was there ever any, you know... competitive attitudes there wasn't I wasn't aware of it between that wasn't aware of it but there probably was there probably was things like there are no aces I mean, I get on really well with Tom and Ed, particularly. I mean, I really like them and I think they're great and I really admire what they've done. But I was in Australia and Ed said to me, he got really pissed, he said to me, you were always better than us. You were the ones who got really drunk and I was saying... you've sold fucking 20 minute albums or something. I'm poor. I gave up. What are you talking about? You've got a massive fan base and you're the most successful people. He said, oh, you were always better. Adam, we used to think and listen to your records and go, we'll never be able to do that. And you're wonderful and all that. And I said, oh, shut up. Give it a break. But he, you know, that was just, but he was coming out with it. That's nice to hear. I always thought their albums, because I know Steve Dove really well. Steve Dove is, I haven't seen him for about four years, but he's their engineer and I love Steve. Yeah. Me and Steve, so I work with a bit with Steve. Yeah. Their sound is wicked. Yeah. They're the ones I like, I mean, in terms of, I'm really, really keen on, the Orbital Brothers I really liked them we did gigs together there was never I never felt any jealousy or envy yeah I didn't Darren Emerson's a really close mate of mine okay haven't seen for years but I don't really know Underworld the guys that well Colin but I think they're great But I mean, it's become a super, super banned area. And I find that dull. I mean, I thought that Mixmag thing, the bass, dance, et cetera, I just thought, what a load of crap. I mean, how can anyone better? I mean, anyone's honest in the craft work have got to be the most important electronic act ever. And everyone else has got to be following. And all the names, all the, you know, what about all the new people? This is just one style. the sort of big sort of Chemical Brothers aren't the best I mean sorry Prodigy aren't the best electronic band ever sorry there's not even you know one good album in 1980s and a couple of tracks after that that's what I'd say being honest if I was to be a fan there's nothing there I'd say live shows bit of a cliche goes on for two it's not that I don't think it's just all this is all sort of this is all sort of I mean I like it I mean I like I think they're great blokes and they're fantastic I wouldn't vote that as the best electronic music I mean it just isn't polls are always like that though it's nonsense I hate all that shit I hate it why do you think that because I actually asked Carl Hyde recently when I met him It was such a massive, massive part of the 90s, the electronic groups. So, for instance, you know, Underworld, Left Field, Chemical Brothers, Orbital. It's pretty much non-existent now for, you know, new groups like similar. Why do you think that is? Because it's not like people got sick of it or anything. No, I think that it was a new thing. Yeah. It was new. Remember, you've got to imagine that it would be in Britpop. Yeah. Oasis. That was, excuse me, I mean, it's so... became a club culture at a festival you know suddenly you've got this new sound that's the difference it's just not new anymore okay I bet there is I mean good if you go to Coachella you guys go to Coachella and see the dance tents and I played them last year They are amazing. Really? Oh my God, yeah. I mean, everyone's playing those dance tents and there are really some amazing electronic acts out there that are doing it now, that Mode Selector, people like that, that are just busting it up and playing to thousands of people. It's just maybe this country is a bit, you know, we're maybe we're, I mean, they're, for me, they're the leaders of the pack, you know, in terms of electronic music. Fantastic label as well, yeah. we're who's doing it over here that that's the question you need to ask it's not it's not what why they it's just no you know who who's taking on the next the next thing i mean i know there's some good people out there and i mean the people we were talking about you know the warp labels and they're Electronic acts. I love them. I mean, I love, I think that what they're doing is really fresh and interesting. It's just Mode Selector, it's like a club-based music that's, maybe the club-based thing got boring. Yeah. Maybe that's why. I mean, we're all bored. Now you've got the superstar DJ thing that took over from it. And then now you get the superstar DJ festivals. Yeah. Yeah. Which are appalling, aren't they? I mean, they appalling awful places so i think maybe everyone the young young people now reacting against it and it's all going underground and they're going back to clubs and they're bored with a super group big thing apart from when it's really really good and you know when it's what's his name on Tobin and people like that I mean that's fresh that's a different direction you know like the three dimensional visual thing maybe just people stood up there just you know It's still good. It's nice to see something like that. I mean, everyone's good. It's their good shows. I mean, Ken O'Connor's show is amazing. Yeah. The visuals and everything. fantastic value for money and Prodigy fantastic show if you like there's all sorts of young people out there yeah I mean so it's there it's just yeah who's the next person to come up and do it and compete with most selectors for me and some of those other people from Europe which I think they're I think best music is coming out of there in America at the moment, for me. Not the quirky stuff. I'm into the quirky stuff over here. I'm talking about club music where there's a banging bottom end that works. Which is a real skill to get that. It's a sort of dynamism. I'm not hearing in English music at the moment. So much. Maybe because you're hearing. I was going to say, do you wear earplugs? Why? Because I remember I was... I'm deaf actually. Oh really? I felt really awkward there. No, because I was at... You may remember you played at Homelands in Ireland years and years ago. It was dangerous. Loud. And it's still a legendary story. Punk fucking gig. We were unbelievable. Yeah, it was amazing. But the DJs from all the other tents were complaining, obviously, because all the noise was filtered through. That was really nothing compared with our own gigs. Yeah, well, Brixton Academy ceiling falling down. We were dangerous because the guy that I was using, or that we were using, Gary, was fucking deaf. so he just blasted it off and hadn't a clue I actually because this time around I got a really amazing system and it was wicked I was really pleased with it so were you putting the system together yourself then yeah with advice yeah I got the guy in to put the system in and it was amazing and I spent all the money on it and that's what I do I mean that's why I don't ever come out of it any money basically because i don't i put the money into the system because it has to be but basically what happened this time around was I had to not use Gary again which is unfortunate because you know the levels that we played at if we went into that now we'd be arrested we would be taken out and I pushed it with this tour to a real I don't know because in Plymouth Plymouth oh fucking hell I mean when you stood in front of the system your breath was taken away it was like in the old days I can remember in the old days people when we oh god we did this gig in Belgium once I mean I thought it was ridiculous but I've got no that's one of the reasons why I started to play first time I started to fall out with Paul I think was that because I felt it was too much yeah we'd just gone too far it was like I mean I remember we went we went to we were sort of idiots we were we went to play we played in we played in Cologne Kraftwerk came to see us really so we played double loud Gary Gary ran us fucking Germans let's have it really loud and I'm going you're talking about basically the old clock that everyone was in the bar to the side because it was like it was just fucking hell it was just like this power when we played in Belgium 80 people left because because it was so loud There's loads of things that used to happen. We played on a slanty stage. All the gear moved to the edge of the stage by the end of the gig. Because of the... When we played at Paradiso, when we cranked the system up, the whole bar fell off the back of the wall. You're joking. No, the whole bar fell off. They had an amazing bar. There were bottles. There were hundreds of glasses on it. We cranked the speaker system up. We just got it up. ticking and then we thought okay let's go for it so banged it up the whole bar came down in the middle of the gig and there was people crying like that with a glass just falling all across and we stopped and the bar and they just like they looked at us and they just there was thousands of glasses all over the back of the wood saw and smashed from the system we were louder than they measured They measured it and said it was louder than a jet aircraft at full. And Gary thought that was great. he thought that was great and I thought that was a great moment for him yeah he was talking this is great now isn't it and I'm going what we had so many monitors on so we had 27k worth of stuff on stage that's as big as most festivals are we had it on stage just our own monitors because it was so loud the only way we could hear to play in time yeah that was before in-ear we had this And I just, I remember being in the middle, plinky plonking away on my sort of fake piano playing. And I had... Paul on that side with all these monitors and Nick on the other side with all these monitors and I had two monitors and I just thought, I'm going to die. This is going to kill me. And I, you know, I had ears, my ears were ringing and I just, I went off and I just, I mean, I'm just saying, I just, I just can't, this has to, this is dangerous. We're just pushing it to, to, to, to. you know we there's loads of things that happened we i mean one that we played at leeds right in the in in the We took this system out of there. I mean, God, there must be people that... God knows what people must have thought. We cranked the system up. We did a soundtrack, cranked the system up, and it was this enormous auditorium, a very high ceiling in the middle of the floor. An iron grate fell from the roof and fell down and hit the floor, and I just walked past it, about the size of that carpet. smashed on the floor oh Jesus it was things like that the whole building was shaking we were vibrating the rivets and then we had to get everywhere so then I was going on stage thinking someone's going to die I was thinking Curtis Mayfield the lightning was coming down on my head because I said that's a tragedy and I was thinking oh no anyway yeah rabbit rabbit rabbit so what You're playing in Brixton, you're going to be doing the War Child. Yeah, I thought... What are the levels going to be like there? Well, we're putting the same system in. I'm surprised they let you back in after their route. The last time, we did Damage last time as well. Well, we sell it out, I suppose. It's all sold out. Yeah. We didn't sell it out, actually. Talk to me about this War Child concept. Yeah, no, it was, they asked, I mean, I was asked to do it last year. I mean, I always felt that, you know. you know, I'd like to do a charity, I'd like to find a charity and do something for, because, you know, I just feel like, you know, taking so much out of the industry, it'd be nice to put something in and to, and then I met the people from War Child, it was last year, and I showed interest in it, and I was going to do it last year, and then I was really ill last year, and... basically half the year I lost half the year and um and then they came back and I sort of thought oh you know that's a great thing to do you know it's a good it's a it's sort of a really worthwhile charity that you know they you know buying guns for kids is such a good thing you know make a war yeah I mean I I thought, I'm really into this. Guns on the streets. They're coming from where I'm seeing things. I thought, well, I can really put some guns on the streets. You know, they can protect themselves. No, I just thought, you know, they're going all around the world and they're really sort of rescuing people, really, and doing so much good work. I mean, really, it's really important for people to understand that's what this night is. You're working with some of the artists that were on some of the old albums I'll try desperately to get them all in as many people in that will do it but People are such miserable buggers when they get older, aren't they? Really? I find they're so miserable. You try and get people to do something. They don't want to get on the stage anymore. Probably afraid of those sound levels. Yeah, don't bother them. Don't do it now. I tried to get John. I'm not ready. But I've been trying to get Afro Bambaataa to do it. Oh, cool. Maybe you can get some DJ gigs to come over. Like that. Because the last time I saw you was in Electric Picnic and I think Jess Mills did original. Yeah. I hope Jess will do that. Yeah. Jessie's obviously got her own album and she's working really hard on it but she's such a great girl I'm sure she will I don't know we haven't even started to think about it I haven't started to think about it yet it's too early to me otherwise I'll start to worry about it so I'm just going to forget about it until a week beforehand that's the best way of dealing with these things I think now in my experience otherwise I'll start planning it I'll start planning oh I've got to do this to that track and that to that track and I haven't got time so I'm just going to let it naturally happen and maybe people will turn up and say they want to sing on something and they can
