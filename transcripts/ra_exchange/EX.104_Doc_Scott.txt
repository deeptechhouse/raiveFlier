you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Doc Scott is a drum and bass legend. With releases on Metalheads and Reinforced, like Here Comes the Drums and Shadowboxing, his name ranks among the Goldies and the Four Heroes of the World. But hear him tell it, and he's a DJ, first and foremost. And that's exactly what he's been doing throughout the entirety of his career, spreading the gospel of drum and bass, even when the minimal rolling style that he's often associated with has fallen out of mainstream favor. We talked about hollowed institutions like the Music House, where... Scott cut his dubs in The Blue Note, where he had some of his best nights out as a DJ and punter in the 90s, earlier this month at his home in Coventry. Here come the drums! I guess I wanted to begin by talking a little bit about your beginnings as a DJ. You started off in your bio at least, Grandmaster Flash, seeing him on television. Yeah, when I was basically, I think, I must have been... maybe 10 or 11. It was like, you know, 81 or something like that. I saw like just a short news, you know, news clip on the news of, you know, I briefly glimpsed him, you know, just this guy doing these kind of tricks with two turntables. And I just thought, wow, you know, what's this guy doing? And I kind of, I think maybe from about eight or nine, I started having a, what I now look back on was I always thought I was hearing or listening to music in a different way. Or, you know, I'd watch movies and I'd be more interested in the soundtrack. as a kid even like kids movies i can remember going to the cinema as a kid and just wondering um or or realizing that the music was manipulating my emotions as well as what was going on on the screen and in most in some cases in most cases the music more so and i was kind of you know, really intrigued by the fact that, you know, score could make you feel happy or sad or anxious or, you know, whatever they wanted to tell you in the movie. And so I'd had this kind of interest in music and the way it manipulates people or it can do. And then I saw Grandmaster Flash, you know, doing this thing. I didn't really understand what he was doing, but it just looked fascinating to me. And then early electro, well more the b-boy, the breakdance and that whole movement came across to the UK from the States. I think the first record I bought was Electro 2, which was, you know, the Street Sounds albums, which had Scratch in on it. And I kind of realized, okay, right, that's what that guy was doing. I don't know. It was like a logical thing. I thought that's always something that appealed to me, wanted to do. And I ended up having like a homemade set of turntables, I think when I was 14, that I used to kind of scratch and make these kind of like really rough kind of mixtapes with and everything. It really stemmed that far back to wanting to be a DJ. And I've always wanted to be a DJ and still consider myself a DJ. Sometimes it pains to make that distinction that I'm a DJ that has made some music and not the other way around. I guess these days it's an interesting distinction because you get so many people make a record and then they ask them to come in. I also fully appreciate the times are incredibly different. When I first started out, say, getting gigs and everything, when the rave scene kind of started in the UK, it wasn't about if you made a record, you want to get people were just looking for people that could literally DJ. Do you have? turntable can you mix and have you got a bunch of records and if you could say yes you could get some gigs then if you were good or if people liked you you know if I think if you're good people should like you and it's you know, catch 22 thing. But if you're good or if you've got some knowledge about what you're doing and the music you're playing and you understand what you're trying to do, you could get out of the flat parties, which is where I started with like, you know, illegal flat parties where people would go into empty flats in our apartments, take them over, put a sound system on. them in there and have parties there and first one you played was called utopia right the first the first rave yeah like a rave thing that i played yeah was in 1989 i think um Yeah, that was an illegal thing. I remember having to walk across fields with a crate, like a plastic crate with records in. You just made a face. Yeah. I'm remembering walking across this and then thinking, am I going to get arrested and this kind of thing. I think I read that the organizers did get arrested. Yeah, I think some of them went to jail. was like like in these parts it was like quite big news because it was like you know in that whole acid house thing and the tabloid media kind of ran wild with it because you know it was um well, you know, kids were going to these parties, these illegal parties and, you know, taking whatever they were taking and to a certain generation, it was like, what's going on? And I can remember, I can remember like going to some of the first parties I went to as a raver in London. um i think i went to an eclipse and i went to an energy that's where i first heard people like um groovewriter and carl cox and jumping jack frost and i was like wow this is how this music i had you know i knew a lot of this music and kind of knew how to put it together but I wasn't you know I wasn't quite sure I was kind of winging it myself because I didn't have any reference point and so um what was energy I always see that mentioned around was it a night yeah it was like an organization the nights were called um energy And they were only doing stuff in London. Why were they so good? They just put on some great, great parties. I mean, you had rain dance back then and energy. I mean, sometimes you'd go down there and, you know, I was speaking to this with my driver like a few weeks ago saying like, you know, now we have Sat Nav and you have your phone to get you to... I said to him, I said... How did we used to get to gigs? You know, in the time when we used to have like A to Zs and you just, I say, okay, you're planning Rotherham, for example, and you just drive, you just get, you just know that the M1 took you north and you just wing it most of the time. Most of the time, people are like, okay, you drive into the town center and you find the nearest taxi driver and say, do you know this nightclub? But, you And so these parties back then was, you'd got Anna as a raver and you had a mobile phone number because, you know, they wanted to keep it under wraps and you'd phone her and then you'd phone the mobile phone number and it would give you another number. And then it would give you a postcode or an area to go to. And then sometimes one of them would get shut down. So then you'd have Sunrise would then team up with another organization. And then you'd end up, I can remember being in this rave in Croydon in Surrey. And it ended up in a huge field. It was like, I don't know, 10, 15,000 people there. And it was crazy. Like people were like parking their cars on the M25 and leaving them there and walking to this thing. And the police were powerless because there were so many, you know, so many people that they couldn't stop it. But that's where I first got to hear people like Mickey Finn, Groove Rider, Carl Cox, and Jumping Jack Frost. And I was like, wow. this all makes sense to me now. Now I've got all these reference points and I came and I remember coming back to the Midlands, which is obviously a little bit behind what was going on in London. And I just thought, I can remember coming back and what would say in my record box at the end of say 89, I was like, I can't play the half of that stuff anymore. I now know what I should be playing. And so did you know where to get that music? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I did. And, or, or, or I made damn sure, you know, to find out what it was. I mean, that's, that's one thing I've always had a. mad passion for is record shopping and hunting down tunes. From when I was like 14, I used to go to a record shop in Birmingham and I'd go there on a, yeah, I'd catch the train on a Saturday morning and just spend all day. I'd get there at like 10, 10.30 in the morning when they open sometimes and be there until they closed. And, you know, the guys would come in with deliveries. And that's like when I first heard, I used to go there first to buy hip hop. When they were bringing like stuff like 2 Live Crew and this kind of stuff in. And then they were bringing in these tunes from Juan Atkins and Derek May and Kevin Swanlinson simply because it was like a... import box of tunes and that's what I can remember hearing I think it wasn't rock to the beat it was one of those early tunes anyway and I was like what the fuck is this this is amazing so I like buying this stuff and taking it and listening to it and, you know, just trying to figure out what it was because, you know, nobody, they were making this stuff and nobody really knew what it was. This stuff was like 87, 88. So then when the rave scene happened in this country, I had a bunch of these records. So I was in a position where I was like, yeah, I've got the tunes and I can kind of mix. It was like, okay, right. Okay, we'll put you on the bill. In people, you had gotten Mix tapes and then, I mean, the initial parties that I used to play at were, like I say, were flat parties. And then some guy, you know, a lot of people had gone to London, seen these big raves and said, right, we need to put one of these on back up here in Coventry and in Birmingham. And so you had an organization here in Coventry called Amnesia who put on huge parties, especially for the time. And they attracted people from all over the country. So I think a lot of people, you need an element of luck. You need to be in the right place at the right time. And it's really capitalized on it. And I've had moments when I've just been in the right place at the right time. So I ended up playing at these amnesia parties through the summer of 1990. And I was playing for these organization called Raw in Birmingham, who they were probably doing the biggest parties in Birmingham through that summer. But the cool thing was that they were attracting people from all over the country. So I didn't know at the time, but I was playing to future promoters all over the country. Thankfully, um, and you had these amazing records. Yeah. And thankfully, so it was, it was going down well. So when they started doing club nights or whatever, it was like, okay, well, we got to book that guy. And so it was, you know, and so I, you know, I fully appreciate that, you know, that, that just can't be replicated. And I think, I think get noticed. you've got to make a tune. The first stuff that I ever made was stuff purely for myself. and then if anyone else likes it, then that'll be great. But I remember reading that you bought a sampler because basically you'd seen it in a magazine, in 808 Studio. 808 Studio. This guy, there was a night in Birmingham at this nightclub called The Dome, and it was like a really big, it was like a midweek thing. And at the end of the night, this guy comes in, you know, literally comes in and says, yeah, you know, I've got these things in the boot of my car, like literally in the boot of my car. You know, come and take a look and tell me if this is what you guys kind of need. So he opens it up and it's like Akai S950s they were, which are like really. For the time, like state-of-the-art thing. Now you look back on it, I think they had like two megabytes. Where did he get these? I have no idea. The boot, boltable. Yeah, I think he had like six. I think it was like six or eight of them. And he wanted like, I don't know, maybe three, four hundred pounds for them or something. Something like that. So I said to him, I just recognized the logo. And I recognize that like when 808 State, who I was quite a big fan of at the time, you know, still am. But at the time, you know, they wrote Pacific State and these big tunes. And I can remember it being really prominent in the picture. Like that was the hub of their studio. I was like, okay, well, fuck it. I need to have one of these things. I don't really know. And I bought it and I put it under the stairs and it kind of stayed there for probably a year until I hooked up with somebody who kind of showed me what to do with it. I was like, okay, right. So I need a computer and you record this. And so once I got my head around what it actually did, I was like, okay, yeah, it's nothing. I mean, if that guy hadn't turned up, would I have? I probably would have gone on to, you know, make a tune, but not in the way I would have wanted to do it because I never, I never wanted to, I was so intimidated by going into other people's studios. I had invites to go in people's studios. once I kind of got known a little bit towards the end of 1990 and I kind of wanted to and there was UB40 like big band had a big studio in Birmingham and a couple of people had gone in there but I was so intimidated I was like oh god I'd be so nervous and I'm a bit of a shy person anyway. Just wouldn't feel confident to go in there and say, yeah, I want this to do that, you know, do this, do that. And so whatever, you know, I would have made a tune, but it wouldn't have come out the way I would have wanted it to. I thought, you know. What was the way that you, I mean, what did you want to hear when you came into this studio? Was that hardcore? Yeah, at the time, I mean, the first EP I did was, you know, the surgery EP. And it was basically me, you know, just try to make like a rave techno. Obviously, it was still pretty much 4-4 then, but it had great beats. And, you know, there's three versions of the same track. One's primarily like... for the time, really specifically for the time, like a dance floor tune. And then the other two mixes is me kind of attempting to make more of a techno kind of thing. And then the other one's more of a New York garage thing. So I was really into kind of Strictly Rhythm and New Groove and all that kind of stuff, Todd Terry and all that kind of stuff. So it was basically an homage to that kind of stuff, everything that I grew up with and all those influences and basically could I do it? But I knew I could only do it in my own time and in my own space. I'm very comfortable working on my own. you know, the trial and error thing. And I mean, I have a lot of invites now to go to people's studios. And even now, I would... I would feel a little bit intimidated or not as fully confident to go in the studio with people. Still? Still, yeah, definitely. Why do you think that hasn't gone away? I don't know. I have no idea. I've never had full confidence. I've never been happy with anything I've ever made. And when I got to the end, when I got to like... So you look back on Surgery, what was wrong with Surgery? Surgery is probably one of the better tracks from a technical point of view. The mix down, when I listen back to the mix down, like the mix down is really, really good. But I also had help doing that. I took that to a guy in Birmingham when it was wrote. and he helped me kind of mix things. I had no fucking clue. At the time, I didn't even have a mixing desk. I wrote it all, and then stuff I wrote after that, when I actually did it at home, I mixed it down at home, like the early reinforced stuff. I didn't have a desk. I kind of EQ'd it all on a home hi-fi and recorded it, that kind of stuff. It was really fucking bogus, man. So when I listen back to kind of like... say here comes the drums like the original original version I'm like fuck How did that even sound like that? And yeah, I went through a period like in early 2000s when I really wasn't happy with stuff I was writing, which is kind of why I kind of stopped putting stuff out. I still, you know, still tinkered around in the studio and everything. But also as well, I felt an uncomfortable air of expectation. and an unrealistic air of expectation. Maybe, maybe in my own mind, I felt that air of expectation. I don't know, but I felt uncomfortable being, I felt uncomfortable being known as, as, as this artist, as a producer. Cause like I say, I really, I only ever wanted to be a DJ and I kind of got to the end of the 90s and had this catalogue of work that, you know, at the time, I didn't... Honestly, I had no inclination or desire to make the biggest tunes or some of the most influential tunes or anything like this. I just wanted to make... I was having fun. It was enjoyable. And then I went through a period when I went to go in the studio and it wasn't enjoyable. It wasn't fun. I couldn't accomplish what I wanted to accomplish. I had a horrible writer's block period for maybe a couple of years when I literally didn't go in the studio for 12 months because I'd sit down and I was like, oh, I have no ideas or just anything I did, I didn't like. And I thought, well, I don't need to do this anyway. I'm not a producer. So, you know, I've done a body of work. I'm happy with it. It is what it is. And I'll make something when I... It's interesting. You look at someone like Derek May. Absolutely unreal. set of expectations and now he almost can't release something. Yeah, exactly. You know, it's, I mean, you know, I had that in a much smaller way, but it's a similar issue. For God's sake, please be clear. I'm not comparing myself to Derek May. No, I was the one doing it. Yeah, yeah. But I understand what you're saying. And it's really interesting you said that because I played with him once in America. It was a really weird gig. It was like in Jacksonville in Florida. and it was at this university place. And the thing was, it was like I was doing it in the drum and bass room and he was in the techno thing. It was a really weird gig. And they sent a limo. And so we had this like hour and a half drive, where it's like me and the MC that was with me, MC Justice at the time, Derek Mayne, his manager, were in this limo and this hour and a half drive to Jacksonville through like literally through these swamp kind of places. And so, and I'd met him a couple of times, I'd met him a few times. and, you know, kind of knew him to say all right to and stuff. And I kind of asked him, said like, look, you know, do you feel that you can't or you just wouldn't want to? And he kind of said a similar thing. It's like... you know this good dude wrote strings of life and it is what it is it's like where do you go from there and it's not like he doesn't write stuff because when he's put out those compilation albums he puts these snippets of little things he's obviously done but he you know for whatever reason he doesn't want to put it out and i kind of understand i understand that and i've always i've always kind of believed that um I'd never want to put stuff out for the sake of it. And I know people that do that. And I know labels that do that. They put stuff out because just to be... Just to have stuff out. And for me, that's completely the opposite end of the... How did you break through? I mean, that writer's block moment. And how did you... I probably haven't, to be honest. I mean... I mean, I... The last release I had was like four or five years ago, I think. And what made you want to put that release out? Simply because I was in the studio and I was not, I kind of realized, I think was that 2007 or something that I was kind of in there and I was having a bit of fun. I thought, damn, okay. you know, make the most, make the most of it. And I kind of did like about seven tracks, I think I picked four of them and, um, put them out and, um, and I was kind of happy with it. And so it was also kind of, um, can, you know, can you still make, can you still make a tune? Do you still want to make a tune kind of thing? So. The fact that those tracks came out, I mean, they weren't the greatest tracks in the world, but they were kind of at a level where I thought, you know what, I'd put these out, that's okay. And I hadn't experienced that for a number of years. or even wanted to. So I just thought before I changed my mind and before I go back in a month and listen to me go, oh, that's crap. Because I've scrapped so many things or I have so much stuff that I've thought, no, I don't. And I go off my things really, really quickly. So I was mentally in a good place and I kind of... For the first time in ages, I like something that I actually did, so I just quickly put it out before I changed my mind kind of thing. Well, let's go back to... you put out Surgery. It must have been amazing to these DJs you look up to, immediately grabbed onto it. It was. It meant everything to me. And it also kind of, it took me up a level, I think, in their eyes. You know, I think they knew from hearing me play that they knew I kind of knew the music and I really appreciated what they did. But I think, like... just to be on the playlist was everything. You know, my goal, my goal also was to have those guys play one of my tunes. So to have Groove Rider and Fabio and Jack Frost at the time, I can remember the first time I heard Surgery was in 1990. It was a big rave at Donington Park. it was like an outdoor thing. I think they had like eight, nine, 10,000 people there. And, uh, Jack jumping Jack Frost played surgery. And that was the first time I'd heard it out when I hadn't played it myself. And so I'm sitting next to the, to the decks. It's, um, it's like, I don't know, maybe six in the morning. So it's light. And I was sitting there, I was thinking, you know what? I could die a happy man now because that's really what, that's only really what I wanted to accomplish was that and to see that reaction. And also, it gives you a lot of confidence. I think people, or maybe some people do or they don't, but some people don't realize, well, me anyway. It's really a confidence thing as well. So I guess some people who are super talented or super technically talented, they don't, that's not an issue because they can go in there and they can bang out a tune and they know technically how to get it to sound fantastic. I'm... always struggle confidence-wise. Writing, from a technical point of view, mixing down, everything. I'm never super confident in anything I've ever done. So with the payoff... Afterwards, when you see that and then people come back and say, I really like your tune or the tune sold well or whatever, it just gives you confidence to go and do something else. So when I had that run of... I think the thing is, especially when you're younger, you just, you don't think, you know, you're thinking about what you're doing. And I think, I think one of the things as well that I did and was a terrible thing to do was, it was kind of like the late 90s when you kind of, the internet really kind of became a thing, an issue and forums started to happen and things. And, you know. I think when forums came out and all that kind of stuff... you know, in retrospect, you know, especially nowadays, if you're up and coming, you don't listen to the forum, you don't listen to that chat, because it'll send you fucking crazy. But I did, you know what I mean, at the time, because it was new, and you think, oh, what are people saying? And people are saying all kinds of crazy stuff on there, and you're like, Jesus Christ, really? And so, I think, for the first time in ages, like, In the early 2000s, I went through a period when I was just thinking in general. You have to get back to that place where you're not. Exactly. And I only ever used to write for myself. And I went through a period of thinking. which kind of people are going to like this? And, you know, who is this going to appeal to? And all these things that just basically cloud your, your thought process. And, you know, as something that you might've liked ends up being all like. you know screwed up and or you take something apart because you think something's not going to work in in this environment or and you end up like the you know the tail ends up wagging the dog kind of thing and you end up in you know you end up in a bit of a muddle and I guess that's where working on your own can can work against you because you haven't you know if you're working with somebody or in a group You know, you can bounce off someone and say, no, no, we know we're doing the right thing. But this is kind of where Goldie comes into it. In a way, he sort of helped also kind of bounce ideas off of him and gave you the confidence to be like, you know what? Your stuff, we're doing it. You know what? There was definitely more of a. I think, you know, the drum and bass scene through the 90s was incredibly close. And, you know, this was, it was only during the mid 90s did we start to become international and start to travel and stuff. So, but even then, you know, through the 90s, you'd be cutting your dub plates and there was a lot more of this. you'd see people more on a regular basis and you could bounce, you know, so you had much more interaction with people. through the, through 2000 to 2010, people were much more international. You saw people less and less digital DJing came in. Um, I switched to playing CDs in, in 2002. One of the, I was one of the first kind of guys in within the drama base scene copped a lot of flack for it as well. Um, switching to CDs. And I think by the, by say 2004, 2005 maybe I was solely playing CDs like stopped cutting dubs and I wasn't really carrying much if any vinyl and you know you saw people less and less and so you know from during the 90s when like so a lot of the time I you know if I didn't call Goldie up or or in the middle of the night say listen to this I knew I'd be seeing him or somebody like like a crust or an Andy C or or a groove writer you'd see these people like weekly for for hours on end at music house where we used to go to cut dubs and so you know you could just play something that you were working on listen i've got something come and check this out in the car so you had that bouncing actually i never really thought about it too much but that's probably true so you're gonna you have this reference point where you could always bounce things off and those are the only opinions that mattered And then, you know, you get into 2000, you know, the internet age, the web 2.0 age and the forum age and the, where. all these opinions are out there and they're all, you know, even... It's hard to separate the wheat from the chaff. It is, especially when it first happened. You know, people, there's something saying people that listen to this, if you're to think of an age before the internet, you know, but before the internet was so important and so dominant, you know... Um, but the, you know, so I've been in a period when there was no internet and then a little bit of internet and then internet becoming, um, a monster, a real monster to the point now where, you know, I go through spells where I literally take myself off Twitter for a month. You know, I, you know, and I have to because it's just, A, you can waste a lot of time on that, but you can also... I think like, what the fuck am I doing? Just reading all this shit. I mean, some of it is, you know, some, it's like anything with the web. Some of the elements are really, really good and they have some really good things. But I mean, like Facebook and stuff like that, I can't go on those things when they drive me fucking nuts. Just, you know, and you have this whole. trolling phenomenon now where people are just kind of sending you messages trying to get a reaction out of you for whatever and I'm at like a real low level I can't imagine like if you're a real famous person oh god you can't read your app messages surely you may you mentioned Music House. And I think that's a place that actually, you know, you hear about all the parties, you hear about record labels and all these things. I think that's one place that goes almost underrated as like, so many people mention it as this meeting place. You're cutting dubs. It was so important. It was incredibly important because it wasn't just, like you say, it wasn't just a place where... We were physically cutting dub plates. It was a social interaction. And it was also... Tell me about it actually physically. Physically, okay. It was a place just off Holloway Road in North London. And it was a dingy little place. You'd drive down Holloway Road and then you'd turn right down. And you couldn't see it from the road. And then I can't even, do you know what? I can't even remember the first time I went there or who took me there. I really can't. But I used to, the Thursday used to be the prominent day because people would go there. For the weekend. And so, you know, you'd literally be there. I'd get there 10 in the morning. Most of the time when they're opening up and there'd be Paul and Chris and Leon. And, you know, you'd be going down there with your bunch of dads that you'd be cut. But the great thing was that through the day and you'd be there for like, I'd be there anyway for 12 hours. You know. I'd be leaving there at 9, 10 o'clock at night. And you go away, you get some food, you come back. But the great thing was you'd meet people periodically through the day and you'd shoot the breeze and chat about what you're doing and everything. But you'd also pick up. So say if I was going down there, for example, to cut. 15 tracks. I'd come away with 30 all the time simply because of all the people that you'd link up with during the day. And some people, you know, you know, you'd bump into the rusts and cronies, the crusts and runny sizes of this world. And you'd also bump into somebody, you know, who would optical, for example, optical. came down one night um there was myself and groove rider and a couple of other people there and this guy comes in like um but just you know with a beard and stuff on the box of dats as yeah you know so you guys um might want to listen to some of this So Groove took some dats and I took about three dats and went home, listened to this. I was like, shit, this stuff's fucking amazing. And, you know, he went on, this was Optical, went on with Ed Rush Optical, went on to be one of the most important producers. you know, within drum and bass. And you never would have gotten that if you hadn't been at Music House. Exactly. And he wouldn't have known where to go. And that's what I'm saying. For up and coming producers, it was like, okay, it's the easiest place to get my stuff to the guys, go to Music House on a Thursday. And there's so many people that came down there and that's the first time I ever met them. And, you know, they went on to be these like you know, corner pillars of the scene. So yeah, incredibly important place. And it was a great day. You know, we had a lot of fun, a lot of jokes and, you know, really good times. But yeah, physically it was like, oh, it was a dingy little place. In the winter, you'd have rats running up and down the alleyway, like literally big fucking ones as well, like dogs. Yeah, I mean, there was no, those times, there was no great feeling. I'd come, be driving home, because the thing was, obviously, I was living here in the Midlands, but driving back up the M1, and you've got this box of fucking fresh dubs all cut, and the smell, and I want to tell you, the smell when you, I used to go to Transco directly and buy my dub plates, because I used to cut on 12-inch plates. And they were really cool about it because they only used to let like a few guys bring their own plates down there because they only used to have 10 inch plates. I said, listen, can I bring, and they said, okay, yeah. Why did you want 12 inches? Because the quality would be better. Yeah, it would. It'd be louder. It'd be louder. And some of the tracks, you know, I was getting stuff from Bookham, from Good Looking, and those guys were making tracks that were eight, nine minutes long. So you'd either have to fade them down. or compromise on the quality to get them onto a 10 inch plate and you just couldn't do it. And, um, so they let you, you were one of the few who was able to bring it. Yeah. I used to, I know I used to cut on 12. I used to go to my first port of call where I'd go to Transco. Like I'd be at Transco at nine o'clock in the morning. and i'd buy um they'd give me the i'd buy them at trade i think it was i think it was about 120 pounds for for a box of 25 dubs maybe it's a bit more i can't remember some 150 quid i think and um And you crack open the box and it has this really distinctive smell even now when I literally I just got my records out of storage from my house move a few months ago about about a month ago actually and there was two boxes that were full of Dub plates and you open them and they still have that smell and takes you right back to music house It's wicked and but yeah driving back and you know you're driving back, you know, you'd be tired and it'd be a long day But you know you'd have like this you know, 20, 30 amazing tunes for the weekend. And it was also a learning experience as well, you know, because, you know, you got, I can remember the first day when Crust walked in with Soul in Motion, which was fucking... It was, I say this to everybody about this moment. When he walked in with this tune, it was like Buck Rogers had fucking just come from the future. Because this tune, to this day. you know, nobody's made anything remotely like it. People tried to emulate, but it was so, I even, I've asked him, I said, like, what the fuck was going on, man, there? Because, you know, everyone was, you know, Matt Les was doing their thing, and Ronnie and Di and those guys were doing their thing, and Bookham was doing their thing, and, you know, you had, you know, all these great people that were doing amazing music that period. And then Chris walks in with these tunes that were just like so far ahead and so different to anything else anyone was doing. Incredible. So, you know, I can remember driving home a couple of times from music house thinking. A, you'd have loads of great ideas because it was such a, you know, because it was a mountain part and you're hearing people's experiments and that's what they were back then, some of the tunes. They weren't finely polished as they are now because people have learned so much from that era and technology has evolved so much that people can make really, you know, incredibly well-produced tracks. relatively easily with the software available. But back then, it was a completely learning experience. People were kind of on the fly. There was no magazines to go to. There were no tutorials. There was no YouTube telling you how to do things. It was kind of, you know, you picked up bits and bobs from what you're doing. It was a lot of it. it was trial and error, you know, literally was trial and error. So when someone came with a really, really good mix, but like, fucking what, how did you do that? And he was like, oh yeah, well, you know, this Tascam thing, I did this and I did that. Okay, I'll go home and I'll try that. So it was really, it was fun as well. And I think. That was a big, always a, I think for anything you do, if it's fun, it's easy. And if it's fun and it's easy, you're not thinking about anything else, just writing things. So let's go to Friday and Saturday, the parties. You've mentioned in the past, obviously, the Metalheads night. was enormous. Rage was big. What was the party, though, for you that, you know, really stands out as the one? I think the one that's probably most important to me that really cemented me on the map and gave me an incredible platform would be the Blue Note. I mean, I'd had... you know, a successful run in the UK up to that point. When did this start? Blue Knot started in late 94. Yeah, I think late, late 94. So you already had some records behind you, obviously, at this point, and you'd been DJing for a while. Yeah, yeah. And the thing was, that was, it was important about Blue Knot and Speed, which was... the club that Fabio and LTJ Bookham did was around 94, you had the real explosion in the ragged jungle kind of thing within the drum and bass scene. I don't even think they called it still the drum and bass scene then. I don't think the term was coined, at least not, not as a, maybe it was, I can't really remember. I think it was more called jungle, but the ragged jungle thing was really, it was really. dominant and it was really really popular and it was really difficult for guys like me and for um for for bookham and for fabio who you know just didn't didn't and couldn't and wouldn't didn't want to play that kind of stuff um it was really difficult for us during that period to um to to play out i mean i i can remember an instance really vividly remember an instance where Me and Bookham were on an innovation night and everyone else was playing, you know, really hardcore, ragged, jump up jungle of the time. And the promoters kind of realized that Danny was supposed to go on after me. You know, just the way the times worked out where we were coming from different places. And they had a fucking like shit storm panic. It's like, you know, we can't, you can't have those two guys playing after each other. So they put on. some local guy for 15 minutes just to play like a bunch of jungle jump up tunes to so that you didn't have us playing you know so you wouldn't have two hours of no kind of and dan i can remember danny looking at me and in his mind he probably said to himself you know that's it i'm fucking doing my own thing i can't be doing with this this kind of madness why do you think things had gotten to that point I have no idea. You know, I mean, promoters, the day I understand promoters is the day I retire. I mean, I've never understood promoters. I mean, I don't understand them because... What do you think the music had gotten to that point, I suppose, also? Maybe that's a question. Again, I don't know. I think when something becomes popular, maybe this was like the first populist wave. And then you had a generation of people around 94, you know, a whole new bunch of producers came on the scene at once. And, you know, it was like, okay, so what's really popular? This is really popular. So you had this deluge of ragged kind of jungle stuff. And it was just really popular and it was just really difficult to play out. You know, we didn't really, we didn't have... home so speed which was more like the kind of um you know the ltj buckham kind of sound the fabio sound was set up so those guys just had a home where they could play their music and not feel intimidated or pressured to kind of play anything else on or and to feel comfortable and to and so and then the blue note was for a similar reason what so um so you know, me and Goldie and Randall and chemistry and storm. And so the artists as well, like Dillinger and Fotech and all that. So we could go, we had a place where we could just hear the music that we really liked and wouldn't be damned for it. And, um, was it immediately success? Yeah, the first night was really, really good, but it was like, we didn't know if anyone was going to show up, to be honest. I mean, I'm trying to think where we would have been in the Metalheads release schedule when Blue Nut first started. It would have been like between 0-1 and 10. I'm not sure specifically, but I mean, Metalheads... It was only just starting out. It wasn't like anything like what it is today. But they were... It was known. They were big hits. Yeah, but honestly, I can remember having conversations, late night conversations for hours with like Source Direct and Peche and Fotech and Fabio. And we'd speak on the phone like saying, fuck, are we doing the right thing? Because, you know... You know, we believe in what we're doing. We believe in the music we're doing, but Jesus Christ, this other thing is so popular. And, you know, those guys are getting booked so much and we're not. And I can remember going through the summer of... 94 and you know not playing out for like three four weeks and not been just you know not being booked because this other thing was so popular and so you know when that kind of happens you always kind of like to you know you believe but you do question yourself you're thinking um you know and i can remember vividly specifically having conversations being in the in pesce studio with phototech and saying fuck you know because we were such in the minority and when you're in a minority thinking are we just being pig-headed or are we right or do you stick to your guns and if it crashes and burns and so be it kind of thing because that was the thing that was always with me as a DJ was like I can only play the stuff I believe in and that I like and the time when you start playing stuff because it's popular or because you think the crowd want to hear it is the time you stop being a DJ and you become a disc jockey. And I never wanted to be a disc jockey. I always wanted to be a DJ. And I always have this clear distinction between the two. And people kind of sometimes hear it and think, well, you should play for the crowd. And of course I do. I do play for the crowd. I never lose sight of the fact that my primary goal is to keep people on the dance floor. but it's also important for me to sound like me because if I just sound like anyone else, then what's the point? You know, you may as well just book anybody. So, yeah, the Blue Note, the first night, I think I played and Fabio played. I think Goldie may have played. I can't remember. But it was good. It was just good to have a night where... How big was it? It was like three... You had three floors. You came in. But the actual downstairs... You had to go downstairs to where the main dance floor was. But I mean, I'm sure if I went in... I'm not even sure if the building's there anymore. I think it was knocked down a while ago. But I'm pretty sure if I... I went in there now, if I physically could, I'd be like, fuck, this is small. You know, that kind of happens sometimes. And you're still afraid that you aren't going to be able to fill it. Yeah, I think. But going back to your initial question, definitely the blue note because A, it kind of validated what we believed in. And it kind of, it was like a safe place for us to come to. And the artists would come down, you know, your Dillinger's and your Lemon D's and those kind of guys. come down and people who were into that kind of music and then would become go on to become really important producers would come down because it was where you could hear cutting edge drum and bass which to me was always the point of what drum and bass was supposed to be drum and bass was always supposed to be a part the component was to be experimental to take risks to be interesting And as soon as drama based becomes not interesting, then I'm not interested in it kind of thing. So that was a really fun time. And obviously in retrospect, looking back on it, we had no idea that so many people were coming there from all around the world. You know, you'd meet people, especially during this like heyday run of kind of 95 and 96. you know, you get there on a Sunday and the queue would be fucking enormous and you'd have people at the end of the night. And the crazy thing was that it finished at like midnight, 1230. So it started at like 7, 8. Why did they make the decision? Were you part of that discussion Sundays, 7 o'clock to 12? I think Sunday, I mean, because Speed was on a Thursday. And I think it was a conscious decision to just not go ahead, try to go head to head with Fridays and Saturdays and just to give people something different. So would you get a lot of people who had gone out the previous two nights? I think so. Looking back on it, it was also a cool move because it gave people a clear distinction between what was going on because you could go out on Friday and Saturday and hear the mainstream, what was going on in the mainstream. That's what people got to realize. I don't think sometimes people realize that Metalheads was always big. It wasn't. It was left field. And that was the first time, the first of many times that I've ever thought, crikey, I'm left of center here kind of thing. I think I've always been slightly left of center. And I kind of like being left. The times when I've been mainstream, I haven't really felt comfortable with it because I'm not a kind of mainstream. When have you been mainstream? I don't think so. Maybe after Shadowboxing, I think, because it was so big that they put me on loads of mainstream gigs. But I don't consider myself mainstream. I don't think I've ever really played mainstream. The thing that you said about Blue Note I found kind of interesting is that it was a safe place. I mean, we'd always like, I personally would always like to think I'd have confidence to play whatever I wanted to do. But if I'm playing on some big rave lineup with, you know, there would be, there was certain tracks, I can't play this here. It would just go down a bomb. I know it would bomb. What's the point? you'd just be okay you're making a statement but you'd bomb so you know i and but my my kind of mantra is i can only play what's in my box or in my bag and what's in my bag is everything i like anyway but definitely there will be certain gigs around that period i think there's no point in playing this because it just wouldn't work Whereas the blue note, that was the first time I think I played out and I played things at different tempos. I could play, I felt so confident and comfortable. And especially during the peak run where the crowd was so willing for you to play literally whatever you wanted. you know, you play some down tempo thing or a 4-4 thing in the middle of your set or the end of your set and people would go with it, which... at the time was like, fuck, what the fuck, you know, if you tried to do that somewhere else, you'd probably get hauled off. Or people would look at it and go, what the fuck are you doing? Kind of thing. So, but Metalheads as well, in that initial release period, I think was a safe place for all of us. Not just the Blue Note, the club was a safe place to go out, but the label, I felt, me as well, gave... If you look at those artists that are on from the first release through, say, 12, D'Alengio, Lemon D, Feltec, Source Direct, Pesce. we it was a camaraderie and we all felt kind of safe together it was like okay we're all on we're all kind of like-minded we're all sound completely different but we all have a similar philosophy of what we think where we think this music should go and so it kind of you didn't feel so isolated and there were times, like I say, that's why we had these sometimes late night conversations where we'd have to kind of reassure each other that we're fucking not crazy. I remember you saying that in an interview. about how you were feeling four or five years ago about drum and bass or maybe it was a little bit before that and you were talking to D-Bridge, Marcus Intellects and some other people thinking what's going on? These crisis of confidence. I think I question it all the time. It's not, it's not, it's become, not to become a rare phenomenon for me to question the scene and what I'm doing and everything. Yeah, I kind of constantly have to. But you remain in it and you obviously are still passionate about it. Yeah, absolutely. I think when drum and bass is at its best. it can be it can be amazing and it still is and the time when that stops happening is the time i'll you know consider moving on to doing something else what is it doing nowadays in your mind that's really fresh and exciting like maybe not necessarily producers or djs or anything but just like it is a sound that has a tempo now and there is that does sometimes stifle creativity and Do you know what I think has been one of the most important things in the past two or three years is... I don't know if it's been a conscious decision, but... it's happened anyway, is that some of us are playing slower. And I think it's really important. When I do the Future Beats podcast that I do, I record them at like 170, 172 maximum. And I think it just makes such a big difference. It's only a few BPMs, but it just, it allows the music to breathe. And then you can incorporate other, you know. Some people send me some stuff and it's like at 166, 168. And, you know, sometimes I'm going on after guys in clubs and they're playing at over 180. It's just like way too fast. It's ridiculous. And like that high energy drum and bass, it doesn't need, it's got so much energy in it anyway. Why do you need to pitch it up? It's like this thing is... It's like Red Bull on steroids. You don't need to pitch it up. This thing is full of energy. You know, I don't get it. And so one of the things that I think has been important, and I think Darren did it as well with these Autonomic podcasts, I think they're around 170, was just bring it down a touch. And now you've got a bunch of guys now that, you know, most of the things they send me are, and they're 170. 170 is like the stuff It's like stock 170s is the kind of de facto BPM and it's really really important It's because it just allows people to do so much more because you don't have this frantic pace And, you know, you think like, well, what's the big difference from 176, 178 to 170? But it's huge. And then it allows people to do these half tempo things. And then when you do half tempo at 170, sometimes you think, Jesus Christ, is that a 170? I don't even know because you can just do so much more. And it just allows a lot more freedom to kind of, rather than just have the stock. kind of thing. Were you ever thinking about tempos back in the 90s? The number so much? No, but there was... a period when I can remember when Ibiza records they did a tune it was called 150 BPM and at the time I was like what the fuck this is so fast and then it was really crazy because if you look back at the initial kind of jungle tunes and then there's a period say from 93 to 95 when it just kind of motored from 140 to 170 in a two-year period it's like what happened then i don't even know what happened then within a year there were tracks that you couldn't play in your set or were difficult to get in because they were just too slow kind of thing So that's the only time I think Tempo was ever thought about. But I consciously made a, you know, thought about it for the last two or three years. And simply because I was getting sent some stuff as well. And these guys, you know, guys from Russia and everything were sending me tunes and they were at 170. And I was like, you know what? That sounds really nice. bring some of these other tunes down to that tempo and especially when you're doing a podcast or a studio mix or something there's no need to belt it out at some ridiculous tempo who wants to well me personally who wants to kind of sit on a on a plane or at home listen to a podcast at some you know a million miles an hour It's an interesting one though. I ask about the beats per minute specifically because I find it really interesting that it seems like only in the past couple of years that we're really talking about numbers more often. You have dubstep at 140. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think from a drum and bass perspective, I think it's, you know, like I say, There are occasions like now as well. I go on after people and they are playing over 180 BPM. And I just think it's too fast. I think there's a limit to anything, surely, because I think to myself... okay, you guys are pushing 182, 184. Are you going to keep getting faster? Are you going to start pushing 190 soon? Because when you get to 200, you're in the Gabba territory. You know, Jesus Christ, who wants to be there? Kind of thing, you know. So... Yeah, but it's interesting though because dubstep is referred to a lot by its tempo. And people say, no, it's not dubstep because it's 134. And so, yeah, you're right. People do talk about BPMs a lot more in the last few years than they ever have done. Maybe it's just because they can see it on their tractor screen. Yeah, that's probably true. Yeah, that's probably true. Let's go back to the Metalheads. You mentioned you had Blue Note. Enormous success. When did Blue Note end? Why? I think it ended in 97. I think the venue was... kind of run its course and I think also logistically I think they had to get out of there as well as I remember I think that you know there were so many complaints from the residents from about the noise and just the um and you know the people and the traffic and everything because it was like in a residential area Hoxton Square was you know it wasn't like kind of out of town or stuff so There was constant issues with the noise and traffic and kind of stuff like that. And at the time they'd moved to Leisure Lounge. That's when we moved to doing a Saturday night thing. So I loved Leisure Lounge. Leisure Lounge was amazing. It was like a much bigger version of the Blue Note. And so it allowed a lot more people to go. It was regular club hours, you know, from 10 till 5, I think it was, something like that. And you also could play longer sets. You know, more often I'd get there and you could play two-hour sets. And playing two-hour sets in the UK at that time was unheard of. You know, it was great on all levels. As I remember, I think they had to get out of there from the blue note as well. And I think it served its purpose. And, you know, you just didn't want to kind of like keep doing it for the sake of doing it kind of thing. It was difficult as well because they tried a number of venues after that to try and replicate. And then you kind of realized that it wasn't as much as it was about the music. It was about the venue and it was about the... the period of time and the timeframe and everything. It was such a, one of those unique situations that, you know, and they, they did try to replicate it and you just couldn't, you couldn't, you couldn't, you just couldn't replicate what happened in that period. And, um, what was going on with you musically around that time that, yeah. In terms of like, how you were changing and what you were making? Um, Oh, Blue Note inspired me to do probably some of my, from a production point of view, some of my best stuff. Um, I think, you know, so I mean after that, yeah, I'm kind of interested in that. Like, sort of period where it's like we're not sure where to go after this amazing... The thing that really changed for me personally was the whole period after the Blue Note was becoming an international DJ. I'd played a few times in Germany and stuff like that. But... I think during 96, I went to Brazil for the first time, went to Japan. Me and Goldie went to America. And a lot of the times we like, I was either the first drum and bass DJ or the second after Groove Rider and Fabio to go somewhere. So it was really like... It was really exciting. It was really important. But it also had a detrimental effect on me producing because for the first time, you're doing all this traveling. And I was, you know, you didn't want to say no to anything at this time. You get invited to go to all these amazing places. So from a production point of view, that's when I was like, also, I was like, this is now my role. My role is to be this international kind of DJ and to read, try and spread. drum and bass to as many people as possible. Did you feel like an evangelist? No, but it was, but it did feel. It did feel important and that can sound really pretentious, but it didn't feel like I was going to do a gig. You know, if you're going to, you know, when me and Goldie, we played in San Francisco and Los Angeles and they were like the first drum and bass gigs that they did in California. You know, we kind of realized that it was important. And it was important to kind of, to, you know, hopefully be received well. I mean, at the end of the day, you can only play your set. You know, you can't change anything that you're going to do. But we were aware of, you know, being, and hopefully a big deal. You know, these people. This might be the first time that they're. Yeah. I mean, obviously, basically, it was people that had been to the Blue Note. you know because like i say we had a lot of international people that came there heard it was like fuck I really would love to hear that where I'm from. And so these people would then bring us out to... That exact same situation as your early days with the UK promoters. Yeah. On a worldwide scale. Yeah, exactly. So, and then I remember in, I think, 97, I went to Australia and to New Zealand. And I still have people saying to me now... I heard you in 97, but I did a tour in 1997 in America. I think it was like a three-week tour with Ed Rush and J Magic. And we did all these dates all across America and through Canada. And it wasn't just like that people were hearing drum and bass. Like, you know, I'm sure Hype and Andy and those guys were going out there and doing things. I think it's one of the first kind of tours where three guys were playing and we were doing, we were doing like, we would take over the whole night. So if the club was run till four, so we'd be on from 11 till four. So they were getting this kind of. not just a set, but they were getting like five hours worth of, of really good, you know, what we thought was really good drum and bass kind of thing. And yeah, they were, they were, they were exciting times, but they also, you know, I get back, especially, and I wasn't used to the kind of that kind of traveling and, you know, we didn't, there were no iPods there and stuff like that. So I'd get back from, from Japan and I'd be like fucking And then you come back and do your, you know, you bunch of UK gigs. And it was tough then to go into the studio and do something kind of creative. And that's when I go back to that point of, you know, Music House was... then say in the late 90s was um you could spend less of your time there because you didn't have as much time to kind of do stuff so then you had a kind of relationship with music house where you'd kind of go there and leave your dads there for them to cut during the week and then you go and pick them up the week after because you just physically, you know, you couldn't be there kind of thing. And in retrospect, you know, looking back, then you missed out on all that kind of interaction kind of thing. And it was, but it was happening to a lot of us at the same time. It's happening to everyone. Yeah. You know, so everyone was like, you know, Bookham and, and all the, you know, the represent guys it kind of just, drum and bass exploded in that kind of mid to late 90s from a worldwide kind of thing. And everyone was just traveling, traveling kind of thing. And that's when the first times... when you kind of realize, damn, I haven't seen Groot for four months, or you're already passing briefly kind of thing. So, yeah, there are exciting times, but they, you know, but they were also, yeah, drawbacks as well. You have mentioned a lot of names around, you know, Bukum, Ronnie Size, and Goldie, and I know, you know, all these people have a sound. I wonder if... you ever were identified with a sound in your mind um you know what what do people have in their minds when they know the name hear the name ducks i don't as an as a producer um you know what i i really don't know and people say that they do um I really don't know. The only thing maybe is, you know, the tracks that I've made that I can remember producing is that the beats and the drums are always the most important thing, the thing that I spent the most time on, you know, the most attention on. And Goldie always says to me that, you know, he can spot my percussion a mile off and spot the gaps that I leave in the tracks. He always says to me, it's the spaces in your tunes. I have no idea what he's talking about. I say, okay, you know, and I, you know. I guess it's more minimal before minimal became a thing. But my stuff has always been more minimal, certainly because I'm not that good technically, a producer, and I'm quite lazy as well. I've always believed in less is more. I've always been amazed by some techno tunes that are so basic, but they're so effective. I mean, you know, that was one of the premises behind writing Shadowboxing was, you know, I wanted to kind of replicate one of those amazing techno tunes that just has one sound that does everything in the tune. And it was also... It was also kind of, it was a kind of backlash, my personal little backlash against tunes that for me were just so overproduced that were amazing technically. I listened to some of these tracks that I was given around the time. I couldn't dream of ever making a tune like that. And I couldn't dream of... putting that much effort into making a tune either because uh and i was like you know it doesn't need to be that technical for my taste my personal taste i mean i know and i know a lot of people love that kind of stuff they love listening to all edits and crazy layers and stuff like that and you know i do when it's done well but i don't like edits just for edit's sake kind of thing because then you just get into nasal gazing territory and even though i i i think like derek may when he did that tune beyond the dance is such a fantastic expression and i always use it so you never really want to you never want to go beyond the dance as especially like i always say that as as a dj i never want to go beyond the dance i do play what i you know what i like But I know what my role is. My role isn't to kind of be this kind of person on a hill preaching. My role is to keep people on the dance floor and to get people on the dance floor. and it's a very fine line. You can mess up and you can go up your own ass if you're not careful and you can go beyond the dance and kind of thing. It's a dangerous territory. But yeah, going back to your point, my sound, I really don't know. It's difficult for me to say. When you say, you know, minimal... and you're a little bit lazy as a producer, but did you find yourself taking elements out, like building things up and then just being like, Ooh, that's just too much. Or was it? No, I would, my, my, my, it is really laziness. No, my, my, my, my thought would be, um, that's enough. Okay. That'll do. Or it just doesn't need anymore. I think I'd write something and say, yeah, I don't think that really needs anymore. It would just be over-egging the pudding. I could do more to it. But yeah, I could be... quite i'd kind of know when it would be content i'd be like yeah that's that will work i could do more to it but i but it was also i think maybe um maybe a bit paranoid of spoiling it because especially if i got a mix down that that's that that has always been the bane for me mixing down tunes jesus christ it's like especially like now that's one thing that kind of has put me off recently it's because I've had trouble with my ears and I've never been never enjoyed the process of mixing tunes down always found it difficult and so I went through a period when I had real trouble with my ears and it was just a nightmare so you know it was no point I was like why am I why am I trying to write music and I can't even like begin to kind of hear it, mix it down. Why do you find it so tough? I mean, aside from your problems. Oh, even back in the day. I don't know. I think... I was always I think it's a confidence thing like I say going back I would always be envious of say Dillinger or or a Bookham or a Goldie or whatever be like marvel at their mixes and I can remember Carl Dillinger saying to me one time I can't remember what tune it was, but him saying to me, he said, oh, yeah, the EQ on that track you did was fucking perfect. And I'd say to him, really? You know, coming from you, I'll take that, man. Do you know what I mean? But I was like, wow, because I'm never happy. I've never been happy with a track I've mixed down. And when I first went through my problems with my ears. I kind of went through some of my old stuff and listened to it and I was amazed at the quality of the mix downs and what I was doing was nowhere near or in my mind nowhere near that kind of stuff. So I know I was adamant that if I couldn't make anything that wasn't even on a par with anything I've done, then there's no point in putting it out. kind of thing tinnitus was it yeah yeah that doesn't go away no um but you said you had problems like you're how are you dealing with it well basically i i mean i did i used to dj without earplugs for for the longest period of time um And then I had, you know, I think you have over a period of time, you have deterioration in your hearing. And then it was just the initial deterioration that I struggled to deal with. And like I say, lacking confidence in the mix downs anyway. And then, so then being able to, you know, really struggling, not just in your mind, but actually kind of physically, because, you know, you just can't hear certain frequencies the way you did. And then sometimes after gigs, I'd get in and have this kind of horrible rumbling in, especially in my left ear. And I went to, I went to see some specialists and they said to me, you know, you've got, I had hyperacusis at the time, which was like every little. sound would like if a phone rang it would really really hurt my ears and said you know you've got the first signs of tinnitus you know you can take steps now you know, wear earplugs and, you know, you won't get full-blown tinnitus, but he said, you know, you have lost some receptiveness in your ears. But, you know, I haven't got full-blown tinnitus, but definitely, you know, my ears aren't what they were, kind of thing. And I know there's some people that have got full-blown tinnitus and I think Optical from Ed Richland, I think, you know, he Yeah, I mean, if you listen to a lot of the guys from the 90s, I don't think any of them have... the sound that they did. I know, obviously I know equipment's changed and that changes the dynamic of the sound. Cause when people switched from analog to digital, you could, you know, you really, it, you just can't replicate, um, those Akai and Emu samplers and, uh, do you all the outboard stuff or at least I haven't heard anyone replicate it to, to that level. Cause you were, but you were one of the first people to move to CDs. So you're right. Obviously not, uh, have a problem with certain aspects of, no, no, no, no game. But, uh, but it is, it went, when I, when I first like transitioned to, um, to logic, it was, it was um it was yes it was a struggle it was a struggle to to um it just just because it was just so different and and you know you just got used to um you know comfortable in doing it a certain way but it was also like long and time consuming the great thing about obviously digital is it's is it's quick it allows you to you know it allows you to write quite easily but but Even now, I mean, I'm doing some stuff at the moment, but I'm like working on one drum and bass tune and the other three things are all around 130, which I'm just finding. easier to kind of get my head around. It's interesting. Marcus Intellects is also doing quite a bit of stuff. Yeah. But the thing is, I think like for us guys, it's kind of, we're just going full circle. I mean, I've never, my first love was techno and I've never strayed too far away from it kind of thing. I've always kind of. kept an ear out for that stuff. I always buy it all the time. And if I can, if I'm playing somewhere and say, for example, Kevin Swanderson or whoever's playing, I'll go out my way to go and hear them play. It's my first love kind of thing. It's for me where everything comes from techno. So drum and bass is an extension. In my mind, pure drum and bass is just an extension of the philosophy of techno, just a different tempo. And if it's done right, I think you shouldn't really... I always think if it's done right, you shouldn't notice the tempo of drum and bass. I think... by me saying it's done right people will say oh well are you saying people are doing it wrong no I'm not what I'm saying is you just you know tempo shouldn't be an issue I think sometimes if you know when a song is great you don't think about it no exactly that's bottom line true I do find it interesting I think for someone like yourself, it did grow out of techno and it's an easy, natural progression. But it's interesting now you have this generation of people who've grown up where drum and bass was the start. Right. And they, it's not bad or anything, but it's just a thing. No, I mean, we, I noticed it. I noticed it first of all, during the late night is where, um, people you had like maybe the second generation of drum and bass producers that came around during the late 90s and their um jazzy influence jazz influences would come from jazzy drum and bass tunes not jazz you know and their um techno influences, you know, wouldn't come from techno. It came from, you know, Wax Doctor or these kind of people who made drum and bass with a techno kind of, you know, tinge to their tunes. And I always find that a bit, I mean, there was nowhere around it for those guys unless they were really dedicated and wanted to go and source stuff out. But, you know, if you're of a certain age, then that's all you, you can only... draw upon what you get to, you know, the spectrum of sound, what you get to hear. But I also, I also kind of felt sorry. I think, wow, that's really kind of, or, or made me appreciate the era that I grew up in, that I, that I got to hear these things at source. I think most interesting, most great producers are actually grew up loving something and then making something else. Right. Like. Because they have that influence and took that take on it. is doing now for example in the house and techno realm is really interesting definitely because he's bringing this completely different perspective to it right you're working on this stuff i mean is there any plans to release it yeah hopefully that's the goal okay i really you know i'm really um when it when it's when it's finished i'm going to send it to um you know send it to a couple of people and um you know my my you know my goal i would i would be so i would be um chuffed is the word i would be so pleased it would be such an accomplishment for me if um if i do if i do you know if i do a couple of um tunes around 130 128 and um someone wants to put them out i will be i would be more proud of that than anything i really would because Like I say, techno is the first thing I fell in love with. And I've never strayed too far from it. And especially lately, I've really got back into techno over the last like... for four or five years. When we were driving over here, we were listening to a live set from Scudge. Yeah. And I was thinking to myself, yeah, this is exactly what I thought I'd be listening to as I was driving to Doc Scott's house. Yeah, it's just, I don't know. I find it so... When I hear it, it just seems like, yeah, this is so perfect. When it's right. I mean, I was in London a couple of weeks ago and Marcel Detman was at Fabric and he was playing the last set. So 3.30 till 6.00. and I was playing two to three at this place, and the place in London, so it was perfect, so boom, over there, and I'm on the floor, on the dance floor, like, you know, it's like a regular, you know, a regular, dude, just listen to this guy, and it was like two hours of bliss, and it's so inspiring as well, I don't know, I mean. It's not to say I'm not inspired by drum and bass because I am. If I wasn't, I wouldn't be doing the mixes series that I do. And those I'm doing more for my own sanity than anything else is to kind of say to myself, like, yeah, there's some good music out there and it makes me want to put it together. And it's also, I enjoy the feedback from doing those. it's two-pronged, the Future Beats podcasts. They're done for, like I say, partly for my own kind of sanity and to keep me, to make sure that I'm still interested and feeling the tunes, and I am. And then it's also to, as a testing ground, because I put them out there and, you know, they're quite experimental. Some of the stuff on there is quite experimental. And it's, I'm really interested to see how people receive it and are they into it. And just to say like, look, there's, there's, there's another, there's a, there's another kind of drum and bass out there beyond. what's in the in the in the mainstream kind of thing and the reaction and and what's good is as well is is i get so much cool feedback from from the artists whose tracks i include you know they'll say oh thanks for playing my tune and then some of these people have now interacting with each other who would never maybe never have you know interacted with each other because you know someone will contact someone and say, oh, listen, I heard your tune on Future Beat 7 and would you like to, my track was on volume five and they're swapping tunes and then some of them have made tunes together and I think that's fantastic. It's kind of the... digital version of music house it's exactly that yeah it's it's exactly that and so you get these collaboration tunes of people that are in different countries never met each other which is fantastic that you can do that technically and that they've come together through and i think like darren did a lot with the autonomic things as well was you know he he really started that thing of like look i want to try and do something a bit different and you know bring through this whole you know just some different the whole bunch of different artists and it gave people a lot of confidence and it takes me back full circle to the metalheads days because i've had conversations with people online and i really make probably more now than i ever have done of getting in contact with people that send me stuff that i really like or even if they are that i'm quite Maybe it wouldn't play out, but I know where this guy's coming from. And I now, because I know how isolated some of these guys feel because you have these kind of behemoth mainstream drum and bass. And then you've got these guys kind of making this kind of maybe to some people weird 170 tunes like that have got no snares in. You know, I can remember playing out the first time I was playing that kind of stuff out when we first started doing a bunch of cuts nights at the Arches. Someone coming up to me saying, you're playing tunes with no snares. And like, it was such a wild concept. And now it's like, it's not that big a deal. You hear loads of tunes with predominantly a kick drum and percussion and maybe one snare on a 16 bar loop. But when you first heard that, people were fucking freaked out, really freaked out. Do you think that the podcast and the autonomic podcast were actually are going to be looked back on as like a kind of a moment where... people started to open up a little bit again? For me, when I first heard, when Darren did the first Autonomic podcast, I was like, you know, it had an influence on me, definitely. Because I had a lot of those tunes, but I wasn't quite sure of them. I knew I liked them, but I wasn't quite sure, and I wasn't quite sure how to put them together or integrate them into the set. And, you know, I had some of these great tunes and I was thinking, okay, how can I work these into my set and get them in? And every now and then I'll try and, you know, slide one in on the back of like what you'd consider regular kind of more, you know, formulaic drum and bass tune. When I say formulaic, just, you know, in a standard kind of pattern. and then you know something with snares in it something with with a snare in it yeah so i i think the autonomic ones where i would like to think that you know the defeat that you know honestly the feedback that the um that the future beats podcasts have got have given me a lot of um positivity to carry on, not just doing them, but carry on within. There are times, especially lately, there are times when I can get disillusioned with the thing. And I don't think it's much disillusion, but I think I do now sometimes think, I've been doing this for a long time and there's no, it's not written in stone that you should do the same thing forever. And there are aspects of it, like I'm 41 now, and it's just basic numbers. There are certain tunes, music made by a 16-year-old is not really going to appeal to me, and nor should it. Do you know what I mean? And an audience that is a demographic of, say, 18 to 21. are not going to be really into my sound or my taste or what I want to put forward. And I completely understand that. So, you know, there are times when I kind of question what's my role in the scene and what's my position? Because, you know, I don't, there's a whole bunch of music that I'm not comfortable. So do you look at the podcast in a way as kind of the start of that? Like that is your role to sort of bring along some of these new people who are doing these out there things? I wouldn't say it's my, it's, it's, it's catharsis to me as well. You know, it's, um, It's, you know, I can, I've got, that's my two, those podcasts are like, this is my two hours of being self-indulgent kind of thing. And you put it out there and if a bunch of people want to listen to it. that's great. And the feedback is 99% of the time is really, really good and positive. And that gives me the confidence, man. Honestly, a lot of the time, because if you're out there in the mainstream and you're playing mainstream stuff, the top 10 selling tunes, it's not an issue. Because there's no risk taken there. You're not taking any risks. You know, those guys know what you play. They know what they want. Where's the risk? It's A, B, C, boom. And it works. And more power to them. But that's never interested me. What's interested me is interest in tunes. And tunes that make you... To me, I've never liked... dance music that's just purely physical. That's just gone as a physical reaction. I like dance music, but not every track can be like that. But you know, I like a DJ that, you know, through his set, he'll play something like, whoa, you know, or just makes you think or visualize something or some kind of stimulation for your brain, not just an hour's worth of physical. red bull you know spunk out music and i've never been about that so so the podcast and it also is it gives people indication that if they go and hear me play somewhere they're not going to be shocked i think fuck man where's the drum and bass that kind of thing so they've got an idea it's also to kind of reinforce your identity especially if you kind of going through a period of where you're slightly changing your sound or you're adapting things into your set, you know, because... Do you feel like you had to do that almost in a way for audiences to know that you may not get... Maybe. Yeah, maybe because I wanted to incorporate some of that kind of music into my set, rather than them having a big freak out moment. I mean, like I said, I go back to my point. I never want to go beyond the dance. To me, that's brought a lot of fun back into DJing because I find it fun and a challenge to see sometimes what I can get away with. Do you know what I mean? what kind of things can I slip in there subliminally and they don't even realize that I've kind of played a tune that maybe some people in the crowd would go, oh, I would never like this kind of thing. But if you kind of get to a point in your set and you think, no, I can get away with anything now. And then you can go into a 15 minute period of really dubby stripped down stuff. And then when you... I mean, I've always kind of looked at DJing that way. And then when you come back in with the more stuff that they kind of would know, then those tunes have more effect because you've kind of brought the set down and you've kind of took it to some little subterranean moment for 15 minutes. And then you come back in with something that they all know and then the place goes nuts. And so I go back to techno. I listen to techno DJs and that's what they do. They build. It not not just I mean that's one thing that kind of I was gonna say disappoints and it sounds like I'm a really kind of father disappointed in a child but I sometimes am disappointed with drum and bass because I listen to it and I think come on man you don't really need to do do play to that lowest common denominator and that's sometimes how I see drum and bass and I think sometimes some of the artists and some of the DJs don't give enough credit to the audience that they're smarter than what they think and they don't need to have some tunes to be so dumbed down and I know that kind of sounds condescending but it's not meant to be it's just my observation you can you can you can apply that to any it's not just in drum and bass it's in techno in trance house whatever you hear water down dumb down it's horrible To me, you know. It's just horrible in general. Yeah. And I always think like, come on, man. Give people more credit than that. Who are you passionate about right now in drum and bass? Labels, artists? I mean, who in your mind is actually? Calibre, always. I mean, that's such an easy stock answer, but he always makes stuff that, he never makes a bad tune. I mean, God, he never makes remotely a bad tune. And now he's going through this phase as well where he's kind of experimenting and he's doing different kind of stuff. And I swear, if you ever get to speak to him, you think I'm not confident? Good God, this guy doesn't, I don't think he likes any of his own stuff. He's always kind of down on his own stuff or he'll be like, yeah, something I knocked up and blah, blah, blah. And it's like this thing that's really amazing. Obviously, Darren, I love, yeah, D-Bridge. I think, you know, what he's got set up there, I think his label is really, really important. I've been actually amazed at it. he's positioned the label now. The full length that they put out was just this strange ambient thing from this guy from Romania. They're doing Fracture, Get Busy. They're doing straight up drum and bass. It's really clever what he's done. It's about building trust as well with, I think, your audience. And he's got a great, I think he's got a great relationship with the people that like his label and listen to his show. And they trust him. And that's a great thing. When you can get in a position when your audience or the people that like you trust you to say, okay, yeah, hit us with something really obscure or new or whatever. like you say, and I think maybe the get busy thing maybe surprised people because they're like, whoa, this is kind of like a raving kind of tune, but it doesn't matter. A good tune is a good tune. And people really need to get off this kind of labels and tempos and whatever thing. And really, it's fundamentally, is it a good track? and does it do what it's designed to do kind of thing. I think he's gotten exit to me in my mind. So many label owners talk about wanting to be like warp, which is like this idea of. all it's just electronic music and i think he's gotten to that place definitely and yeah it's kind of an amazing place to be where your audience just follows you wherever you it takes a lot of work i think you know i mean stuff like that doesn't happen overnight and it's it's similar to like um being a DJ as well, I can remember it took ages for me to feel confident enough. And you have to go out there and take risks. So people know, so you develop a personality as a DJ and then you can get to a level where it's kind of like. you're allowed to kind of play something and I think like the Blue Nut really did that for me that gave me it allowed me grace where I can go to places and play certain stuff and maybe that I mean look anyone can go somewhere and play something whether you get away with it is another thing or whether the people have enough goodwill to let you do that or say yeah okay because i can remember playing at sun and bass once at the sun and bass festival in sardinia and i started with like a five minute ambient intro thing like this techno thing but i love this piece of music i don't even know i stumbled across it i think it was actually i think it was a richie horton did a top 10 And it was in there. It was like, there's no beats in it or nothing. It was, but it was amazing. It's like science fiction with strings and chords and everything. And I was like, you know what? One day I'm going to fucking play this somewhere. I don't care. And I was at Santa, and I played it and everyone was kind of standing, but everyone went with it and I got away with it because. It was like, oh, okay, it's Scottie, it's Dr. Heen. Yeah, okay, we'll give him that. He can get away with that one. And then I've kind of mixed this tune into it and it worked. And it was kind of on the fly as well. Like I said, I'd had this tune maybe for about a year and never thought there'll be a moment when it'll be appropriate to play it. And when he was inside, I was like, you know what? This, fuck it, man. I'm going to go for it. Confidence is a big thing for me personally. Yeah, going back to your point, Calibra, Exit. I love what Loxie's doing. Loxie's making some great stuff. You've got Skeptical, who I was a big fan of when I first heard this guy. This guy's doing something different and he sound reminded me of early photo tech. You know this really clean Stripped down sound and his drums didn't sound like anybody else's like he was obviously spending a lot of time you know creating his own snares and his own kicks and and then making damn good tunes with it. And that's, you know, that's, that's, that's the key. And now he's doing some fucking amazing stuff. And not only that, he's getting, you know, noticed now and he's getting relevant. He's elevated. I mean, before the marker thing, obviously post marker, it's, there's a massive spotlight on him, but yeah. And obviously. Who else? Eni makes some great stuff. There's a guy, I think it's something to do with, oh, it's Pessimist. It's called Rough House. And he made this tune called The Foot, man. And I put it on, I think it was on volume eight or seven or eight. And then since then, he's been sending me, he sent me like about six things. They are all amazing tunes. I'm not even sure who it is. So I've got, I think some guy from Bristol. And what's really cool is, is some of these guys like skeptical when he first kind of. showed up maybe three years ago or at least on my radar three years ago um is that you got these younger younger guys younger producers and they're consciously making a decision to say i don't want to make that make the stuff on the mainstream stuff i want to make stuff that will appeal to these guys kind of thing and that's what the bunch of cuts nights that we do It's the modern day blue now. For me, it's the equivalent. It's the same philosophy of some guys that think alike. you know, me, Darren, Clute, Debridge, Marcus, Calibre. And... Where is the best place to play in London these days, speaking of that? I'm curious, because the end for a long time seemed to be a really big stronghold. My favourite, my favourite. I love playing at Fabric. Yeah. The only... Sound system is amazing. Oh, the sound system is perfect. You know, if anything, sometimes I find it a bit too loud. If there can be such a thing as Too Loud, you know, you could come down a notch or two for me. But Fabric is a fantastic place. I'm privileged, you know, they've been really good to me down there. I think, like, they, from when they started, they asked me to do one of their, when they did their podcast way back when, I think I did number three for them. Those guys have been really good to me down there. And I really appreciate the continued support. And it's a great place to play. I love it. But when we do the Bunch O' Cuts night, I think that's my favorite place and time to play in London. And it's the only time I go out. Two hours before, I'm due to play and I'll stick around until pretty much to the end because everyone, you know, I love all those guys, what they play and they all bring something completely different. They all do something, bring something different to the table, although it's from the same side of the fence, so to speak. And, you know, they all play stuff. like I said to you before I know I'm going to hear a bunch of tunes that I don't know and I want to know what it is and that's I think when that point comes that I don't feel that. That's the time when I think that, yeah, I think I'm done with drum and bass now or drum and bass is done with me. But I still have those moments at the last bunch of cuts. I think Darren played after me and then Skeptical and Dub Physics did a back-to-back and they played some of their new stuff. And I was like, whoa, that's awesome. So for me to be able to like still have that feeling, it's like, yeah, it's still in there. It's just every now and then I get, I'll get down on myself and I go through my annual, annual, I've had it with drummer bass and I have my little tantrum and kind of throw my toys out the pram. But, but you always come back. Yeah, I always come back. *music* you
