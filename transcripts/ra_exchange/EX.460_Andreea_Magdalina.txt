Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resonant Advisor. This week on The Exchange, we return to RA's London office for a live recording of the second edition of Full Circle, RA's series of talks celebrating women in music. This time around, Martha Pazienti-Caden speaks with Andrea Magdalena, the founder of She Said So. Since launching in 2014, She Said So has grown into an international network for women working in the music industry. Its 15 global chapters, located everywhere from Mumbai to LA, include well over 10,000 members who collaborate on strategies for promoting gender equality in their local music communities and workplaces. Over the next 40 minutes, we get to know Magdalena's story and how she grew, she said so, from a grassroots level to an international concern. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Andrea Magdalena is up next. Everyone, welcome to Resident Advisor. My name is Martha and this is Full Circle. We are celebrating women in music. This is our second one. Thank you everyone for coming. Andrea's here and we're going to spend some time getting to know her. So, shall we start in the beginning? Let's do it. Actually, before we get into that, shall we start by saying what is She Said So? Yes. Well, actually, before I jump into that disclaimer, I haven't really slept well these past couple of days. I only got here from L.A. yesterday, so if I'm not making sense at any point, please blame it on the jet lag. My name is Andrea Magdalena. I'm from Romania, and I'm the founder of She Said So. She Said So is a network of women who work in the music industry that started out here in London. And in the meantime, it turned into a global community. We have 15 active chapters around the world, 15 or 16 now. Vienna is on its way. Turkey, Istanbul actually is the latest one that we launched in March, but also including Mumbai, South Africa. LA, New York, the Bay Area, a lot of European countries slash cities. So we have a really big community in France and in Spain and Berlin. Some of them are cities, some of them are... more, you know, nationwide kind of communities. Yeah, that's, we've been around since the end of 2014. At that time, I was working at a music streaming service called Mixcloud. And I noticed that both industries were struggling with diversity. So I decided to do something about it. And that's how She Said So came about. It started off by bringing together 10 women that I knew in the industry at the time. And then we hosted an event and it just went bonkers from there. But that's She Said So in a nutshell. Would you tell me a bit more about the kind of climate of the music industry in 2014 when you started and what were your kind of motivations for starting She Said So? Well, I can definitely say the diversity conversation wasn't really a conversation in the first place. And that's why I was making a point of saying that I was working at the intersection of tech and music, because at that time, I noticed that the tech industry was at least acknowledging that this was a problem in the first place and was, you know, actively trying to find solutions, or at the very least. people were talking about it. Whereas music, it was, I don't know, it was either not spoken about or it was very hush-hush or it was in very small circles of women who were sharing this amongst each other. No one really dared to say something officially because at that time, I'm sure your career would have been in danger. You would have been the complainer. you should be grateful for having this opportunity in the first place. That was the typical answer. There was a lot of knocking on doors when I started and just like reaching out to people, reaching out to women in the first place. What I noticed at that time was that this sisterhood, this sense of sisterhood wasn't really strong. At least I wasn't experiencing it in my scene, in my community. And one of the theories was that that women have always been pitted against each other. There was only one seat at the table, so then you would have to work really hard and maybe step over some folks in order to get there. And that's wrong. That's not true. There are seats at the table. There are many tables out there for everyone to be a part of. And that's what we've been working on in the past four years to continue raising awareness about this and about the fact that diversity is good for everyone. Of course, focusing on women, because that was my experience, direct experience. But I like to think that what we do at She Said So generally, you know, helps out a lot of other communities as well that are perhaps less represented or marginalized. Okay. And we're going to get into She Said So's journey and kind of where you're at today soon. Let's talk a bit about you and your background. So we know that you worked in the intersection between music and tech, but let's talk about your relationship to music from an early age. You know what? I never thought I'm going to end up in music. I was always a fan. I never studied music. I'm not a creative in that sense or a creator. I don't play any instruments, and it's one of my biggest regrets, actually. But I always had this entrepreneurial spirit and with a creative kind of angle to it. And I was very passionate about it. culture and about doing something meaningful but at the same time that's pretty you know future forward and hence the whole technology angle yeah and I you know I come from very small city in Romania where nothing happens but we did give birth to Nadia Comaneci who's probably Romania's favorite poster daughter. She actually went to school with my mom. For those of you who don't know, she was a big gymnast in the 80s. She scored a perfect score at the Olympics and in the meantime became the coach of the American gymnastics team. Anyway, that's a big side note. Sorry about that. This is me wearing my Romanian flag. It's something that I've actually been doing a lot more of recently. And I think part of it is caused by the fact that I transitioned from London to LA. In London, as a Romanian, at the beginning of my journey here, I think I was faced with a lot of light discrimination as an Eastern European. You know, like, oh, you're from Romania? Oh, okay, so you must be a babysitter or, you know, stripper or something along those lines. Oh, there I wasn't. And when I moved to LA, Romania? Oh, my God, that's so exotic. I don't even know where it is on the map. But I think I like you. You made it all the way here. So you're cool. I'm going to be your friend. Yeah, so that kind of determined me to create more awareness about my roots and Romania in general. Because, you know, being here at RA, we have a pretty cool electronic music scene that I think deserves to be spoken of more. and just a lovely cultural heritage overall. But yeah, I was a nerd pretty much from a very young age. I still am a dork. And yeah, I was just good at maths and physics and stuff. And for whatever reason, when I was supposed to apply to law school, I changed my mind a month before and decided to come to university in London instead. And I didn't really know what to do if I wasn't going to become a lawyer or judge. Actually, that was my intention. And I was like, I'll do media, journalism. And yeah, it was really easy and ended up working with startups actually at the time when startups weren't really a thing in London either. You know, Old Street was just tech hub. which was this first co-working space in East London and nothing else. And in the meantime, it became, you know, the hub of, I suppose, the startup scene in London. So again, I was at this interesting intersection between technology and music and continued going, you know. raving basically was my official route into music. I started taking photos at raves, basically warehouse parties. Here in Old Street, actually, there were a lot of them taking place here. I remember I was quite scared walking around the neighborhood. That's definitely not the case anymore. And I started taking photos and the promoters were like, oh, yeah, you should just come and take photos for us. We'll let you in for free. You can have free drinks. And it was a way for me to get it for free into parties. And it slowly, slowly cascaded into. just developing a more official taste for and we're entertaining this idea of working in music and Mixcloud were the first ones to give me this opportunity and I'm very grateful to them for that and since then my journey has pretty much been in the same space music and tech. Okay so what were you doing at Mixcloud? They hired me as the community manager and I think I was employee number six or something so we were all very tight very close with the founders and it also meant that we are all doing the jobs of five people at the same time. But it was great because I was learning so much. I was so hungry and to absorb this information. Music was a new thing for me and they needed this person too. You know, someone who's hungry doesn't really have the background of all the, you know, relationships, music industry relationships. And she's just like keen to put herself out there and reach out to people. not being afraid of rejection. And that's what I was doing, developing those relationships and supporting creators on Mixcloud who needed to grow their channel and kind of giving them best tips. And it slowly kind of turned into more of what I'm doing now, which she said so, towards the end of my tenure there. So building partnerships. with them or between them and other partners in music and organizing events that were kind of putting us in the cultural kind of spectrum, at least in terms of London and the tech scene and the music scene. So fast forward, She Said So is now your job. Can you sense the anxiety? I actually quit my job, my full-time job, a month ago. focus on, she said, so for the rest of the year, at least, hopefully that means I can turn it around into a sustainable business. It's not easy because I'm sure you all know there's no money in music. And if you do end up finding your sweet spot, your financial sweet spot, it's either after years and years of hard work, or maybe in some cases you compromise to make things a little more commercial and wide appeal. And so we want to stay true to our mission at She Said So. That's the most important thing for me personally. And so balancing that with profitability. As an organization that is, you know, culture forward, I started it as a passion because I wanted to make an impact, not because I wanted to make millions, you know. So the mindset is very, very different. So now I'm starting to learn more about how I can. utilize what what we built in the past four years and actually make a living out of it and and I don't want to say set an example because there's so many incredible companies who do that very well. They are profitable and they are also ethical, I suppose. Like Kickstarter, for example, they managed to find a sweet spot as a B Corp, it's called. It's somewhere between a charity and a full profit business. And that's how I see, she said, so in this interesting space. I don't want us to be a charity because I think it puts us in that box and people automatically, you know, female empowerment, it's a charitable thing. No, it's not a charitable freaking thing. It's something that should be part of our financial ecosystem. Us women should be part of the money talk, you know, the boardroom and so on. So you're not doing this for charity. This is only what's right and natural. And at IMS next week, I'm going to give a speech about how we all win. The future of feminism is male. And if everyone employs a diverse team, there are studies that show your company will then be more likely to generate more profits, better performance, better productivity levels. So everyone wins, you know. But for whatever reason, we have to still... do the convincing. How would you say She Said So has affected or changed your personal career path? Oh, a lot. I wouldn't, I would probably, who knows actually. The funny thing is I was always a tomboy and I never had this interest in women's rights particularly. And it was only until I got my job at Mixcloud and I started facing these issues myself that I realized it's just not right. Not to mention that I think I really needed... to root my work in something that was meaningful and that had an impact, a positive impact. And ever since I started manifesting that with She Said So, it's taken me to places and it's enabled me to meet people and form relationships, beautiful, authentic relationships with incredibly inspiring people that I probably wouldn't have had the chance to meet without it. Okay, let's break down what She Said So actually is. So you've got the mentoring programme at the moment and regular meetups, and then there's the kind of online community. So what does She Said So look like to a member? Good question, because it is still very confusing. And that's because we don't have the right product to house our community yet. And that's going to be one of my next focuses. But to backtrack a little. So she said so started as a Google group where I brought together these 10 women that I knew. And then they told two of their friends and so on the word spread. And then we hosted our first event, which was a panel where we invited a bunch of senior women who have been around. And it was the most incredible experience we've had at that time. That's when I realized, damn, we're onto something here. The energy in that room was so explosive and it made us realize that this is a shared experience. I'm not crazy. I'm not just acting out. This is a real problem, a real challenge that most women face. And I lost my train of thoughts. What was your initial? What she said so it looks like. Okay. So it started as the Google Group and it still exists in the Google Group, which houses around 3,000 women now. And these are women from all over the world. Then we have 15 or 16 global chapters around the world. And each chapter either has its own Google group or a Facebook group or a mailing list or some sort of other channel that the community lives on. And you can be a part of the global chapter, the global community, or you can be part of your local chapter. For example, I was mentioning France. They only speak in French. All of their activities are very focused on the French market. make sense for them to be part of the global conversation. unless their work specifically has something to do internationally. So each chapter operates in its own way, but people can be a part of either or both. And each chapter is organizing their own events. And we also have global events that are driven mostly by me. And I have a team of people who are helping me out as well. So partnerships like IMS next week and others along these lines are driven by, I suppose, global. We call it, she said, so global. Yeah, and mentoring has become a really important thing for us. We launched our mentoring program, She Grows. last year or two years ago. And the concept was put together by two She Said So members here in London. Harriet Moss, who is, she works at this publishing company called Manners McDade and she's in sync and TV, that's her world. And then her counterpart, Holly Manners, she is an A&R at Warner now. She wasn't an A&R then, but yeah, they did such a fantastic job coming with the concept of peer-to-peer mentoring and simply pairing women with more experience in one area. with women with less experience. And it's been fantastic. It's really wonderful. It's a very powerful tool because we were talking about creating awareness about female empowerment and diversity in general. We're now in the stage of let's come up with practical solutions. We're past the awareness stage. what can we actually do to make a change? So the mentoring program is one of them. And another big project that we have is with the British Council. I always like to talk about it because it's targeted at women in sound in Brazil. And Brazil is a crazy place where women have very... few rights at a, you know, systemic level, let alone industry access and all of that stuff. Jesus. So being able to impact women in those situations or in those type of circumstances is, you know, it just gives me goosebumps. That's how you know. you're making a real change. And it's a three-year-long program that is based on this mentoring concept. And we have a partner in Brazil and the British Council here who together we have designed. this program that takes place across three years and every year we're selecting 50 different participants, all women in sound. So that can be music producers, sound engineers, composers, podcasters, radio people, variety. And with the aim of getting more women in those jobs and equipping them with the skills so that they can then get those jobs. And it's, yeah, it's a really powerful. project that I hope to bring to life with other partners in other countries that are in a similar situation because I feel like that's exactly where these things are needed most and when she said so was first kind of getting established how were you received by the music industry I I think At the beginning, people maybe didn't care as much. Even in some of my outreach to some women, I got a lot of rejection. And that's completely understandable. On one hand, there are some women who don't identify with this challenge or they don't necessarily feel like they need to be part of or vocal about this. And that's absolutely fine. No problem. And then there were women who were scared. of being vocal because they felt like they're going to lose their job or as an artist you're going to be the female artist instead of... people looking at you as an artist period. You don't want to have that stamp or you don't want your gender to dictate your career in that sense. So there was a lot of convincing, knocking on a lot of people's doors and generally the response was positive because it got us here. But I have to say there was a lot more... selling to do at the beginning. And I think now everyone's kind of on board with it. And my next focus, at least... people who are already engaged with this kind of activities. And now my next goal is to engage the men who are maybe on the other side of the fence, who may be feeling like, oh, it's such a great time to be a woman now. Opportunities are being taken away from me because of that. Or I'm scared to say anything now because it's just going to fire back. what if I say something wrong and it's going to fire back on social media? So there's a lot of fear and a lot of weirdness, I think, in this relationship between men and women. And I'm generalizing here, of course. So I think there's a lot of work to be done to convince those men who are on the other side of the fence that... This is, you know, we're not in conflict. We're all striving for the same things, especially in music where everything is so driven by passion, you know. Otherwise, we wouldn't be dealing with this crap all the time. I know it feels like we've achieved so much and it's such a good time to be a woman. But in reality, not much has changed. We're still not getting equally paid. We're still not getting promoted to the top roles. We're still not getting investment for our companies. We're still not being listened to. We're still being groped. You know, all of these things are still happening. And yeah, there's a lot of press and attention. But there's a lot more work to do, basically. What was the first moment that you had when you felt like you were kind of really achieving something? She said so. What was like a special moment or a moment of realization? I have to say it's that event. that I mentioned, the first ever event that we did, which she said so. When those women started sharing their stories, we had our very own Me Too moment in that room. Maybe there were 30 or 50 of us. And it just, I cannot explain it. You know, when you're on the dance floor and it just feels freaking great. You feel like everything is incredible. You're connecting with others. You're connecting with the music. You're connecting with yourself. That's how we felt that day. And it motivated us to continue doing that. And it also gave us an idea that, hold on, actually, we're onto something big here. Yeah, that was really special. And now that you're established, what are your aspirations and goals for She Said So moving forward? Well, I don't know if I'm established like that. But we've definitely made progress and I'm really grateful for people like Nick and Amy here at RA supporting and creating more visibility for what we do. because that's all there is, really. And that's all we are about, collaboration and supporting each other and just being nice to each other. You know, we're not asking, I was telling someone earlier, we're not asking for favors here. And I like to quote... I can't remember her name, but she is one of the very first feminists in the States from like the 19th century. And she's being quoted in this new documentary about RBG or notorious RBG. She's like a famous judge in New York. She's still alive. a U.S. attorney who is basically kicked ass. And because of her, some of the lawsuits that she's carried, a lot of policy has changed in the states in favor of women. And without her doing that, at that level in American politics, I think America would be even worse than it is today. doing pretty poorly as it is. What's the quote? The quote is, Dear brethren, I do not ask any favors of you. I only ask that you take your feet off my neck. That's, you know, it just feels like we're being held down. That's the feeling that I've always had. And why am I being pushed down? So we're now trying to take those feet off our necks and create allies in men. That's how I personally see it. And that's why I always make an effort of clarifying that she said so. Yes, we are a women's only group, I suppose, because we kind of had to team up and create our own little gang. Right. We never had the private golf clubs and those kind of spaces or the strip clubs where apparently guys do business. So we had to create our own little club. By doing that, we're not trying to put ourselves in opposition, but we had to do it to help each other out like that, become stronger. And now it's a case of clarifying that we're all on the same page. We all want the same thing and let's work together respectfully. equally and in your opinion what can the ra readers and listeners do to contribute to equality on the dance floor for electronic music so much i mean if you're at a party and you see something wrong you know say something or do something about it if you see some dude groping a woman. And if you're a guy, especially if you're a guy, go and call him out, you know, because if a girl's going to do that, then nothing's going to change. But if men call each other out like that, that's an easy way to become our ally and help someone who might be having a really bad time because of that. music being such a personal experience and having such a huge effect on culture, on people, on psychology and the economy, really, every small experience can make the biggest difference in your life. And if you're a woman and you maybe took drugs for the first time or someone spiked your drink or something like that, and that is your experience. your music experience defined by those circumstances, then it just defeats the whole purpose of bringing music communities, bringing people together on the dance floor. also touch on this idea that dance music was built by black and brown communities, primarily gay, who did that because they weren't feeling safe anywhere else. So they created their own space, they created their own music genre where they felt included and safe and represented. And now electronic music has become such a commercial phenomenon that few can afford in many cases. We have a responsibility to make sure that we give back to those communities and that those communities are part of this new financial ecosystem that was built around it. And if you, as a promoter or as a listener, whatever position you're in, if you're able to support those communities by going to their shows as opposed to going to, I don't even know what's, does London have a super club? I don't even know. But instead of going to Ibiza, maybe spending 100 euros to get into amnesia, go to, I don't know, some like whatever. Support your local community, support independent. folks on social media. I mean, oh my God, it's kind of scary to go on social media now and read through the comments, the comment sections on all sorts of Facebook posts and people have a lot of time on their hands. If they use that time to actually do something, you know, it was, let's not even go there. But yeah, I suppose I personally prefer to stay away from engaging in social media battles like that, which she said so too. You know, we don't really engage in calling people out unless it's a dire. situation that absolutely needs to be called out. We typically don't do that. Our approach is focusing on positivity and solutions and like how can we work together to prevent that from happening again if something bad happened but in some cases it you know if if you see something that's terribly terribly wrong call it out on social media as well i suppose and buy music from people who care you know there's every, every little thing that you do can have a really big impact. And so don't, you know, I think have the confidence that you're making a real change, even if the only thing that you're doing is, you know, like calling that guy out for touching someone's boob on the side. That in itself is already a huge contribution that you've just made. And what do you want to see music industry heads or people in positions of power doing to fuel our next steps towards equality? First off, hire more diverse people. If you're in a position of power and you can either... hire someone or help someone out or invest in someone's business or book someone at your event, you know, use that position of power and influence to give that opportunity to someone who maybe hasn't had the chance or look around you and you see, okay, what, what, I feel like something's missing, you know, is it a case of from a gender perspective or is it a case of of age, disability, race, sexual identity, you know, if you feel like those people aren't represented in your community or in your workspace, call it out. And if you are not in that position of power, but you have some sort of influence. on someone who does, then, you know, it's almost like you have a moral responsibility to use that privilege that you have to support someone who doesn't. Because we all know the way we got to this place where some people are more privileged than others. was through pretty freaking ruthless, you know, methods, right? People got rooted out of their countries and sold to slave owners, you know? I mean, it's ridiculous. And thankfully, these situations... don't exist anymore at least not these extreme cases but we're now in in a time where we're very much in the thick of the repercussions of that you know what our you know ancestors did so we have the responsibility to fix that to redress it And every little opportunity you have to do it, use it. My final question for Andrea, which is, are there any organizations that are on a kind of similar wave to you guys that are popping up right now that you feel inspired by? Yeah, absolutely. There are so many, actually, that are popping up all over the world. And some of the most inspiring ones... are in those emerging, I don't want to say emerging markets, but in those markets that maybe have a more struggling economy or maybe where the industry isn't as developed, you know, and everything is very DIY and all you have is yourself and your computer. Maybe not even that in some cases, you know. Obviously, there's this woman in New York who I think they're doing a fantastic job. There's quite a few actually in the States that popped up in the past two years. There's this one called She Is The Music that's actually spearheaded by someone at Universal and Alicia Keys, Spotify. women's audio mission or someone someone similar like that they launched this website where you can look through a database of women in sound you know if you because a lot of what people say is, oh, yeah, I really wanted to hire a woman, but there's no women who do this. Well, that's not true. Yes, it does take a little more effort to find them, but they are there. And you should be making that effort to get them on board with your company or project or whatever it is. Yeah, there's the Women's Audio Mission in San Francisco, which is focused on women in sound, engineers and producers and so on. And they're absolutely lovely. There's another one called the 90, no, the 9%. Actually, a lot of them are now focused on this more technical side. And I remember... Having this conversation two years ago when we were saying focus on the technical roles and the senior roles, because that's where we're lacking women or representation of other marginalized communities. And it's happened. Like people, you know, were galvanized. and got motivated and they started either similar groups or even if it's just one event that you're hosting. Maybe you're a company who does events. Maybe you're doing a live exchange of your own. Make sure that you reach out to these women and you get them engaged. Or not just women, just any type of underrepresented community. And yeah, the 9% is one of them. It started by this. young woman track girl who's a producer up and coming producer now who's uh yeah she's working on some really dope stuff and really big artists off the back of initiating this collective where she wanted to support other female producers get them in the studio give them opportunities to work with established artists and grow that, you know how majors have that tight little group of people that they always work with, right? That's why most pop music ends up sounding the same because it's the same people really doing it um so it's it's changing it is changing but it's it's taking a while um and and that's natural and we just have to keep doing it you know whereas I feel like now we're at a stage where people are like oh but there's so much of that going on you know as I said earlier yes there is But it's still going to take a while before all of these initiatives turned into real change, you know, where like the laws are being changed, the policies, there's code of conduct, there's real change on paper that you can hold people accountable to, as opposed to just, you know, talking about it. Andrea, thank you so much for sharing. Thank you, Martha. Thank you. you you
