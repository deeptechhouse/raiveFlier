Bye. Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Carlos Hawthorne and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Johannes Goller, a man who arguably knows more than anyone about the dark art of promoting parties in Ibiza. For the past 17 years, he's helped Sven Vath run Kakuna Amnesia, the pioneering residency that introduced a harder, deeper strain of techno to the White Isle in 1999. Under Goller's guidance and with the help of DJs like Richie Horton and Ricardo Villalobos, Gakun grew from an outlier night playing weird music into one of the best-known house and techno events on the planet, a reputation it still holds today. At the tail end of the party's 18th season, I visited Gola at Cocoon's leafy Ibiza HQ for a candid conversation about the island's glorious past and its more challenging present. You can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Johannes Gola is up next. Thank you. you I read that you're from a family of butchers, is that right? My grand-grandfather opened the business in 1932 and in 2000 I decided to not take over the family business. and going to Ibiza instead for one season. This was the deal that I made with my father, because I promised him when I come back after the season that I'm becoming a teacher. Right, so you said that you wouldn't become a butcher and you would change to be a teacher. Yes, a teacher for butchers, because we have the dual system in Germany, which means when you decide which direction you want to take, you have... a three-year period where you have to work three days in the factory or in the butcher shop and then two days you go to school and for this school they need teachers who know what they're talking about so this was the idea and how did he feel about you not taking over the business um in the beginning he was uh shocked because it meant that we're going to have to sell it. But he soon realized that it was the right decision because it was 99 was with the BSE, with the Metcalf disease, which really affected our business at home. It was the time before the EU standards came in. We had our shop in a small village and to fulfill all these new regulations, we would have had to invest a big amount of money. And just to get this money back in would have meant like... working 30 years non-stop and I just said no dad I'm 24 years old now and I really don't want to have this back on my shoulders for the next whoever knows many years and so he said okay and this is your decision it's your life and I support you with whatever you want to do. So which part of Germany are you from? I'm coming from Heringen, which is a very small village, 180 kilometers north of Frankfurt. And it was very close to the former German border, just 300 meters away, basically. So it was a really, really remote area. And we were really happy that back in the days we had a good radio signal where I was able to listen to the Saturday night radio shows that came from Frankfurt. And this was also the first time where I heard Sven Feth playing techno music. Wow, so were you going out much at that time? Yes, we were going almost every weekend to a club in Kassel. It was called Stammheim. No, first it was called Aufschwung Ost. And then they changed the owners and then it was called Stammheim. And this was the Saturday party. And at the same period, Sven had his club Omen in Frankfurt, which was the Friday night. So we were choosing like, hey, should we go Frankfurt tonight or should we go tomorrow to Kassel? And both meant one and a half hours on the highway just to get there. And so Sven was, he was the biggest DJ kind of in the area at the time. He was the most well-known. Yes, it was like in the beginning of the 90s and mid 90s and was also the time where the wall came down. So the border that I was living next to was suddenly not there anymore. And there was like a huge playground, like there were suddenly like techno parties. Cities like Erfurt, Gera, Jena, Leipzig and also going to Berlin was not so complicated anymore. And this was the big time of the German techno revolution movement. But it wasn't something that you thought you would dedicate your life to? No. I mean, I was always the one in our little village that was organizing the parties, the Christmas parties, the birthday parties. You know, if there was a typical day like 1st of May where we all gathered and made big barbecues, you know, it was always me who was like, okay, let's do something, let's do something, let's organize, let's build. But I never had the idea of becoming a... a promoter into, that this becomes my profession. I mean, I guess that wasn't such a possibility back then. It wasn't, the industry wasn't so developed. No, it wasn't. And I was really into my family business. As I said before, I made my master's, so I was really taking it serious. And I loved it until the point where I really had to decide about the future. And so you said to your father, I'm going to Ibiza just for a year, for a summer. I mean, my dad brought me, my family, they brought me to Ibiza for the first time in 1988. And I fell in love immediately. And the next year I was 13 years old. And the year after they asked me again, I said, hey, where should we go? And I said, hey, we go to Ibiza, of course. So we went for like three years and then I was 16 and I made my own money and I didn't have to ask anymore. So with my first money, I booked a flight and I came to Ibiza, 10 days, jet apartments, not much sleep, came home, lost 10 kilos. Yeah, this was... the early years. I came back ever since. What did Ibiza kind of represent to Germans back then, to Germany? I mean, it was, I mean, with 13, 14, 15, you know, it was just like, for me, the excitement to be on an island, holidays, beach, beautiful girls. the music, the lifestyle, I mean, just Ibiza, the vibration, all the colorful people from all over the world, everyone in holidays, enjoying life. And I mean, just back in the days, just going to Daltvilla or just to hang in the port where all the... the people came, you know, to do their parades and to have some drinks before they were going to the discotheques where I was not allowed to go in. You know, just to see this was like being in a cinema. It was like a complete... new world to me. So when you were 16 you didn't actually go to any of the clubs? No, with 13, 14, 15 not but with 16 of course and we were going maybe twice to Amnesia we were going to Kiss back in the days, Playa de Mbosa where it was pretty easy to get in but there was also electronic music and we went to Space a couple of the mornings and Bora Bora of course, there were places to party. So how did you go from, you know, punter to establishing that relationship with Cocoon? I met Sven's manager, Talida, in 1997. And we became friends. We were always hanging when we came to Ibiza together. We spent the weekends together. We had fun, you know. And with this, I got closer to Sven. the whole family back in the days. And in '99, I said to her, like, "Oh, look, you know, I think there's a change coming in my life." And she knew that it was my dream since many years to once spend a summer in Ibiza. And then she asked me and said, like, hey, Johannes, you know, next year we want to do, like, the season. And, you know, I trust you. And why don't you go and just spend the summer there, you know, live your dream. And I can't tell you what you have to do. Just go there and be there and help wherever help is needed. I said, like, this is a cool idea. So I did some research, found an apartment, jumped in the car and came to Ibiza, not really knowing what to expect and what's waiting for me because there was no, like, you do this or you do that. It was just like, go. So that was the year 2000. Cocoon started in 99, that's right? Yes. So, I mean, what did the party look like when you got there? It was running every week? I was here also for the first two parties in 99. And I was giving out flyers on the beach just to be on the guest list. We arrived at Amnesia. There were maybe 800 people. Half of them were all friends from Frankfurt, Cologne and Berlin, like really people that we knew. And there were some Spanish and the party started at three or four because back in the days, the people, they went to the clubs much later than it is today and the clubs were open until nine, ten. So it was a very intimate German crowd and the party was very intense. Sven and Richie were playing in the main room and it was Riccardo and Atta on the terrace. The terrace was kind of like not really happening and the 800 people, they were mainly in the main room. We were used to partying in Germany. And so in that first year, did it run every week? No, we had four Mondays. It was two in July and two in August. I didn't go to the two parties in August because I just didn't have the time. And then after the season, Sven took the decision to do the full season in 2000. And from this point on, they were looking for a team to make it happen. And so what were some of your duties that first summer? The duties? Picking up the flyers at the printer, picking up the DJs at the airport. going from A to B to C to D to sort out things. I was just doing everything. I mean, I've known you for a couple of years now and I feel like you still kind of do all that stuff. Thanks God we have now a much bigger team than back in the days and I don't need to do not everything myself. I'm in a happy position to... delegate and to tell people what to do and but of course if there is a need I'm I don't say like no I'm not doing this anymore I mean of course if there's a need I'm there you like kind of being involved in all the aspects and making yes I'm I'm a doer I I like to do things and I I like to work and I I like to be active and to move around rather than going to the beach and chill so in those first few summers i mean how um what was sven's role in everything sven's role i mean sven is the the father figure behind the whole cocoon idea philosophy the concept and of course he was the one that said like hey I want to play with these DJs and I would like to invite this DJ and I think on the terrace we should do this sound and maybe we should like give the terrace to some German house clubs who maybe get better deals than we would and they can build their brand or can give their brand a platform in Ibiza. And Sven was basically giving the direction for everything. We had in Cocoon in Frankfurt an office with like 15 people. We had the Cocoon booking agency, it was the Cocoon event agency and the back office. The record label came in 2000. 2000 or 2001 too. So with this professional people with experiences plus Sven on top, it was for me easy to find my way and to find myself in the whole business concept. What did those first years look like in terms of the reception from the crowd? Because, you know, Cocoon was offering something very different. Yeah, techno back in the days really had no big platform here in Ibiza. It was all like very commercial. It was the British, they were dominating it still. And that was also one of the reasons why Sven said, hey, look. If I don't do something myself, I kind of like don't find myself represented in Ibiza in the right way. I mean, there were always promoters asking him, but, you know, then for him playing for Cream, for example, or for parties at Space in the morning on a Tuesday or on a Thursday morning, it just didn't feel right for him anymore. Yeah, and Richie Horton made the same experiences and they were just talking about it. So Sven took the chance and the risk and took the Monday at Amnesia. because I think the Monday was closed back in the days. And on the other side of the street was Manu Mission at Privilege with 15,000 people every Monday. So a lot of people were saying like, are you nuts? You really want to do the Monday? Monday is all about privilege. It's all about Manu Mission. You won't see any people on your dance floor. And in the beginning, it was a tough one. We mainly had, I would say, like 60, 70% of our guests were Germans and the rest were Spanish and locals. Because also back in the days in Spain, there was like a techno scene, much more than in Italy and in England. We had like mainly Germans and Spanish in the first two years. As you know, Ricardo was a very important part from the whole concept since the beginning. And then with his success on the terrace, the minimal music started. And in 2003 and 2004, suddenly Cocoon became like, the people more and more talked about it and said like, hey, this is not just like a German techno party, you know, there is really something happening new. You know, Sven's music was still much faster than it is today. And Ricardo's dreamy house after our sounds suddenly became... really popular and recognized, it became more and more international. And then the Italians came, then the Spanish came, then the English came. And I remember in 2004, we had a closing where we had 80 or 90 DJs on the guest list, from DJ Rush to Carl Cox. to Mr. C and name them. And suddenly they were all coming, checking out like, hey, what's cooking there? This was the big turning point of Cocoon. So similarly, there was nowhere to listen to the kind of music that Ricardo was playing? No. Ricardo was here at a residency at... And I remember in 2000, he also played at Satrinsha. At Satrinsha on a Tuesday. He always had this late afternoon slot where we all met and then gathered for some drinks. It wasn't an after party. It was more like... beach hanging lounging having sangria another party has started in 99 sercoloco um at dc 10 and you know over the years not only do you guys share the monday you shared a lot of the same djs a lot of similar sounds. Both were pushing music that didn't exist in Ibiza before. They may be going for something a bit more groovier. You guys are doing a different thing. Can you just tell me a little bit about that relationship and how it's developed over the years? As I went to DC10 for the first time, it was of course a Monday. They opened at 8 in the morning. The routine was space, space close to terrace. Then we all went to Jockey Club, which is now Blue Marlin in Kala Yondal. We partied there all night until the morning hours, then DC-10. So 8 o'clock, DC-10. It was basically a dark hole with a snooker table. Whereas now the VIP, there was a snooker table. There were some rotten mattresses on the floor. There was still the airplane on top of the entrance. And the terrace was basically... a fifth of the size that it is just now. The DJ booth was right in the corner. And after like noon or one, two, three, when I wasn't there anymore, but this was then the time where Tanya Vulcano started playing because before the music was only inside. And as I said, it was dark. It was an after hour and the music was quite. You know, they had, who was there, Cirillo, Joe Mills. It was pretty like, it wasn't the dreamy, melodic, what you think what it could have been. No, it was pretty full on. People there, I also have to say, it was a bit scary sometimes. But this changed over the years. I think the only constant that is still there is Tanya Vulcano. And I think she means as much to DC10 and Circo Loco as Riccardo does for Cocoon. You know, Circo Loco changed from... from starting in the morning to it now starts at 4pm. Classically, you would go to Silco Loco and then, you know, I've done it many times myself and then you'd carry on to Cocoon. Silco Loco now finishes at 6am. I mean, is there a dialogue between the two parties? There is no direct contact. And if we talk about the DJs, I talk to the agents, and then the agents talk to Andrea and Antonio, and the other way around is the same. And there is no direct contact. I mean, we all have a mutual respect for each other. It's a bit of a shame that their opening times have shifted into the night. But it was kind of like forced from the authorities because they were not allowed to open at 8 o'clock anymore. And with these new regulations, they had to face the new situation. And of course, if they open at four and they had 12 hours of business beforehand, they want to have at least this 12 hours. So then it's kind of like a natural thing that they moved into. into the night. I mean, it must have been beneficial though that, you know, when it finished at three, four, that people would be out partying and then they'd, you know, they'd go to cocoon as the kind of... I think when you see it from the clubber perspective, it is a real shame that we are now both in the night because it was, as you know yourself, kind of an amazing Monday routine to go to Circo Loco at 4 or 5 o'clock and I don't want to say a warm-up because it was a proper party and they had their headliners playing from 7, 8, 9, 10 until midnight and they closed the terrace. They continued in the main room or in their club room inside, however they call it. until 2:00, 3:00, and then latest at 3:00, all the... who partied there and had a great time they came to Kunkukun and they continued there until like 8:00 9:00 in the morning I mean this was probably the most fun time when I look back I mean sometimes we had some some people coming to amnesia where we had to say like hey dude maybe better you go home because it's enough but Still, when I look back, fun times. How have the kind of earlier closing times, the kind of strict 6.30 cut-off, how has that impacted Cocoon? The good thing about this is that the people, they come much earlier. I mean, in the last, basically the whole season, we had both dance floors full at 2 o'clock. And 10 years ago, it was sometimes 3, 3.30 till the people came. So the people come much earlier. It's much nicer for the DJ who start the night because we don't invite so many DJs. We try to give the DJs a bit more time, just more than 60 minutes and 90 minutes like this festival sets. And of course for a DJ, if he plays three hours, then it's okay to warm up for one hour and then for two hours you have a nice atmosphere and a connection with the dance floor. It's important. Yeah, that's one of the great things is being able to watch like Dixon or Seth, you know, take it from 12 till 3. and there may not be many people there, they can play different records and situations. Absolutely. I haven't heard from anyone that we invited who said like, no, I'm not playing this lot. They all said like, yeah, of course, of course. They are looking forward to it. So when was it that Amnesia, that the terrorists changed Amnesia? Good question. I think it was 2008 or 2009 where Amnesia changed the terrorists. I mean, they just basically... took the DJ booth, the old DJ booth away. They added a little bit to the VIP area and they built a new DJ booth at the far end of the club. So basically the perspective of the DJ changed. Ricardo is still talking of the tube because before it was just like... the garden with the palm trees and with the sound system with the limiter which was always very traumatic and the DJs enjoyed playing for it but it was always a little bit like you know you could go to a certain point not further and it took a lot of experience for the DJs to like handle the limiter because it was really not comfortable And back in the days, the main room was the real main room. I mean, the party was in the main room. The DJ booth was still up, was connected with the balcony. And also there they did a change, but... I think the old DJ booth, which was much better for the room itself, you know, the way how it is set, dance floor, VIP DJ booth. The new setting is okay, but I preferred the old one. But back to the question, I think it was 2008 where they changed the terrace. So the terrace was kind of like a, it was, you know, very much a second room. Yes. And it was, and the viola boss was always in there. Yes. Right. I mean, when they do these kind of structural changes to the clubs, would they ever consult you? Amnesia sent the sound guy once to Cocoon Club in Frankfurt just to see how we did it with the DJ booth because... Amnesia wanted to build a DJ booth, you know, just a small one where the light and the video, the VJs and the LJs are next to the DJ as it was before and as it still is in the main room. And we told them, like, make the DJ booth a bit, like, not so wide, but more, put it more into the dance floor and put... the VJs and the LJs behind the DJ, leave the DJ booth for the DJs. So this was a thing where we were talking about it. but all the rest was done by the club itself. So you say about 2004 when Ricardo started playing regularly, that's when Cocoon kind of took off. He was a resident since 1999. But this was where the sound became more like... In the beginning, the Amnesia stuff, they came to us and said like, hey, can you please stop this music? We can't sell drinks. And we said, like, no, no, no. And back in the days, it happened that Ricardo played some classic music, you know, and the workers in Amnesia, they didn't get it. They hated it. For them, it was the worst day to work, especially on the terrace. And I said, oh, this German sound is so like, you know, it's not like nobody is dancing and nobody puts their hands up in the air. And back in the days, it was super commercial. It was progressive. And every DJ played the same tracks. these Ibiza anthems and you had to play them to make the people happy. But no, not at Cocoon. And it was also a process for the people working in Amnesia to understand that Cocoon is different. I mean, the people who work for the club, how interested are they in, you know, the kind of cultural offering of the party? Or is it just the numbers that drives them? The people who run the club, they are definitely interested in making money. And they are trying to find a balance that guarantees that. One year they do it better, one year less. But of course, when you are talking about Cocoon... Martin Junior was the one who made the approach to Sven and asked him like, hey, Sven, do you want to do your own night here in Ibiza? I can offer you amnesia on a Monday. And so Martin... T is still a big fan of Cocoon and he supports us as much as he can. And he's a DJ himself and he has a lot of understanding when it comes to music and the culture of partying. This is also a very important thing, you know, throwing a party, putting a DJ and it's not so easy as it is. Cocoon has an identity. And when you come to our parties, you can feel that. It is the energy and the vibration that we have on our dance floor is still unique. Do you think that only comes from time? It comes from time, it develops over time. Over the time, the people, they trust us because we are not experimenting. You know, our lineups are solid and it doesn't matter if it is Sven, Richie, Adam, Ilario, Nina Kravitz, you know, you always know you go to Cocoon, you're going to listen to great music. And you're going to find like-minded people who are on Ibiza or living in Ibiza or coming to Ibiza as tourists. And they know why they are there. And it's not like, I mean, there are some touristic spots here on the island where it is much easier to fill a club because you have hundreds of hotels next door. But if you do a party in Amnesia... You need to make the people go to Amnesia. They wouldn't go if it wouldn't be for Cocoon. This is what makes a big difference. I mean, pushing this kind of totally different sound that wasn't on the island before, was Cocoon bringing just a different kind of clubber to Ibiza that hadn't known about it before? Yes. The people from all over the world who... were into the music they knew when we go to Ibiza the only day where we can listen to this music is the Monday you know Monday afternoon DC 10 Monday night Tuesday morning cocoon amnesia and if you are like If you know someone, there was maybe like the possibility to listen to your favorite DJs somewhere on a beach all Tuesday long. And so the people back in the days who came to Ibiza for this music, they came for Cocoon, they came for Sven, they came... for exactly that what we were setting up there um you mentioned the after hours there it's always been a big part of the cocoon identity um was that from the very beginning Yes, I would say we invented after parties in Ibiza. I mean, I remember the very first one in 1999. We did an after party at a place called Particular at Kala Yondal. And unfortunately, the place is closed since like 15 years. No one knows why. But this was the first Cocoon after party. after party and I remember Sven playing there was a small tiny DJ booth and we were all hanging in hammocks there were maybe 50, 60, 70 people and this was the first one in 2000 as we started we were lucky enough to find some little treasure beach hidden beaches who were not like on the hidden path and we managed to set up some crazy things so I guess you kind of you know as well as running a club night you start running after parties and you your job kind of doubles overnight yes this was like a triple shift for almost every week that we did. You know, famously, the kind of police now are starting to crack down on these kind of things. I would imagine it's become harder to do the after hours. Yes. The law changed, not in our benefit. The parties became as well very, very popular. And I mean, our first after party at Sestanyol, I think we were 80 people. But mouth to mouth, just friends. And we were all sitting there hanging, Sven playing for 12 hours. And yeah, I knew everyone by name. The guy who owned it or who run it said, you can come back, not knowing what he's saying. And I think three or four years later, it was the day where we had 4,000 people there. and the police, they couldn't come by cars anymore, they came by boat, and they wanted to talk to me, and I said, like, hey, don't stop the party, because when you stop the party now, then there will be a chaos. I mean, the people that parked from Sestanyol down to Talamanca, where the football stadium was, you know, the people, they were walking for two hours. And they said like, hey, do me a favor. You stop the party at eight so that it's still daylight so that everybody can find their car. We are just trying to, like, not create a chaos here. But this was the last time that you did a party here. And, yes, unfortunately, they were right. Do you feel like the police were, I mean, separate to the laws, do you feel like the police were more kind of lenient and understanding? Of course, of course, of course, because they are all, we are talking about 2003, 4, 5, they were all locals. And when they came, they knew people. family members who were on the dance floor looking at them like a shift you know we're having a party here it was became harder and harder for the for the places itself to take the risk to do it because they they were threatened that the license will will will be taken and so on And now it is happening in private villas. You need to find someone who's willing to host it. In the best case, it's the owner of the villa and not the person who just rents it from someone. Because if you have a villa, no one has the right to tell you you're not allowed to throw a party as long as you don't disturb the neighbours. And this is what it is now about. Find the right villa and to throw a party. So let's kind of move to the late 2000s. You know, Riccardo, Ricci, but then you also have Loco Dice, Luciano, Marco Carolla. big DJs that had big followings and were kind of, you know, many would say that they had their best years at Cocoon. And then, you know, their profile started to grow. Could you ever conceive that they would go off and start their own parties? I mean, Cocoon is, one of the ideas of Sven with Cocoon was to build and create a platform for younger artists to develop themselves. And with this huge success of Cocoon in Ibiza, it was clear that one day the day will come where we can't accommodate Loco Dice, Ricardo Villalobos, Luciano, Marco Carolla, even Chris Liebing, Luciano. You know, their profile just became too big to keep them all under one roof. I mean... Other clubs, they are not blind. They knew, like, hey, that's what's cooking there at Cocoon every Monday, 7,000 people. And, yeah, the offers, they were on the table, I think, like, already years before the first one left. But none of them really had the structure to take on their own night. It took a while till the first one took the risk. I mean Luciano was the first one, but Luciano was never seen as the Cocoon resident. He was much more the DC-10 resident, the Circo Loco resident. But he found his team. took the chance he moved to pasha and it was a success from year one and of course this generated a kind of like like oh look it worked so maybe we should also you know and then the offers got bigger and bigger and bigger and then the day came where then uh richie called us and said like hey guys appreciate everything friendship and what we achieved over the last years. But I have this concept, I have this idea, and I have an offer, and I'm considering of taking it. I'm on the way now to Ibiza to have a meeting, and you're the first ones to know. This was... The way how Richie did it, as a friend does it. But not everyone was so open and honest. And suddenly we found one of our residents starting his own night in amnesia without telling us. And this was not so nice. But this is the time. And like we now all know... that it worked for some, but it didn't work for all of them because you can't have the same people going out every day in Ibiza, paying the entrance, paying the drinks, having fun. It is their choosing. And I think that's what they did. Some stayed, some not. Was Marco Corolla's Night Music on? Was that the first time that Cocoon had had kind of direct musical competition at Amnesia? We were, back in the days, we were thinking like, oh, maybe let's do some special events in Ibiza. And the Friday was, there was nothing happening in Amnesia and they didn't know what to do. There was not a regular night and then Swain came up with the idea and said like hey Why don't we invite underworld and we make a party called we party like 1988 or 89 and So we invited mr. C. Yosh wing Swain himself underworld life to play like a classic acid set And it was on a Friday and it was like a huge success. Underworld for the first time in 20 years. In Ibiza, Mr. C went on stage and they performed the Move Any Mountains together and this Shaman Classics. And I think at this point Amnesia might have realized like, oh, there is maybe a possibility to do another night that is non-commercial. And then the year after, they invited Richie to do, was it a Minus Showcase? I think it was a Minus Showcase or a Plastic Man Show, I don't know. So kind of like there, they already realized, like, okay. And then they offered the Friday to Marco. So, you know, 2012, suddenly Marco and Richie have their own nights. A year later, Loco Dice starts his own party. Suddenly Cocoon is competing against its own children almost. I mean, 2013 was my first summer here and then I did 2014 as well. I would say that maybe those two seasons were some of the most difficult for Cocoon. I mean, would you agree? Yes, definitely agree. Because the new nights, you know, the people, they're always up for truth. trying new nights, new nights they create competition. And it kind of like diluted the scene that was like coming together on a Monday, you know, the Dice followers, the Carola followers, the Villa Lobos followers, the Fate followers, name them all. They all found their home on a Monday in Amnesia. And now we realized, like, the Marco Carolla, the Italians, they are going now on the Friday, then there are the DICE people, they went to Ushuaia. And it kind of like, of course, numbers went down. It was very challenging and it also changed. let's say the financial dynamics, of course. Yeah, I think it took us like exactly those two years to like bring the boat back into like stable waters. You know, as we said, like, yeah, we sailed through the storm thanks to the loyalty of Ricardo. And of course, this amazing, yeah, how you say like, you know, Sven never disappoints. And he's always on form, on top of his game. And to have those two rocks standing strong and still and performing and pushing it forward, this was the key of the success and why we are... Still here, why we have many of the DJs who tried their own things coming back, just talking about Richie. Ricciardo was never tempted? No. It'd be funny to see him running apart to Elivisa. I think he knows that it's for him maybe more enjoyable to come to Cocoon and to know. that there are the friends who are taking care of everything and giving him the best spot possible without having to face... Or to have the weight of all night on your shoulder because it's big. Yeah, as you say, it's a huge demand on a DJ. It's not just turn up every week and play. You have to be a promoter. Richie was doing promo events every week and you have to really, really be there. I mean, especially in Richie's case, I mean, the time and effort that he spent. to bring this enter onto the surface and to the Ibiza party scene. I mean, this was really, really big. I mean, he was the promoter. He was the sake barman. He was the DJ. He was the host. I mean, he was every day, everywhere, promoting his night, promoting his... sake I mean so many things that never really like in terms of promotion that I've never seen in Ibiza that anyone ever put so much time as the main DJ in himself and This is time consuming and it is also very exhausting, especially on a Thursday night when you know Friday, Saturday, Sunday, festival gigs and so on. It's a lot of work. So 2017, we're sitting here. It's end of August, 18th season of Cocoon. I mean, how are you feeling this September starting? What's the kind of mood now? As many know, September is the favorite month of all the Ibiza veterans, of the locals, because the August is always very intense, very full on. It's extremely hot. The island is extremely full. Everybody's working to the max. There's a lot of stress in the air. And the locals normally, they don't go out so much in August. But already last Monday, we could see, it was the 28th of August, we could see that they are willing to go out again. And last Monday with Riccardo, Luciano, Adam, Rotter, Tini and Sonia Mona, we had maybe one of the best parties of the season in Amnesia. It was, the whole island was there and it was a lot of fun. This is what makes September so special. You know, the people who really know, they come in September. This is the interesting thing, isn't it? Because, yes, Marco's still there, but now actually, yeah, there is no Richie. Luciano's doing a few things. Loco Dice isn't here. Oh, Loco Dice is doing height, but that's a kind of separate thing. Kukuli's back has its kind of position back again. Yes, that's the feeling that we all have. And already as we announced the lineup, there was like a huge media response. And I think for the 18th season, I mean, not many can say that they turned 18 in Ibiza. And with a new campaign, with a new look, with a very, very strong lineup, without compromising. I think Cocoon is back and better than ever before. I'm interested in how you build the season. How soon after the closing party in October do you start thinking about the next season? Before the season is after the season, after the season is before the season. This is like now in 2017 and also in the last years, it is a thing that I'm working on all year round. A time, 2007, 2008, I met Sven in Thailand. It was January, February, and we sat down and we said, like, whom should we invite? And two weeks later, the lineup was done. But this is not happening anymore. So we are already, like, talking to, of course, the headliners. Sven's dates are more or less set, then talking with Ricardo, like his six, seven gigs, you know, and of course I ask Sven, Ricardo, with whom do they want to play, and then kind of like it falls into its place, kind of like on its own. You know, there's Adam with his gigs. And, you know, we set the headliners. We talk about, like, new talents and new producers. And then it's like putting a puzzle together. But the most important thing is, of course, like, having the deals right with the headliners. Does Sven okays? Every booking, every artist that plays? Yes. I'm in constant exchange with Sven. We are talking every day. He comes up with ideas and I come up with some ideas. And then we are talking about like with whom he wants to play because he also has his favorites. And then we are trying to put the puzzle together. How much attention do you pay to what's going on in the rest of the island? A lot because it's part of my job. And I also think I was to almost every party at least once this summer because it's also important for me to see with my own eyes and to experience it by myself and not just like to listen to the street because sometimes they... have a different point of view but I think it's very important to see what the others are doing and to know how the parties are working, how the vibe is, what kind of people go and I think it's part of the homework that you have to do when you're a promoter in Ibiza. What are your thoughts? Yeah, my thoughts are diverse. I have to say I haven't seen much that really impressed me. There are some really nice things happening now, daytimes, especially on a Sunday. I really like the vibe at the events that they are doing now at Las Dalias, as at Sundays. because it's island people, it's a fresh party, it's happening in the north, in a new venue, and I think they're doing a good job there. I'm doing Cocoon since 18 years, and I have to say, especially this year, I'm having such a great time at our own parties and I'm enjoying it so much because the parties are just amazing. We are always checking the nationalities and in the last weeks we had between 60 and 70 different nationalities coming to our parties. And from all over Europe, like from almost every single country in South America, North America, people coming from Asia, from Australia, from New Zealand, plus the people who come every week, the locals, and it's just so much fun. The party is just right. There's a good feeling. There's a good vibe. And I have to say, I'm enjoying the season a lot. Well, it's interesting that, you know, Cocoon started with a very kind of either a local crowd or a kind of crowd of Germans who knew each other. But now you're attracting people from 70 different countries and still you're maintaining that kind of same vibe. Yeah, that's exactly how it is. And I know exactly. where our friends are on the dance floor who are like living in Ibiza. I know where the groups are. So I always... go there and spend some time with them on the dance floor and when they are having a good time then I know that the party is right you know and they are very honest and they can also be very critical I mean they come every Monday you know and when they say this was particularly good then it's most of the time they are right You know, I imagine that running a party in Ibiza has changed a lot over the years. I mean, what are the kind of most difficult things about it in this season in particular? To tell the DJs to stop the music at seven o'clock. You know, the terrace has the magic when the day breaks, when the sun comes up. And now, end of August, you know, it's kind of like still not really, really daylight at seven o'clock. And especially the DJs who are playing for us since years and they were used to like close at like 8, 8.39. And to have the terrace, these magic hours when the sun comes in and the light changes and the atmosphere changes and the music changes and everybody's just becoming like one, you know, those were the magic moments. And sometimes to tell the DJs like, hey, it's seven o'clock and they said, hey, the sun is not in. I said, yeah, sorry. Nothing we can do. I think this is a challenging moment and it's also very bitter for like the party's over. You know, there's a kind of a lot of talk and a few things being written about a kind of... the local locals from the politicians to the people are kind of you know just growing kind of anti-tourism sentiment and people are just a little bit tired of the disruption that the season causes I mean do you think there's any truth in that? Yeah, I want to hear them all when the tourists are not coming and they don't rent their villas anymore and they are not buying their vegetables anymore and they are not... I mean, come on, it's a tourist island and the main industry is the tourism and somehow the locals, they are all benefiting from it. And I think this is like complaining on a very, very high level. I don't give too much about this. You know, some people say that the kind of growth in VIP culture and certain kind of nightclubs and stuff attracts a different crowd that maybe isn't as disruptive, that is moving the island towards a kind of... more luxurious tourism where there's not so many drunk and disorderly ravers. It's a kind of easier thing for the locals to deal with. The future will tell. 2017 is definitely a year where things have shifted a little bit. towards the weekends. The people, they don't spend a week or two weeks anymore on the island. There's a, I don't want to say the majority, but there are much more people coming for the weekends. So the island feels different from Friday, Saturday, Sunday, than it is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. That's a... And all hotels, they can confirm this, that the occupancy on the weekend is much higher than during the week. So this goes for the restaurants, this goes for the clubs, this goes for everyone who does business here on the island. And this is a fact that has shifted. I don't know if this more on the weekend and less in the midweek, if this is balancing the financial situation out or not. it's happening. And that's interesting because you would think, you know, with people talk about Croatia and festivals and these are kind of, you know, alternatives to Ibiza now, but actually, you know, most festivals happen on the weekend. Actually, Ibiza is, I mean, not only is it busier in general, but the weekends are actually the strongest time. I haven't been off the island. this summer so often but I know from Sven that all over Europe that there are more festivals than ever and We can also see here in Ibiza that compared to the previous years, there are less clubbers on the island. And this affects all the discotheques. There is not just one discotheque that is affected by it. I think they are all feeling and realizing it. But when I talk to friends of mine who are doing festivals in Croatia and Germany and England, they are all facing the same situation. They are all selling less tickets. And they are selling less tickets to the young people who come for the dance floor. The VIP situation in Ibiza became even a higher value because there are some clubs who are really focusing on this clientele because maybe it's easier to sell a table for 5,000 euros than selling 100 tickets for 50 euros. And I understand that there are some clubs focusing on this, but in our case it's not. Cocoon was never a VIP party. There is a VIP and it's frequented, but it's not our focus. We are focusing on the dance floor, we want to deliver, and if there's a VIP, cool, if not... Also cool. Yeah, you mentioned there the kind of less clubbers on the island. And I was speaking to friends that said that a lot of the workers, kind of particular kind of British workers live in San Antonio. There aren't so many of them anymore. I mean, you said yourself in a talk at IMS earlier this year, you said Ibiza needs to protect the working class. I mean, I don't know if you can expand on what you meant, what you're referring to there. The people who come here to spend the season, they need to live somewhere. And living space is rare. Prices, they went up in a dramatic way in the last two, three years. And when you come to Ibiza and you have a job where you maybe earn 1500 euros, but you have to pay like 1000 euros for a room in an apartment, which you have to share with like five others, then you have 500 euros left to spend. This is getting out of proportion. You know, there are friends of mine, they opened new restaurants and hotels and they would love to hire staff, but they can't offer them accommodation. So they don't get the trained staff they need to operate their clubs and restaurants and hotels on the level they should. That's the problem because if the working class, if the people who come here to work and to make a living and also to enjoy the island, if they don't have enough money to pay rent and to enjoy the island, then maybe it's better just to go somewhere else. Well, I mean, something has to change, right? Like, what's going to happen? Something has to change. I think the government needs to come up with a conclusion and with ideas because it can't be that house owners or people who own an apartment that they just can double the rent from one year to the other. I mean, in Germany we have laws that allows you to put the rent up 3% and something like this needs to happen here. because if this continues, then sooner or later, no one can afford to come to Ibiza, live here, work here and be here. You know, it's out of proportion. Do you think the clubs have any responsibility to, you know, to act to maybe lower ticket prices or lower the drinks prices or bowls of water? Of course. I mean, selling a water for 12 euros, in my opinion, is almost a crime. it's not fair, you know, the clubs, they need the people. And the Spanish mentality says like, okay, we are selling less drinks, so we have to put the price up. And this is their thinking, you know. Well, I would say like, hey, half the price and you sell double and you have a better party. Because, you know, we all like to go out and if you have like 50 euros in your pocket and you have to think like, do I order now four water or three beer? Like, no, this is not fun. And I hope that the day will come and that they will realize like, hey, things have to change. You know, there's an interesting thing there where you're kind of, you know, you run the party at a club like Amnesia. Amnesia is like all the clubs in Ibiza. Their drinks are very expensive. But as a promoter, you don't put the drink prices. It must be frustrating. You know, you must have people say to you why the drinks are expensive. Since 1999, we were trying to convince... the people behind amnesia to like lower the prices and to have at least a drink of the night and if it is the water and uh but there is no chance no chance no chance do you think a greater culture of greed exists in ibiza today than 5 10 15 years ago I think everywhere in the world money becomes more important to the people and you see what's happening in the world. It's quite obvious that the richer get rich and the poorer get poor. You know, you started off as a fan and then you started working with Sven. Where are the boundaries between the personal and the professional of you and him? Oh yeah, that's a good question. Basically, I think there is no boundary. By the time now, over all the years, we became very, very close friends. I was touring with Sven for 13 years. before the Ibiza season started. So we were like for five months on tour for 13 years. And I'm also the godfather of his son, Tiga. So there's a really, really strong bond between us. We're really good friends. We are family. We share a lot of time together. a special special relation do you think cocoon could carry on without sven no the question is not if if cocoon could carry on with sven sven doesn't have one thought about like retiring so i think as long as sven is behind the decks there will always be a cocoon and like Sven and Cocoon is like one. Sven is Cocoon, Cocoon is Sven and there are no signs of retiring. Just finally, you know, I don't think there's probably no one in the world who's seen him DJ as many times as you have. What is it that makes him the DJ he is? He has an incredible talent to... put records together or songs, tracks together in a way that they can tell a story. This is like a journey. And I saw people playing the same track. but it feels different. So he has an ability to channel the energy from the dance floor with the energy from the music, with the energy of the location. Sven on the beach, Sven in a club, Sven at a festival, it's all different. It is unique. And he is able to bring all these ingredients together as one. And the longer he plays, the more he creates this particular feeling. Sometimes I watch him and he's just turning around and he puts one record on after the other. other sometimes even without looking at them and it just makes all sense. you
