you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Lilivan is a name that many listeners to the exchange will not be familiar with, but if you've been going to the type of experimental electronic music shows held in sit-down venues, you may know him better than you think. He's the man at the other table checking his email, the one providing visuals for artists such as Vladislav DeLay. Van Ness, Deadbeat, Morton Sabotnick, and was one half of pioneering duo Reconcentrum. His distinct visual aesthetic is akin to painting with images, but it's an accompaniment that's constantly evolving. The process he undertakes to produce it is a fascinating one, to say the least. So listen in as we go deep into his working methods and career. you You've been called bitter, twisted, negative, cynical. But I've met with you in a number of places in the world. Never in Berlin, oddly enough, where you live. And you seem like a pretty positive guy. Well, I would say so of myself, too. But I do admit that I find myself critical. of many things that I think might be taking up too much space or don't deserve all the credit they get where there's all this other stuff that should be happening and so I can be critical of things and maybe it's sort of often deserved that I'm called negative however I think that most things are quite wonderful that are happening so how did we get here? Well, we got here, I can tell you briefly that I read an interview with myself yesterday with an Austrian website. I did a show with Christian Fennis there, and then they wanted to interview us. It was a special about Gustav Mahler. They wanted to know how we did this. And somehow, most of the interview concentrates not on Mahler or on video, but on how most artists in my estimation today have turned themselves into brands rather than being artists. And I'm totally concerned with their... branding and not making a mistake, not slipping up, not letting a journalist find out anything about that could be negative. And I thought, we're artists, we're not razor blades, we're not like Gillette that has to have a very clean image, we're not Tiger Woods. And so that's why I ended up talking about this. And so I thought, God, I must come off as a terrible negative person but I don't really feel like when I said how did we get here I actually meant how did we how did we get to this place how did you know you were in Berlin when the wolf came down yeah by accident By accident, I came here. I had been studying in Denmark. I grew up in Dublin, in Ireland. I'd been studying in Denmark, and I used to come to Berlin on visits regularly because it's so close. And I'd stay in Kreuzberg, and Kreuzberg was quite interesting. Then I finished studying. I moved here. It was like 89. And after a few months, I got a bit bored because... People weren't making art, they were just talking too much about it. And they were talking about technology. Maybe it's a German thing to wait for a new Sony camera instead of just taking any camera and making a movie. And so I packed my bags, I was ready to leave. And literally my bags were packed and the wall came down. I came over to the East that night and I thought, "Oh, this looks interesting. Maybe stay a few weeks. Maybe something interesting will happen here in the next few weeks." Maybe something interesting will happen here in the next few weeks. Well, in that night actually we thought, "Maybe the wall will close again tomorrow." Because it was a very confused situation why the wall had opened. The East German Politburo, they were very confused. And so I thought, it could be interesting. A few weeks later, we squatted this building Tacheles down the road from here, which now, unfortunately, is not so interesting, but for the first few years was an incredible place. And suddenly I started meeting artists from, or people basically, and a lot of them were artists from Bulgaria, Russia, Romania, who were making art in a method which I liked very much, which was just use a Super 8 camera which is held together with gaffer tape and rubber bands, but make a movie every night. And so we were making Super 8 movies every night, developing them during the day and show them in the evening time. And I thought this is much more fun than... waiting around reading reviews of new cameras being coming onto the market and hoping that one day I'll make a movie. And so I've stayed here ever since. You mentioned, you know, all these Eastern European countries and that's one thing I read in your bio that I found fascinating. The wall came down and all these Eastern European countries Eastern European people grabbed your interest. Was it because they were moving to Berlin because they knew that that was, you know, a place to go right after the wall came down? It was a place to go because it was a... It was a focus and it had a magnetic effect on people all over Europe for hundreds of years. When the war was still up, for example, people didn't want to do military service from West Germany. Basically anybody who was different or gay or an artist or a pacifist would come to Berlin, so we had a big community of those here. But also East Berlin had a community of people from Russia and from other countries who wanted to experience something somehow closer. the West or closer to what they were experiencing in communist Russia or communist Romania. And so Berlin has been a magnet anyway. It's had a huge gay community for 200 years. We had an emperor here in Berlin who brought Huguenots here, brought Voltaire here to write Candide when he was being persecuted. So it's always been an interesting magnet for people. And of course when the war came down it was all happening here. people from both sides so there's a huge influx of artists from of young people strange people from America or of Western Europe but also from Eastern Europe and for me coming from Ireland Eastern Europeans and Russians were I mean growing up I don't know if you can imagine this but growing up in Ireland I never thought I would meet a Russian person they were so far away they were just locked away I used to collect stamps as a kid as I guess most kids did as an American I you know I was told not to meet Russians. Exactly. But now living here, I mean, you hear just as much Russian on the streets as you'll hear, like, not as much as you'll hear Spanish and Italian. But you hear a lot of Russian, you hear a lot of Polish on the streets. But growing up, these were just, like, unbelievable. and people and so for me, sure I was attracted to these kind of people and the way they were working was very close to my heart, working quickly, making lots of art, making lots of experimentation and not trying to write one script for three years. I'd studied film before and decided not to become a director because I decided I did not want to write a script and then talk to producers for five years. and fight with producers and then maybe make one film every 10 years. And I'd read Orson Welles' biography, which I found so sad that somebody such a genius never got to make the movies that he wanted to make or was taken out of his hands. And then I discovered short film where I was in control of everything and I would show the film and I was in control of the whole process. So that attracted me. How did you get into film? Was it watching things in the theater? How does that get there? It gets there because I wouldn't know what else to do. It gets there because my mother was a painter. When I was 13, she bought a Super 8 camera, thinking to experiment with it one day. I never did, so I stole it. That's what I've been doing ever since. But I also got there because I had very, very bad eyesight when I was a child. I was an only child, so we traveled a lot. My father's a journalist. So I was alone an awful lot. I was happy to be alone. That doesn't sound to be complaining. I remember lying in bedrooms and just playing visually, creating a world around myself. my glasses off and holding in front of my eyes, breaking the light coming through a hole in the blinds. I discovered how to break the spectrum. I thought I'd discovered that. I didn't know that Isaac Newton had done it 200 years before me. But things like that. That's always what I've done, is just playing with visual things around me. And I thought the logical progression would then be to make films, to make cinema. But as I said, I'd studied film and then I broke off. I dropped out because I thought, I don't actually want to tell more stories. I don't want to buy the rights to a book and tell a story because so often cinema is just a book for people. I didn't have the time to read the book, so they see it for two hours in the cinema. And then there's Godard, there's all of that, where there's a lot of experimentation. But I was more interested in just creating what today is called visuals, which is almost a softening of the title, but creating visual play. And then I discovered expanded cinema from America from the 60s, Nam June Paik, all of these experiments, and that's where I felt really at home. When did you discover that in film so she would take me to see some things I remember Oscar Fischinger there was a retrospective where two of his films were shown in England and we actually got the boat from Ireland to England and the train to London to see this my mother was like fascinated by these things and she dragged me along So I knew about some of these things, and I said I dropped out of film school. That's true, but then I went back and I studied film theory and was fascinated by the conventions of film, but also just the structuralism, the techniques of film, playing with lenses, playing with film material. And of course, if you do that for a while and you travel around and you show some things, you pick up things. I mean, now everything's on the Internet. It's weird. It's a strange thing for me now that everything is so accessible but people seem to know less than they did before. Because you don't actually have to. I used to take the boat and the train to London just to see an exhibition. We had no money in those days. I'd work in a cafe for three weeks to get the money together to see an exhibition. Now you can see the stuff on YouTube but it seems less people know about it than they did in those days. But that's how these things happen. What kind of paintings did your mother make? Sadly, or not sadly, but interestingly, and maybe I'm ashamed to admit, quite similar to what I do now with video. She was called an abstract painter, I guess. You would call that abstract. A lot of collage. She loved Georges Braque, that kind of bricolage, collage. She loved Friedrich Merz, a Merz builder. Yeah, Kurt Schwitters and then the Merzbitter. She loved that kind of stuff. So do you think of what you do as, in a way, as painting? Oh, yeah. Is that the best way to sort of describe it? I think I would think of it in that way because often when you say you make film or you make video, do people think, oh, you're going to do... I don't know, you've written an expose and then you've got a script. I mean, I've been trying for years now to somehow copyright my work and get what musicians get, GEMA royalties. And it's interesting how when I tried to register, oh, okay, we need the script. I said, well, there's no script for it, it's abstract video. And they said, oh, any actors in it that we know? Because that would be, if we have important... actors then we can register it. I was like, well there's no actors in it. So actually now I was writing scripts for my animations which is quite bizarre but I actually got through with it. I thought it's quite funny. I've got like, you know, yellow line moves across meets green dot and so on. And they accepted that. They said like, yeah, there's a script. That's pretty bizarre if that's what they need for it. I would call it painting because it's interesting for me just to have clashes of colors. I try to create moving imagery. mirrors natural phenomena. I mean, I'm inspired more by storms and by things melting and things exploding and burning and plate tectonics than I am by literature and then trying to create a film based on literature. How did you... I feel like I keep asking this question with different forms. How did you get there? I mean... In terms of filming, doing these experimental films with Eastern Europeans to having a soundtrack, parties or exhibitions? Well, when you're doing what I do, then I'd be quite happy to see my films and to watch my films in silence as well, and to have them shown in silence. And I do that sometimes. But one reason is to have more people to see them and to actually make a living out of it. It's more interesting to work with other people who are, you know, I mean, you saw the show I do with Morten Sabotnick, and a lot of people come to see Sabotnick because And then I realize what I'm doing is like an add-on to that. And then many of you say, oh, it's actually more interesting with that. Other people would prefer to see without visuals. That's also fine by me. But it's more interesting to collaborate with people. For me, it's interesting to work with, say, with dancers now, with an orchestra, and to have that synergy is a terrible word, but kind of a combination which I'm... I guess my question is sort of, let's go to the early 90s? When did the music begin? When did your collaborations with that? The collaborations would not have been called, I wouldn't have thought of them as collaborations in those days. It was just the only place I could show the stuff was, for example, down the road here in Tacheles or the squats. We had a great squat here called Im Eimer, which is now a restaurant. and Rosenthaler Platz. It was just so much fun to show my stuff in party settings and to see how it works with, I mean, synesthesia had been a big topic at the time and I was very interested in synesthesia, to see how it works in combination with different types of music and, of course, any place that shows your work, well, go there and show the work. So I would go to Tacheles with like... a couple of Super 8 projectors, making loops in the old ways. It was before video and before you'd turn up with a laptop. And 16mm and slides. And so I never thought of, let's do a collaboration. It was just like, we're opening on Friday at midnight. We had a club down in the cellar. And we're opening at midnight. Everything has to be in place by then. So I didn't think I was collaborating with a DJ. But of course, I'd be showing my work. and he'd be DJing and then we'd talk about it the next day. Oh, and I played that track and you did that thing with whatever, you know, pineapple thing that was moving around. That looked great. Let's try to work on that. And then from that collaboration, we tried to find the essence of what we had done in an eight-hour session and then shows came from that. I want to get back to the history aspect, but the way that you described how the... DJ was talking to you. It was exactly the problem that I had when I was talking to a friend after watching the Morton Sabotnick thing that you did in Poland this year in which we were walking down the street and we were like, the visuals were absolutely amazing. You know that one that had the thing with it was black, it looked like a squid ink? It must be a good thing and a bad thing that people can't quite describe what you've done. Well, I understand what you mean. I remember the conversation. with your friend in Poland about that as well. The funny thing is that at one point I thought what I'm actually doing, you know, you think about what you're doing and you think about like, well, what sense can it make or where is it going? And I think what I'm actually making is something which is not describable by words. And I quite like that. Of course, there can be a disadvantage if somebody wants to write about what you're doing. Not only is there no vocabulary for this yet, and no score for it either. People have tried to score visuals for as long as they think, OK, it's a musical score, and Brian Eno has tried to do this stuff, and many people have tried to score visuals. It's pretty impossible, but I quite like the idea that I'm trying to do something and create something which is not describable by any words. There are no words for it, and therefore maybe it's kind of a new universal type of language. Not a meta language, but people from any culture can see what I make and can decide or can enjoy it or like parts of it or not, other parts of it, that doesn't matter to me. But you don't need any cultural background, you don't need to be able to speak French to understand my video. speak French to see an opera in French or you won't really get most of it. You'll enjoy the sound of it. But you can actually enjoy what I'm doing, hopefully, and understand what I'm doing without speaking any language. Maybe that's a Kaspar Hauser effect. You just don't need any cultural background at all. Let me just say, if you have got, I've always aimed for that. To be able to make something that people can hopefully enjoy without having any background information. However, hopefully the more background information they have, they can glean even more pleasure from it or more references. I mean, there's lots of stuff that I do. There's lots of references. There's little quotes and there's little plays between Polanski and Orson Welles or something. But I would hope that you can enjoy it without ever having heard of those two people. If you've heard of those people and you know their films, maybe you think, oh, there's a little added reference. That was fun. In Serbia, you did a thing with Vladislav Delay in which you weren't being... It was basically all quotes for the most part. You were working... with figures, something very recognizable. Basically, you're taking scenes, I suppose, from films. I can tell you about that. Yeah, I just wonder, that must have been quite an interesting experience to have something very concrete. I suppose. It was an attempt, because I've played with Wladyslaw often, we play quite regularly together, with more of the abstract things and more texture and more intensities and nothing at all figurative and narrative. And that project came from talking about European cinema and how I wonder how European cinema will continue. how much of it is just being overrun by other cinemas from other parts of the world. And we decided to make an homage to European cinema. So that was all sampled material. And in my previous projects, a lot had been sampled, but I'd always taken care to manipulate beyond recognition so that it wouldn't just be a reference, it would be just raw material. But for this project... I decided to try to make something which was completely recognizable, soundtrack as image. So all of the images you saw were all from European films, which I like. from the history of European cinema, the last 100 years. And that was a huge challenge for me because I was trying to carve the way I usually work, it's more like a sculptor. I think of myself as a sculptor. Take material and carve it as if it were a stone, chisel away stuff and try to find some hidden poetry in it, or what does it want to become, which direction can it go? And of course that's interesting when you don't alter the figures though. So it's Karosmek Milos Forman and all these early films. And it was a huge challenge, and we still don't actually know where it's going. We've performed it maybe three times so far in three years, so that's not a lot, but I like these kind of long-term projects where we meet from time to time and talk about it, try to work on it more, and I still don't exactly know where it's going. It's supposed to be just a one-hour compressed film as an homage to European cinema, but I'm far from satisfied with it yet. It that is really finished or that I think like, no, that's good, I can let it go. Your first big project was Reconzentrum. Were you satisfied with what you achieved there? Well, I remember reading an interview with Sterling Morrison, the rhythm guitarist from the Velvet Underground, and he had been asked whether he was happy to see now the Velvet Underground, you know, finally getting the recognition they deserved. It was when all these Japan imports started coming in, then Lou Reed started re-releasing stuff and bought the rights to everything. And I remember him saying, as far as I'm concerned, Velvet Underground, we achieved about 20%. percent of our potential there was so much more that we could have done but we got distracted and waylaid and all this stuff and I feel similarly about Reckling Center too I mean we I feel proud of a lot of the stuff that we did especially the reasons why we did things and how we went about doing things how we didn't succumb to as I mentioned earlier trying as fast as possible to find a niche or a niche and brand ourselves and stay within that. but how we just surfed capitalism, basically. I mean, we just played everywhere. We played from big museums to laundrettes. Anybody who invited us, we'd say, like, sure, pay for the travel, find us a place to sleep. We'd look at their budget. If it was a laundrette, we'd play for free. It was a big museum. We wanted a lot of money. And we wanted complete artistic freedom. Don't tell us what to do. So we also even played, like, We failed at that completely. I thought that we could play corporate shows and we could be subversive and we could bring art into a cigarette company's promotion and then of course discover that capitalism is very good at embracing and swallowing. And so I did something once that was totally critical of a cigarette company and they came up after me and loved it and asked me if I wanted to do a tour of Eastern Europe again. So we failed in those things, but we were courageous and it was fun to try things. It's always more fun to try something and fail at it than not to have tried it and just to be nervous and try to be within your corporate box. Artistically... We did a lot of things that we didn't realize how, we didn't realize why we were being so successful at what we were doing because we were quite childish about it. Maybe should I say a few things about how we started because that's how, you know. The funny thing is we were in a 10-piece drum and bass band before called Elektronauten. What did you play? I played video. Okay. And Mark was programming a little bit, singing, and he was also the manager, the booker of the band. And we were from this squad down the road, him, Imo. So we just played from time to time. And then we got more success with that. We released one CD. But 10 people is really difficult. And we got an invitation to play the Documenta in Kassel, the big art festival in Kassel, every five years. And I think from the ten people, six said they couldn't go because it was somebody's birthday and somebody else had to go to the Arbeitsamt, to the job center and stuff. And we thought, that's unbelievable. It's a great invitation to play at this place, just to do whatever we want. And so Mark and I just basically took all of our... excess material. I was doing videos at the time for MTV and he was doing remixes. And if you do these remixes and stuff, you've got a lot of material that's lying around that never makes it into a final mix. And we just thought, let's take all of our rubbish and bring it to Documenta and play it. Like all the stuff that didn't make it, like Polanski said, any scene that doesn't fit in has to be cut out. And if it doesn't belong in there, you So I was ruthless and I had a lot of excess material that I had cut out. And we went down, just put all this stuff into his car, CD players, VHS recorders, everything, and we played for about 10 hours. And it was a lot of fun. And we thought, oh, that was that. We came back to Berlin, and somebody there had seen it from the Galerie Berlin-Tokyo here in Berlin. It was an interesting gallery club space, actually, in the 90s. And so they'd invite us from time to time, and then it just grew from that that we'd play these 8-, 9-, 10-hour sessions, taking Lee Scratch Perry's rule that the mixing desk is the instrument, so it was just all of and we were actually just selecting, manipulating, and then putting it out. It wasn't anything rehearsed, nothing at all. And then we had some friends who were organizing techno parties here in Berlin. pretty big events and they were always looking for something to make this thing a bit more arty. So upstairs they'd have like DJ Spoon and all these like big heroes who'd get 10,000 people dancing but they'd also have their alternative for their chill out room and they'd like put us in there and it was fine because I paid the rent for it. We got a studio then, I paid the rent but it was still like still just fun to do every couple of weeks. And it just grew from that, but after doing 10-hour shows, you get tired and you also want to focus a bit, so it reduced it down to one-hour shows. But basically, and this is why I'm giving you this background, basically, for the 11 years we were doing it, it was basically always just taking lots of material, selecting it on the mixing desk and see what happens. And so what I liked about it was we never once rehearsed. Every show we did was a public rehearsal. It was like Every time it was full of accidents, full of random, where you go down, you end up in a ghetto, and you've got to get out somehow again. And there'd be moments which would be sublime, wonderful moments. There'd be moments that weren't. But that was, for us, interesting. a dialogue between us and a dialogue with the audience. We continue doing that. So in that way, I'm proud of having done many things like that. We released DVDs and we traveled the world with it. It was fun. Obviously, what Marx was doing with the raw material must have been interesting to you musically if you'd stayed with him for 11 years. What was it about the music, aside from the process, that was so... appealing to you? Sense of humor. Respectlessness. Respectlessness. Yeah. We did this, we did a remix of a film from, has the film started yet, is the name of the film, by Maurice Lemaitre, a letterist. The letterists were like a 1950s version of Mark McLaren and the Situationists and Punk. And we did a remix of his film in Cologne and he was present. He was like 80 at the time. And the remix was his film on the left hand side of the screen in 60mm and ours, the video on the right. And Mark took the soundtrack and remixed it into a kind of a minimal. And he was there and after about five minutes he got so excited that he got up on the stage, he took off his shirt, set his shirt on fire. took off his shoes, threw them in the audience. He's an 80-year-old guy. He didn't know that his hearing aid was causing huge problems in the room, that we had this massive feedback. But it became this huge, almost sound and image debauchery. And he came up to us at the end, and he just stood in front of us, like this 80-year-old man, and shouted at us, thank you so much, you've understood. It's all about respectlessness. I mean, as I say, these were the precursors of punk and McLaren. And that was wonderful for us to actually hear somebody who understood what our essence was. By respectlessness, I mean that in these early things, Mark would mix, like, say, some... Stockhausen, something you're not really supposed to touch Stockhausen. He'd mixed that with the radio at the live at the same time with like sound effect CDs and all of these things. And so it wasn't about, oh, this is a holy piece of music. We're not allowed to touch that. We have to sample just this. And as you may hear from what I'm saying, we got really tired of all these people. trying to put themselves in boxes really early to make sure they got a good review in debug or a good review in specs so they'd be really careful not to cause anything which might disturb the reviewer or the curator in a museum. I mean, today still, if you make art in a museum, as in live show as media art, if you play exactly what was on your DVD, they're more happy usually than if you come and do something special for them because they won't do exactly that. It's understandable. They have a market and they have to sell tickets and everything, but sometimes it can get a bit boring. And so it was certainly never boring performing with Mark because sometimes he would just do things which were inexplicable to me. And I think like, why the hell is he doing that? And sometimes that would lead to a wonderful moment and sometimes it wouldn That was fine with me. You mentioned the corporate gigs. And you mentioned gigs at art museums where people were expecting exactly what they got. They knew what they were going to get and they wanted that. I imagine that's just as hard and just as unsatisfying in a way. corporate things were not satisfying at all. Financially they were satisfying, of course. But, I mean... I'm sorry, I'm referring to the art gallery gigs. That must be unsatisfying, that the expectation is due. Yeah, I mean, expectations is a funny thing. I remember one promoter once said to us, privately, I really like what you're doing, but I can't invite you back. This was to a club. I'll talk about the museums in a second. This was to a club. We said, why? He said, because I've got 500 people here, and they and then you come and you just do a remix of a Miles Davis trumpet solo for 20 minutes. The one time people threw candidates was in Benicassim when this great DJ before us, like some Barcelona house DJ, who was very, very good, and he whipped up 5,000 people. They were all dancing. We came on stage. And then they thought that, you know, my weird images and Mark's Miles Davis intro was a great intro to the next set. And then they discovered it wasn't an intro. It was going to continue like this. And we actually emptied out the tent and we had people like throwing cans of cola at us. I'm just shocked that you, you know. got to the point where a festival like that was like, yeah, Reconcentrum, that's, of course, let's put them right after the Barcelona house DJ. Well, as you know, life is full of misunderstandings and some lead to very nice things and others lead to friction. So expectation is something, and what people really expect you to do, it can be frustrating. But in the art world, there are terribly many boring people, but there's also a lot of quite interesting people who are quite courageous. And sometimes old school people still believe like, no, art has to be free. You do whatever you want to do. And at the end of the show, maybe half the people had left. I prefer shows where half the people who don't like it, where they leave and the other half really liked it rather than everybody think it was rather pleasant. Of course. And so, you know, they weren't actually that unsatisfying. There were times where afterwards you'd have arguments with people that said, I thought you were going to didn't ask and just because you bought the CD doesn't mean that we're going to do exactly that. This was at a time where a lot of people were releasing very interesting CDs and labels in Cologne and Berlin but when they played live they do a straight four-floor techno set because that's what people wanted. And I think people thought we would do the same, but we're like, no, no, our live shows are just as interesting, weird, bad, good, whatever, as the CD, as the DVD. So you've got to live with that. I mean, I may come across quite arrogant in this way, but I feel quite arrogant towards people who have lots of money and then want to buy something and think that they bought your soul as well, which is why we don't do corporate. anymore. I couldn't. You mentioned film earlier. You mentioned a time before video. You mentioned video, obviously now laptops and other technology. Just walk me through, I guess, a little bit about what... how you're doing what you're doing, what instruments you're using to make that stuff. Okay, so a background sentence that would be that I'd mentioned that with Rechenzentrum, we were a sample-based project. Everything we did was sampled, and that was our concept and manifesto. Everything we sampled was manipulated beyond recognition because we didn't want to sound like, I don't know, sampling James. Brown to make people think that we were half as funky as James Brown. That wasn't interesting. I mean, there's so many samples on our records that are by incredibly famous people that if they knew about it, they would have taken us to court, but they wouldn't even have recognized it themselves. That was the idea. Visually, the same. Everything I did was sampled from movies, from CNN, in a hotel room, from everywhere. I manipulated. I did that for 10 years of Reckon Central. And then I realized that I could probably do this till the end of my life and it would become quite boring because I felt I'd taken it as far as I could just to satisfy myself. And so I went into the exact opposite direction. Now everything I do is filmed by me and also what I'm filming is created by me, which means that I've turned my... For about a year I turned... in my bathroom into a laboratory and just had chemical, biological and physical experiments going on in there and just filming them. So every day it was just like burning stuff, melting stuff, like really long-term things, like watching stuff go green mold and taking like a picture every minute, setting up cameras to take like time-lapse photography. So right. Right now there's cameras in your bathroom filming something. I'm lucky that I've got a girlfriend who lives close by with a good bathroom and I've got a fitness studio on the other side with a good shower. So I haven't used my bathroom for hygiene things for a long time. So it's important to me that everything that I use now has actually been filmed by me and not only just filmed by me outside but actually I'm filming stuff that's created by me. It's just like weird experiments, try to bring together different forces of nature and see what happens, bring together different materials. In the final product, I'm still looking for the same thing. I did a workshop tour once with Mertzbo in Europe years ago, and at the time I don't think I quite understood what Japanese noise music was about. I thought it was just maybe like attitude. really extreme and then I understood how incredibly sensitive he is and many of those Japanese guys and what they're going for is much more he said I'm not interested in rhythm not interested in melody or harmony I'm just interested in texture and intensity that's what I'm going for and I thought suddenly everything made sense of what those guys were doing and I've sort of followed something similar in the last years and so now I try to create I mean sometimes texture and intensity can be incredibly fragile still you know it doesn't mean that everything has to be loud and coarse but that's what I'm going for so now to answer your question finally I'm just filming hours and hours of this material and then of course then I take a lot of it into into a laptop and I manipulate it digitally. But I also do a lot of stuff where I print it out every frame, every second frame on sheets of paper, then redraw them. If I'm not happy with the texture, redraw them with pencils, with crayons, with chalks, with inks, scan them in again and create a new loop out of it. And then when I play live, I've got two laptops, and I just have a huge library, and both are for me huge. I've got a few hundred. clips. Each one is usually, I mean the longest one I have now is about one and a half seconds and I just make a big collage to get back to your very early question about painting. I'm just making collages in real time from hundreds of clips on two laptops and a mixing desk and I mean, you saw the recent show I did with Morten, with Sibotnik. I know roughly what he's going to do. He's doing, say, Rappers of the Moon, but usually he switches that off in the middle, he starts experimenting, then he brings it back in again. So I know our dramatic arc over the one hour we play, but I could never do an identical show. I've never been able to do two identical shows in my life, and I wouldn't want to. They're Because when you do a live collage, things change, things go wrong. I'm creating loops all the time in both of them, creating layers in both of them. And then I'm looking at the screen and deciding, oh, that's nice, but take it in this direction, change it. But I could never do the same show twice. One of the interesting things about the Sabotnick show that I found is obviously you're in sync with Morton. listening to what he's doing and waiting for him to get to a place before bringing in another sort of crew clips, I suppose, would be the best way to put it. And there was some point at which it sounded like he was about to kind of jump into another section. And I could see like you kind of bringing in a little bit this next set of clips. And then it kept going on that path and you like brought it out. it does seem very much like it was almost like a DJ couldn't hadn't matched the record and sort of brought it back and was like okay I'll try that again in a minute absolutely you saw that yeah you saw exactly what was happening Tell me about working with him. Was that the first time that you had collaborated with him before? With Morten it's quite funny and quite wonderful for me. I'm very happy about it. I was asked two years ago, almost three years ago, to work on an opera in Bregenz in Austria at this opera festival, an opera by Morten Sabotnick. And I only knew Morten. and Sabotnick as the rappers of the Moon and the synthesizer, the Buchla. I didn't know he did operas. But I instinctively just said, like, it's certainly interesting, let's do that. And so then I got to meet him, and while we were working on the opera, he was telling me that he had been thinking of possibly doing some live shows. I mean, he hadn't played for, you know, 30 years, something unbelievable. And would I be interested in collaborating with him? And then we were asked by, we did the opera rehearsals for over a year and everything, and it was four cellos and a keyboard, and it was a real opera. singers. And then they asked us whether we would do just a small promotional thing for the journalists in the region in the afternoon of the opera, just he would explain the synthesizer into a little live show, what I'd like to do videos to, and I said, why not? And a week later they said, oh, we just asked some other people, would you like to do this in Liechtenstein as well, in the museum? I said, yeah, why not? And so from this, this has grown now that now I performed in Lincoln Center in New York with him. We were in Mexico two weeks ago, in Madrid to Reina Sofia with him next week. And it's just like grown from that. And it's interesting because he's a lot older than I am, but at 78 he's still a lot younger than so many other people that I have collaborated with who are actually my age or even younger. And we discovered that we had just very similar and very simple mottos about why we do what we want to do, which is, for him, he says he's creating little islands of ecstasy. That's all he wants to create. I mean, obviously, with the background, it's a lot. more than that but it's about creating something which has never been there before a little ecstatic moment and I certainly enjoy creating these little ecstatic moments with him where things happen and that's what I meant before about what you said about what you'd observed and about how I work it's fine for me to think that he's going to go in this other way and then he doesn't and I thought he would go there so I'm introducing something but then we don't and that's what I would call maybe like a little one-way street or a little ghetto and you've got to get out of that again and then you get to somewhere else which is like a new plateau and you move it around. I mean, he's actually interesting because he's such a controlled freak. to control the show completely. That seems so strange to me, considering his music, that he's a control freak because it seems so wild and bridled. It is, and that's the wonderful thing. The wonderful thing is when something goes wrong. I hope he's not going to listen to this. No, no, but we've spoken about this. The wonderful thing is that he's really trying to show all of the various things that the synthesizer can do. I mean, a little private story, it's just that I stayed house in April for a week when we played at Lincoln Center. I stayed in New York for a week longer. So there you can see in the studio. and I'd go out to get a glass of water at four in the morning, and he'd be in the kitchen sitting there, look at this, Ableton, they've enabled this new thing that I can link up the Buchla with Ableton this way, with this MIDI controller, and it's just fascinating, fantastic for me to see this seven to eight-year-old guy with such incredible enthusiasm, but then he's trying to do all the possibilities. So now he's got these nano-corg MIDI controllers that are very and like other MIDI controllers, and like a keyboard, and another trackpad. And so it's actually wonderful when something goes slightly wrong, because that leads him to somewhere where he's got to also get out of or increase it. And for me, you may have seen how we've set up the stage as well, because in Austria, this just happened, the first show we did, that then he's like looking at the screen, and he's creating music to my video, and my video is based on the music. So we've or feedback loop or however you want to describe it and he's much more open to doing that than so many other people that I've performed with recently or in the last years. So that's basically how we got that together and now we're performing quite a lot and each show is actually getting better. It's interesting that you mentioned that I didn't think of that, that he was facing away from the audience, sort of. To interrupt you, there's two reasons. One is, of course, that it's lovely for the audience to be able to see the synthesizer. Yes, yes. This is also very true because I remember sitting in the audience in Poland and thinking, that is a beautiful, beautiful piece of machinery. It's beautiful and people can see also what he's doing. Partially see what he's doing, but they can also see it's not like the usual thing, people behind a laptop and then, oh, so he's behind a actually see the whole thing. They can see how it's patched. They can see how he's manipulating it. And the other thing is so that he can see the videos. And then we sit opposite each other so we've got eye contact. You also do a lot of one-offs, it seems like, with people, you know, or... non-collaborations in that way. For instance, you did something with Deadbeat Mutech this year and I was talking to him and I think he said to me that he hadn't even seen what you had prepared beforehand. It was just sort of a surprise to him as well. It was a surprise to him. I mean, we've known each other for a long time and we talked about... collaborating for a long time, so I think my aesthetic was not a surprise to him. But we hadn't been able to rehearse it or work out something. He'd given me the music for his new CD and he more or less told me that at the show there, and also the one we did in Berlin a few weeks ago, he would be staying quite strictly to the new CD because that's what he wants to present, so I knew what's going to happen more or less. create a new, I always try to create a new thing for each person that I work with or collaborate with. I don't just try to come with my same clips and so you wouldn't see me performing with deadbeat with the same video that you saw for Subotnik because it doesn't make that much sense to me. Was that mostly black and white? It was completely black. Why did you choose that? Well, various reasons. I love the music that he makes, and we both have a shared love of dub music and of Lee Perry and a lot of this stuff. And then he's also started a label now called Black Arts, and there just seems so much that this isn't really for yellows and greens and pinks. And it's also going to be in a club space, so I want to... I mean, more than Mutech. Mutech was more a concert, but when we It's going to be more in club-oriented spaces where I actually quite like what's the projection. The actual light beams going through the club being in black and white and keeping that to quite a stark... His cover as well is completely black, keeping a stark contrast and not making it like a colourful poppy show. I mean, subotonic sounds are so colourful. The whole palette is repeated over and over and recreated and manipulated. And Deadbeat's things are pretty, you know, they're pretty Caribbean black and white for me. So, I mean, it'll stay like that. You've also done stuff with Finesse. What is it like working with him? With him it's also interesting that I've mentioned that so many people are not interested in... I get invited, I often get invited to collaborate with somebody and then I've understood that the reason they want me to collaborate with them is because they can ask for higher fees if they've got a multimedia show and not just a concert set. And that's not a bad thing. I mean, that just makes business sense for somebody trying to expand their possibilities or get higher fees or whatever. And I'll only collaborate with people where I have the feeling that there's also a personal interest. I would never want to play with somebody where the fee is good, but I find the person unsympathetic. There's got to be sympathy and there's got to be shared interest, common interest. There's got to be some kind of common goal. Even if the aesthetics... sonically and visually are completely different, there's got to be some kind of common goal of why would we be on stage together. Then I've performed with a lot of people who I notice, okay, they talk about the visuals before the show, they talk about collaboration and dialogue and everything, and once they're on stage they get completely lost in their Max MSP patch or in their Ableton setup. That's fine, they're playing live, but they don't actually have much interest in what's on the screen behind them. They just hope that we get compliments and get invited to play again. And that's also fine. No, that's completely okay. But for somebody like playing with Fennis, I mean, Fennis regularly turns his back on the audience when he's playing the guitar and just stands there watching the screen for like 10 minutes until he goes back and changes something and his Max and his P-Patch introduces a new And obviously I'm listening to the music and we have had some fantastic concerts where, not being very humble, some shows where I've just come off stage and think like, you know, I mean, I love that feeling when you come off stage and think, if I were to die at this very moment, it was all worth it just for that. Or being on stage. playing in that moment thinking this is maybe the best thing that's ever happened to me and maybe you know 5,000 people in the audience like it maybe it's a small show there's only 10 people there and they don't like it but in that moment I just don't care this for everything was just worth it this very moment and I've had moments like that with Christian quite often because I mean he's also You know, I talked about branding and artists branding themselves. He's a very clear profile of what he's doing. And yet in shows, he can be wildly experimental where it just goes way off the track and people are expecting to hear Endless Summer and to hear like nice melancholic stuff, a little bit of like starry, drizzly sounds. And then it turns into a massive, brutal wall of noise. But there's always a sensitivity in there. There's always an intention and a... and an emotionality that I love, that speaks to me very much. I mean, now we did this Mahler show that I mentioned, and we've made a DVD of it. It's coming out sometime next year, I guess. And just even working on that, listening to his live recording that we did, and just changing things, mastering my video, changing color and contrast, just listening to his music over and over again. It's just so wonderful. love with that. That's wonderful. What music do you listen to for pleasure outside of work? Well, I guess one name has come up already a few times is Lee Perry. I just can't get away from Lee Perry. I just love so much of what he's done. I love so much of what he's done, but not only just listening to it and enjoying the music. I love so much of who he is as well. When you read his biography, I'm sure you've read it as well. of bringing two small audio mixers from England and creating these fantastic sounds on this setup that most people today would be quite embarrassed and which doesn't have like 10% the technical horsepower that every laptop does and creating these wonderful, beautiful melodies, reinventing stuff. And that's why I'm in love with him. A lot of classical music, but I guess that's also an upbringing thing. Like my father was a journalist who interviewed Bob Marley. I was talking to somebody about this yesterday, how funny it was. I used to play drums in punk bands, and my mother would come to see me play, and she'd be really proud of me. friends would be like, what's your mother doing here? And the other hand, I had blue hair at the time, and the other hand, she'd take me to the National Concert Hall in Dublin, and they wouldn't let me in because I had blue hair. So it was an early experience in people trying to be exclusive and not inclusive. I'm a vastly inclusive person. I'd like everybody from every possible background to come to my show. I find exclusivity quite boring, even though that's a trademark of the art world I listen to an awful lot of classical music, but that's usually because I'm probably involved in that composer. I did a Beethoven project with Mark years ago, so then I listened to Beethoven an awful lot. Now I've been doing Messiaen and Xenakis, so I listen to that quite a lot, if they're classical or new music. I work with Zeitgratzer Ensemble, this Berlin new music ensemble, and we did a DVD as well for Xenakis. And I just immersed myself in that whole school of music. But, God, what do I listen to for pleasure? I don't know. I'm too curious. I've got too much curiosity and inquisitiveness. My girlfriend is a classical pianist, but then she loves Ella Fitzgerald, so when we're at her place, it seems to be Ella Fitzgerald all the time. Tell me about the festival that you're curating, Tashkent. That's exciting. Yeah. You know, we talked about this a couple of months ago, I suppose. And I have to admit, I was completely fascinated by the idea of it. The Goethe-Institut is sort of the guiding force, and they asked you to do what there? So first I got asked whether I would create a piece of media art based on glaciers melting. And I said, well, it was just an email. I said, well, that sounds fascinating, but I need a little more information on what's happening here. And just by coincidence, one of the people instigating this project was in Berlin for another project, and so we met for a coffee. And then after the coffee, I turned into the artistic director of the festival. So it was a useful coffee. It was a worthwhile coffee. The story, very briefly or in a nutshell, there's four countries. countries in Central Asia, which don't particularly get on or like each other, like ex-Soviet republics, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, they don't get on with each other for various reasons, like many regions in that area. But they have one thing in common, which is they have glaciers. glaciers are melting all over the world. It's known. And there the glaciers are pretty important because they provide water for cotton and Uzbekistan is the world's second biggest cotton provider. but it's also the dictatorship and it's difficult and other countries are suffering under this and that. And so they decided to try to make one project, kind of a unifying project, a little as I spoke earlier about making video that one can enjoy without speaking any language. This could be an art project which you can create, enjoy, view, make without being a member of one of those four countries and disliking the others. And so what's happening is we're getting the Swiss company to come in to record Glaciers Melting, the sound of Glaciers Melting, and then this audio track will be given to... all media artists from the region are interested. Anybody can download it, and then they can create a piece of work, and they can hand it in, and then we'll look at it, and we'll try to realize it, but always with an emphasis on collaboration between the four countries. So we're trying to get a... a dancer from one country with a musician from another country and a DJ and this and that. And then we're going to put that on in each of the four countries and see how that works. And now I'm quite happy with having had some influence on the project. They wanted first just to have music. And I was saying, let's expand it completely. So now these kids in Almaty, in Uzbekistan, like many big cities now have freestyle hip-hop kids on the street with their ghetto blaster. And now they're actually working on creating a dance track which they will perform in the inner city, just free on the street. People who don't know about it will know what it is. But all of the sounds are from the glacier melting. And we have readings in ancient languages. speaks anymore with this as a soundtrack. So it's the whole spectrum. I want to make more public art in that area than have it confined to a museum with three ministers standing around drinking champagne. That would be quite boring. I think the, obviously, kind of talked about this earlier with me, is trying to avoid having an international incident with these four countries, seemingly. hating one another. I shouldn't go so far as to say... Sorry, that's an international incident. No, but it's not that they hate each other. I mean, it's very briefly, it's a tragic thing that Stalin decided all of these nomadic people should stop being nomadic. So he put them all in houses and he made sure that they were always, that they were never alone. There was a minority there to make sure they would always have enough friction and leave him alone. Machiavellian politics. And then after the Soviet Union, they drew borders. But the borders don't make any sense because this region was nomadic for all of history. Now suddenly they have borders. And in every country, you've got a minority of people who feel badly treated by the government because they're not getting enough education as the other people. It happens all over the world, but there it's very, it's injury. And so the idea is also to have collaborations between these countries, as I mentioned, but I've got to take care to make sure that it doesn't lead to any more friction because they're all waiting for friction. I mean, they had a little, not little, they had a horrible incident in Osh in Kyrgyzstan just about a year ago that killed like a few hundred people. It's just orchestrated as well. We're on to get more power than the Arab government. These things happen. So I'm trying to make an art project in an area which is, for me, fascinating because, of course, I love performing in all these other media festivals, but it's also great to be in a place that is so different and doesn't have any experience of media artists hanging around together. It's quite rough there. I mean, I got arrested in Uzbekistan the first time I came because I'd filled out the form wrongly for the immigration form. I up for a couple of hours but it's interesting I mean nothing will happen to me they're not going to kill me but I'm fascinated by this kind of project I love this very much so I've been there now three or four times meeting people from each country we'll see what happens I'll keep you updated You mentioned the media festivals and trying to get out of that, if you can. Trying to get out of it? Well, not out of it, but that you've gone to all these things and it's a nice change of pace to go and do something else. I think the only reason we met is because we're kind of on the same festival circuit, so to speak. And I wonder, at a certain point... Is that getting tiring? No, that's not getting as tiring as I had been getting, say, in the 90s when I was making video in clubs. I've heard clubs let me down. And we had these clubs in the 90s here in Berlin, these squatted clubs, as you may know. It was so easy to start a club. You see an empty house, you break in, you're squatted, nothing happens, good. You open up a club the next day. And so there were hundreds of clubs in this whole area, exactly where we were sitting. Maybe not hundreds, but over 10 years there were hundreds. And then I thought, clubs, new social space, a place where you can actually create really But it got a bit boring for me after a while because also these things got streamlined, got efficient, made lots of money. Their owners drove random big cars and they just became quite boring places for me. So I did actually turn my back on clubs and I don't actually like performing in clubs. I got a bit let down by other video artists in Berlin who felt they were just as important as DJs, which I found quite bizarre because you don't see 100 people queuing up for VMF or one of these clubs to see the VJ. The VJ basically in that context is like very nice security people, a good bar, a good lighting system. you know, it's an add-on, but people go to see a DJ flown in from London. But at the same time, and I'm not saying that they should be necessarily, but at the same time it has to be frustrating in a way to know that, you know, you're putting in probably the same amount of work beforehand, you know, getting your records together, so to speak, and that you're kind of... Well, that can be frustrating, but gravity can be frustrating as well, but there's not much point fighting against it. I'm all for asking people for bigger fees and say, look at all the work we put in and all of this, but I think in the end, what's the expression as well? Putting backsides on seats or something? What's actually selling tickets? What's actually getting the club full? Is that there's a star DJ flown in from somewhere or from Berlin? who will get everybody dancing. People don't actually dance to visuals. People don't actually talk about their relationship. Oh, do you remember we met in that club when that video was on? They usually talk about the track that was on. That's fine for me. So I just decided to move on. I mean, I just decided that I wanted to go to a place with Reikens Center, with Mark as well, where there's more focus what we were doing. That's why I mentioned going from 10-hour shows. We actually moved up on stage. There's not really much reason that we're on stage when we're performing. We could actually be at the back where we actually see and hear better. But if you're at the back where you actually see and hear better, you keep getting interrupted by people asking you where are the toilets? Can you help me open my beard? Do you have a lighter? Who's on tomorrow? And you're like, listen, I'm in the middle of a show right now. That's why we took it on stage because then it also makes people sad maybe, but it makes people realize, oh, there's actually a live show and oh, they're actually doing something. You're building the brand. Sadly, sadly. I also have to admit. But yeah, sure. I mean, building the brand can be funny if you do it in a situationist way, a bit like the Sex Pistols did. I mean, I quite enjoy those things. So I'm skeptical of it, but of course it can be fun too. What is the Lilivan brand? Razorblades. Razorblades. I have no idea. I've got no idea. I spend very little time thinking about it. I mean, anybody who knows me or knows what I do is... I mean, I've had a Facebook page for two years, Facebook page, and I'm not able to update it. I've got no interest in it. And these things just really don't interest me that you
