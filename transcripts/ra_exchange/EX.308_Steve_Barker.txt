Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Tony Naylor and I'm a regular contributor to Resident Advisor. Our guest on this week's exchange is the DJ Steve Barker, host of the BBC's legendary cult radio show On The Wire. Broadcast regionally in Lancashire in the north of England, On The Wire has been running continuously for a remarkable 32 years, and in that time it has pushed an uncompromising and at times influential mix of dub reggae, electronic and avant-garde music. In the 1980s, when fans of On The Wild would share cassette tapes of the show way beyond its northern heartland, it played a key role in helping to popularise hip-hop in the UK. It was likewise the first British radio show to play music from Detroit techno artists such as Derek May and Kevin Saunderson. And in the acid house era, it offered crucial early exposure to the heroes of Manchester's rave scene, most notably 808 State and a guy called Gerald. Over the years, on the Y's time slot has jumped around and the internet has helped it reach a new global audience. But in its central purpose, nothing has changed. It still promotes the same mix of pioneering and experimental music with the same enthusiasm. Over the years, On The Wise time slot has jumped around and the internet has helped it reach a new global audience. But in its central purpose, nothing has changed. It still promotes the same mix of pioneering and experimental music with the same undimmed enthusiasm. This is still perhaps the only place on UK radio where in the same two-hour time slot you'll hear the latest tracks from Arca or Fatima Al-Kadira, next to gems from Fela Kuti, King Tubby and Rhythm and Sound. The importance of that spirit of adventure to several generations of electronic music artists and fans was illustrated by On The Wire's 30th anniversary broadcast. which saw Demdak Stare, The Orb and Shackleton provide specially commissioned pieces for the show. On The Wire is, was and remains a unique cultural entity, one which resonates beyond the north of England. Steve, an obvious but nonetheless useful place to start, I suppose, would be with the origins and the birth of On The Wire in 1984. So, as I understand it, you were already working at BBC Radio Lancashire. Well, back in 1984 when we started the show, it actually took the place of a show called Spin-Off, which went out twice a week, and this BBC manager at the time... who, by all appearances, looked a kind of quite straight guy. You know, he was a nice chap, nice family man, etc., etc. And he'd been listening to what I'd been doing on spin-off, which wasn't really too much different from what we started to do on The Wire, and he said, why don't we put this show on a Sunday afternoon and combine the two spin-offs from two hours and make it three hours and go between two and five on a Sunday afternoon? And I thought I was in some kind of psychedelic fourth dimension kind of weirdo dream, you know what I mean? What's going on here? You know, even so. And it was a very challenging thing to do back then, you know, especially for me because I was just a punter, basically. I was just doing this as a bit of a laugh because I was a bit of a music fan, you know. I never thought of actually going into radio per se, you know. So what was your job here then? I didn't have a job. I've always been freelance. Ah, right, okay. Because people have this idea. that if you work for the BBC as a DJ, you're driving around in a sports car with white-tie wheels and a chick on each arm. You get paid buttons. I still do, actually. I get paid ridiculously, for me, anyway, a small amount of money, which is why I've never been able to do this full-time. But nevertheless, to be offered a show, show at that time which was basically when hip-hop was just starting and apparently reggae was dead but I didn't think so was a great it was a great opportunity you know So what did you see was lacking nationally or locally that you thought On The Wire would fulfil? What was the space you felt you would move into? Although John Peel had been going out nationally, the rest of Radio 1 was certainly the old smashy and nicey generation. So, oh, Peelie. God bless him. He'd yet to be canonised. Yeah. We forget how things were, you know, back then. He'd yet to be canonised. He was put up with. He was in a pigeonhole, late-night pigeonhole, etc, etc. And although I like some of the stuff that Peely played, you know, I thought, well, he didn't do enough of some other things, which was like new American dance music, like he tended not to touch. Now, there might have been a few pirates doing that around the time. There certainly were very few here. So I felt we were able to go into some newer areas whilst... carrying on some of those traditions that Peely and other notables really back in the 70s started out with basically playing reggae which is again very rarely heard these days but some names now have gone by you know like Tommy Vance played reggae on radio of course Dave Rodigan had shows back then but it was always seen as a kind of outsider music thank goodness So it was basically this collision of music that we were able to bring with On The Wire. On that first show, it was Adrian Sherwood and Keith LeBlanc. And, of course, Adrian had just met Keith and the whole kind of Sugarhill gang. lot in New York at a new music seminar and the whole kind of new tackhead and fats comic thing kind of started off then and not only was I able to play that I was able to get a little bit involved in that as well maybe more about that later on yeah we'll come to that In a sec. There's quite a spiky paragraph on the On The Wire website talking both about kind of the dismal nature of Radio 1's mainstream output at the time, but also about how you felt the London Dance Mafia, is your term for it, were kind of behind the times then. So there was an oppositional sense of you doing something different from a northern perspective particularly, did you think? Yeah, yeah. It's not often recognised in the UK as such. It's not restated enough. But the north's always been a really, really strong centre in the sport of black music, black American music. right back from the 40s and 50s, right back when some of the blues and R&B stars used to come through and drop into Manchester, maybe Birmingham, go straight on to Europe, not many other people. The DJ scene in the UK with... the Twisted Wheel, where my old pal Roger Eagle was so influential. The whole kind of Wiggins Casino thing. We were almost kind of basking in being outliers and outcasts were really liking this music. there's a bit of that to it. You know, well, you get on with it, you know, down in wherever it is, but we'll do it here, thank you very much. You know, we'll get on with what we've always done, like, really well. And I suppose I've moved from that, moved from that since, that position. So, 1984, you love reggae, you love hip-hop, you love early New York club music, American club music. What had been your musical education and your enthusiasms prior to that? Because you'd trained as a journalist and then you'd gone into some music journalism, I think in 1967 you interviewed Jimi Hendrix, didn't you? That's right. It was one of your first jobs, so you'd maintained an interest. What were you doing for work and what was your musical passion at the time? I mean, musical passion goes back, I was thinking about this the other day actually. And I remember being at school when I was about 13 or 14 at Nelson Grammar School with a mate of mine. And we were kind of, I think the Beatles might have been kind of relatively important, but we knew that there was a lot of pop music at the time in the early 60s being covered. in the UK that wasn't actually real pop music. It was covers of American pop music, which wasn't pop music. It was that thing called rhythm and blues. And we started getting into this stuff. And I suppose the first artist that really kind of struck me was... fear of God into me really was Ray Charles and that's when he was starting to do some of the more kind of crossover stuff as well so it was easy for me to buy some stuff that my parents put up with while I still time you know listening to like the hardcore Ray Charles stuff and people used to tell me like terrible stories about Ray Charles drug taking excesses which was a bit exotic for me when I was like a 13, 14-year-old in the misty valleys of northeast Lancashire. And it kind of progressed. When you hit upon a car centre of music, then it begins to flower outwards, doesn't it? You look at influences here. Well, I was inquisitive, so I'd look for things around it. So I got into black vocal. and I started going backwards and like being into getting started getting into Chicago blues but then even deeper into country blues and if I was ever on the desert island at least four or five of my tunes would definitely be kind of pre-war country blues tunes. And that was like what I was doing then. A friend of mine and me snuck out of school one day and we went to Manchester to the Free Trade Hall in 1964. I think we missed a French lesson to see the American Folk Blues Festival. Well, that was Howling Wolf. Sonny Boy Williamson, Sleepy John Estes, Willie Dixon, Lightning Hopkins. I mean, when you're 16 and you see stuff like that, you know. And there was nobody in the audience who had a free trade hall. It was about a tenth full. They were like these university students in crocheted veils smoking clay pipes. It was a total knockout. How can these experiences not change? But when Jimi Hendrix arrived, coming back to your point he made, I was doing a journalism course in London at the Regent Street Polytechnic. University of Westminster. We were putting together a magazine and people were saying, what do you want to do? I said, I fancy interviewing this guy who's got this record out, you know, Hey Joe, and that's where I went to see Jim Hendricks, between Hey Joe and Purple Haze, which is an experience for an 18-year-old, yeah. And so you were making your living hell then, having discussed the parlous finances of the regional DJ? At that stage, I mean, although I was... relatively educated I suppose because I'd been to grammar school and been to college and then went on to university I was just doing I didn't want to do like a house journalism job I worked for a while at university on a magazine called Unit and Tony Elliot was the editor who went on of course to launch Time Out and he offered me a job in in the Northwest time out. And, uh, and I said, no, I didn't want it. I didn't have a car, so I couldn't get to the office basically, but it folded about six weeks later. So I was just doing, I was just doing laboring jobs. Right. Until, uh, the civil service in, uh, in Liverpool. Uh, I worked there for a few years, but then. went to London in the middle 70s. In 75, went to London. In fact, that's a funny story, actually, when I got to London, because I'd been there about two weeks, and a mate of mine called me up, and he said... He said, there's a friend of mine starting a band. You might want to see them. He's managing this band. And do you want to come round? It's Radline Square, this pub at Radline Square. It's a University of London gig. I said, yeah, yeah, sure, I'll come round. I've got nothing to do, you know. I was, like, alone in London. I just started this work. So I went round and met him and made. And we went around to the gig and he introduced me to his mate. Steve, this is Malcolm McLaren. And he was sort of the second, he was the second Sex Pistols gig. He was at Red Lion Square. He was like, he was terrible. They were supporting this also horrible pub rock band called Rugolator, who you probably maybe have heard of. But that was another kind of... It's almost like a Zellig, you know. I was performing this Zellig kind of... Who's that up there with Steve? Oh, it's Sex Pistols. But throughout this time then you were maintaining this kind of watching brief over black American music and the various mutations of it, presumably. That's right. And the reason I mention working in London is I worked in Labrador Grove in 1975. And, you know, if you wanted to be in a place where the actually sound of the streets was reggae, it was the mid-70s. in London, you know, and a while so was Jeff Travis opened Rough Trade shop just up the road from where I worked and I used to go in there. I remember buying the complete set of Bessie Smith vinyl records in there because he used to do a roaring trade in secondhand vinyl and buy stuff up there and I think it was, I may have been Honest John's because he's been around a long time. But my first kind of straight in, my first reggae as such was like Burning Spear and what have you. So by the time the radio show comes into being then, this is kind of something you've been building up to for years in terms of being... about what you wanted to play and having very fixed ideas about the stuff which was underexposed. The first few weeks of the show were quite interesting in terms of, you mentioned, you had Adrian Sherwood in the first week, Depeche Mode in the second week, who were already kind of massive at the time. They all came in. It was fantastic, these. And Lee Scratch Perry, week three. Yeah, he was incredible. Depeche Mode came in, all of the band came in. I had young chaps, you know. But there were thousands of girls up the road, you know, and they never expected to be at the BBC station. But they were really sweet. And the reason they came in is because I think Adrian Sherwood, I think he'd just done or was perhaps just working on a remix for them. But also, I mean, Daniel Miller still had... He was still hands-on and Daniel Miller's like a genuine, brilliant geezer, you know, and not very often mentioned in music business and music history in the UK, but he's like a top guy. I think he had something to do with it. as well. And then Lee Perry, who I just sent a birthday card to the other week. His 80th birthday. Did that feel like a bit of a coup? I mean, obviously you're from Lancashire. This is not the metropolis. This is even kind of for Mancunians. Blackburn is a kind of a satellite town, a mill town, which many people wouldn't go to. Did you feel like you were achieving something quite special by getting people out to Blackburn, essentially? Well, yeah, I mean, I think we were quite proud of what we were doing because it was edgy. We thought we were doing edgy stuff. It wasn't having Lee Perry on radio. It was having Lee Perry live on radio for three hours. With everything that could go wrong, that. He was live. He was live on radio for three hours, right. and Roger Eagle was on there trying to interview him of course which was impossible and he was showing Lee these records and Lee couldn't remember these records he made like he had all Roger had this fantastic collection of Lee Perry 7 inches you know and like loads of labels including Lopesator and Blanket all other labels. And Lee was looking at them. He was putting ticks. He had his felt-tip pen. He was putting ticks on the labels of the ones he remembered. But most of them he couldn't even remember. He's younger now than he was then. Well, yeah, he was quite lucid, actually. He was on the show recently, wasn't he? He seemed quite together, comparatively. So, double reggae, and we'll come to kind of why you love that later, perhaps. But you're playing a lot of hip-hop at the time, which, I mean, that was kind of the time I remember the show. I think the first kind of... 87 around that time and for me I mean playing things like Just Ice and KRS-One you know I certainly don't remember hearing those anywhere else and similarly you were playing kind of bleep techno stuff from Sheffield and also first kind of US techno records that I'd certainly heard in this country by this point you were already In your 30s? Yeah. I mean, were you enjoying any of that music as a clubber and as a club DJ, or were you enjoying it as a kind of listener at home? in Lancashire? In multiple ways really because I've never done if you get a gig as a radio DJ it's easy especially from what I do because basically I produce and present and I can select my own music I haven't got anybody like there's nobody interrupting like the life cycle you know of the thought to execute and that's it. If you're a DJ in a club, it's tough for me until you make it and then a lot of people say it's an easy ride once you've actually made it because you get sloppy. But to build that, to get the gigs and to get the reputation and to get your skills together. because I was never interested in seamlessly running through, you know, I was off to bang mixing. I was never interested in seamlessly matching the BPMs. I mean, you could explain it to me later, Toby, but I still don't understand that. Although I've done live, I've done DJ gigs all over festivals and certainly when I was living in China. I've never actually been a live DJ. And so in terms of playing stuff on radio, playing live never informed what I did on radio. And as for playing stuff at home, all my children grew up and slept to the bass of the throbbing, because the bass never wakes you up. The lullaby sound of dub reggae and Blake Zecno. Exactly. but mostly I like where I play I enjoy the stuff I play but and very rarely do I think I play this because I think it needs to be played to one side of me actually thinking oh this is a really cool tune or this is fantastic or whatever it is you know whereas I think most and I think that's something to do with you know I do two or three I used to do three hours a week now I do two hours a week there's so much music you can easily fill a two hour show you know with new music every week or as I've been able to so you've got to fill the show haven't you you've got to fill the show and they've got commercial pressures and the stuff that they feel has got to need to be there's all set of reasons apart from you actually liking the tune but I think what sets this programme apart from with what I do and what my colleagues do who contribute to the show is we love the music we play, full stop, that's it. I mean, as a punter, were you out in clubs? Were you seeing how dance music was functioning? I mean, Blackburn at the time was kind of a real centre for rave culture and obviously Manchester was, but you were kind of outside of that then, despite the fact you were popularising a lot of that music. Yeah, well... At the time, as you quite rightly say, I was knocking on, wasn't I, really? I'd be... Which you'll point out that you're now 68. 68, yeah. At the time, I was in the mid-30s, and I had a bunch of young children. I did do gigs, yeah. I had some regular gigs, and I thought... I found mostly quite boring, really, because I did some regular gigs just to get paid because we didn't have any money as a family. But then I did some gigs that were great. We put some gigs on at King George's Hall and this was the time that raves were being held all over East Lancashire. And we put two massive gigs on. at the King George's Hall. I had over a thousand turned up. The first one, it was absolutely rocking. And that was me and Andy Madhatter, Holmes from Manchester. He was playing Acid, and I was playing a bit of Acid. And then we had this, my wife was running a girl DJ crew back in the middle 80s called Wow Hi-Fi. And they played as well and it was fantastic. And that was, what was that called? The Slammer, it was called. And then we ran one called The Cooler. But somebody got stabbed. And so we couldn't do any more. That was it. They were really the top gigs. And I thought, what am I doing? 35 years, whatever it was, 36. stab into the house or rather stay at home and watch Dallas or whatever it was happening in 1986 I'm asking that question in part because you mentioned John Peel earlier now the obvious comparison is always made with On The Wire is if people want to kind of describe it to somebody who doesn't know it they kind of go it's the Lancastrian John Peel it's similar in in style. Now, I know John Peel was kind of pivotal in helping the show stay on the air a couple of times when it was threatened with closure. But it always struck me that one way in which your show was very different to John Peel was that you seemed to understand dance music in a way that he certainly didn't. You know, he would play a lot of dance music which often, I think, was kind of... sonically interesting but verged on kind of novelty records whereas you seem to have a deeper kind of understanding for the functionality of those records and the joy of those records and the soulfulness of those records and quite why they worked in a club context. Yeah, well, part of that, I think there's multiple facets in terms of response to that. I mean, number one, it's from my appreciation, I think, I claim a kind of an appreciation of black music. going back to the 20s, 30s, to the jazz era or even pre-jazz era. Of course, that's the kind of music I love. So basically, I'm trying to understand where the music's actually come from. That's number one. And when you listen to Muddy Waters, people don't realise Muddy Waters actually is dance music. That's what people used to dance to in blues, in blues dances. The other thing was that hip-hop, and to a certain extent, but much more subtly, techno, hip-hop was a very political language. It was political. You know, when you say... There's more, we were talking earlier on before this interview started about swearing on the radio. I remember playing a lot of hip-hop for a number of years and there was no swearing in that. There didn't have to be. And it was highly charged politically. It was only a little bit later, perhaps the late 80s, that some misogyny and bad luck... What we understand commonly as bad language began to creep in. So I always thought that playing hip-hop on radio was a political statement as much as anything else. And of course I think I understood that the party was actually playing in black culture at the time and to some extent a lot of that's been perverted now but it's an incredible impact, isn't it? Nobody could have actually forecast what impact it would have. I remember a great gig I went to actually and it was just describe how it was back in like 1982-83. I got a call from David Toope, who's a good friend of mine, who wrote some seminal early tracks on hip-hop. And he says, "African Bartos playing in London, you want to come and see?" And I went down with David and Sue Stewart, another early writer on street culture, shall we say. And they did a brilliant magazine together called Collusion. It was about five or six issues. It was a fantastic magazine. precursor to The Wire. We saw Africa Bambaataa and DJ Jazzy Joyce and there was a few others on there with some breakdancers and what have you. and they were at the Shaw Theatre on Euston Road. About 200 people fit into this theatre. It was fantastic, and it was seen like as a social, the first trickle that turned into a tsunami of a kind of global and a cultural scene. It was like a social impact, you know, this is what's happening. And he was, he felt like... you should have been a social worker or anthropologist to attend, you know, not somebody who was into tunes, you know. But there were a few hip black kids there as well as me and David and Sue standing out. Stroking your collective days cerebrally over the spectacle. Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's an interesting point. You know, the whole impact of US black culture on... British underground music. It strikes me that maybe you were aware of this at the time, maybe you weren't, but On The Wire and then a few other kind of DJs around Manchester and the North West, so Stu Allen on Piccadilly, Spin Masters on Sunset when that got off the ground, and a few other people. There did seem to be this kind of shift as Acid House got into gear whereby... You were moving away from, I suppose, a traditional public school educated, white, middle and upper class, enemy reading sense of what alternative culture was. And suddenly in the North West particularly, there was this kind of self... sustaining underground club music culture. Did you feel at the time you were part of that? Did you feel that shift? I mean, in retrospect to me, it seemed like a very exciting time. I'm probably... as I say, retrospectively superimposing some kind of analysis on it. But, you know, it did feel as if there was a shift to a kind of more respect and more space for, I suppose, working class, northern club culture and music culture, which obviously, as you said earlier, had always looked back or looked across the Atlantic to America for inspiration. You did feel part of it, certainly, and you felt like something was happening, because part of that change... of course, was the movement out of the studio into the bedroom in terms of creating a lot of this stuff. Because although, you know, people like, say, you mentioned 808 State earlier, and Gerald actually moved into the studio eventually. Initially, you know, a lot of what they were doing was really quite crude, shall we say. So you could... see elements of hip-hop multiple that certainly was a nuance of hip-hop wasn't it kind of taking the means into your own control under control and producing something new from it and saying basically fuck you you know this is what we're doing you know there wasn't any compromise which I thought was really interesting with that music I think there's an inevitability that that kind of plays out because as much as I hate corporate rock music or soft rock, I hate corporate hip-hop, and I can't play it. And as much as I hated Tamla Motown at one time, and I now quite like it, there's so much of that. We're getting on to the way music is absorbed. to the mainstream and kind of what happens to it, don't we really? And you actually began to see that in a number of different ways. And interestingly enough, the first way you began to notice that wasn't the music being absorbed into the mainstream era, into one of the labels that were going at the time, BMG, EMI, you know, blah, blah, warners. It was the drugs, wasn't it? The real commercialisation of a lot of this music, certainly house music, came through drug dealers, didn't it? That's the way it happened. Go on, explain that as a theory. Well, people actually started to use the music, the popularity of the music, to make money from drugs. Simply stated. So you think the music took on an increasingly kind of functional, dumbed-down form then, because obviously that widened the market for drugs, essentially. Exactly, that's what I do think. So basically, you know, the notion of a movement then gets kind of splintered. splintered down and what you're left with which I think is the real key thing for any kind of music is individuals you know individuals stand out and individuals stand proud through all that you know and it doesn't matter how any of that kind of impacts of any of that elsewhere else, but individuals can stay true, or the most remarkable individuals stay true to their visions, you know, of the music. So if you look at that house you mentioned, like, you know, Derek May, I mean, so-and-so, Juan Atkins, people like that, they actually saw it through, you know, we could still see them, you know, as some of the key players. this time you mentioned some of the parties you did around the radio show but I mean were you aware of how kind of big On The Wire was I mean I found this fascinating which I didn't know But you put a fall show on at Clitheroe Castle. So to describe that for people, it's a castle, obviously, but in a small market town in the middle of Lancashire. And 2,000 people turn up to that. And then you did what now seems, I suppose, an era-defining show at the Ritz in Manchester in 1988, December, I think this was. So the line-up for this, which is kind of incredible, was Adrian Sherwood, Gary Clale. A to 8 stay, a guy called Gerald and Naina Cherry and probably some other people on the bill as well who are forgotten. Mark Stewart was there. Mark Stewart, right. Little Annie was there. Right. You had the ability to put on these shows, you know, you were still on a relatively small regional radio station. were you aware of these cassettes being swapped and the word spreading? You must have got some sense of that just from 2,000 people turning up to watch The Fall, I suppose, in Clitheroe. Yeah, well, that was incredible. I mean, we didn't know how that would go because Clitheroe Castle, it's a kind of natural bowl. It's on a hill and it rolls down into a kind of arena. It's a beautiful setting, actually. But we said we'd go out live. Going out live... Oh, so you broadcast the show? Oh, yeah. I've still got the tapes. Right, right. Nobody's asked to put it out. It's incredible. It's like BBC... You've heard all these shitty fall tapes. We've got a BBC broadcast quality from 1986, I think it was. 30 years ago. There are about 176 fall albums. But this is the best one. But anyway, so putting Smithy on live is a bit like putting... Peri-on-live, isn't it? So, yeah, we were going to do the full. So the thing about this gig, you know, they're going to play a gig and a few people might turn up. 2,000, it was like 2,000, nearly 2,500 people turned up. And there was one policeman who managed to wander in. There was no trouble whatsoever. some of the Sunday traders in town took a few bobber and it went off sweetly you know and then funnily enough we did another gig about two months later and it was the we put on the Melatones who were like favourite band of ours from Liverpool and there's about 400 people there but there's like 15 or 20 police there's like a brigade or whatever it's going to happen again appreciation of what the potential was but we just wanted to put the bands on live so So that took us by surprise. We didn't think there'd be that many people. And things like the Ritz gig, you must have felt that you were kind of really in the eye of a storm there to a degree. And it was interesting, I suppose, with that line-up, you were kind of mixing far harder stuff, the kind of, you know, on-you-sound end of things, with 828 State and Gerald, who were already kind of, you know, well-known rave acts at the That was one of my best DJ moments, if I could take a break there. Because just one moment, you know, you can just capture this one moment. I DJed as well on that one. And I did like this little set. And I was playing some house thing at the time. It was like a new groove tune or something like that. And I thought, oh, fuck this, let's drop this King Tubby, you know. And, you know, the dance floor at the Ritz was like a sprung dance floor, a beautiful dance floor. The dance floor was full, yeah. Drop this King Tubby. Nobody left the dance floor. First and only time I've ever dropped a King Tubby, nobody's ever left it. So I said... these re-educated attendees at this gig. So on the wire it had already fulfilled its purpose then, you know, a new educated crowd. That's right. It was a bit of a challenge, especially, as you say, with Adrian doing this fairly hard-edged, hardcore left field. you know, industrial funk stuff, you know, with Gary Clale. I was especially pleased that Naina came, actually, because Naina and Adrian were old friends, but Naina was playing a bomb, the bass gig across town at the International. She came and did, and she was eight months pregnant. She was eight months, so she came over and did, like... A 25-minute set for us with Cameron and everybody. So contractually that would not be allowed to happen these days, would it? Exactly. So, yeah, we knew at that stage, well, you know, this is stupid. But it was great. It was great looking back. We've still got all that on tape as well. Yeah, there needs to be a kind of slew of... releases of all this stuff, doesn't it really? Just to talk about kind of the way the show works a little bit, because I think that's interesting in itself. Obviously now it's online and you have this wider audience geographically than you've ever had, but you've retained a very distinct sense of place and locality with it. Michael Fenny Fenton, when he comes in to the studio as he does in each show. We'll talk about world music gigs in village halls around Lancashire. And you flagged up recently an experimental music festival in Blackpool, which I would not have heard of anywhere else. Is that you fulfilling your remit for the BBC as a local music programme? Or is that you, in an increasingly globalised world, actually thinking that... retaining some sense of locality and celebrating the small, but important things that are happening in Lancashire is still very important. Yeah, we've always been proud to broadcast from Lancashire. Fenny has a Blackburn stroke Darwin accent and my accent might have been rounded a bit, but I'm still from Lancashire. I'm proud to be from. Lancashire so that's the prime reason that's the primary reason the other stuff follows on I like Fennie to be able to contribute because he has a unique view and he has a fresh view and he doesn't come to music He comes to music purely as a punter. He doesn't read any music magazines. And so he reacts to the music purely as he hears it. And to some extent, that's what I do. I'd like to be a musician, but I'm not a musician. So I couldn't really tell you anything about music at all, which some people wouldn't be surprised to hear. I just come to the music from the kind of pure experiential, you know, how does this make me feel, you know, that kind of response. So it's not like too much of a conscious thing. It's something we've actually developed from being proud to be from Lancashire. Now, it's funny because a lot of the people on the station here had never even heard of On The Wire. You know, they don't know what they've got, you know, because it doesn't really fit in. That's another battle, you know, to have because... when you think about the way the BBC local radio is constructed, and I think this is reflected in BBC national radio. That new controller. It said recently, there's too much data. You know, there's too much data. And I agree with him. But, you know, it's ridden with, like, research, isn't it, and demographics, and this is how it happens here. And there's very little... kind of soul-off-the-cuff choices or surprising juxtapositions. There's none of that. You know, it's all got to be kind of smooth, expected, familiar. And so to some extent, you could begin to kind of see how philosophy is, you know, not smooth, not expected, not familiar, or whatever the proper words are, you know, the antonyms to those things that define. broadcasting that would appeal to generally managers of all radio are frightened and understandably so of people switching off. Whereas what they should be doing is looking for people to switch on. And what were this focus group now and were audience figures watched throughout the two hours? I suppose when you and Fanny are talking about that will be... music gig in a small village hall in Darwin. That would be a dangerous moment for anybody analysing that data, wouldn't it? Because, you know, the expectation would be then that the bloke listening in Hungary is going to turn off at that point because he can't get to that gig in Darwin. But I think... People relish that sense of place. Yeah, I think that's true. But also, it's a radio show where we play a lot of stuff. And I think a lot of people listen to On The Wire know that they're going to tune in and they're not going to like some of this stuff. And that was what Peel did as well. Yeah. Give him credit. He knew that some people weren't going to like some of the stuff, but he knew by the same score that there might be one tune that he could play that might change somebody's life, you know, because that's what you did. You took risks, you know. To some extent, that's been a kind of theme through what we've actually done. Also, it's by the seat of our pants. I never have a playlist. I've actually got a playlist tonight because I'm doing a special, a Randy's, part one of a Randy's special, reggae special with... Clive Chin, introducing all the tunes because I got him to do it in Brooklyn so he's introducing all the tunes, we're cutting it in here. Right. But generally I just bring in a bunch of stuff I've put on my laptop or CDs in the bag or vinyl or whatever and I look at it like half an hour before I start and say what should I start with? So, you know, it's like the total... converse of like normal radio you know you mentioned the culture at the BBC there as I understand it the show's been seriously under threat twice I think was it in the 90s and then again in 2012 yeah so What saved it and how safe is it now, do you think? I mean, do you feel that you're in a position now where you are free to continue in this vein in perpetuity as long as you wish to? Or is there always that kind of cloud hanging over that, you know, it may end? It was two very distinct reasons. The one in the early 90s was the guy who put on the wire on in the first place, actually. We got a new manager. And he was young, thrust in, kind of out of the BBC corporate pod of the time. And I kept passing him in the corridor and he says, oh, I'll listen soon. I said, have you listened? And he said, no, I'm going to listen soon. And I believe me, I hadn't listened actually. I passed it in one day and he looked a little bit hesitant. And I said, have you listened? And he said, yeah. It wasn't what I expected. And because I was like 10 years older than him, or maybe even 20 years older than him, I don't know, he more or less expected some, he expected he'd die straight and stuff, you know. And so it became part of... He wanted me to change programmes. He wanted me to do an hour or something. Basically, he was cutting the show. But the big mistake he made was he also wanted to cut church news. We became a core celebre along with the church programme. So the Bishop of Blackburn thought this was terrible. And for me, I got some people, supporters, like the music industry, biz at that time, that indie biz, fantastic. John Peel, people like Laurie, who does the BBC show, Laurie Taylor, is it? He did something on race, mentions on radio. And then this guy wrote a piece in The Independent about us that appeared on the same day that the BBC board met in Manchester. And On The Wire had actually finished. We'd done Our Last On The Wire on the Sunday. And the manager called to the BBC board and told them... keep on the wire because it was and there was a press release issued saying it was a unique BBC product. They also had to keep the kind of church programme. And so we actually did our last programme on the Sunday and then we came back the following week. So it was BBC board who took the decision to keep on the wire. So, you know, you can't argue with that, can you, really? board took the decision. The following one was just like a few years ago but this was in the move really that the pressure, general pressure on. on BBC budgets and I think there was really a lot of pressure on managers to do away with music programmes. The manager here kept to his great credit, he did a bit of juggling here and there but he didn't get rid of any of the specialist music programmes because we've got quite a few unusually, you know, we've got a folk programme, we've got a blues programme, So there's quite a few different specialists, and we are specialists, of course. I don't know how we are going to describe it. Does it matter when it's broadcast? I mean, obviously you go now, it's midnight till 2am on a Saturday night, Sunday morning. Would you like a more accessible time slot, or has that kind of gone by the wayside now? To be realistic, it has gone by the wayside. If we go back right to... When we first went out, we went out on a Sunday afternoon between two and five on FM only. Now, that's a dream time for radio, you know, because basically what do people do on Sunday? I mean, our kind of target audience, and I hesitate to use the expression, but... At that time. Lest you be pressed to explain what that is. Whatever it is, but generally people. You know, they've gone out to a club night before or they've stayed up late on Saturday night, you know, and on Sunday it's a relaxing day, isn't it? So they're not going to do a lot. They might go down and do a bit of shopping, like more now than it used to be, I suppose. But people just chilled out on Sunday, didn't they? And that's what people loved about the show. There's something to it. They never expected it. And also a mate of mine, Gary Hickson, used to run a show directly after On The Wire called Big Beat. And he carried on with a lot of dance music as well. So it was like five hours of totally rocking radio. It was unbelievable. We would never go back to that in terms of live radio because football's changed, hasn't it, since then? All football's on a Sunday afternoon now, isn't it? So there's so many things changed, but also what's changed is the internet and it's kind of unleashed a lot of broadcasting. So the key is now people getting to know... the URL is rather than what time we're on, you know, so I don't think they listen live to us anymore, you know, really. I think it's mostly via the net. How do you feel about the state of underground radio in Britain at the moment? Online has obviously, I don't know how much you know about this, but kind of revolutionised things, I suppose. NTS, Reform Radio in Manchester, KMAH in Leeds. There are now a wealth of online stations. Are you aware of that? Do you think it's a good thing? Is there still something special about there being a... a BBC show on at a fixed time every week on radio that people don't need to listen to online or do you see a little distinction between the two channels really? I don't know what we actually bring to that party I mean I know there's a lot of internet radio and it doesn't have to be like in Bradford or where I've got a mate who does a good show Or Resonance, where there's a fantastic show done by a mate of mine who features Zoe Lucky Cat. She's fantastic. But I also listen to WFMU. If I had a radio station, that's where it would be. WFMU, I'd have that on all day. And residence is great. So there's so many. It doesn't have to be in this country. It's anywhere. It doesn't matter. It no longer matters. If you're local, then by and large, you're going to listen to a local radio station to find out what the weather's like on your next street, aren't you? Whatever. Usually I just look out the window. You know, everybody's a DJ now, aren't they? I think the worst thing that's happened is... over the years actually is celebrity DJs I'd shoot them all I get because people are like just ordinary punters like me and you you know we like our record we try to develop over the years you know we're not rock stars you know we're not actors we're not whatever it is cricketers you know whatever you know in the public eye but all these people are coming on Celebrity DJs, you know, and they get gigs, don't they? They get live gigs, they get gigs on radio. I mean, God love him, you know, Jovis Cocker, you know, he's a nice chap, but why shouldn't he be there? And Guy Garvey is another one, you know. For every Guy Garvey, you've got a thousand people who love to have a radio gig, who've got as good a radio taste as he's got, but they can't do it So that's my main bugbear. I think good luck to all those at the radio station where people are actually doing what they can do. Say good luck to them. We need to get rid of all these. celebrity DJs on big stations, you know, like Six Music and all those kind of, all those stations. That's my view. Do you consider that you have a distinctive style? I'll describe what I think is attractive about it and then you can disagree or agree. This is going into psychoanalysis. No, no, not at all. Not at all. It's intimate. I think you wear your music knowledge lightly. I think a lot of specialist inverted commas music shows often the presenters want to download a lot of information, a lot of catalogue numbers, a lot of background info, almost to prove their cred in that field. You take a very different approach. Half the time you're struggling to remember things and generally it's about listen to this piece of music and the detail will sort itself out. There's that aspect of it which I think is kind of welcoming. It's not off-putting to new listeners. And also your interaction with Fanny particularly, it is like two blokes nattering in the pub about what they've seen on telly and what they've seen at the pictures. There's no sense of alienating Kool around it. It very much is either deliberately or accidentally about music enthusiasts sharing good music. Were you aware of that, or is that just naturally how you would present yourself? It's naturally how I prevent myself. I become aware of it over time. So it's only when I become self-conscious do I make mistakes or go to bloopers and what have you. People say there's this thing in radio like you're just talking to one person. And I think it's difficult to learn some tricks of the trade whereby you just actually do that. If I listen to myself back from shows in the 80s, then I've got to admit, I think, and I know you're usually your own worst critic, but I think I sound really gauche. unbearable really people used to tell me I was good then you know people no longer tell me I'm good you know so I think it might have been encouraging to me and so what it is Tony I'm afraid to say I can describe it in one short word a I've aged. So you've become increasingly downbeat as the years have gone by. Yeah. I have noticed, actually, over the past few years, I'm playing a lot more quieter music and more reflective music now than I was a few years ago. That's not to say... I think there's not a lot of good loud music out there, actually. Perhaps there should be more. I'm not talking kind of four-to-the-floor stuff, which you always get banging music, but what's the point of that? Well, maybe I just don't play it loud enough at home. Well, let's talk about your unusual, persistent enthusiasm for new music, then. So, firstly, one thing that has been the constant throughout the decades has been this love of reggae, in particular dub reggae. I saw you describe it somewhere as the original rebel music. Explain that appeal to me then, and explain why that kind of anchors what On The Wire is about. Yeah, I think that's central to reggae as well. I go back to something that Dennis Bavell, who's like top geezer, Dennis. I wish he had, if he had a radio show, I'd listen to Dennis Bavell. What a lovely guy. But he once said the first dub tune was Jimi Hendrix's Third Stone From The Sun, he said. I know what he's saying there. It's not just like the effects in it, but how it makes you feel. And I think one of the most disappointing eras was the whole era of psychedelia, because I don't think the music actually delivered the goods. in terms of the pure sonics of it. There's only a few that sound totally different, and partially, especially Electric Ladyland, Jim Hendrix was one of those who made it feel totally different. So when I first started hearing dub, it was almost like, hold on, this is what I should have been, this is the kind of stuff you should have been hearing previously, you know. The other thing about dub... For any reggae fan, it's not having a load of dub albums. It's knowing where the dubs originate from and being a familiarity with the original source music and how it's actually restructured, especially very sweet love tunes. Some of my favourite dubs are, talking about Dennis Bevel, some of the Lovers Rock stuff from the late 70s, early... early 80s by people like Dennis, my professor and Clem Boucher I think he's probably my favourite of the time where you get this kind of contrast between a very sweet edge which is taken usually by say guitar licks retained from the original mix or the vocals retained from the original and very open and kind of chasmic spaces. So it's very, very spacey music. Also, if you actually listen to live, if you go to Dub Kicks live, it's very, very physical music, much more than any, because of the separation of the sound. a much bigger impact on you bodily than say house or rock or any other kind of music so you feel like your spine moving in and out when you listen to a lot of dub I'm talking about the sound system because obviously you don't there's very few people playing dub live unless you're talking about Adrian Sherwood occasionally other people So those are some of the reflections on why I started to like W. I suppose the headline is, sonically, it's something I'd actually been looking for and missed. from what was promised in Psychedelia. You see the rebellion in it then as a lack of crowd-pleasing, an unapologetic music which follows its own path without recourse or regard. for spreading a populist enjoyment of it, really. It takes its own awkward path. Well, certainly it was largely playing to... Dubb was also largely playing to a fairly closed audience, wasn't it? I mean, you didn't get many people wandering into sound system gigs or many people wandering into blues dances, did you? You know, that's not what happened. And if you've heard it on radio, you can't hear it on radio, can you? I know I'm on radio and I play it through radio, but you've got to take it away and play it, you know, not on a tinny box, you know, not on a car radio. I suppose sound systems are a lot better now at home and in the car and whatever, and you can hear it a lot better than you used to be able to hear it back in the 70s. little transistors. So to some extent it was hidden, wasn't it? It was an outsider music. You know, you had to go and look for it. You had to go and find it. It wasn't put on a plate for you. You had to work a little bit harder to find it. And then you had to work a little bit harder to understand it. So to some extent, it was like a secret and a rebel music in that sense. It was outside, certainly outside the mainstream. Are those things you would have sought out in Northern England as a punter? I mean, obviously, there was quite a big sound system culture in Huddersfield, bizarrely, and Manchester to an extent, and also Liverpool. Did you hunt out those things? I didn't actually because I was aware and there wasn't much happening up here. In fact, funnily enough, one of the first times I came across... Caribbean music was I used to go to this pub in Barrow Ford which is near Nelson called the Georgian Dragon and I went upstairs once and they had a blue beat I'd never seen it they had a blue beat and I thought what the fuck's going on it was fantastic you know there were about 15 people in but these guys were like giving it some dance you know and I've only ever seen that on film ever since But no, I didn't have transport and I didn't have mates who were into the same kind of thing. So I trod a fairly lonely furrow. Apart from your friendship with Adrian Sherwood, though, I presume that blossomed around your shared love of dub, did it then? Well, it wasn't just dub. Dub was like a core, but discovery was the main thing. I think discovery is another key word, isn't it? Discovering new stuff. And Adrian was certainly up for that and doing that. I remember he went to, he was going to that, was it New Music? New Music Seminar, I think, in New York. And he says to me, Steve, can you do me a hip-hop tape? Because I need to understand what's happening. So I did him a hip-hop tape before he went and did all notes on it so he could bullshit his way through. And that's where he met Tom Silverman and Keith LeBlanc, who are just a Malcolm X. That's how it happened. And then after that, it was all like the sampling, the sampling thing, you know, because Adrian Wells... was obviously one of the first people who was doing samples, or as we used to call it then, we used to call it capture rather than samples. By abusing technology, that's another thing, abuse of technology in music is what's moved music forward over the years. And it's not just like technology in terms of gear. It's instrumentation. It's abuse of the instrumentation, isn't it? I mean, that's classic. A blues musician, a blues musician, slide guitar, what's that? if it didn't like abuse of technology. Yeah. So there was something very new about what TACED were doing and what Adrian was doing that you were excited by fundamentally. Well, yeah. It sonically was unlike anything else that was happening at the time, wasn't it? Yeah. In its kind of industrial edge, but also that kind of cavernous dub mass to it. Well, what was great is I wasn't consuming that. I was almost like part of it. because I was, like, naming stuff and I was bringing them samples and I was suggesting stuff to do in the studio and what have you. I was there at, like, I mean, I was there when Adrian, like, mixed Wrong Name, Wrong Number or Yaw Yaw Bastards by Mark Stewart, which is the most brutal piece of, like, dance music ever recorded, you know, still, to this day. And a number of like Ketelbank's first album was when he mixed that and a lot of the stuff through the 80s. So I was kind of part of that. So that came about how then? So Adrian was what, a fan of your work? No, no, no, no. Or you kind of approached him to come and be on the show? No, what happened is I come across one of his first albums, one of his albums on 4D rhythms, I think it was, which is a precursor to On You Sound. And I was doing interviews then when I did my other shows, because I had thousands of interviews with people who were happening at the time. But I was really like this Creation Rebel album. And I think it was Starship Africa, actually. He had an office on Wimble Street. I rang him up. I said, can we do an interview? So I did an interview with him over the phone. This was like in 1979, 1980, something like that. And then went to meet him. And I met him and Kishi, his wife at the time. We became friends, really, after that. And I used to stay with him when he'd go to London. And I used to go to London on work a lot of the time, but rather than having a hotel, I just used to sleep at Southern Studios when Adrian used to record. overnight and do mixing overnight down at Southern Studios. So that was as close as you came to fulfilling your dreams of being a musician then, basically. Being around that and having some input creatively into it was your moment. That's right. Not so much these days, because it's a bit more difficult these days, but a lot of samples for Dub Syndicate. and named all the Little X albums and a lot of samples for Little X, which is like the blues dub kind of thing, Skip McDonald. So I've continued the relationship right through. I mean, he introduced Adrian to Lee Perry as well to do those, because he was working with my professor and all the profs, great, you know, it wasn't right. for what Lee needed to collect, come back and do something modern, you know. And that was like a time boom album. So, yeah, I was a lot more kind of active. So you maintained that relationship on a, as you say, a kind of active creative level then up until the present day, basically. Yeah, he keeps asking me to go down and play a gig down in Ramsgate at Shantytown. Me, at my age, you know, take a few tunes down there. Well, you say that about your age. That was another thing on the website. It was that pledge to age disgracefully, which hopefully you feel you are fulfilling. Do you ever reflect on how... unusual it is for a man at 68 years old to be listening to kind of new bass and dubstep records and to be playing them on the radio and still to have that enthusiasm and has that enthusiasm for new music has it waned at times and has it come back or has it been a very constant thing in your life? It's been rather constant and I just wonder about how sad it is for people to have their lives kind of closed off to music at a certain time because It's like, for most people, they have a music taste for a set period of time, don't they? And it's usually between around about 12, 13, through to about 24, or something like that, 25 maybe at the outside. And then they have that hermetically sealed. that's what they like forever, isn't it, really? They don't stray. And I think, you know, it's like, well, you don't do that with the stuff, do you? You know, if you think about music and compare it to other elements of the arts, say visual arts, you don't stop looking at paintings because, you know, after a certain... You know, I've stopped looking at painting, actually, Tony, after, you know, 1964, you know. I thought, not much done good after night. You know, it's stupid, isn't it? And it's the same for every other kind of artistic endeavour. You know, you've got to look at new stuff that's happening. And the proof of this is... one kind of fairly healthy area of the record business, shall we call it that? We probably can't anymore. But it's no reissues, you know, that people have never heard. They think, oh, it's fantastic. Have you heard this? Well, yeah, actually, I've heard it, you know. But, you know, people being able to discover stuff that they missed the first time around. And there seems to be a cycle of that. I think it's just about eight, between eight and nine. 10 years, you know, things are actually reissued every 10 years. And basically it's to cue into that kind of thing I was saying about people when they're interested in music. Yeah, exactly. So what's the sense is stopping listening to music? I mean, at home, me and my wife usually have Radio 3 on most of the day because that's the best music station for me. And then I might go and listen to some other stuff. or wherever in the car. It's music generally around, but I'm not tuning to WFMU in New Jersey just to see what kind of freaky things they're playing. I'm not doing that. I don't listen to a lot of other radio. I very rarely listen to any other music radio apart from Radio 3 and WFMU. Are you one of those music fans who wakes up in the night sometimes keenly aware that you won't live long enough to explore all the music that you would like to? Or have you kind of come to some kind of peace with this idea that you will end your days and you won't have explored? I think you were talking about Javanese. folk music as I was reading here you probably won't get to explore that in as much detail as you would like yeah well you get to a point don't you where well you probably are not at this stage yet Tony but you look at all the books on your shelves and you think and you look at all the records on the shelves but I see this as hold on you know my son Max is a bass player he's a really good player and he's into lots of different things, but basically he likes jazz, he likes funk, he could be in Herbie Hancock's bass player in 1973 and be happy, that's the kind of work. So he likes music, and so I've got a lot of stuff to hand on to him. But my grandson, Billy, he loves reggae. So he's coming along as well. So they're all coming along. So your family and friends don't regard you as some kind of freak then for having cast up this, inverted commas, childish interest then? No. They share your... They do, they all love music. And you touched on this briefly before, but you were in China, I think it was 2002 to 2011. So just to explain for people, you were working for the British Council out there. Was that in a musical role? Because you ended up in musical projects, didn't you? No, no, no. It wasn't in a musical role. I was working as a consultant on social media. policy. Right. Yeah. But they did quite a bit of project. One project I actually got involved. This is a kind of interesting story, a solitary story really for anybody who wants to run a project with an organisation. is this fellow was like stumbling around, he was the arts person, he was wondering what to do, you know, and I said, why don't you do A Sounds of Beijing? I said, there's this guy I know, Peter Kusaka did Sounds of London, it was great, you know, a great album, and it'd be a brilliant one for Beijing, given it's developing and it's changing. And I said, I'm sure I could get a couple of other people interested, like... David Toope would be interested to come and I've got another friend called Clive Bell who writes for the Y I'm sure he'd be interested he's a musician as well we could let And so he picked it up and started running with them. And, you know, give him credit, he ran with this and he got onto British Council in London. He invited Brian Eno and Eno said, that's another interview of this. There's loads, I tell you. And Robin Rambo, scanner. So they all set up, you know, and they ran it. And it was a fantastic project. Sounds of Beijing is a book and there's a CD and all that. kind of stuff. And they did the book, by which time it was like getting on with work. I mean, I saw them all when they came. I was with Brian a few, Brian Eno a few times and my old friend David Toop. It was really great, you know, it's good to be involved. They wrote the book and never even mentioned my name in it. I mean, the actual concept, you know, and then I said, I saw a draft and I said, what's this? You know, you haven't even mentioned... And if anybody reads this, Sounds of Beijing, I'm in the thanks. I mean, as it was, you know, it didn't, like, ruin my life, you know, but if you do need some credit, you're going to have to make sure you get credit. That's the advice I would give, because otherwise people will screw you over big style, won't they? So sometimes you have to be pushier than you might be by nature to make sure your role in these things is acknowledged. Yeah. And what's worse, there's a mate of mine who's like a great guy called Yan Jun, a music, he used to be a rock critic in Lanzhou in China and now he's like an experimental musician and what have you, poet and what have you, brilliant. He kind of led on doing the book and he hadn't realised and I said to him, Yan Jun, you know, he's a guy who did a dubstep gig. within 19, what is it? That's right. 2004 or 5 it was the first dubstep gig in China I was going to say we should explain here that whilst you were in China you continued to broadcast on the wire from China and also you were doing sporadic club gigs out there had it been in your mind in taking that job that it was an opportunity to get out and explore Chinese music and did you or well I mean I didn't know I was going to be able to continue on the wire but we did made it work. I used to record stuff and I used to do like half the show. And then I met a guy called Christian Verant who was a musician in a kind of tech house outfit of Hong Kong called FM3 who eventually they became two of them himself and a guy called Zhang Zhen. from Sichuan province, whose dad was a mouse clarinetist, by the way. It was fascinating. It could be a whole interview, I'll tell you. And Christian went on to do the Buddy Machine. FM3 went on to do the Buddy Machine, which I don't know if you've ever seen that. It sold millions all over the world. Check it out on Boomcat or something like that. Right. But anyway, he kind of introduced me to a lot of... Christian, because he'd been in China a long, long time, introduced me to a lot of what was actually going on in Beijing. So I did, like, a review in The Wire for the first kind of... ..like, bar music festival in Beijing for The Wire and then got interested and got to know quite a number of people. I kept getting tunes all the time. I started doing a few little gigs. here and there. Then I started bringing some mates over to China and getting them gigs in clubs and what have you in Beijing and Shanghai. But these were like people who still go, I mean, these were people like Steve Goodman, Code 9 primarily, but lots of other people. So you brokered Code 9's introduction to China? Yes. So the Sino Grime stuff then, were you again unacknowledged influence on that? I think I probably was because Martin at Keysound Records had a few samples from me, but he was already into it, Martin, I give him credit. I think Sino Grime prefigured my time in China, but I did a bit there, you know. Steve Goodman did sample a Lee Perry interview for one of his 10-inchers on Cone 9 10-inchers as well. So you're one of the hidden sample libraries for modern producers then. You are the go-to man when they need that out-of-the-way sample that won't be found in any off-the-peg sample packs then. I've done it selectively, Tony. I've done it selectively only. I don't want to be on demand supply. I mean, an obvious question in some ways, but I'm interested simply in what you are interested in at the moment. So what areas of music are you currently excited about and how regularly does that change? I mean, we've talked about enthusiasm waning or not. You say it doesn't, but presumably you play very little hip hop, for instance, now. Your taste must change over time. Are there certain fields that you particularly... passionate about at the moment? It's one area that is defined by genre these days and sub-genre, isn't it? Because I notice you go to, say, a great site and a great outlet for music, like Boomcat, run by a great guy who helped me a lot when I was in China because he sent me loads of tunes because I couldn't get hold of tunes otherwise, could I really? And you look at it and say, how am I going to browse this by artist label? Genre. You browse by genre. And I think a lot of the music I'm interested in at the moment is known as modern, sort of modern classic or listening or sometimes ambient, modern composition. A lot of that, and a lot of... I've always been interested in kind of drift and drone music, and I think it's actually a strand that's largely unrecognised drone, how much of an impact it's had over the years, you know, right from Velvet Underground, you know, picking up from... from Lamont Young and their influences right to the modern day. Lots of guitar bands are interested in it. So, modern composition, drone, drift. etc I'd love to be able to for people to point to me some really cool hip hop but generally I see it as the odd bit here and there rather than I'm always interested in when things come through as some kind of collective movement there's a few people doing things because there's always individuals doing something. Yeah. Because I was away from UK, I kind of missed out on grime in a way. I think the reason I missed out is because early on, Grime tended to be dominated by what I was concerned was kind of inferior, people with inferior rap skills. Yeah. And the whole kind of composition side of it hadn't picked up. And it's like much more advanced now. It's fantastic now, some of the stuff now. I mean, you couldn't even pigeonhole the music as grime, but it's called grime. And it's wonderful. A lot of good music now has resonances back into house, you know, that early techno. Certainly a lot of the grime has resonances back into early techno. But you wonder how much, you know, some of this music can... how much it is a genre or a sub-sub-genre like footwork, for instance, because I found it difficult, I found some of it great and others found it... really difficult to think, what is this? Is it something, is it that thing that's finally creeping up on me? I can't get my head around it, but then it's rescued by, you know, like Rashaad or something. I thought, that's great. You're not compelled to love everything, are you? No, I'm not. Simply because it's new and challenging. And the other thing is I've found, given that you're getting me to confess things, I can put a really good program together, I think. Very, very quickly. When I was trained to be a journalist, what you used to do, and I still love to be able to do this, but I can't afford it anymore. You used to get all the papers. And you'd get every paper. And you used to go through, and you used to have to do analysis in like half an hour about what the key themes were and blah, blah. You'd analyse the press. And I tried to carry that skill through into music and I can listen to stuff like that really, really quickly. I said, that's a lot of talk. And so I think I might be deceiving people by playing really cool tracks from albums that only got one good track on it. But then you think back and you think about some of the great albums and you think, well, it was a great album, but it only had four killer tunes on it, you know. That's an interesting point that you make there because that ability to choose the best, the essential tracks from those albums is a skill in itself. If you can do it quickly, all the better. However, particularly now, when we're all inundated with music. Do you feel that role as a guide and a curator is more important than ever? I feel there was a period just when everything took off online, there was this sense that, oh, this is brilliant, it's really democratic, we've all got access to everything. I feel your role is more important than ever now, though, precisely because we're inundated. Yeah, I think you've hit on a key thing for me, and that is one of access, because my... A long time ago, I used to think the real issue here that we've got is access. We haven't got access to anything. You know, I mean, when I was listening to country blues, started listening to country blues when I was in my teens, you know, I read about this stuff and I read about this stuff and I couldn't get it. I can't find it anywhere. And now you can get the most obscure blues singer and you can download it for nothing probably, you know. And so that's just the example for everything because everything's like that. And it's like I said before when I was talking about celebrity DJs, everybody's a DJ. Everybody can say, well, of course you can be a DJ. But basically you need... So I've changed my mind basically. Access isn't too much access is the issue now. because people can't actually begin to make proper judgments. Taste comes in. It's like you need... One thing I hate in expression is I don't like that. I don't like impressionism or I don't like expressionism or I don't like what one's school about. I just like what I know. No, you don't, because you don't know it. We need education. We need visual education and we need auditory, oral education as much as we need visual education. People don't know what they like because stuff's not been explained to them. They think it's a natural thing. I don't like that. I don't like it visually and I don't like that because they're not trained to actually understand it. I also say I don't like opera. I hate opera. It's horrible. The missus got into opera and she told me, I love, you know, there's like some operas now. I think people are very fearful, aren't they nowadays, of appearing pompous. People are very wary of presenting themselves as authorities, I think, in anything. Because it's felt that somehow there's a snobbery around that idea that you would be learning in a field and other people aren't. Particularly in something, particularly in the... popular arts like music. But again, it needs in a way, doesn't it, somebody with your knowledge and background in dub reggae, if I don't know anything about dub reggae, to come to you and say, right, where do I go? Because really those fields are unnavigable without somebody like yourself there to show some guidance, aren't they? I mean, I think that's what we're doing a little bit. We're sifting through a lot of nonsense. There's so much stuff out there, Tony. It's not a sea of stuff. It's like multiple oceans of... It's like David Toop said, oceans of sound. It's all like they're making a noise, isn't it? And swimming through that, you'd certainly get drowned, wouldn't you? So one thing I don't do is I very rarely ring anybody up and ask for music anymore. No, but I imagine that is probably unnecessary on many levels, isn't it? Well, I do it on the odd occasion, but I do buy tunes, because I think, I can't be arsed, actually trying to find where this person is. And I thought something the other day. I thought, I get this stuff from this label called Blackest Ever Black. Do you know? Oh, yeah. Yeah. And I think it's a really great label. I think they do some really interesting stuff, but it's not cohesive, you know. The only cohesion it's got is it's interesting music. Sure, yeah. And so I wrote to Kieran who sends me the stuff. I said, OK, I just have interest, Kieran, you know. Which of the radio stations play this stuff in the UK? He says... Oh, I don't know Steve, really. He said, none of them, it's just a few, you know, you asked me for something. Resonance plays it now and again, but I don't. I thought, what's happening? You know, and I'm thinking, well, who plays Pan? You know, another great label of the past. And I read a piece on them the other day on the net. This scene is not just... music is it fits into a lot of other kind of art forms as well and I think that's perhaps that's the way ahead for now especially with more excited things coming on visually not just looking at books you know becoming net and all kind of reality thing in about time you know what we're going to do you know we're going to have virtual reality creations of Robert Johnson, you know, performing in our living room. I mean, it's there, isn't it? It's going to happen, isn't it? Sadly, probably. In terms of this wider audience you have now online, what feedback do you get? And is that kind of key to maintaining your interest in all this? The sense that you are turning people on to things which otherwise they wouldn't have heard? Is it kind of its own reward in that whilst you've still got that enthusiasm, it's just natural to share new and interesting things? Yeah, I think, you know, getting some feedback is almost a by-product. We do it anyway, you know, because we know we're confident in the music that we're playing. It should be played. It's interesting, Jim did an interesting thing the other week. He did a 25-hour dub techno loop. And he got like, we just put it on Mixcloud. You know Mixcloud, you get a lot of numbers, but it's over time. He got like 1,500 people all from Germany listened to it within a week. It's like incredible. So these things happen, but we're not particularly concerned for approbation from... people but it's nice if it comes. So 40 years is that the aim? Have you put a number on it or is it a case of you'll do this till you drop and then you'll hand over the baton? Well I think we've got the sonic barricades up so it's who's going to assail these sonic barricades. I mean to be great wouldn't it if we're not in a situation where you know I've got like a bunch of 30 year olds or a bunch of 20 year olds or teenagers knocking on the door, oh we should be doing programmes like this, you know to some extent that used to be able to happen a little bit on the BBC but it doesn't anymore, I think maybe when programmes like On The Wire go they'll go and nobody else will come I mean, remember when Peel went, oh yeah, John's gone now, so we're going to do our best. Rob de Bank, what happened to him? You know, I mean, he didn't. So basically, what is, so this is a thing of mine really with John. They haven't done the best by him, really, because basically they're keeping him alive by other means, aren't they? By having John Peel days and stuff like that. Well, as you say, he's been canonised and the actual importance of what he did has been completely ignored. Yeah, exactly. So they have these John Peel days, John Peel at Glastonbury, blah, blah, blah, blah. John Peel would have preferred to get somebody who's like 25, who's got a totally open attitude to music, who can express themselves relatively okay, and let them play at 12 o'clock at night for two hours and let them grow. What's the problem? But no, we've got radio on urban, one extra, blah, blah, all this kind of six music, blah, blah. you know, it doesn't make any sense. Well, I was going to say, I mean, you know, for you, there'd probably be lots of music on one extra that you would like. Yeah. But then, you know, there is lots of music there that you don't like. And again, we're losing those spaces where there could be crossovers from those different cultural areas and, you know, people from different... backgrounds and classes and you know racial backgrounds geographically around the world which shows like yours and John's there was a leveling of that you know there's no hierarchy in terms of where people came from or what color they were or what the background was it was purely about the music they made and whether that was powerful and that was there was a progressive sense to that and as there still is with on the wiring. There's no demographic basically. No, there's no demographic. There is no demographic. How dangerous is that for you? There is no demographic. Well, more power to your elbow. Thanks very much, Tom. Thank you. Thank you. you
