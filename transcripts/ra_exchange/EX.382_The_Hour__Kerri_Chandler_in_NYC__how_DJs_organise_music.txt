You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour! This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hi, I'm Martha, producer of The Hour, RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. This month I'm here to bring you two stories. One from the US as Kerry Chandler hits the streets of New York, giving us a tour of the city and showing us the spots that have been vital to his career and influenced his recent DJ Kicks mix. And one from the UK as London DJ Moxie sets out to explore the ways in which DJs organise their music. You're listening to The Hour from Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome along. It's Moxie here. I'm a DJ based in London and some of you might know me from my radio show on NTS or the club night and label I run called On Loop. Generally speaking, I'm someone who's fairly organized, but when it comes to staying on top of my music downloads, preparing for radio and my weekend gigs, I find it overwhelming to remember everything I've downloaded and then where and how to organize it. I'm also someone who's a bit dyslexic, and visual pointers for me have always been key. This is something else I find really fascinating in the music industry. As a lot of my mates who are still on vinyl stay that way because, for example, they can't ever remember the name of a record. But if you ask them to describe the sleeve, they could tell you in exact detail. Originally, I started with records, then moved on to Serato. and now I'm on Rekordbox. I've tried a bunch of ways to organize my music, but still I feel like maybe there are other ways I could be doing it better. So for the next 30 minutes, I catch up with some of my DJ friends, including Avalon Emerson, B-Trates, Errol Alkin, and Bicep, who we kick off with first. It was actually Matt and Andy from Bicep who got me thinking about doing this podcast as they were the ones giving me a bunch of tips a few years back when I was starting to make the move onto Rekordbox. I'm with Bicep now. I'm in their studio that they've just moved into. They're currently in the stages of organizing. There's a lot of cables everywhere, but you guys are getting into it. You're labeling all your cables. Yeah, patch bass, all the madness. Getting us older in our night. Yeah. Yeah, it's looking good. You guys have been super busy touring so much with the album. So I suppose taking all of that into account. When you're so busy, you're working on your live show, you're trying to prepare for DJ shows. How do you guys go about organising your music? We buy records a lot still. And what we'll do is we'll buy a load of stuff off Discogs and record shops. We'll just let them sit in the corner studio and build and build and build and build. And once every month, once every two months, we do a ripping day. And we just rip absolutely everything, limit, compress it. fix them up and then get them into a big folder with all our new music and then we have a way of organising our music because there's two of us we used to sort of have you know folders that were like October but it was a total mess and you could someone would put in a load of techno tracks and you'd see something and it'd be like you know 15 minutes into your set and Andy'd be playing disco and then I'd accidentally play a techno promo and be like whoa fuck fuck fuck So we're now a lot more organised in the sense that we kind of like do it based on the kind of feeling of the music. I remember you mentioning before you might have like a Robert Johnson folder or a Panorama bar folder specifically. Kind of feelings and themes and the Robert Johnson folder isn't actually for Robert Johnson. It's more what we think of when we think of Robert Johnson. So you think of this sort of like 10 minute sort of like really like emotive sort of like, you know, kind of Gert Janssen-y tracks and kind of can go on and, you know, really nice sort of like when the sun's coming up. And so that will be put down into like a Robert Johnson folder, but it might also go into our like warmups. synth folder so it's like kind of way of like it just seems really organized so you guys obviously you share everything but how how are you doing that do you have a link dropbox folder do you do it via itunes if you're constantly putting stuff back and forth everything goes onto this computer studio computer And from that, we put everything in Rekordbox and then we sync it to USBs. So all the folders. Basically, we have it all in iTunes. That's where we put all our playlists. And then from that, we sync certain folders to our USBs for certain nights. By the way, there are probably about 15 of our USBs floating around the UK at the minute. How many have you lost? Oh, like, I mean, it's one a month, one or two a month. But we also, like, the album, like, so many of the album demos were lost a year before the album. I lost the whole album with, I didn't pan around for it, I just didn't even mention it. It's like, with the album stuff, we don't label it, anything to do with iSeph. We give them, like, weird names. I had the Ab I just didn't even think about it. Oh, God. Have you had that before going and playing a set? Because I remember Fort Rameau telling me a story how he has the same stick, but he'll have six of them and he'll carry them around the same with him because he's dropped them on the floor, like through a crack in the floor just before he's about to go on. We even have the record box, our whole record box. taken offline in a zip folder available on Dropbox so if we did lose them all on tour we could just go and buy USB and quickly get them. Like I mean that last tour in Korea we only had one USB left. By the end. By the end. And we weren't even DJing that much and we were just playing live. How do you... How do you familiarise yourself though? Because I get so overwhelmed with the amount of digital stuff. So when I'm downloading music and I'm putting it into folders, I'm like, okay, I'm going to play this or yeah, I'm going to potentially play that. And if I haven't had a chance to maybe go through on the CDJs or like maybe look in the back end of Rekordbox, when I go to play a gig, sometimes I'm just thinking, oh, I can't remember how that wait a minute or if you haven't got the new CDJs where you can properly you know like scroll through super quick like do you ever think oh maybe I'm not going to play that actually because I haven't had time to get used to it sometimes like I'll listen through tracks when Matt's playing one so I'll have it you know I'll have four CD decks and one I'll be playing the tune I want to know how it ends be like okay this ends in beats what's that end like yeah a lot of a lot of little parts so i'll take like four tunes that i kind of know or i've added in that week and then matt will take the new ones he's done or he'll advise me he'll be like oh no this one ends in b so this one ends and like you're not going to mix that one into that that's not going to work yeah i suppose it is definitely handy having two because in that sense two people djing is very difficult to get It can be a disaster very often because there's just two people going different directions. We've kind of spent a lot of time trying to find a way. And definitely, we try to go one for one, usually. If we're really comfortable with we kind of know all the records, we're one for one. But certainly if we had a big promo dig. it'll be like you do five tracks and you do five tracks it's up to you to make sure your five work you know what i mean it's sort of like and there'll definitely be times we're like oh no that clanged or you know yeah yeah yeah like yeah that one turned into techno track it still happens but i think definitely it happens less now i mean again kind of trying to break down like having all that variation but then having those sort of three folders that we kind of get to know really well every month, then that kind of like definitely means that whilst you may have like, you know, 50 gig of music, you actually are only dealing with like one. Yeah. I'm like, yeah, let's talk about it. Let's get into it. Let me show you my playlist, girl. Let's check it out. Up next, we have the queen of technical skills, Avalon Emerson. We played together not too long ago and got deep on how she organises her music. I wanted to know more about the process after she imports a track on her computer to actually playing it out. Yeah, say I have an AIFF that I want to play and import. I have like a kind of a two stage, like an inbox that I throw everything into and so that I can... go through that when I'm on the plane or wherever. And then I dump everything into a DJ library folder and then import that into Rekordbox. And I guess the main two ways that when I'm DJing, I browse my USBs is through a per night gig playlist. And then through my other kind of like browsing tree based on styles, functions, I have like a new folder that splits everything up based from when, at what point did I import it into Rekordbox. Because there are many different levels to when you were telling me about how you break everything up. I definitely haven't found the correct way, and so I kind of use a varyingly weighted, multiple ways of going at things. Still haven't found the perfect thing, obviously. I'm surprised you say that because I was really impressed with how organized you were. And even just going back to your desktop, the way that you have everything is linked on Dropbox, right? And then you have that backed up. That's right. Just in case there's any problems. Which is so smart. That single DJ library folder is all on Dropbox. So if somebody, you know, rips my laptop out of my hands or, you know, my studio computer completely blows up, then I still have all of the actual files. And then every so often in Rekordbox, I export the library so that I can. import the entire taxonomy of the catalogue into any random computer. Yeah, it's such a good idea. I think I definitely need to start doing stuff like that rather than just walking around with one USB stick. The thing that I was really interested by, and I'm still sort of trying to get my head around as well, is that... intelligent playlists and how you break up your tracks so that every track you import you put tags on right so you'd say you sort of work out exactly where you want it to go like house music or acid or techno or something a bit more variable than that Yeah, that's what I attempt to do because before I had just normal playlists that I would like manually drag things into. After a while, I would kind of forget either what the signifiers were for those playlists or I would forget about the playlists entirely. And so they would kind of like mutate and change meaning and it would be more and more useless to me. And so... Now what I do is I just listen to a song and then I qualify it based on these like tags that I have created myself. And a song can be multiple of these tags and they're not like mutually exclusive. Like something can be breaky and acidy and techno. And based on all these things that I am tagging with, then there are intelligent playlists that are different combinations of all of those tags. And then basically it's just really easy for me. It's like a low... cost of energy when I can like import something and then be like is this a techno-y song is this a break-y song is this an acid song and so I just click and like tag it based on what it is to me and then um and then it flies into the intelligent playlist The new Mark II XDJs and the new CDJs, they have these tag filtering things too, which is really cool. And they basically, you can create these intelligent playlists, like kind of what I create, but on the fly. Check a bunch of check marks based on your record box, my tags, that thing, and then it'll filter out everything that you have. You're setting up a bunch of like Boolean rules, essentially like logic rules, and then everything that fits those rules will show up in your thing. So that's pretty cool on the brand, on the super new ones. This is what I mean, Avalon. You're so tech. You know so many different levels. I just really love machines. And I think that this technology, it's like these CDJs are so expensive. It's like they must be doing some shit. Sorry for cursing, but they must be doing some valuable stuff. Might as well learn what it is. You use the CDJs like they're an instrument. The way that I was watching you when you were doing it, looping stuff up, dropping it on the beat, bringing things in and out. I used to make so many edits, and I still do, but you can kind of do all of that stuff on CDJs now. And yeah, just be more precise about what you want to do with the parts of the song that you want. And yeah, setting up hot cues with different portions of the song. And yeah, you can, you know, you kind of can. cheesy. I feel like people have been using that dumb catchphrase of like, you can make a re you can remix your tracks live with this new DJ gear. Like you kind of can now actually. And yeah, it's fun. It's fun to do. So I do like that doing that. Someone who's contributed massively to the music scene as we know it is Errol Alkin. He's been DJing in clubs way before dance music was seen as something popular. As a mainstay of the industry, I wanted to hear how Errol's developed with music as it's become digitalised. and how he organises his records. Hi Errol. Hi. Hi. Thanks so much for welcoming us into your home studio here. No problem. Currently surrounded by loads of records, loads of magazines, CDs. There's a lot of stuff in here. I think it's fair to say you've got a pretty extensive archive. I mean, it seems that there is some kind of system going on here. Yeah, yeah, there is a system. Vinyl-wise, it's kind of grouped into how I would term music's genre, or perhaps even like a time period of when records, or I would associate a time with those records. Here is a lot of the alternative indie guitar music, a lot of 80s records above it. discos over there there's a lot of kind of unofficial re-edit style 12s all kind of grouped together from a particular era but there is also a similar type of record from a different era over there so I know where everything is if I was to kind of tell or ask someone to find something for me I could probably give them pretty basic instructions and they might be able to find them themselves as well. So it's not chaotic. There is a kind of order to it. There are more records than these as well, but some are in the attic and those are ones that I probably haven't had to kind of go towards for a while. But it's not to say that I wouldn't go through them now at all. Do you miss that element of pretty much solely playing out records? Because I know with you, with Trash and all your residencies that you had at that era. I suppose that's when DJs were really starting to become a thing, you know, it's like the sort of the DJ of the night. And I know that you would pretty much only play out records and actually and tapes, you were saying, I think. Yeah, really early on. I mean, this is going back to like 1993, perhaps. When I first started DJing, it was not just vinyl, but also CD. But also cassette as well, because, you know, back then being, you know, 17 years old, I couldn't afford, I couldn't afford to buy music all the time. So I was borrowing records from the library and recording them onto. Oh, really? Okay. Used to go to like Archway Library or Islington Library. Since Rekordbox happened, I've kind of gone fully towards that. played vinyl sporadically after that and then only in a full set recently where I went back to back with Boyz Noize at one of the residency nights where we just played vinyl only. I was slightly sceptical about... moving totally into a digital zone because I've always had a strong association with vinyl and sleeves and all those kind of things that would inspire you when you're playing. Going into something that felt far more regimented as Rekordbox, I was really kind of slightly intimidated even. You know, because I felt I was constantly peering into a machine. But then after you realize that once you have a proper understanding of it, you feel how liberating it is. I also use mixed in key as well. So I write all the, I write what key a track is in. But then doesn't that happen in Rekordbox already? It does. Rekordbox can write it in as to say if it's in like B flat or whatever, C sharp. But I use the Camelot system, which is the numerical with the AB system. So I write all that information in with Mixed in Key. Then from there, I kind of go through it twice again, listen back to those records just to make sure I'm not liking something for the wrong reasons, and then bring that into record box. And then usually there'll be like a crate, which will be the most, like the latest records that are coming into my system. But from there, it then gets siphoned off into specific. genres or however I would view a record genre wise that's my kind of intuitive sense as to what I'd be looking for the one thing I love when I'm DJing is is when you kind of feel that what I could do with right now is this type of record and then you can go into that folder and then automatically arrange it by key as well because I know I'll be playing in you know the key of E or something like that and then I can then find another record which if you can make that mix work will create a great moment on the floor, you know, so there's all those elements as well. And in terms of the visual element of record sleeves and being able to identify, you know, each record as soon as you see it, is that something that you've tried to pull over into Rekordbox? Is the artwork, you know, a lot of people import the artwork so that when they're skipping through, it makes it less overwhelming. Is that something that you've thought about writing notes to yourself as well? Yeah, I... At first I really thought the artwork would be a really big deal to have that inside of Rekordbox but it doesn't mean anything to me inside of Rekordbox that much. Outside of it... I'm still a huge fan of the whole culture of music and artwork and everything that goes with it. But I think now I'm kind of, you know, I kind of probably have more of an attachment with the music just broken down to its title and knowing what the music sounds like and what it evokes. key it's in what bpm it's in that information ahead of the artwork um but that's really come from disciplining myself to listening to a lot of the records that i play a lot to know them well Here's BBC Radio 1's B-Trates with how she made the move onto Rekordbox from Serato and her unique approach to colour coding. I'm not going to lie, I really don't miss the laptop. I don't miss having the laptop screen there. Like I'd be staring at a computer screen instead of engaging in the crowd more and you can kind of see where like certain beats line up and you would almost... rely on the visual aspects rather than your own ears. It was really nice to let go of the screen and kind of just take a step back. Although one thing I will say that I did quite like with Serato in terms of, you know, when you just forget. about a track I cannot remember what that track is but sometimes I would search function yeah with record books you really have to organize you should be like twiddling that thing forever trying to look for a record yeah that's one of my reoccurring nightmares is is doing that on a cdj and the other track running out Yeah. Like you're just forever looking for this one track that you can't find. Like I seriously still have the nightmare at least once a month. Like I think every DJ has that reoccurring nightmare that like the track's going to run out and then everyone is just in the audience like what is happening? Turn the music back on. I mean, actually, that did happen to me recently at Boiler Room. My first, my Boiler Room debut. Of course. I mean, the track didn't run out, but the music cut out and everyone was just staring me at like, like, turn it on. Like, what are you doing? Turn it on. Yeah. It was horrendous. Oh God, yeah, I really feel for you in that situation. So how did you make the move? When you were on Serato, you obviously, you had a way that you were organising all your music. And then when you moved it onto Rekordbox, did you do the same format? Did you switch stuff up? I mean, I was doing everything for my radio show as well, like preparing for the show and the mixes and stuff with Serato. I'd never used Rekordbox before, but I knew that I wanted to let go of the laptop aspect in a gig scenario. So I kind of moved everything over to Rekordbox at one time. And I think I do it quite similarly now, except how I had organized it before in Serato was using the colors. So color as an energy level. So if something was like a really high energy track, quite dark, quite heavy, it would be bright red. And then moving down from there would be like orange and yellow would be really fun records. Still pretty fast, still pretty high energy, but less banging, let's say. You know, there's like tougher techno and there's sort of the lighter music, more musical stuff. And then those would be like pink and purple. And then also kind of ranging with BPM, like the slower stuff would be like light blues and greens. Yeah. I don't do that as much anymore with record box because like. really I just I haven't found the time to like properly organize it which I'm hating myself for because I love being really anal like that and having everything super organized But now what I do in Rekordbox is I actually use the rating, the star rating function. So instead, it's the same thing. It's just instead of using the colors, I'm just using like either one star for low energy and five star for five energy. Rather than being like it's a one star, like that's a shit track or something. It's not. That's totally not like it. If it was a shit track, it wouldn't be in Rekordbox anyway. Yeah, exactly. Because I go through music every single week for radio, I have numerous folders of every week of new tracks that I bring in. Having a radio show keeps me so on top of new music. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I've found that's the only way that I kind of need to... to like label it like even if I'm finding old records I still bring it in for that week just to kind of know when I had discovered it or whatever and if I am playing it on the show then great but if it's just going in a DJ set it still goes in for that same week so In Rekordbox, they're all organized by week. They're also organized like the master, I call them the master folders, which are in Rekordbox already, but they're organized by maybe the time of the year. I think quarterly, I like to make a brand new house folder, for example, or like a brand new like techno folder and or like a brand new like opening DJ set folder. so that there's like certain moods that are all together. But I think that's pretty standard. I think a lot of DJs do that, just the genre folders and like... energy folders and then if I have played a set that I thought particularly went down well then I'll always look back at the history. I think that's a really nice function that it stores the history so you can see what kind of went down well and then bring it into its own folder and kind of mark it as like... whatever the gig was called, that was that star set. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I do that as well. Or those certain tracks went well together. You're like, oh, yes, I need to play this again and remember it. Back to Bicep in their studio. The way that you approach mixing with records and organizing, would you say that that transferred into the way that you play digital now? And do you still play records or do you just find it easier to keep everything organized in digital? Yeah, I think like when we were playing records, I think we'd have like a, we'd definitely have like a start of the night, end of the night. We'd definitely try and organize it. With two bags, remember? With a beginning bag and an end bag. so it was like and you'd do it together you'd go through it all together yeah we'd go through our records before we went away on tour and organise all the kind of warmer deeper sort of like dreamy stuff at the start and we'd have that also split into like a disco-y section and then a more hoist-y section and then the second bag was usually techno and it was quite it was a rough version of where we ended up going I mean like that was the Fridays and by the Sundays the record pack it's a Yeah, no sleeves. We used to actually bring like 20 empty sleeves. Just to get every time. Every time, just so we didn't. and actually leave them on the floor. Yeah, they always get ripped, don't they? Who came up with your system? Was it a joint? Very slowly, it was just made better and better. Yeah, I think it's like one of those things is like the last thing you want to do is organise your music on a Monday and it was just, we kind of forced ourselves to do it basically because it was becoming, we had so much to go through and we're just like, we need to start sectioning it off and It meant that you could always, you felt like you could always dip into some other stuff, but you can always go back to those core three things. I think the one, two, and three one came from doing these all night sets that were like two years. Yeah. Yeah. And then also we did like a whole tour of like seven hour sets. And like, you really like. You can really quickly wreck the vibe if you're starting to go too heavy two hours into a night. You need to be holding off to the fourth or fifth hour to start to light things up. And that required really understanding your whole music. I mean, XOI was probably one of the best things in terms of getting the grips with us DJing actually longer, because we really were. And we were doing that like an hour about. I see Warrington spending time on the three hours of warm-up. Like we could actually, every week it was like, oh, it's your turn to do warm-up or my turn. And we'd spend three hours getting like, you know, the right cool vibe. The warm-up's so important. I love it. We never really get to play that though. So it's like, it's kind of nice that that's... give us a chance to really dig into that area. I play a lot of stuff off the blog that is just like 100 BPM and you would never play almost anywhere unless it's like an empty room. XOI was amazing for that. the first hour was usually completely empty and it was just like just chilling out in your own bed yeah yeah yeah yeah it's like really fun you know they try and not go above like 115 until like one o'clock yeah people will be running up going yeah just wait just wait going at like you know 110 bpm it's like you're winning yeah If there's one thing I've taken away from speaking to everyone, it's the importance of archiving your music library and never underestimating the value of backing everything up. Thank you to Avalon Emerson, Bicep, B-Trates and Errol Alkin for taking the time to speak to me. I hope this has helped you guys as much as it has for me. final words of wisdom. Back up your shit. Back yourself up because you know that and I guess a tip would be to like not be afraid of it and it's possible probably what you want to do is possible and search online google your stuff and yeah just get out of the mindset of um if you're not djing vinyl you're not a real dj like i feel like i and many other people like had that hanging over their head for a long time and it's just like Once you can throw that behind you, like there's a world of new stuff that you can do with the DJ sets. You have to make it logical in your own head. But also it really does depend because it's kind of like because there's two of us playing every week, we had to find a kind of a solution. Approaching radio and a DJ set, I think it's important to keep them really separate. For example, with radio, like even the first hour of my show, because I'm coming off of... the back of another DJ. I'm coming off the back of Pete Tong. I always consider that first 30 minutes is like a little bit softer, a little bit slower, you know, kind of progresses throughout the three hours. With a DJ set, I think I always like to keep in mind the set should be a journey. Like it should be getting from one point to another and like trusting yourself to kind of to take it on your own journey that you would really enjoy. I would say honestly like all the records that you take out with you. Much of the time, you don't know what your set's going to be like until you walk into a room and you kind of gauge it. Don't feel that you have to have something on your key just because everyone else is playing it. Or don't feel that you have to take countless, countless records out with you. Just really be into what you've got. And that way, if you play something on instinct, you're not going to have that moment when you're playing a record and you're just thinking, you know what or anything like that. And I think a lot of what you do in a club, the success of it is probably achieved in your preparation beforehand. Thanks to Moxie and her pals for sharing some insight into the way DJs organise their music libraries. The latest DJ Kicks mix comes from Kerry Chandler, a revered DJ whose artistic identity is strongly linked to New Jersey and New York. The mix is based on the idea of taking a musical walking tour through these places from Kerry's point of view. Max Pearl met up with Kerry to do just that. bringing to life the route Kerry imagined when he conceived the mix. Kerry Chandler played his first DJ gig ever in a small city called East Orange, New Jersey, which is about an hour away from Manhattan. In fact, he was opening for his dad, who was the resident DJ at a disco called the Rally Racket Club, and he was only 13 years old. By the late 80s, he was making inroads to the New York scene. getting gigs at these huge nightclubs like Shelter and Sound Factory. Though he was younger than some of the early pioneers like Larry Levon or Frankie Knuckles, he even got to play at the Paradise Garage before it closed in 1987. So New York holds many of his fondest memories, from the recording studios where he used to work, to the record shops that he used to shop at, and the 24-hour cafes where they would stop for a coffee between one club and the next. Though he now lives most of the year in London, his new DJ Kicks mix is a tribute to these formative years he spent exploring Manhattan and its outer boroughs. It's supposed to feel like taking a walking tour through the Big Apple. So in keeping with the theme, I met up with Kerry on a rainy afternoon in Manhattan so we could visit some of his favorite spots from back in the day. We'll hear some of the tracks from the mix while seeing what sorts of memories pop up along the way. Thank you. Thank you. I am here in the financial district in downtown Manhattan, standing in front of Zucker's bagels and smoked fish, waiting for Kerry Chandler to hop out of a taxi so we can have a bagel, and then he's going to give me a walking tour of his personal Manhattan so we can get a better understanding of the ideas behind this new DJ Kicks mix. We're walking up to Hudson Street. We're in the financial district walking up to Tribeca. I'm here with Kerry Chandler. We're gonna go stand in front of the old shelter, which he's now telling me was actually the second edition of shelter, which was... One of the most famous nightclubs of the late 90s, early 2000s? Yeah, before it all came closing down because everyone wants to build housing, and this always seems to be the same thing. Noise, and people want to build apartments. So that's kind of what was the demise of a bit of it. But yeah, this is definitely old stomping grounds over here. We can take this one over here. Can you describe what this neighborhood was like when you were first coming out here? Well, New York was, what was it, Giuliani? Giuliani kind of cleaned up New York a bit. It became Disney rather than what it used to be. And it was just like, it was just pretty much raw. And it was just a place where, I mean, this side of town was kind of quiet, just looking at it. looking at all this stuff here now just seeing things that weren't here but um like i said they built it up and they uh made apartments out of everything looking at this stuff yeah You were saying when you used to come down here, it was basically just you were either going to a club or getting in a taxi. There was otherwise no reason to really be down here, right? Yeah, there was nothing here. I mean, it's just maybe some late-night eatery that opened up next door to the club. But, like, there was no real reason to be down here besides, like, you know, partying. It's like you would never know it was the same neighborhood. I'm walking through What is this? It's an animal hospital on the same street. It's like, what is this? It's all turned into a, wow, neighborhood. That's the best way to describe it. Somebody's neighborhood, maybe a little business on the street. But it looks like just a bunch of apartments you would never know. This was the same area. Yeah. It's absolutely kind of a... mind-numbing to see. And this is sort of like a nightlife district. There were a few different things down here, right? Oh, yeah. The whole street, pretty much. I mean, it was a lot of underground stuff going on in the street. And to see this, it's just like, wow. It's like they destroyed my entire... My entire, like... all my 20s are gone now. That's what this looks like. They just erased it or something. This whole area looks so different. Walking down here now, I'm seeing a cat, you know, a caterpillar land digger. They're ready to rip down some more things that were historic here or something. It's really, really strange. So you started DJing when you were like 15, which means by the time you were coming down here, were you already playing gigs or were you just coming to party and listen to music? I mean, I used to lie about my age a lot coming down here just to see things. But yeah, I've been DJing since I was actually 13. Here, I'll show you something fun. But my dad used to take me all over the place and my uncles because they were just party animals. I wasn't supposed to be in a lot of these clubs up late. And I don't know, but they just let me get away with it. And a few of these places, I could never go into the dance floor itself, but they could sneak me into the booth and I could stay there until it was time to go. So that was their kind of loophole. Let me see. I'll show you. Here we go. So you had to sneak into your own DJ gigs? Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. So that's me at 13. Can you describe this photo we're looking at, what's happening here? This is me playing at a club called Rally Racket and just warming up for my dad, and we did secondary parties. With that fresh 80s Adidas gear? Yeah, red Adidas shirt and big headphones that are probably as big as my head. When's the last time you rocked a party with your dad? My dad passed away. Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's fine. My dad passed away earlier this year, or last year, December. Not last year. ending beginning of this year ending of last year December and funny enough we were actually going to do another party together in February before he passed away he would he would you know we were like brothers more than like that was my dad he was only 18 years older than me so but he still DJed and he still did a lot of things I remember reading in another interview you were saying you would kind of surreptitiously mix your dad's records and he had a bike that made a loud noise so that every time he was coming you would hear the bike noise and you would put away the records. Oh yeah, I always hear him coming but he busted me. But thank God he busted me because I had no idea what would have happened if he didn't. That's what started me on the path of actually warming up for him because he was like, okay, show me you know, what you're doing. You think you're DJing? Get down from there. If you can DJ, then, you know, show me and I'll bring you to the club with me. And if you're not, I'm going to crucify you. So immediately, you know, I did everything I could. And he just looked like he had tears in his eyes. And he was just like, you know what, this weekend, we're just going to put you on a crate. I'm going to stand records and just hand them to you and see what you do. And I did, and that was it. And I was hooked ever since. You got the keys to the club. Yeah, I definitely did. And I always hated when my mother came to the club because she came to come and get me. I used to try to hide. So I'd run around the club and just like, oh God, she's coming. I want to stay. I feel like it must be kind of bittersweet because in a lot of ways New York has lost so many things but also right now the music scene is so healthy. You know what I mean? No, it is. I mean, in Brooklyn it definitely blew up again. I'm really surprised and happy. But it's one of those things where... If you would have told me that that would have been going as long as it did, it would have surprised me anyway. Because we were trying to create something out of nothing to begin with. We're coming up on the old shelter. These buildings are amazing. I mean, you don't see these... That's the reason they took them over was to make apartments out of them. It's just, I mean, honest to God, I don't even recognize it. The only reason you knew it was the shelter is because you could see the logo like it was a shelter, but that was just later. But if you knew where it was, it was just that. That was it. You walk up to the black doors, and you're going in. Yeah, it had that nuclear bomb shelter logo, right? Yeah, and that's kind of what it is. I'm curious to ask Merlin how he came up with that idea. Maybe that's what it was. Maybe some kind of original bomb shelter or something. I don't know. But I can definitely tell you that going up there, it looks like it was a loading dock. So we're walking up to what once was shelter. one of New York's most historic nightclubs. And it is now a... See, this is what I mean. They turned it into an apartment complex. you So can you tell me about some of your, you said it was like being home, like it was sort of family. So what I did was I went into the shelter, brought some of my gear. and EQ'd it exactly what the club was like. And I just made the song in the club, and that was one of my favorite things to do. So whenever you heard the Shelter song I made in the shelter, it sounded the best in the shelter. I love that the club had its own anthem. Oh yeah, that's what it was. Not that it was really funny. So later on they were like, well, we were starting Shelter Records. We want to put this out. I'm like, who's going to play a song about another club in another, you know, a song about another club in a club? That doesn't make any sense. I don't understand, but okay. And they put it out, and it did really, really well. And I was so surprised. So your first record was... Prior to that, you had produced for some vocalists, right? Like you were interning in studios, doing some production work. Yeah, I mean, a lot of it was just me DJing on the weekends and doing edits for myself to go play. But at that time, I was doing a lot of hip-hop stuff. And my girlfriend at the time, she passed away. She loved a lot of house music, and I had this thing called Get It Off. which was short for get it off my mind. And I made a lot of the songs and things after my life, after that. I found it so I could express myself making house music, doing it that way rather than anything else. And I just said, you know what, if I had to make a song, I'm never going to just make a song because of it. Every song I've ever made has a story about my life and life here. We're standing in front of Kim's video right now where Dennis and I used to go crate digging. And this place is like it had all of these black exploitation movies and whatever you want to find. Some really rare crazy stuff in here. And they used to have it so they had these bins. I don't know how, I mean there was thousands of everything in here. Records and collectibles and... And this was like our little hangout hideout kind of thing. We go in and you can get like, we'd back his car up like right here someplace. And we just go in and they had records for like a dollar a piece. And we just look at the really interesting ones and go, oh yeah, I don't know what this is. We don't have this. and just load the car up as much as we could. And, you know, we were in here like every time I happened to be home from a gig playing and just crate digging and just pulling them out and pulling them out. And you go out with your hands dirty. And they knew it. And they used to have wipes on the table so you could clean your hands up. and you just pack your records and go and they saw us every like every other week at least and our ritual was to sit here like at home once you got the records and just oh yeah that's cool that's cool and just mark all the records off and like stuff like we really loved and things that we can probably sample and um you know now look at this permanently closed apparently Dwayne Reed was here at one point, too. So it's really, really strange to see this. And I just Googled it just to see, and it's been closed for about 10 years now. I didn't realize. Wow. Yeah. Can you describe where we are? Like, just give us a little set the scene for us? Well, this is kind of one of my old hangouts. I mean, the Red Lion. We just just I can't even begin to tell you the stories of that place. Figured out where we were going next. There's another hangout around the corner called the Slaughtered Lamb. We used to go in and just have, they have every single beer or something on tap special around the corner from here. I almost want to go and just grab one. Just this whole street was just, especially in the summer, it's just a place we just like haunt. We just be here all the time. And this is definitely the store. It feels like someone just took away a part of my family. Anything I could really find that was really crazy, things I've never seen in my life were in this store. So to talk a little bit about the mix, you know, I was giving it a listen this morning. I noticed it's all old school disco funk. There was even like a Tila Rock, like 80s rap track. There's no, you know, there's no contemporary Deep House to speak of on there. So can you talk about why you decided to do that? Well, I thought that everybody already heard me mix house. And they probably wondered. DJ Kicks to me was always one of these things where you can get to really just show what you love. And these are the things I grew up with. And I wanted to make a record of what... or just a mix of what influenced me. And yeah, this is why we're walking through it now, because I really, this is what I experienced, and this is what I want other people to kind of be inspired by. If it inspired me, I hope it inspires somebody else to do the same. Yeah, for sure. Did a lot of feelings come up for you as you were picking those songs and mixing them and getting the mix ready? Oh yeah, absolutely. Especially the first one. Cool Out was one of my dad's favorite records. He'd start the club like that. At his, he would start with Cool Out or Killer Joe. Because his name was Joseph Chandler. So he would start with Cool Out or Killer Joe. And then the night would just start. So that's why I kind of picked that track. That's the beginning for me. So I figured it should be the beginning of the album. Yeah, there's that beautiful track, too, called New York City Streets. It opens with just the sound of rain and cars on the street. And I just thought it was so evocative of the city, you know? Yeah, I mean, that's just like what it is. It's like we just met at the shop, and it's just like, this is how it is. Let's just go for a little walk. Would you like a bagel? Let's talk, you know. And this is it I wanted to convey that in a big way. Like all these sounds you hear and people talking by and little things that happen, only in New York. Do you have any memories tied to any of those specific songs, apart from The Killer Joe? Every song on there has a specific memory for what it is. The song even right after it, When Will the Day Come, my uncle, which is my dad's brother. He's a DJ too, so that's one of those days when we were younger and I'd just go record and crate digging, like, oh, wow, look at this record, look what we found. And that was pretty much the record after that. And my uncle, same thing. I absolutely loved him. He's like the youngest. He's the boy in the family, so he's closer in my age. He's seven years older than me. Same thing. Instead of my uncle, it feels more like my brother. Is he still mixing? Yeah, my Uncle Arnold is still around, and he's a very, very interesting guy. But he lives in Atlanta right now. Well, coming into the park, I'm just noticing it's like a lot more trees. It's a little more open than this. You can see through the park a little bit better. But I'm on the other side of it. But my favorite part is going through and getting towards, well, the middle areas. Yeah, this is it here. Okay, we are now entering Washington Square Park. which, if you don't know, is one of the parks in downtown Manhattan that has the replica of the Arc de Triomphe, which is that big stone gateway. Usually there's a lot of salsa musicians here, skateboarders, rollerbladers. That was the other thing I used to do a lot of, skateboard through here. I used to have my longboard, but then I had my skateboards, and I used to go through Manhattan and just run all through here. And then we used to just trick out and jump stuff and do things all around here. But this whole section around here, this is where I used to sit and watch musicians and people used to just play and talk, talk mad and just do what they wanted to do. All of this. And there's such memories. There's so many memories. But this is where everybody came to be an artist, really. And I loved it. Especially the summertime. The summertime is the best. Absolute best. It's interesting. that you spotlighted on the mix were live acts, they were bands. Like these weren't DJs or people playing drum machines. necessarily, you know? So it's interesting what you said earlier about the fact that at Zanzibar there were a lot of vocal performances. That was a big part of it, you know? And you had to, like, everybody was waiting to see you perform. It was like you had to give your best performance of your life because it was like the Apollo of Newark. If you messed up there, there's no saving you. That's how that place was. It's like, it's exactly, there was no, it's like, okay, this is that record. Let's see how well you do it. No auto-tune, no dancers, none of that. You better perform that record better than it was on that record. Because if you deviated or you did something wrong, you'd know about it. Like in the first two bars, that's how Zanzibar was. It was like unforgiving and you get that stink eye. It was just like, it's and then everyone's going to be talking about it the next day. Oh, yeah, immediately. Your records might even come off the shelves. It's like it's not happening. But Tony was really spot on with what he picked and who he thought was going to be it. So Tony wasn't just the resident, but he booked all the acts to perform as well. Oh, yeah, pretty much. I mean, it's him and, I mean, it's the whole crew, but it was really Tony had the eye on everyone people in place where he knew who was going to do what and who had a sense of what he involved us all in his house. It was our thing. It was a Jersey sound. Here we are, King Street. Oh my God. So where is this thing at now? One block that way. I wanted to see the sign, the Larry... I think it's at the next intersection. Oh no! God, that can't be right. Please tell me that's wrong. Full demolition construction equipment. Fence full demolition of two-story structure using handheld equipment and partial... No way they're taking this building down. Really? Paradise Garage building to be knocked down. Oh my God, so that is it. Yeah. How are you going to make a street named after Larry and then you're going to knock the building? That's crazy. Absolutely, it's like wow. It's just you just took part of my life away Straight into my favor now There's no mistaking this thing called love Was given to us as a blessing Every morning when I wake I miss you I wish you were Here to take me in many ways Okay, we are now on West 4th Street, which is one of those little windy streets of lower Manhattan that doesn't really go with the grid. Not at all. Noisiest New York can be. Yeah, a lot of little bars. Here we go. Tic-tac-toe, exotic novelty sex shop. Whatever you need. Okay, so we are now entering the Slaughtered Lamb pub, which has an illustration of a bloody wolf's head on the facade. We're going to descend into the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb, where I think they've just put up all their Halloween decorations. Yeah, but you know, the funny part is, it might as well not have been Halloween. It could be any time of year, and it was always kind of like this. It's just Halloween is a little more elaborate, I suppose. Okay, so what do we got here? A couple skeletons? Pool table? Well, there's a skeleton in this cage. And the funny thing is they're saying they're getting set up for Halloween. This is always here. This is always here. This is nothing new. All of this stuff that's here, there's chains on the wall and all this stuff. It seems like it should be an S&M place or something, but it's absolutely just one of these old pubs they try to make up after. American werewolf in London. Right. And I mean all of this stuff, this isn't new. This is all of this stuff. I don't know what they said they were getting, what, put a pumpkin down maybe? Right. That's it. But otherwise it's always like this. I don't know. I want to say Slaughtered Lamb was probably one of my favorite places coming down here. I don't know. I can't say I like a bit of the dark or the macabre, but it definitely helps with being creative in an atmosphere kind of like that. Because it's very nostalgic for black and white, everything. We're just walking by Electric Ladyland, and it still blows my mind that... that Jimi Hendrix built this studio, but from what I understand, he's never used it. And where I found that information was out in the Jimi Hendrix Museum, the Jimi Hendrix Experience Museum, is when they told me that. I was like, you're kidding me. I said, he never used that studio, the one that's in New York. And they were like, no, never did. I was like, the studio's incredible. It blew my mind because it's such an amazing place. There was one other place called Baby Monster I used to use all the time too. It was vintage everything. Beautiful Neve board. And we used to do all the hip-hop stuff in there. It was so like, why are you using this room to do that? But it was one of these rock rooms. We thought it would be really cool because of... Rick Rubin, he told us, yeah, that's the one we should use. So we're like, yeah, let's just go do that one. Well, he was like a rock guy who converted to hip-hop, right? Yeah, but I mean, he was always a pioneer. But this comes back to that thing again, music is music. I always think there's just two types of music. music and there's bad music. All these genres. It's like, you enjoy it? Yeah? In case you're just going to hunt for it in a record store, then why bother with the genre if you know the artist? Right, of course. Thank you. Thank you. There's a new music seminar in New York, and it was over at the Marriott Marquis on the 8th floor. And that's actually where I kind of got my start from, my real licensing and starting Madhouse. I met Mel Vandali at the New Music Seminar, of all places, and I just licensed this song called My My Lover. And I was doing remixes and stuff for Atlantic and RCA, and just getting the rap stuff going with Warner. And the next thing I know, I told Mel, I said, you know what, I feel like starting a record label. And this is back in 1992. And he says, you should do it. Come on over to London, and I'll show you how it's done. And I said, what you can do for me here, funny enough, back on Hudson Street, is... run champion in the States. And we can, you know, we can have a relationship that way. And I said, that's great. I said, cool. I'll be over to London. And, you know, sure as hell. That's when I started it. And I went there, came back here, back downtown 161, met Linda. That was it. That's all she wrote. And here we are 25 years later. But the place I wanted to go to, I'm taking you to. That's where I met him, and that's just where we had drinks. The Revolving Bar. All right. All right. Yeah. This is where the new music seminar used to be, back in the 80s, early 90s. And every year we used to come, and it was a... Here we go. This is where we get on. Every year we used to come and meet on this floor and we'd meet every producer and every record label and everything that was happening. We'd meet so many people. I remember meeting Ice-T here once early on and Afrika Bambaataa and all these other people. And then what happened was it was just... They would talk about music and there were different events all over the city and different clubs. You could go to different studios and watch how they did things. I'm going to show you where my favorite part of this is. Now Hope is still here. They took it away and I think they put it back just recently because so many people complained about it. The revolving bar. And what it is, is like you go back there and you can see all of New York. Like all of Times Square. And this thing is set up like a turntable, so you're sitting in it, and you end up on the other side of the room after maybe five minutes. The whole bar spins. So it's like you're sitting in the turntable, so by the time you're drinking, you're like, whoa. This is crazy. How did I end up over there? It's slow enough so that you don't really notice it until you've done a 90 degree turn. Okay, so I just want to explain. We're like 24 floors above Times Square right now. We're looking out at all of the giant billboards. with the LED advertisements and the classic Coca-Cola ads and all that. The thing that we used to smoke is gone, but this is cool. What happened was... In this area here, there's a revolving bar. And this is where I used to come and just have fun drinks and sophisticated meetings all the time. And the New Music Seminar was here. So we'd make all our deals here. And you'd start one part of the room. This is the big turntable. This thing would spin. You see what this big thing is here? All of this would spin. And you'd have these chairs on wheels, and it would just keep moving. For like a good hour, you'd spin around maybe four times. Okay, so the structure of the building didn't spin, but the internal, the floor spun. Yeah, the floor was spinning. Wow. And it was so cool. And if you ever get a chance to come back, go to that floor and you'll get to see what it was. Because so many people complained when they took it out of here. that they put it back. Because it's incredible. It really is. And it's up higher now. It's a place called The View. But this was my view. And we used to come around and see all this stuff on the billboards and seeing the energy from the street and just like watching it. It was incredible. It still is. I mean, if you haven't been here. But higher up, it's probably even better. I'm going to have to come back. So we just rode the high-speed elevator here at the Marriott, which is this kind of like 60s space age, or even 50s, I don't know, but like a modernist space age elevator with the transparent, translucent walls. What do you think? Oh, that's always been my favorite every time I come here. That's the reason they probably have, like, you have to pick the floor you need to go to because we used to ride them all the time when we were, like, teenagers. But it's incredible. If you haven't been, go to the rooftop and definitely take the elevator all the way up and then bring it all the way down. Yeah, this is the spot. You got it straight from the man himself. Do you ever get Not really, no. Actually, no. I mean, I just, I'm always, everybody asks me what my favorite time period is. I still don't have one yet. So that's how I, maybe that's what's wrong with me. Because I really don't have a favorite time period. I have moments where it's just like, oh yeah, I enjoyed it, but it's not my favorite time period. I mean, you don't look back on it romantically, you know. Because I think a lot of people wear rose-tinted glasses when looking back at the 90s and they forget all the stuff that we want to forget about, you know. No, no, no, no. I never looked at it that way. I was always looking for the next thing. What's going to make it better? And maybe that's my reason I'm still so energetic about what I'm trying to do. I've never looked back and said, why don't we have that again? I'm like, what's next? To me, that's important. You know what's interesting about this mix that you're doing though? I feel like you're going to expose a lot of people from the younger generation to stuff they've never heard before. That's why I did it. I'm saying it in one way, like I don't get nostalgic, but I want them to understand the quality I was listening to. It's not a matter of like, oh, this is better than what you're playing now. This is more like... look at what this is, where I've come from, and why I create things the way I create them. And this is why, you know, I want you to have the same headspace I have and, you know, where I like to get my influences from. You know, these people, they're real musicians, and they're incredible people that I've actually aspired to be like. And, I mean, I got to work with a few people on that same thing, like Roy Ayers, for instance. And never in a million years would I ever think that I would even meet the man. But to actually know him and work with him, we call him Uncle Roy. He calls me the doctor. So it's like one of those fun things. Every time I see him, it's nothing but love with that man. And that's why I decided the same thing when I ended the album. I ended it with him because it's like going home. Thanks to Kerry and Max and thank you for listening. Next month's edition of The Hour will be our Year in Review podcast with a group of RA's editorial staff highlighting the year's key stories and their favourite music and artists from 2017. Thank you.
