Hello and welcome to Resonant Advises Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I am the tech editor at Resonant Advisor. Cynthia Crystal has been a low-key but stalwart presence in German dance music since the 1990s. By age 20, she'd released on Low Spirit, the label helmed by German rave icon West Bam. But it wasn't until about 2014 that Crystal started to receive international attention for her efforts. That's when she pitched a group of ambitious, up-and-coming producers on starting a contemporary house label called Bestamodus, whose rapid success led to a sprawling network of sub-labels and encouraged Crystal to go deep on improving her own production methods. She joined Elisa Stolman in the RA studio a few weeks ago in Berlin to talk about what she's learned from her decades as a DJ and what she was able to teach herself about songwriting and making music. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Cynthia is up next. ♪♪ ♪♪ So, hello, Cynthia. Hey, Elisa. As I often do, I'd like to start this interview just with your personal background and your history as a DJ and producer. So can you just tell me a little about how you got started in music? Yeah, so I lived back then close to Frankfurt in a town close to, I think Saarbrücken is the bigger town. And this is where I started shaping up my music taste, I think. I was like 14, 15 when I started. listening to music that's not pop music because my older cousin gave me always like his tapes from the music he liked and was obviously loads of stuff from like Frankfurt, Sven Fade and stuff like that. Yeah, and then I started buying records and I was really lucky in 1996 that one of my favorite record stores asked me to work there. The record store is called Hampti Records. It still exists in Saarbrücken. And yeah, I think I was always really lucky with stuff and being... at the right time, at the right place. And yeah, then I started DJing as well and from the record store. One day they asked me, oh, are you also playing music? I was like, yeah, a little bit at home and stuff. and they were like, yeah, we organized your first gig. And I was like, wow, are you serious? And I was like, wow, this is okay. I have to think about it. I was getting nervous. And it was, I think it was Carnival 1997 and I had to play from like six o'clock in the afternoon till... And it was really funny because the DJ after, he was sick. So I had to play like four hours at my first gig. and it was crazy. I think I was sweating so much, and first time on a big sound system and stuff. And I think I did quite well, because they asked me to be a resident there at the club, and I used to play on the small side floor, like all night long, from like midnight to five o'clock in the morning. And I think it was a pretty good school for me, because I started with very... deep stuff, went over electro, a little bit of techno to house and also a little bit of like early trance music and stuff. So I think it was a really good. school for me to learn how to build up a set and how to work a floor so to say and yeah and also in this club we had a lot of um how's it called we had a lot of guest DJs like Ellen Alien and Heiko Lauchs and Sven Fade and Chris Leving and all those names you know back in the days and then once there was a guy called Westbam he was from Berlin He saw me playing and he was like, wow, I have to book you. And I was like, yeah, sure. You know how it is. Never make deals in a club. And I was like, yeah, let's see if it's going to happen. And then two weeks later, they called me and they're like, yeah, come to Berlin and play. And I was like, yeah, cool. And yeah, this is how it all kind of started for me. And then I made a record for his label and started to play internationally and yeah that's pretty much the history. So growing up in Saarbrücken did you have a lot of exposure to dance music as a listener? You mentioned who was it was it your older brother you said? No, my older cousin. Older cousin. Okay, so, and he was listening to Sven Veit and stuff. So was it very common to come across dance music as a casual teenager, casual listener, someone learning about music? I mean, my parents, they've always been into music and I bought all these top 50 kind of records and you could even find old Steve Sir Curly stuff on there. And I was like, wow, this is really cool because it's like just about the rhythm and also the singing wasn't so aggressive like as in pop music and stuff. And then, of course, I mean, it was the heydays of electronic music, you know, like house music, techno and all that stuff started in the early 90s. And I was really lucky that in 1994, 1995, my cousin who was older, he was pretty much living in Frankfurt. There are Omen and all these, The Box and Dorian Gray and stuff. And he was bringing me loads of tapes and stuff. Also, we had some radio stations that played this kind of music because it was just... new and everyone was like really crazy about it so for me it was really the best time to grow up and have all these um yeah of course have my cousin like feeding me with this new kind of music and I mean Sven Fade back then he was playing all kinds of stuff he was playing also some pop music some latin stuff and house and techno just everything he liked and yeah so Back then, it was really easy for me to dive into this kind of stuff. Did a lot of teenagers go to raves as well? Yes, yes. I remember, I mean, back then I was, maybe it sounds funny, but I was horse riding and we were a group of like 10 girls. And when we were 16, we were always going out together. And it was just like, so cool. We were all in this kind of music. It was really nice to just go with a big group of girls. And we were like rave tourists, you know. We were based there. We went to Paris. It was only like two hours far from where I lived. And we went there and I saw a very young Honey Dijon playing there with DJ Wilde. And it's crazy. I just met Jennifer Cardini in the plane like the other week. girl, it's so funny. I saw you playing like 20 years ago and like, you know, Rex Club and even Smaggy and all these people. And it's still so cool to see they're still doing their thing, you know? And I was like, wow, cool. I was there like right at the start. And yeah, and also from there, we went to Kassel, we went to Frankfurt, we went to Stuttgart and all these cities that were full of clubs and like full of raves So I'd also like to ask about Humpty Records very quickly, which is the record store you mentioned where you worked, right? Were they a dance music store primarily? Yeah, so in Saarbrücken we had Humpty and on the other side there was a small branch of Hardwax where Prosumer worked and Murat Tepeli in Roga 23. And I was working for Humpty. that was a bigger chain they had different yeah different stores and like also Frankfurt also Stuttgart and stuff like that and we were specialized in dance music like house techno also some trance music and in our store there was another guy who was taking care of hip-hop that was also like a small section But I would say it was 90% dance music, just records. And were the other guys who worked there, well, I'm assuming they were other guys. Or the guys, of course, back then. Were they also all DJs as well? Yes, they were all DJs, especially the owner. He was or I mean, he's still one of the best techno DJs, like technically. And I think I learned a lot of a lot from him about technique, mixing and stuff like that. But they were so much older. I mean, I was 16, 17, 18 when I worked there and they were like. 33 and for me it was like oh my god they're so old oh my god you know and now I'm like also like over 30 I'm like what I'm so young you know it's just really funny so how does a 16 year old get hired at a record store that's a coveted job you know it's not easy to get yeah especially as I mean back then it was even worse with like women in electronic music but I think I was always like a really fun person to hang out with and always really open and stuff and one of the guys who was working there he He was always really, I don't want to say impressed, but he was like... he was always really happy to see me because obviously not a lot of girls were shopping there so they treated me like a princess when I when I was there like always giving me like the best records and check out this and did you hear about this and I was really open and thankfully they said hey we we need someone working there at the weekends and would you be open for doing it I mean they paid me in records um which was really good for me but um I think was just lucky and maybe it was just about personality and I thought okay She might be young, but she's very open and she already knows some bits. I mean, of course, I didn't know everything, but you learn a lot when you are in the store because you're listening to the latest music like every week. And I think that also really shaped my taste of music. It can be kind of fun to be the only girl in a group of guys sometimes, which we'll get back to later. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Before we get there, you mentioned you released with Low Spirit, which is WestBand's label. Yes. Can you tell us a little about your first releases and how you started making music? Yeah, so I started making music, I think I bought an MC-303, it was called like a groove box. It must have been 1998, 1999. And I had an Atari with Cubase 2.0 in black and white, I think. It was really funny. But back then we didn't have YouTube and all that stuff. None of my friends was really producing, so I bought some magazines where they kind of explained it a little bit and it was mostly like try and error. But I think I got some ideas together. And also in like 99, I finished school, so I was going back home to my hometown Berlin. and started to study. And here I met some other guys who were releasing on the label Low Spirit. And one of these guys, he was like, wow, so you're also making music. I was like, yeah, I'm doing it, but I could need some help, you know, because I'm just, I told everything myself. And you can get there, but it takes a long time. And he was like, don't worry, I have a friend. He's super good at engineering and stuff. We take your ideas. This friend was living in Munich. And so we went there. He had a proper studio. And he was pretty much taking my ideas and he was helping me engineering it. And I learned so much from that as well, how to use machines and instruments and stuff. Yeah, so this is how I really started getting... into producing music. But then of course, the more help I had, the more tips I got from other people, the better my own production skills got. And I think I made like three records there, three or four records there. Yeah. Did you notice a change in your bookings? Did that set off a busier touring schedule for you in that period? Yeah, definitely. I think I was then signed to the label and the label, I have to say, was... I don't want to say commercial, but it was a bit more accessible, I would say. Also, the label organized all these love parades and maydays in Dortmund. So, of course, they took me with them on tour. I was playing in Japan, I was playing in the Netherlands, a lot in Germany. And how old were you at this point? I was 19 or 20, something like this. Yeah. Really shy girl. Oh my God. So what happens next after you've done these releases? You're no longer releasing with loads. spirit so I'm guessing that how did you transition into the next phase of your career? Yeah so I think in 2003 the record sales broke in I think because there was Napster coming up the mp3 was getting bigger also the yeah this kind of music electronic music was was a little bit on the down so also I didn't feel really comfortable with the label anymore. So I left. And also I finished my studies. So I had my first job. I wanted to concentrate on that a little bit. And then I think in, when was that? I think I restarted it. Yes, I stopped in 2003, 2004. You stopped music altogether? No, I was still DJing, but I stopped a bit producing because I didn't really know what I wanted or where I wanted to go to with my music. Yeah, I think I restarted again in 2006 because I was starting... started throwing illegal parties with one of my best friends in Berlin and there I was like cool so now I have a new home you know I have something to work for so I really want to get back into music then I made a switch from like super old from the stone age kind of Cubase and my Atari so I bought a MacBook for three trillion euros and Logic yeah and then I was getting into Logic and trying that out. But then, of course, it took some time to translate my knowledge from Cubase into Logic and stuff. And I didn't really have some releases. I think I was releasing one track, but was also not really happy about it. But I think that was kind of the second start of my career because I was trying to get known in Berlin as a DJ or as a good DJ, I think. I was playing a lot here, then we were throwing those illegal parties here, which was so much fun. I'm thinking back to that time. Then also in 2009, I was part of Kind of Music for a little bit and they wanted to have some tracks from me. But also in 2009, I was pregnant, so I had my daughter. And I was still making music, you know, I was still playing. It's such a big part of my life, so I could never stop it. But it was just slowing a bit down. But still, I was, I think, kind of well respected in Berlin, was playing there. But then I think the whole thing really changed for me when, because my husband back then, he was using Ableton. And for me, I just knew it from another ex-boyfriend. He was using it for his live setup. I was like, yeah, this is only for playing live, you know, just not knowing what I'm talking about, of course. And then, yeah, my ex-husband, he had it. And I was like, yeah, let me just have a look. And I was like, wow, this is so cool because you can jam and you can get a result like so easily. And I was like, yeah, I'm going to try it out. So every time he was at work, my daughter was sleeping. working on some stuff and I think I'm coming from a really technical background so it was kind of easy to get into. Also these days you have loads of tutorials and stuff like that and it was so much fun and then a year later I met the boys from Best of Modus and that was actually the point when it really started for me and it was really like an eye-opening experience because we started the label Beste Modus and I was like wow so now I have really my own home where I can release my own music I can do whatever I want it's really something that it's worth working for. So and I think this is just when my career really, really picked up. Okay, cool. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna go back to a couple of these, the things you've talked about here. Because we've covered a lot of ground. Yeah, the first bit is you mentioned that you were studying and you had your first like real job that you want to focus more on. What were you studying? What did you end up working in? Yeah, so I studied software development. Also, funny thing again, as the only woman in my class. And then I had my first job. I was working for BlackBerry. I'm not sure if people know this. And yeah, I was doing some stuff for like servers for big companies. Was also working on some apps and stuff. And like, yeah, I was just doing like some software kind of stuff. So this is what you mean when you say you had some technical knowledge that could help the transition. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. In what ways? How did you notice that? Like you're just comfortable using a DAW and a computer and thinking in a mathematical way sort of? Yeah, when I'm thinking back, I think my dad bought his first computer in 1990. And he, yeah, I just remembered like it was yesterday. He was like, yeah, I think this thing with those computers and stuff, it's going to be really big. And I was like, yeah, maybe my dad's right. And he bought all these magazines with small software programs. And I had a C64, I think it was. very popular computer back then and I was using these programs and I was I mean I had no developer background of course but then I was like yeah what if I change this number let's see what's gonna happen and then they had some kind of I don't know, they had some kind of like, how do you call it? Just some animations were suddenly going backwards or was smaller and stuff like that. I was like, oh, this is really cool. So that was like the first time I really worked with computers and stuff. And my dad was always like, yeah, use it. And if you have questions, you can ask me. Then I had writing software where you could just like insert a text or write your own homework, for example, and stuff like that. So I was always really open with that. And yeah, my dad is a really technical person. He's an engineer. And also my sisters, they're really... I think it's just coming from our family. We were always really technically, my sister has a motorbike, she's like repairing it herself, for example, you know, we were always into this kind of stuff. And also my mom. She's a technical, how do you call it, a technical designer. I'm not sure if that's the right word. But yeah, we were always in all this like technical stuff. And my parents made sure I'm not scared of like technical things, you know. Were you already into coding and software development by the time you graduated high school and went to university? No, not at all. I was, I mean, I was also doing a lot of sports. So I had a horse and I was doing. It's not triathlon, but with five different things. I'm not sure. It's not five-athlon, but quadratlon, whatever. So yeah, it was pretty much triathlon, but with five different things. So I had a horse and I was doing loads of sports. And yeah, when I graduated at school, I had an extra course where they offered coding and I did it. And it was a lot of fun for me also. My teacher said I'm really good with thinking around corners, if that makes sense. And he asked me, what do you have planned after school? And I was like, I don't know, maybe do something with horses. you know, just like every girl, you know, just wasn't sure what to do. And he was like, no, no, no, I think you should do coding. And I was like, oh my God, no. Because I had in my head, like all the guys doing it had like long hair. They were really into heavy metal and stuff like that, which was true 80%, I think. But yeah, I think it was a really good advice and I'm still thankful for that. I just met him the other day when I visited my parents and he was like, yeah, are you still making music and coding? I was like, yeah, man. It was a really good advice. And yes, I was not into it, but he gave me this tip and I was like, okay, cool. Let's study then software development or see at least how far I can get with that. And I liked it. And it's, yeah, my friends always call me little Miss Independent. And with that job, you are super independent. You can work from like any place in the world. And it's in high demand, this job. So yeah, for me, it was really good to do this. Do you still work in coding or? No, I quit my job like in 2014. I'm still doing updates every year when I'm going kind of to school for like a week just to not lose the ground or not lose my skills because I mean now it's going really really well with my music stuff but you never know it could be in like three four five years no one wants to listen to me anymore my tracks suddenly get shit or whatever so It's always good to have something to fall back to. Totally. Yeah. So I'm happy to have this background, but I'm not doing it. But yeah, my old boss is like, yeah, whenever you want to come back, you know, we're here. Open arms. That's a nice thing to have. Yeah. It makes me a lot more relaxed, you know, because... With music, and also in general when you're self-employed, you have all these insecurities and stuff like that. But for me, it's a bit different because I know, okay, if everything really breaks down and I can't do it anymore or I get sick or something, it could also be, you know. It's really good to fall down on a proper job and that makes me really confident, also a bit more relaxing maybe than other people. Yeah, the precarity takes less of a toll on you, for sure. When you first started studying coding and working at BlackBerry, were you doing it thinking that this would be your main career and that DJing was sort of a hobby that you used to enrich your life? Yes, yes. For me, I never wanted to be like a full-time DJ. I just did it as a hobby and yeah, I like to do music and stuff, but I was always... Maybe also from my education, my parents always said, yeah, it's good to have something secure on the side and stuff like that. And I like coding. I like my team. So for me, it was more like having this job and then doing DJing on the side is fun. And also a lot of my other DJ friends, they did it, you know, although they were playing bigger gigs and stuff. We're working in graphic design or in record stores and stuff like that. So it was quite common to have like to rock like a normal job and then do DJing on the side. And yeah, so for me, it was just normal. And I thought, OK, that's it. I'm just going to do it until I find something else maybe or I don't know. You also mentioned that you moved to Berlin somewhere in this period. When did you move to Berlin and why? 1999. Yeah, because I'm from here and then for me it was quite... clear once I finish school I just go back home. So you also mentioned that after you moved to Berlin you started doing free parties or illegal parties or organizing your own parties can you tell us about those parties? Yeah I met one of my friends through coding and stuff like that and he was I think it started with his birthday party which got a bit out of control. in his flat in Friedrichshain. And suddenly we had like 300 people there and also a little visit from the police. Nice. But I think it wasn't too bad. 2004 but we thought it was really funny and we were like yeah let's throw parties cool so we mostly we squatted old places back then it was still possible to do that but so squatting places that were empty residential buildings or something like that office buildings yeah just whatever we could get like empty spaces and what parts of town did this normally happen uh east yeah yeah Yeah, because there were still so many abandoned places, empty houses and... And we were location scouting. Yeah, we were location scouting so much. And we found a lot of like really, really cool places like this empty coin making factory in at Janowitzbrücke behind the Chinese embassy, I think it is. That was really the best place we had. And we were doing like parties two or three times there. It was just like a shithole, to be honest. We had to put like a bar in, mattresses against the windows so no one could hear the sound and stuff like that. We made it soundproof and we got it. But this was like kind of, it wasn't a legal party. We tried to make it legal. So it belonged to the government. So we went there and we were like, yeah, we want to do an exhibition with a little bit of music in the background. And they're like, oh, yeah, that's a really good idea. Cool. You can have it. And we're like, yes, cool. Got it. And then I remember we lost electricity in the middle of the night. And I was responsible for the electricity because there was actually no electricity at all. But we got it from the neighbor house and the guys who installed the. electricity box they told me okay just in case you lose you lose it just press this button and it will be back on and I was like yeah of course it's not gonna happen you know but then in the middle of the night suddenly everything was dark black and people were screaming I was like shit okay how does it work again me running down to the cellar pressing whatever kind of button music went back on lights went back on for like two seconds everyone was screaming and then it went off again I was like oh no So press the other button and then everything was back and people were just like freaking out. It was so nice. It was such a nice party. And yeah, we've been throwing it for a couple of years. But then, yeah, it also got a bit harder to do this kind of stuff. And I also remember, I mean, we were always lucky. So the police came twice at eight o'clock in the morning when... everything was pretty much done you know we made our money we got our expenses back and stuff And once they took the mixer and of course it was me who had to pick it up because I was again the only girl in the crew. And they said, yeah, you just go there, you know, just like wear something nice and you will get it back. And I mean, police in Berlin is always really nice. And a lot of them, they're also going out. So they're like, OK, nothing broke. And OK, you made a party, whatever. Pay 50 euros, you get the mixer back. So Also, like the crew back then was a bit falling apart from like one guy getting married, the other one moving away, the other one starting a proper job. And yeah, so we stopped that. What kind of music were you playing there? It was really funny. So my best friend, he was more into punk music. So we had one punk floor, which was funny, and one floor for electronic music. And by the end of the night, we had the punk kids on the techno floor. And yeah, the techno kids, so to say, on the punk floor. And it was like all mixing up. It was also like the start of like electro clash, you know, when everything was like clashing and being mixed and stuff. And yeah, it was quite fun. Yeah, there was a little bit more of a pop disposition to electro clash, like more vocals and singing and traditional songwriting like that. Yeah, guitars as well. Okay, so what happened after the free party period once the crew had sort of disbanded? Yeah. I mean, I made kind of a name in Berlin as a DJ or like a well-experienced DJ. Also, I mean, some people said I was playing good music. So I played in like different clubs in Berlin. And yeah, it was close to 2009 then. And I was hanging out with the guys from Keine Musik. And they just started their project, Kind of Musik. And I said, yeah, it would be nice to have a girl on board. And we like you. We were hanging out and stuff. Why don't you want to be part of the crew? And I was like, yes, it's nice. But I was pregnant back then and also had a residency at a club called The Villa. And The Villa was run by the same guys who took over Stadtbad later. So I played there and yeah, I think people liked it. They booked me a lot. And yeah, then I had my daughter. So I was like, okay, kind of music. It's not going to happen right now. It's just going to concentrate on my daughter. And I think I can't spend too much time on like your project. That happened after the free party thing. When you got pregnant, were you worried that you wouldn't be able to have music as such a big part of your life anymore? Yeah, a little bit. I knew that I could never ever cut out music completely out of my life. But I was, of course, a little bit worried if I would still play gigs and stuff. But also my husband back then, he was working at the club where I had a residency at. So I knew we would both still be in like the electronic music scene. But I had friends and stuff. So, I mean, I knew, okay, let's just see what's going to happen. So if it's working out, I will still play. But if not, yeah, let's just go with the flow and see what's going to happen. I didn't want to make too many plans. But then, of course, I was also a bit scared that it's going to change my life completely and I don't have... my, I don't want to say my freedom or that I don't, that I'm not able to go out. It's also maybe, it sounds funny when I say I'm not able to go out anymore, but it sounds like I'm just like going on rave for like three days every weekend. No, but I mean, of course it's life changing. And I was a bit scared what's going to happen. But my daughter was right from the start so easy. So after three months, I had my first gig again. I was playing for two hours, then rushing home, of course. And so I was like, cool, I mean, I can combine it with the right organization. just combine it and do what I love. Yeah. Did people, what were people around you's reaction? Did they tell you, oh, you're not going to be able to do this or that, that sort of thing? Yeah, some of course did. But then some also said, if you ever need a babysitter or help, just let me know. And of course I had close friends, they were offering me this. And I was like, yeah, let's just see how it goes and what's going to happen. And yeah, I think it worked out really well. I think I'm also like quite a cool, relaxed person. So I was not just suddenly like drinking Latte Macchiato and Prenzlauer Berg, you know, and just only talk about my child. I think it was really chilled. And I feel like making music is such a big... part of my life and that makes me happy and I had this um yeah my mom always told me like yeah do what makes you happy that makes the kids happy so yeah so how did it you said you were doing gigs still a few months after she was born yes did it did it end up changing your schedule at all anyway did you have to sort of rebuild after that um I mean I was out of like playing for Yeah, pretty much nine, ten months, something like this. I mean, I stopped playing when I was like maybe four, five months pregnant because I was just too tired. And then after I took some time and then one of my friends, he was like, how are you doing? Would you like to do a gig? And then I just was like, yeah, I can try. I mean, you never try, you never know. I did the gig and it was quite fun, quite interesting. yeah but from there I started playing again I mean not every week but yeah just playing around in Berlin and sometimes I had a gig in Munich or whatever Cologne or something like this just like taking it easy I would say yeah did other people assume like oh well Cinti has a baby now so like we can't ask her like was it other people's perceptions of the impact the child would have in your life did that influence the gigs that you got no not really I mean once they saw me coming back and having the gig again they were like oh yeah so you play you want to play it party maybe and I was like okay if it's not like if my play time is not 7 till 10 I can definitely do it but Just give me an easy playtime. And we tried out, you know, and it was fine. So it wasn't too hard to convince people to get back? No. I mean, once they saw me being back, they're like, yeah, cool. She's back, you know, like, get her on. Okay. So now we're in about 2010, right? Okay. So can you get us from 2010 when your daughter was born? to about 2013-14 when you started Bessamotus because that's when you finished your last that's where we got in the history. Yeah that's the next chapter so to say yeah. I met the guys at the party I think it must have been in 2011 late 2011 early 2012 I think. yeah I was playing in Berlin stuff like that then I had a gig it was a really funny place I think it was this Jam Oh, yeah. I think it's more like a reggae kind of place. Yeah, it's an African cultural center or African diaspora cultural center or something like that. Yeah, something like this. Yeah. And one of my friends was throwing a party there with a really decent lineup and he wanted to have me playing there. I was like, yeah, cool, let's do it. So my playtime was funny from like eight o'clock in the morning to like 11 or something. And I didn't expect to be, and I didn't expect too much. Yeah, when I arrived, only a few people were left, maybe like 150, 200. I mean, that's quite much, maybe 150. And the guys from Bessamotus Day were there as well. And I started playing and I mean, I always played really groovy stuff. And the guys before me, they played a bit more like tech housey stuff. loads of like snare rolls and stuff like that. So I started with a really, really groovy track from like Oslo Records. Yeah. I think. Yeah, it was super groovy. And then, yeah, suddenly I was playing and suddenly this guy came up to me like asking me in English, oh, what's the name of this track? And I could hear from his accent that he was German. He was like, hey man, let's just talk German, you know. And he was like, oh, you're German too? Cool, yeah. So he has the track. And I told him the name of the track and he came up like two more times, I think. And that was like Steve-O from the crew. And after that, we had a really good chat. I met the rest of the crew, like Diego Krause, Ed Herbst. I think Albert Vogt wasn't there that day. Yeah, and some other friends, they were hanging out. And yeah, so I became first friends with Stefan, with Steven and Lieben. And also this was the time when Stadtbad, not opened. I mean, there were throwing parties before, but this was just the time when Stadtbad and wedding. started to have proper parties every week and I had a residency there because also my husband was working there at the door. Yeah, and I was playing at Stadtbad and I just put them on the guest list whenever I was playing. And so I met them several times. We were going out together. Also back then there was this really nice party called Submarine at Watergate on the Wednesday, where they just booked. Ron Wilson was throwing this party and Ron Wilson was inviting loads of people like Brother, he had Italo Johnson and all these kind of people who were playing this new kind of house music. And we were hanging out there and we became... friends and then because of the fact I was playing music they sent me their own tracks and I was like really blown away and I was like wow okay that's it so I have to do something with the guys and then I was like okay I have saved up so much money and I could either spend it in shoes or clothes or I could do something useful with it so I was okay let's just try starting a label and when I made this offer to the guys I think they were like they didn't know what to say they were like okay what do we have to do and I was like no worries I worked also for labels and stuff like that for a long time and we can I just handle everything you know and then yeah we had the first release and found our dream distributor also through Italo Johnson. So thank you for that. Would that be Diamonds and Pearls? Yeah, that was Diamonds and Pearls. Because we wanted to go with them and I was just sending a message and then they said, yeah, we're full, but just come around. And I was like, this sounds funny. I mean, we are full, but just come around. I mean, I'm a mom. I don't have time for like coffee, you know. Went there and then Richard Seepitzauer was opening the door and he was a good friend. I was like, man, I know this is coming from you. He was like, yeah, of course. So they said, okay, we just try. First record was 300 copies, I think, was sold out within 24 hours at the distributor. And we were like, wow, this is cool. Who was on the first record? Was that a split between the guys and the crew? Yes, we all wanted to happen on the release, of course, because we were hungry. We just wanted to get our tracks out. So it was Steven and Lieven, myself, Diego Krause, Ed Herbst, and we had another guy. Daniel Bejana, he was part of the crew when we started. But later on, he wasn't part of the crew anymore. He wanted to do something else. So we were five people on the first release. And I think we had a release party even at... Prince Charles back then, if I'm right. Yeah, so yeah, first release was like bomb. We got lots of requests, lots of new followers. And this is how it really started. And for the first time, I felt like being at home because suddenly I had my own baby and something that I thought it was really worth working my ass off for. Yeah. So you've already... described in like, when you explained how the label started that it was your idea, and you sort of brought it to the guys and you said, this is what we should do. You've already sort of illustrated a bit of your dynamic. But I'd like to get a little more into that. The guys that you do Best of Modus with are slightly younger, right? Yeah, a little bit younger. There are, I think the difference is five years, five or six years. Yeah. Okay. But it's enough that you're sort of the matriarch of the crew, not only because you're the only woman, but you seem like... I'm the boss. So how is it like working then with that kind of crew? What's your internal dynamic like? I mean, I'm the most experienced from working in record stores. Also, I was working for Sound Music a little bit when I studied. I worked for Undercover Music Group. That was one of the biggest, so to say, crew or how do you call it? collaboration of labels with like Chris Liebing's label, Monica Cruz's label, then loads of other labels from back then. And so I was very experienced working in this field. So I said, okay, guys, you don't have to worry about it. I have some money saved up. We're fine. I just organize everything, just give me the tracks and we're fine. And then... Was it easy for them to get with that program? No, I think for them it was easy because they said, okay, cool, she has like loads of experience. And they were just like new to the scene as well, you know. And they were kind of giving it into my hands. And also I'm more like a maker, I think. I mean, I'm thinking about things, but at the end of the day, I'm like, okay, you never try, you never know what I said before. And I was like, yeah, let's just do it. I mean, if the worst comes to the worst, I burned like, I mean, back then, how much did we spend? A thousand euros, a thousand five hundred, which would have hurt. But then on the other side. you get loads of experience from that so it was okay if it if the worst comes to the worst we burn some money but then at least we know better the next time but luckily it was going really really well and from there I was okay this was really cool let's do the next one and then so it seems like also that for them, it was a nice deal because they got a platform to start releasing their music because they hadn't really released music before this, right? No, I think they had like one or two tracks on more like digital labels. But yeah, they had friends who liked their music, but it was not like me who already had a little bit of a name in the Berlin scene. I mean, I have so many contacts and such a good network also from back in the days, you know. So for me, it was... I think it was a really, really good combination. So with me having the experience, having the contacts with the guys being amazing producers and Steve-O being our mastering. mastermind and yeah Jigo also being a good producer and so everyone brought something special in you know so that's why we worked so well in the crew in the crew yeah I guess I'm wondering like what what about um them when you met them and started started to get to know them what about them made you think okay these guys are the one instead of instead of saying I would like to start a label and put out your guys' music and it's going to be my label. Why did you decide these are the people that we're going to have a team effort here? I'm more like a team player, I would say. Of course, also in a group where it's very dynamic and where it's very... Democratic, someone has to have the last words. And as a woman, I love to have the last word. And yeah, for me, it was quite clear that we are a crew and that we decide democratically what's going to happen. weapon and but then at the end of the day I was always like okay now from my experience this is not cool let's do it this way and then they said okay cool yeah let's do it and what about them seemed special to you as well like what did they what did you get from your relationship with them in terms of like whether it would be knowledge about something technical or exposure to a different slightly different perspective in music or a general rejuvenation in your approach to your music career or so on like what was special about these guys I think for me, it's always about character and they absolutely killed it for me. You know, they're like amazing guys and friendly, supportive. And we had such a good time. And yeah, for me, it was like, wow, this is like the ones I want to work with. Also, the music was amazing. And they were, I don't want to say a bit lost, but I think I was the missing link to them. So I made the team complete. So just for that ride, you know, my stomach said, okay, this is the team, now do it. And I was doing it. Yeah, sometimes all a group of talented guys need is someone to... Organize it all. Yeah, yeah, true. Someone, yeah, they needed someone who's a bit like, okay, this is the way, let's do it like this. But you also have ended up releasing some of your own productions on Best of Modus and the surrounding labels that you've launched since. Yes. So you did get more into producing at this point in time, right? Yeah. Okay, so can you tell me about this sort of like second or third wind with getting into production? Yeah, so this is my third try. As I said, I was making the switch from Logic to Ableton, which opened a whole new horizon for me and a whole new door. So much easier to jam with Ableton and make your own tracks. And suddenly I had a goal. I had my own label where I could be free and release my own music. But still from... not doing it too much in the previous years, I had to get myself... skills back I also had to get my um my workflow back which was quite hard because I was also rocking like a normal job I was doing I had my baby of course but I tried to spend as much time as I could in producing yeah from there I think you can see a really nice progression from the tracks from my first track I had there which was called uh Chicago's New I think I mean, now when I listen to the track, I was like, okay, I would definitely not do the mixing like this. And also the drums sound a little bit like a wet fart. But I think it's good to see this progression. You know, this is something like every producer should really go through. Every producer who's making their own music. learn your skills, do your own stuff. It's so fucking satisfying. When you get better, just live in your studio, bring your computer on tour, stuff like that. Watch every tutorial, get every advice from friends you can get. That's really like the best advice I can give here. And then you can see that you're... The music is getting better, you know, you can see really like a progress from the really first tracks I made then, which were sounding, they were sounding okay, the ideas were good, but then... Of course, you could tell, okay, the drums could have had a bit more punch and then I should have used the saturator on the chords and stuff like that to make them a bit more crunchy and stuff. But yeah, when I look back, it's like so satisfying to see how my tracks got better and the more work I put in, the better they got. So when you first, you've mentioned some tutorials and stuff like that. So it sounds like you had... you know, a foundation that you were working with at this point, but then you were, you still had like a lot to learn in terms of switching DAWs and all that kind of stuff. So can you tell me a little about how you taught yourself what you now know? Yeah, I started, we were in this kind of like new wave of house music. And there were a lot of like amazing producers who threw out a lot of tutorials. And I think for me, one of the best ones was Danny J. Lewis, like also a producer from the UK, also from the 90s. And he has his tutorial platform called, how is it called? You should Google it. It's like Danny J. Lewis. And I think it's professional. music tutorials dot com something like this and he explains you some theory about like how a groove works and how it really works, then he's like producing a whole track with you. You can really reproduce. And I believe that when it comes to making music, it's also about the technique, how you make stuff. And then you can decide if you're going to go a commercial way or if you're going to go in a more underground way. But if you know how to make a chord and stuff like that, that's the foundation, that's the base you need. And I was pretty much... Like I was like a sponge, you know, I was taking all this, his knowledge, trying to get it into myself. Then there's this other great blog called The Attack Magazine and they have this thing called Beat Dissected. So they explain you how to make a... Yeah, it's really funny. You can also learn how to make Berghain techno. It's really called Berghain techno. Then you can also learn how to make a 90s house beat or like a Chicago banger or like I think they have stuff like big room techno and stuff like this. So they explain you how to process your drums. And that was really, really helpful for me. to make my drums sound bigger. And then, of course, I had like two or three friends, which are amazing producers. And that's the good thing about being a woman in electronic music. You have all these guys around you. They're usually so much more skilled because, let's be honest, it's still more like a thing for guys to sit in the studio and turn the knobs and stuff like that. So I had all these amazing friends. And they were like, whenever you have a question, we come around, we can jam, we show you some stuff. And I took this offer and yes, I was like a sponge, you know, just taking everyone's advice and stuff like that. And this is where it started to get really a lot better, my tracks. And then I think it just was like two and a half years ago. When I sat down, I think it was also around my birthday, and I was like, okay, let's just reflect my career. So my labels are selling shitloads of records. It's going really well. So my DJing is super nice. It's picking up a lot, you know, and then everything is good, you know. Just I think my productions, they could still be a lot better. And then I customized my studio. Maybe when you followed me on Instagram, you saw I tried to use a drill and stuff like that. But yeah, so I customized my studio. So I have really the best sound in my studio now. Then also I bought a bit of... gear because I was getting bored of like just clicking the mouse and stuff like that and I was really living in my fucking studio like in the last two years I really wanted that to be better and I was like in my studio like four days five days a week of course at the weekends I had to travel brought my daughter to school at eight o'clock or brought her to kindergarten at eight o'clock then just went straight to to to the studio and was really like working on tracks and then they got better and I got more confident and stuff like that and then I don't know I just wanted to do whatever like a disco house track then they had tons of tutorials I just tried it out and translated it into my kind of taste and stuff And yeah, this was really when my tracks got so much better. And I have to say at the level where I am now, you really have to live in your studio. You mentioned workflow earlier. So when you talk about workflow, are you talking about that when you would go into your studio, you're talking about also dedication and routine? In a way, it's being really important. So is there a routine workflow that you do when you make music? Like you always start with kick and snare or what have you or start with a melody or something like do you have a process when you sit down that you always do? Yes, I mean, usually my go-to instrument is my lovely 909. So I usually start with a simple beat there, really keep it simple. Then I get inspired a lot from like records from other people or going out or playing at the weekends. Yeah, so usually I go there and I mean, my main thing is house. So I usually start with like a simple house drum pattern. Then I heard a track and was like, maybe let's do something like this, really punchy or really like a Chicago house where you don't necessarily have a bass line, but you have lower toms that are juggling around a little bit. Or I just stumbled across a funny vocal and I'm sampling it and I just go. from there but I would say I mostly start with the drums yeah I think I mostly start with the drums but I have to say in the last couple of weeks I was trying a little bit more of like UK garage stuff and then I started with the chords and the vocals and then put the drums underneath so yeah it really depends but I would say in 90% I would start with a drum loop yeah was it important to you when you were dedicated to improving your skills in music to create some kind of workflow even if you ended up not following it now, like a way to structure what you're learning, because it's like learning a new language, teaching yourself a new language. Did that help provide some structure if you said, okay, every day I sit down and I do this? Or would it be more like, today, I would like to think about how melody works, or how to get a baseline sounding the way I want? Like, was it more about your... process and your routine or about specific individual things you want to learn? It was a little bit of both because now I'm a single mom, my time is limited. For me, it was really important to get a certain kind of workflow where I go into the studio and I'm not fiddling around too much. I'm like, OK, bam, drum loop and then let's get it going from there. But then also I wanted to I was like, OK, so this and that is my favorite producer. So why are his chords sounding so fucking good? Okay, so then I was like trying some tutorials or I was lucky enough to know the producer and he was like, yeah, it's just easy to do this and that and then tried it out. So it was for me having a good workflow where I can get easily and very fast to the result I want to have and also shaping up my technique. I think these were the two topics I was mainly focusing about. You also mentioned earlier, you mentioned like toms low in the mix that can provide a different kind of feel in a beat and so on. And that strikes me as the kind of observation that you can only start to make when you start to see these things in the music like before. If you're not making music, perhaps you just get a general impression of what the vibe is like in the track. But then starting to make music, you start to take that apart. So I guess I'm asking, how did making music change how you heard it, how you listened to it, and how you played it? Yeah, it's funny. When I started spending so much more time in the studio, whenever I was in the club listening to music, I always had this Ableton skin in front of my eyes. And I was like, okay, so now the kick drum is coming in. And I saw the tracks coming in. And it was really funny. I was always getting mad about it. But yeah, it's really funny. I think before you want to make music yourself, you should listen a lot to music. I mean, I was pretty much studying like Cary Chandler drums for 20 years or so. And now I'm like, okay, I know, I understand how he made it and what's happening and stuff like that. And yeah, it's definitely changing or producing music is also, it hasn't really changed the way I'm DJing, but... I think it's more like a combination. So whenever I produce music, I make sure I have a nice DJ intro and stuff like that. And also how things work in the club. It's coming a lot from like listening to music. And yeah, but it's really funny. Sometimes I'm like. I listen to a track and I'm like, oh yeah, he used this and that, you know, and then it's like, oh yeah, he doesn't have a bass line because it's like, whatever, Paul Johnson, Chicago stuff, and he only has like, some really banging, like, toms underneath, so that really make the groove and stuff like that. So, yeah, it's really funny how sometimes you get, from producing, you understand some certain tracks kind of better. if that makes sense. Yeah, it's for sure. Yeah. You also mentioned that you started using hardware, like you transitioned from just going from Logic to Ableton to using hardware. So how deep into the process of sharpening your production skills were you when you started using hardware? And why did you decide to do that? Yeah, I think I had a good workflow and my production skills were put on the next level. And then, but then I felt like Ableton is nice. It's cool. And, but to be honest, I was mostly sitting there clicking the mouse and I was like, this is not really, it's not making so much fun. And like making music is, should make fun. You know, it's like. for me it's like if it doesn't make fun anymore I think I would quit so and I was like now it's really about like fulfilling all of my dreams my tracks are getting better so maybe I should just invest in a little bit of hardware you know and then I had a friend from Paris and I always wanted to have a 909 so and but he also makes music only with hardware and I was in Paris with him and in his studio And he was like, yeah, wait until you work with the 808. It's so much nicer. And he had a shower and I was like, I'll just switch you on. Making some music was like, wow, this is amazing. You know, shit, forget about the 909. I want to have an 808. Okay. In Berlin, I checked eBay Kleinanzeigen, like this eBay secondhand thing. And I was like, I'm sure there is no 808 there. Let's just try. no no bad luck I mean so kind of bad luck for me and I was like okay should I have to buy it so I bought it and yeah then again I was pretty much sleeping in bed with my 808 because I was I was trying it out so much and then I was like, okay, I think I should get a 909 as well. And then again, I was super lucky. One of my friends, he was giving up on his studio or he, I think he had two studios and they were giving up on one of the studios. So I bought his 909. And I have to say, it's so much fun. I mean, let's be honest. If you want to make music, you don't need all this hardware shit. You can make dope tracks just with a computer if you know what to do to make them sound crispy and stuff. But once again, it's so much fun. When you can jam, when you can twist the knobs a bit. Also, I had the drum machines on the rack. means I had to stand up and that's a different kind of like making music. You stand up, you can move your legs, you can almost dance a little bit and it's like we're making dance music. We're not making like sitting on the chair, clicking the mouse music, you know. So that completely changed my workflow again. I mean, there's still a lot of stuff I need to learn with instruments but it's so much fun. And another funny thing was that now a lot of people saw that I was renovating my studio, was getting a little bit of gear and stuff. And I have a lot of friends, like they made music in the 90s, but they stopped. And like, especially one friend, he was like... you know what, my cellar is full of gear, you know, from the 90s. I don't need it anymore. Do you want to have it? I mean, not for free, but I'd rather park it there. You use it, you're making something nice out of it. I was like, yeah, just bring it over. I was like, let's see what he has, like stuff from the 90s. It's from the last century. And he brought me like a Juno 106, you And I was like, wow, okay, this is amazing. And that's also another thing that pushes me because he's trusting me, giving me all his gear that's worth a lot of money. So he was putting it into my studio. And that also pushed me again, you know, like learning all this stuff, making more music and learning how to use all these instruments and stuff like that. And again, it's so much fun to discover this. And it's also like, sometimes I'm in the studio and like, yeah, this must have been like when they made music in the 90s, you know, discovering all these machines, they were new. And then they made a beat with it. And then they were like, wow. that's it, you know, this is when like house music was born or whatever. And I sometimes feel like this, although I'm just like a copycat or whatever you want to call it. But it's like, I have this new instrument and I'm like making the first beat or playing the first chords and like, wow, that's really a different, another level, you know. And it's, yeah, it's so much fun. Kind of simplify things too. Also, if you think about like all the possibilities in a DAW, and I mean, people make this point a lot that restrictions, the restrictions of hardware can be beneficial. But even with something like, let's take the velocity of a drum hit with Ableton, you've got like 127 different options for what you can set it at. But on a drum machine, you've got like two, right? You've got like soft and hard. And when you realize that you're like, oh, well, all the old stuff that I'm referencing, they were just using two velocities. It can kind of make all this stuff that you're learning seem much more simple. Or like when you realize that the Juno 106 is going to, you don't have to torture a soft synth. into making a Juno 106 sound. You just like turn on, you're like, oh, that's what that person used or something. Was it, did it also feel like when you were learning music that it's sort of like unlocked the, when you're listening to it, you can now hear like different synth sounds and name all those ones. And did that. process of learning all those machines help you make music as well yes as well yeah definitely now you can be like okay he used like an 808 or 909 you could or this is like an m1 sound or whatever the names of all the other instruments are and uh yeah and i really like the the fact that it's limiting me because while i was working with ableton I don't know, I have so many friends that work in the music industry that like, you can have this software and that and just try it out and people are so friendly, you know. For me, it has been such, or it's still such a pleasure to be like a woman in electronic music because I have all these friends, you know. They are so helpful and so friendly, giving me all this stuff. And I try it out. Really, if you have questions, just come to me, call me. And yeah, it's really nice. And yes, I've got all these software synths and like plugins and this and that. And for like super, like not so much money, sometimes for free and as a gift. But then I felt like whenever I was going to the studio. okay, so which one of the three trillion VSTs shall I use? While with the hardware, I was like, okay, I only have the 808 today, so let's do it like this. And also it makes the tracks more musically because you're limited. While with the software synth, you can do crazy things you cannot necessarily do as a musician because you only have two hands, five fingers each. If you know what I mean, you know, sometimes with software, you can just like click a dot with the mouse where as a proper musician, you wouldn't you would never do that because you don't have a third arm, you know, so it sounds more musically if that makes sense what I'm saying. Yeah, so that totally changed it for me. So, yeah. So you mentioned this as sort of like one of the benefits of being a woman in a male-dominated field. Yeah. We touched briefly earlier on an aspect of that that might not be so easy for a woman, which is that you are a mother now. Yeah. And you were also learning to make music while you were raising your child. Yeah. So can you talk to me a little about your experience with motherhood and DJing? And we already covered that it was easy for you to get back. into DJing, but is it hard to maintain this kind of lifestyle while you have a child? Yes. I mean, I don't want to lie and say everything is like sunshine and stuff like that, especially when I split up with my ex. And I don't know how to say it's like he's not taking care so much. So I had to find my own solution for it. Yeah, it's tough. I mean, I have an amazing au pair. She's taking care of my daughter and I try to have everything balanced. So not going too crazy with the gigs, being away for like three weeks and stuff. So this is fine. I found my way to like combine everything. But there was a point at my career, like I think it was also like four years ago when I had an au pair, but she wasn't really good. And then she quit like last minute and stuff. And I had to find a new one. And I was like, I'm so tired of doing that, you know. And then with the accident, it didn't work really well. I was like, maybe I should just go back to my normal job, you know. And then I had... some stuff some really bad stuff in my family happening with my mom died you know so I had no one to like like help and I mean my dad would always comment stuff but it's a different thing having a mom or a father you know helping you and stuff like that so I was really like struggling and I was like yeah maybe I should just give it back just go back to my normal developer job just be a mom and just be like a normal person so to say but I was like no and I remembered my mom said there's always a solution for everything so I was like okay trying to get my strength back okay I need a new au pair and luckily the sister of my ex she her best friend she has an agency for au pairs and I called her and was like really I need help you know and she was like call her she gets the best girls for you and really since then I'm working with her and she always gets really the best girls who really fit to me to us and since then it's going really really well but I have to say my daughter is 10 now and she gets to this kind of kind of age where girls become women and I mean I try to bring her to my gigs to the easy ones where it's not too much traveling but I can also tell that sometimes she's like because we're such a good team sometimes she's like oh mom I don't want you to go but then I have to go and play Friday or Saturday coming back on Sunday so that's really tough and sometimes it breaks my heart but I think my dad was saying the other day that I shouldn't be too sad about it because... I mean, if I wouldn't travel for DJing, I would probably have my own software company and then I would have to travel during the week and a lot of other people do it. And that's how it is, especially for women. If you want to combine motherhood and a job, it's still the toughest thing in the world, I think. But yeah, you can find solutions and my daughter is fine with it. to maybe take the latest flight and come back early or she's coming with me. So I think now everything is perfectly balanced, but it can take some time to find your balance and to find the solution that fits the most to you and your... Life situation. And as she gets to her teenage years. I'm scared. Yeah, and you work in nightlife, which is often a taboo subject between parents and kids. How are you going to tackle that or introduce her to this part of your life in a healthy way? I mean, she obviously knows what I'm doing because now YouTube is a really big thing for the kids and I have my ballroom on YouTube, of course. So she knows what I'm doing. But I think I was always really responsible with drinking and all the other kind of stuff. So I'm not scared to introduce my daughter to that. Music and going out and all this lifestyle is such a big thing in my life and I love it so much still after all these years, I have to say. And I think it could be fun to bring my daughter to like the first gigs. I mean, she's been on two gigs, was a festival outside where it was cool to bring kids and stuff. So she knows what I'm doing and she likes it. She's really into dancing. But then, of course, I mean, let's be honest. I mean, there's also like... lots of crazy stuff going on and and on one side I want to have I want her to make her own experiences but on the other side I'm scared but if you stay being such a great team and we talk about everything I think I'm not scared at all would you teach her to DJ have you already taught her anything like DJing or producing Oh, it's really funny because she was using one of my, I had a push. Yeah, I got a push from Ableton and I used it and it's all like colorful and stuff. And it was so cute. She wanted to try it out. And I mean, she was just like fiddling around and I made a video of it. And one of my friends, Mike Huckabee, saw it and he was like, oh, it's so cool. You know, I'm teaching the kids in Detroit I want to do a machine lesson with your daughter. And she was like seven years old. And I was like, yeah, cool, let's do it. And so they had a machine lesson. And it was really funny because, yeah, my daughter, she's more into dancing, but really she loves music. moving around and stuff. That's where it all starts. Yeah, that's where it all starts. You know, once you start moving your foot to like a beat, then you're lost. And yeah, so they had a machine lesson together, which was so cute and funny. And what Mike is teaching the kids is not how the machine works. It's more about rhythm. It's about, okay, you have a kick drum here, you have a snare, then... he puts the metronome on and then my daughter had to press the kick drum and then the snare drum or the clap and try to make it fit to like the metronome. And then like the hardest part was to bring in the hi-hats because it's not on the one or two. And I tried it as well. And I have to say it took a little while and Mike was like, yeah, someone has to work on the hi-hats. I was like, yeah, man. It was funny. But since then, I mean, Mike was offering another session and stuff. But my daughter was like, no, I think for now I'm fine. And yeah, I just let it grow naturally. I don't want to push her into it. But if she wants to try it out again, of course, I'm going to do it. But yeah, for now, she's into this German. Justin Bieber. I don't know how this happened. Who's the German Justin Bieber? Oh, God. We go to the concert when it's her birthday. I'm already scared. It's Mike Singer. Mike Singer. Okay, I'm going to have to check this out. I didn't know Germany had one. Yeah, yeah. And it's funny. Yeah, if she wants to try it out, of course, I'm going to show her. But I'm not like, oh, you have to be a DJ because I'm doing it. You have to be a producer because I'm doing it. Or the exact opposite, rather. Don't do it. Don't do it. Go be a software developer. Yeah, or just be a doctor or something useful, you know. Well, before we wrap up here, we didn't quite fully get into all your current projects yet. So I just wanted to touch on all that. So we talked about Best of Modus, but you also have a family of labels around that. Yes. As well as other projects. So can you tell us a little about like what you've got going on and what you work on these days? Yeah, from starting Best of Models, it grew into like an incredible, almost ridiculous amount of other labels. So we started Best of Models only for the crew. Then Diego Krause, he came up to me and he was like, look, I have so much more music on my computer. I really want to release it, but what can we do? And we were like, okay, maybe we should start a label just as a self-outfit release, you know, just with your music. And he was like, yeah, that's great. And so we started Unison Wax. We have the seventh release now. This is like just mainly for Diego. Then we are in a group of like amazing producers. So a lot of our friends that were sending us tracks and I was like, shit, we have to do something with that. I was like, hey guys, what about starting a sub-label and just release music from our friends, support them, you know, just strengthen up the crew and stuff. And so we started Beste Freunde, that means best mates. So we started that. Then I had some, I became friends with like a duo of like two brothers and they made also amazing music, like a bit more stripped back and stuff. And yeah, they moved to Berlin and I was like, yeah, maybe we should do something together. And I just and I wanted to have something on the side for my original crew, because it can be quite time consuming discussing in a democratic way. What's going to be in the next record? What's the color of the next record? So I was like, I want to be a bit more free. So I'm just going to do a side project with these other guys. And so we had We Are House. Also had a little party thing going on at Grießmühle back then. So that grew like really naturally. But then, as I said before, like two and a half or two years ago, I started making so much more music. And also I'm coming from this background from playing. five hours on the second floor all night long so I I mean my main thing is house music but then I also love disco I love a bit more like minimal to start at the beginning of the set maybe some groovy Detroit techno stuff some electro stuff and I was like I just don't want to limit myself to like 90s house. I just make everything I want. So I had so much more music on my computer sitting and I was like, this music needs to be out. So the best two tracks I sent to my favorite label. Unfortunately, they were a bit too slow with like replying to me. And I was like, I can't wait any longer. I mean, when I released the tracks, they were like, shit, we should have taken it. I was like, man, But yeah, anyway, so I was like, okay, I want to have my own baby. But I'm like completely free, independent. So I started Crystal Grooves and I think it was the best idea I had in years. And that's like a pun on your last name, right? Yeah, because my last name is Crystal and 803 is the room number of my studio. and grooves because I like it groovy. And yes, it was a really good decision to do that because the first release was just played by everyone. I mean, Gert Janssen, Midland, Black Madonna and... you know, older opinion leaders and whatever kind of names. And I saw shitloads of records. It's like really amazing. And then I was like, okay, cool. Let's rock this, you know, let's do this. So is this kind of your main project right now? That's my baby. Yeah. And also. I hope this doesn't sound negative or anything, but this is I can do whatever I want. And I wanted to be a bit more free because. With Bessel Modus and being so democratic and everything, it was kind of slow with our output. With Crystal Groove, I can really have a steady steam of releases because I want to keep the ball rolling means I want to have a release and then people like it and it's like, wow, boom. let's say like three months four months is like really a healthy uh heavy amount of time to like release the next one so I had a release on Aus Music then for the UK then uh had the next Crystal Grooves and I'm a bit more free so I can keep the ball rolling a bit more and um yeah I think it's really good to do it like in my way and like have it a bit more like a steady output. Yeah, you have a crazy work ethic. And so, you know, no one can get in your way here. You can go at the pace you want. Yeah, it's crazy. But then once you start, I mean, really with the first Crystal Groove record, it was played by so many people. I got so much. positive reaction and stuff like that and suddenly I was also getting recognized by like bigger DJs who played my music who shared my music and then I got lots of other requests for releasing music and I had to release on Aus Music I'm also gonna do my album on Aus Music next year another milestone yes And yeah, it was funny because I was also my workflow was so fast. So I was making so much more music. But then, of course, I couldn't release like everything on Crystal Goose. Also, I wanted to have a bit of space in between. But for some reason, this first half of the year was crazy with like a release on Freddie K's label, which is a bit more raw Chicago house acid kind of stuff. and something for the techno heads, if you want to say that. Then, of course, the release on Aus Music. Then I had a remix for Detroit Swindle, which was getting quite big. And yeah, I have now a lot of other requests also from some of my favorite labels, finally. Yeah, I'm working on that. But it was good that there were school holidays now because I really had to slow it a bit down because... It's good to release a steady amount of good tracks, but then you don't also want to overdo it. And then there's the Sinti overkill. And also, it feels like I'm constantly like, I'm a salesman, you know. I'm constantly like, buy this record. code go to my gig buy my t-shirt and do this and you know after some time you get really get on people's nerve and I don't want that to happen like too soon yeah so on top of all of this you have at least one other project which is elevate can you tell us about elevate yeah so elevate is another funny idea I had because I love to network with people. I love to support other people. So we had this crew of friends with amazing labels. But I felt a bit like everyone was in their own kind of fight, you know, in their own kind of bubble. And I was like... why are we not combining the things you know combining the forces try to be bigger support each other more let's do like a combination of all of our labels and find a name for it and just support each other more so we started Elevate and actually it was just like an online online record store or an online platform where we sold our records and merchandise and also the stuff from our friends. But then we had the stuff at our manufacturer that is handled with care. And they said, if you get more records, then sorry, this office is too small. And I'm like, okay, shit, I'm going to bring everything home. I put it into my daughter's room and it was really funny. It was getting so much. Even my daughter was like, mom, if you put more records in my room, I swear I'm moving out. And she was only nine. And I was like, okay, maybe I should look for like a storage room. And then the woman next to my house, she had this shop and I asked her a while ago about studio spaces. And she said, I have nothing, but I keep your number. She was like out of the blue. She was calling me. She was like, look, I have this. I want to become smaller. You can have the room in the back. And I was like, wow, this is really next to my house. I live in 25 stores in 24. So I'm like, cool, I'm going to take it. And then I took it and she, her daughter was 18, 19. She moved out and she was like, look, I live upstairs, but I think I'm going shop and I was like okay so I was like should I open a record store oh my god then I called the guys like oh new idea we're opening a record store and they were like you shouldn't drink at daytime you know I'm not drunk but I have this opportunity. And they were like, okay, let's try. And I was like, okay, let's try. Yeah, no, we have a record store, but since it was not planned, I have to say at the moment, it's a bit chaotic. Also to keep the cost low, we have friends who work for booking agencies. They're renting a desk space during the week. And we now have to find out how we're gonna... do it I mean we do more stuff online but obviously we also want to open the shop I'm not there the weekend so I'm trying to open maybe on the Wednesdays Wednesday evenings something like this and then maybe find someone who wants to work there on the Saturday so we are at least open two days and also I'm there I would like to sell some records and stuff and yeah it's another funny adventure it's nice to and it's really funny I thought about This is like going back to my roots. You know, I did this like 20 years ago and now I'm there where it all started somehow. Yeah, it's really funny. Funny how things work out that way. And even though it's a return, it still seems like a lot is in flux in your life and changing still. Like we've gone through so many chapters just in this conversation. And so I guess I'm wondering what's the next chapter? What's in motion? Yeah. I mean, I did a lot of changes in the last one or two years as well, because I had the feeling I only want to work with the... best people with the best team in my back so I was doing a few changes and I used to be in the resident at Watergate also in the agency but then I felt like it's maybe not the right place for me to be also like music wise we were going in two different directions so I was like okay maybe it's not the best agency for me personally to work with so I changed my booker Now we have the best poker in the world and everything is going really well. Then I have one person who's taking care of my PR stuff. Because, yeah, let's be honest, you can make the dopest tracks if no one knows about it. So you have to get your stuff a bit out. We grew together as a nice team. So, yeah, I'm just currently trying to put a nice team together. So my hard work gets noticed. Also, there might be a few changes with the labels, maybe. I'm definitely shutting down We Are House because I feel it needs to be treated more carefully, but I don't see myself there, also with the sound and stuff, which is not a bad thing. I'm just trying to keep it realistic and try to channel all my power. Also, I had this radio show at a public station called Fritz, which unfortunately I had to give up because I felt like... With traveling and stuff like that, I felt like I lost a lot of the quality. And I'm really a big fan of giving the best quality to everything or giving my best with everything. And so I said, okay, I have to put this on the side. It's not working anymore. So now I have more time. And yeah, the studio time is always holy for me. So I want to spend as much time as I can with this. yeah try to improve the shop that's also another goal and yeah just uh get better with the with the labels also opening up a little bit more for because we are one and only so far but with my new label i opened up also for the digital world and it's bringing so many like new fans because we are lucky in Berlin. We have like 3 million record stores. It's the best place to buy records and it's also the best place maybe to play records. But you have a lot of followers from South America. For them it's too expensive. They don't have turntables. They don't have the money so we want to open up for that as well a little bit. And yeah, just trying to shape a nice team around me and just. make as much music as I can yeah working on my album is the next thing got some nice cool remix requests and yeah I think it's it's going into a right direction at the moment it certainly sounds like it there's so much going on that it makes sense that sometimes you need to pare down to focus your energy yeah the specific channels yeah especially because also I have my daughter and I want to have spend some quality time with her. So I think but now where and now it's really I have the best time management also have another friend working for me as a little bit as an assistant. So he's doing a lot of administrative stuff and that's also helping a lot. So I don't have to sit there and fill in lists with like. funny stuff from the label so um yeah it's going really well at the moment yeah it's good so you're running an empire now it sounds like yes the one woman empire someone said in an interview it's i quite like that no it's a it all came naturally and uh yeah it's so much fun to be my own boss and just put in so much work and see it's finally yeah hard work pays back that's that's really how it is for me personally
