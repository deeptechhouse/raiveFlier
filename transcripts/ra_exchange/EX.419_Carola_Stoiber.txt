Bye. Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. We're listening to a track by X101, which was an early alias of Underground Resistance. This was a record that took Berlin by storm in the beginning of the 90s. It was also the music that got this week's guest into techno. Carola Stoiber was initially taken by post-punk, hardcore, and the experimental acts active in her adopted hometown of Berlin. But through her work as a journalist and later as the general manager of Trezor Records, Stoiber connected emergent techno scenes in Detroit, Edinburgh, Birmingham and London with her Berlin bass. She later weathered two serious storms, the closure of the original Trezor and the disintegration of the record industry. These days, she's a booking agent at Pool Proxy, which brought her to Amsterdam, where R.A.'s Holly Dicker had the chance to find out about her. her story thus far. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Carola Stoiber is up next. you Bye. I'm in sunny Amsterdam on the first weekend of August. Pride is happening outside in the streets, but I'm inside in the Sheraton Hotel with Carola Stoiber. Carola, can you tell us about your decision to first move to Berlin because you were sort of originally from north of Germany, is that right? How old were you and why did you decide to move? I decided to move to Berlin when I was 15. I grew up in the north of Germany in a very, very small village. It's out of nowhere land. And I did pony horseback riding in a village that was close to my one. There's nothing else to do and, you know. Girls are into pony stuff and horses. For the record, I was too. So then I started to take lessons there, blah, blah, blah. And there were also... during holiday time, vacation time, a lot of young other children coming. They were coming for one week, two weeks, three weeks, depending. And in the meantime, the country girls were taking care of the ponies. But this is where I met the Berlin people. There was a crew of Berlin guys and girls and sisters and cousins. They were between 12 and 15 and they came with the cool clothes and the right music. It was already post-punk time, but they brought ska and they were just looking cool. And I just, okay, this is it. So we became friends with the girls. We were 12, 13 and started to visit each other. So then I started to go to Berlin all the time. All the time I could do it. I jumped on the train, which was then back in the day still east and west. So you had to cross also the eastern part. with the train, which took forever because the tracks were bad and you also had to stop and they did the pass control and everything. And then with 15, I decided this is where I want to go. And was holding on another three and a half years, finishing my school. And then I just took my stuff and moved. Did you go with any other purpose other than you just wanted to be in Berlin? Like, did you go for studying or music scene? a job or was it just I'm going to Berlin and see what happens? That was a little bit prepared. I had three years to prepare how I'm going to. I'm going to set this up. And, of course, that was not taken out of the blue. I was interested in history. And so I signed in for studying history, journalism, and politics because I wanted to become a journalist. But I, of course, made sure that... I can choose the city so that they don't send me somewhere else. It had to be Berlin, so I made sure that what I choose here will work with what the plan was. And into music, I was there already, of course, yes, because I went back and forth. listened to a lot of stuff and learned a lot of bands and about bands with the gang of Berlin because they were all skaters, punk rockers and also in bands themselves and quite active. Can you set the sort of musical scene for us a little bit, the kind of time and maybe some of the places that you went and some of the artists that you saw? during this period? Yeah, we saw a lot of artists. The thing I do remember that was quite impressive was we went to see Killing Joke in Kant Kino. And, I mean, we were 15 or 16. The big question now is... Who checked back in the days, by the way, who went to the concerts? We went and we were 15, 16. There was nobody asking for passports. I was discussing with my friend recently. He said, how did we do that? I mean, we just went. Nobody. Anyway, so we put on high heels. For the band and shit and the concert. Just couldn't walk with them. High heels for killing joke. That sounds crazy. Yeah. This is what I do remember. Some strange other shoes so that we look a little bit, you know, older. Maybe we got rid of our black boots we had all the time. Anyway. So the concert was great and then we were called in backstage. Why that happened, I can't remember neither. We all had crazy hair already, so maybe they... And they were thinking probably that we were older. So then I got an autograph of the bass player. And we were just hanging out there and I don't know that nothing was happening. I don't even think that we spoke to the band. I can't remember that. But I found it again. I still have this autograph. It's crazy. That was quite impressive. What was the venue and where was it? Does it exist anymore? It's the famous Cunt Kino. You had Cunt Kino with the cinemas and then it was also venue. Now they show movies again. And there was also the place in the 80s, Talking Heads. Everybody played Cunt Kino. And the other one was SO36 for the punk rock. for the other bigger punk rock bands. Probably Killing Joke weren't that big at that time. I can't remember capacity. And there was also Cartier Latin, that is now Wintergarten, this variety. That was a big venue also where, for example, Theatre of Hate and Spare of Destiny, and they all played. And I remember that one too, because Theatre of Hate played recently again. after 30 years, and he's still singing crazy good. But then I remember that the catillot had seat rows, and everybody was jumping on it, and then they crashed, and we fell with the seat row that was crashed. It was also something I do remember. So you're a punk with crazy hair and boots and studying journalism. What happened next? I finished the university and started to write. Did I start to write already? Probably, yes. But while I was studying, you have to think that or you have to imagine that you had workshops. So you were sent to discuss with a partner, a team partner, find a subject, talk about and do a feature for radio, a three-minute feature. And I met, I did this with my, then became a friend Rainer and we found Achim Kohlberger and Dimitri Hegemann who were running Fischbüro and Fischlabor. I think Fischlabor already. Yes, the bar in Schöneberg already that time. And they were about to found a label and Raina knew that. And so we said, okay, we're going to interview them and see what they want to do. And so we did. And that's how I met them. And then we just did the interview and they were talking about that they want to sign Clock TVA or sign Clock TVA because they knew them from before. And now we're starting to do a record company. And that was it. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you for the interview. We did the feature for the radio that was, I don't know, maybe it was even broadcasted. Yes, it was. And then I went to Fischlabor the other night again, and then they were asking me if I want to become the secretary for the upcoming label. And I asked them later why they asked me, and they couldn't tell me. Dimitri just told me that Achim said, this one in. This one has to, this one in. I have to describe that Carola is sort of waving her arm in. So, Secretary, what exactly does that mean and what did it entail and what was your... reaction to that? I took the job because that was better than babysitting because I was still studying or I also cleaned bars. That is what you do as a student. I actually cleaned the Café Swing which is also a famous place for concerts and hang out for. for the scene back in the days in the West. And then I just started as a secretary. You have to imagine this is what it was. There was Achim sitting dictating, dictating, is this the right word? What letters I have to write because you have to imagine no emails. There was fax, no fax it was. So you had to put everything in one page. You didn't do it like what we do now. One word and then back and forth. You have to think about and write a letter with everything you wanted to say, to fax it out. And then a fax came back answering the letters. So that's what I did first place. And you eventually became the music editor at Berlin Tip magazine. Can you... Tell us about the magazine and maybe fill in the gap. There was maybe a couple of years in between. It was not a big gap of years in between. It was pretty much happening at the same time. So I was studying and I was working for Interfish Records. And then... I finished my university and then I went on a trip with my friend to USA. What you do? You've done now? Okay, now we're going to go six weeks. So we went to San Francisco, bought a car, went down to Texas to meet friends, a band. And so the car then went to New York City and did hang out in New York City. And also with, I don't know, with friends we had before, we met before. So I met somebody there in New York City and I fell in love with him. And then I went home again and then I went back again. I was back in Berlin and then I was... telling my bosses, okay, there's a new music seminar and I have to go back to New York City. And they said, oh, okay. So they sent me back to New York City. Sorry, can you put a timeline on it? Can you give us a date? What year was this? That was '91. And I can't remember. Yeah, '91, must be '91. And then I went to New York again pretty fast. There were not a lot of weeks in between. But there was also already then the Trezor Club in the building process and it was opening, it was open then. two already and the DJ booking started. So it was already in the pipeline that we bring some DJs from USA over. Before we get into that, maybe you can backtrack a little bit and tell us about sort of the predecessor, if you like. Michael Trizzle, which was the UFO, or do I say UFO club? How would I say it? Yeah, the UFO club. That was before. But I wanted to go back via New York City because that was the, when I went to New Music Seminar, I also met Jeff Mills, Underground Resistance, but I also met the... main music editor of Tip magazine, which was a B-weekly program and yeah, also City magazine with writing about music bands and what's happening in the city culture and stuff. That was a print magazine and that was also quite important. It's still going now, right? Yeah. It's still going now, but not the way it was. It was a little bit more also with political background too. There was another one, City, so City and Zip were the ones covering the Berlin actions. But also again, no online or something was there. You know, you got your infos from the print magazines. And then she asked me to write something for her, a small report, and I did. And then she said, why don't you come and... and become the music editor for Berlin. So that's how it happened. All at the same time, pretty much. I started to work there because I wanted to write Finnish university, as I said. So went in there, okay, let's do that. But kept on working for Interfish, in the process becoming Trezor Records, because the club was there then. And beforehand, at the UFO club, before the war came down, that was the club for the pre-techno assets. So coming from EBS, yeah, EBM, switching into what we call techno now. And I was there maybe one or two times, not a lot, because I was still into guitar music and post-punk rock and hardcore. So I was working there, but from the musical side I was not yet into. That's interesting. So what was the switch for you? What really turned you on to techno? It was underground resistance. It was the music they brought us to also release because they were looking for a European label or distribution when they started the X101. And that was it. Because it has this special energy. They will kill me if they ever listen to it. If you're into hardcore and metal music was quite energetic, then there was also this energy. It was maybe a little bit, no, not a little bit, angriness too. So then I said, okay. And later on when I went to Detroit, then I understood also why. happened to be the music they do or they did so sort of back to this point of um the UFO club being uh at the turning point of sort of EBM Acid House becoming techno Was there or were you aware of the kind of animosity, might be a bit too harsh a word, but this sort of like Berlin versus Frankfurt ideology, which I've read somewhere sort of came across via another magazine called Front Page. Were you aware of this or was it not really your music at that point and didn't really care? I was aware of that because they were talking about that a lot. But I haven't been to Frankfurt and I was in Berlin. I really didn't care about this. And I also think that is stupid. I mean, it's stupid now and it was stupid back in the days because we all went, you know, started. electronic music because of the community. And I don't even know who was starting that. But later on, of course, yeah, the Frankfurt people are coming. And of course they were dressed differently. Berlin was black always. They were having white shirts and, you know, muscles. But, okay, let's do... They can do what they want. So I did not really care about this. More was the problem I remember was that... the guitar music and the techno people they didn't want to switch so I was jumping scenes and you could not convince in the beginning somebody switching and checking that out too no no no this is nothing for me no no no now it's completely different not after all these years it started to be different already earlier but It was quite strict. UFO Club kind of infamously sort of hosted the first ever Love Parade after party at Wright. Were you there? Were you at Love Parade? No, I was not. Yeah, no, I was not at the first Love Parade. Don't ask me why. I knew that there was planning that they're running around on Kudam and I was also living in a side street there, but I'd somehow missed to go. So I don't know. I only can watch that on TV then when they show some bits and pieces of the first one. But everybody talked about it after and thought it would have been a great thing, which is true. I assume you went to one of them. Did you go to any love parades? Yeah. Can you tell us about that? Yeah, I went to a few then later on at Kurfürstendamm. And that was great. Oh, Holly, what year is this? I can't remember. Also early 90s. I had friends coming over from the North. or they came over from the North Sea where I grew up and they were in town for that one and this is one I remember in particular and then they said, oh, this is Love Parade today and I said, tomorrow, and I said, yeah, yeah, we go there. So I took them there, and we had a big sleepover in our Vicky, in our apartment, because I lived with some friends, and it was booked out. They all slept over in our place to come to love and go to love parade. So I went with them. I said, now follow me. And then, yeah, the one from North Germany, we were quite impressed about what's going on there. And then we went to Trezor too. Trezor in the original space opened March 1991, I believe. What else was happening at that time in Berlin? Were you going to any... raves or were you still into guitar music even then because surely I think that was the moment when techno was really exploding I was always into guitar music I never I never went away from this I'm still listening to a lot of stuff probably mostly back of the days so from back of the days no I was going to a lot of concerts, because there were a lot of bands coming to Berlin and play. And so I saw everything, a few that became big, for example Pearl Jam, when they played Love Club. And then I went to Trezor from time to time, still working as a secretary for Trezor Records, but a little bit more into the direction of journalism. So at the beginning of 90s to 92, how you see, it slipped away a little bit from the label because I was concentrating on my career as a journalist and what I wanted to do. So I also did a radio show with Radio 100, which was a left-wing alternative radio station. where you had the freedom to play whatever you want and you had technicians that came also. Collective radio, it was something better you cannot work for with an official broadcast sequence, no, frequency. So that was really a great, great time. How did you land that gig and what... What were you playing on your show? Was it music-based or were you talking as well? It was music-based and we did shows, for example, Australian music focus or sometimes if there were a few concerts at the same week, then you presented to the bands, played the bands that were about to come and play. But also did a lot of interviews and did features too, which could have been 20 minutes or one hour. That's what I meant with the freedom you had. There was nobody saying you have to do something that's three minutes long. Or if the interview was good, you just kept on broadcasting the quotes and also playing the music. Do you have like a favorite interview or a favorite? memory from this time? Yes, I do. It's true. One is with the lead singer of the band Helmet, New York, Noise Hardcore, who I met in New York. Again, New York, because that was also a friend of a friend. He knew where he was working. I got a chance to talk to him. And I talked to him again later on. And I just played yesterday in Berlin, by the way. I missed that. So it was quite good. And, of course, now the other one is Underground Resistance because I also interviewed them in New York. They were there. And I took the chance. Yeah, and then I got that chance to get that feature broadcast in Monika Dietl's show. That was the first show in Berlin for electronic music. Okay, so take us back to New York and or the moment you first met Underground Resistance. It was actually Final Cut was first. Final Cut was the... Also, it's not EBM. Industrial. Industrial was emceeing. You also had a guy. doing some vocals, whatever, texting, I can't remember. And he was the mastermind in that one already, but the MC was from Chicago. And then there was Atonal Festival in 1989 or 1990. I think the one with Jeff Mills, his first big trip was in 1990, performing with Final Cut. I assume you were there. How was it? Yeah, that was also interesting, funny story because I was working for the label and then they hired me also for artist, being artist host for doing the festival. That was the first one after the break for Atonal when it was first electronic. Before it was guitar, underground, experimental noise. And then everyone said, oh, Adonales now, electronic, how can they do that? I remember that. So there was a lot of buzz, what would happen now. So did you go to the old ones then? No, I couldn't because I was not in Berlin yet. I missed them. I was dreaming of, but I was still in the countryside. For that one, of course, I went. and then there was a band was cancelled it was 808 but then 808 stayed in the end came and Consolidated played and then we invited Final Cut because they were also on Interfish Records with their license from USA we did. And then they came, flew them over, and it was with Jeff Mills. And it was also not like what we have now. You fly them in, there's a hotel and everything. We just had a big love for them, and I remember that I did bring some sheets so that they can. have it warm because it was not very warm in Berlin that day. And then we also went to UFO Club together and that was it. Then they went away, it was a great show they played. And then back in New York City and the New Music Seminar '91, I was sitting in a panel about music and industry. And then there was a small paper coming was given through the rose and then it ended and says hey i know you from berlin this is jeff And he was turning around and I said, crazy, it's Jeff. And that's how we met again. And he was then with the Underground Resistance, as Underground Resistance, with Mike Banks, Eddie Flesch and folks, Juan Atkins, the whole Detroit people, united forces to go out and present the sound to the world, their sound. That was the mission UR was on. And that's how I met them again. And there I did the interview because it was also new, of course. And I said, you need to tell me about this now. So I did an interview for my part of the whatever job or life or journalistic style. And then on the other hand, Trezor was happening. And I said, why not? Went back to Berlin, so now you have to book Underground Resistance, which was already the plan. But then they came over with Blake Baxter first, I think. And that was the moment you fell in love with techno? Yeah, that was the moment, because I got the records and then I said, okay, alles klar. And then, of course, there was a different... emotion, mission, passion to go on working for Trezor Records then because the music was a little bit, it was more mine than before. Before it was, okay, some artists are doing some electronic whatever stuff. which was good too, of course. But then it was, yes, okay. Yeah, now I got it. Cool. So then I guess that means you took a bit more ownership and maybe your role changed? Yeah, a little bit more ownership too, but the role did not change yet. Hasn't changed yet. Because I then left to work for the tip magazine. And because they offered me a job before I was freelancing. So I said, okay, I'm going to work for them. But then I was called back in 94, I think it was. No, no, no, no. Wrong. 92. No, 94. I should have done this. year things no it was 94 when when they caught me back and asked if I would come back and become the general manager so when that that was happening then so what did the general manager role entail General manager role for Trezor Records was getting the records out, signing artists, checking who could be interesting, doing the deals. And then, yeah, and then just getting it going. Production, distribution. We didn't do the distribution, but communication was the distribution. And do we do promo, everything. Yeah, I guess that. has now become various different roles like A&R, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But back then it was one person doing everything. I would never say there's only one person. That's what some people like to do. They run around and say it's all me. It was always a team, always a team. There were always people. And it was also the matter of time and the setup with the club. And everything. Something that you would think that was all planned, but it was not. We didn't think it was all happening. Maybe this is a good time to tell us a bit more about the team and the structure. I feel like it was probably quite chaotic back in those days. Maybe it is still. I don't know if it's... more chaotic, if it was more chaotic, no, no, it was quite straight. That was a business you had to do, your stuff you had to do, the communication. I was working with an American, Mark Snow, and he was then the main A&R. and that all happened when I came back and so we did the label together for a long time. Of course there was Dimitri also supervising and coordinating and the club people were there but the label side were him and me and we worked hard. We worked from... tend to late at night. So what was your joint vision? Who were some of the artists you were signing and where were you looking to find these artists? I always, no, later on I always put it like this. If you can hang out with artists in the bar and you can drink with them, then it's all fine. You have to, you have to, yeah, you have to like each other too. You have to have the same visions and goals. You cannot just now put this record out and then it's happening. There was the United, also repeating this, United Forces. for this and the vision was always to put out quality techno music and be a little bit ahead of whatever is was coming then too because we were quite ahead absolutely um so we're in the mid 90s period and this is sort of the time when this British techno axis was happening, specifically around Edinburgh. Can you talk a bit about those artists and how they joined Trezor? Yeah, that's what I meant before. Also that we were always looking for something that is maybe interesting, but also the fact that it was nothing planned. So there was this London guy, Terry Donovan. He was working for BMG, as far as I remember, and he also did run a night. He hosted a night, a treasure club, bringing London underground artists. And that's why we, for example, met Dave Tarrida. He came with him so that the whole crew from Edinburgh, Neil Landstrom, Dave Tarrida, Tobel Schmidt. And then also Christian Vogel, not from Edinburgh, but from Brighton. But they were connected. They were the No Future gang later on, because they were on the same, how do you say that, Holly? On the same... Wavelength? And doing music and that was more the experimental. We would call it experimental back in the days if you listen to that. Now it's really solid techno. Yeah, so we're talking about Sativa recordings and the Mosquito labels run by those guys separately. Yeah, Mosquito was Christian Vogel, Sativa was Dave with his partner, and Neil had Scandinavia already, yeah, and Toby was also recording for them, and they were recording for each other. So Christian was actually the first. The first one, we then said, okay, we would like to sign or see if he would be into doing a record. And he was. So that was happening then. And when he played first time in Berlin, I do remember, I think it was the second time in general, but the first time I saw him. I went there and then he was playing and it was completely different from what I was used to listen to because he just, when he listened to his set, it was that he cut himself so that he was stumbling. So, you know, he cut the beat. flow himself all the time so so it was really really really new for me and also for a lot of people because beforehand it was more that everybody tried to get a flow with mixing and and so that you build up your hypnotic or whatever the atmosphere and he just cut it all the time boom another record and and completely different beat and tempo And so that was like, what is he doing? And it was super cool. And what about the other guys? The same. I mean, they had their own style as well. Neil was performing live. So he was not DJing. And still very rarely, I think, he is the one live. Toby, I think as well. And Dave Toredo was also this direction, but he had his own style in DJing, of course, too. But it was, I would say, I call it the UK new school. Because for UK it was the new sound that was coming from there. But there was also another scene. There was Brighton and Edinburgh, but there was also Birmingham. So you had Surgeon and Regis and those guys doing their stuff. I wouldn't say like Frankfurt Berlin, but two different spots where the... talents and originators were starting their labels and their music they wanted to do. And did you, how did you first hear about these scenes? Did you go over to the UK and experience it first hand? Yes, I did, because if they were not coming yet to play Trezor, I went to Birmingham and checked out the scene there and met Tony Surgeon. And I think we went to Leeds too, the same weekend. And then I was there and people were out of their heads. And I was not used to that. UK was already pretty crazy, Berlin is crazy, but UK is always a little bit more. And they were hands up and open eyes and yeah, and what's going on here? I got a little bit scared. But then I understood, okay, okay, this is the, you know, so the version here. It was quite nice, but I can't remember the club though. And then there was also James Ruskin, who kind of a bit later on became pretty important, kind of after the millennium, I guess. So how did he get involved? James, I think, was booked for... Don't ask me, James, if this is wrong, please forgive. I think he was booked first for Treasurer and we just liked his style and then we also asked him if he would. if he would do a record for us. But he was also connected to the surgeon and friends and label side and out of that scene. And he was really good too and really outstanding. Did you have much involvement with the club itself? Was there much of a crossover? The label was involved, the label people with the club. Of course, there was a team again, but also the snowball effect that you had that you could go and play the records in the club and check them out at the dance floor directly. And of course, the label artists were playing Trezor. So in the very end, I was there in the hardcore days every weekend. Because then I knew everybody. There was always one DJ playing that we knew. So Artist Dinner, Trezor, Trezor, Trezor. I spent quite a few years in this cellar. I guess at this point the journalism stopped. Yeah, the journalism stopped. I kept on writing a little bit here and there. But then I had to stop because I could not go on with this. Don't ask me if that was the right thing to do in my life. But I guess that was the turning point to make a decision between, okay, now it's going to be this label and electronic music. or the journalism and I decided to go for the electronic music no regrets um not no not not at all yeah and then sometimes I did write info sheets so that was also quite good that I was able to describe the music we've all been there I myself wrote many a chisel info sheet full disclosure okay so then the rumors started emerging that Trezor would have to close. Can you give us sort of the story of that? Yeah, then the rumor started that Trezor had to close, but it took a while. It took a few years because there was always a, but then they didn't start to build what they wanted to do at the area. And so got extension, got extension, got extension. And then in the very end, It had to close, and I was turning 40 in that year, in these two weeks. I'm not saying how old I am now so that you can figure out when that was. And there was a two-weeks party going on with everybody who was important and wanted to play. So is this like a continuous party for two weeks? That sounds insane. Yes, it was insane, but it was not all day long. It was every night. Closing, then sleep a little bit, and then next one's coming in. I can't remember how we survived this. But it was great. It was really, really, really good. And then what happened next? I think she was all sort of exiled for a while. I believe it was at Maria Am Ufa on a Wednesday night. And then, meanwhile, finding the new location. Yeah, it was exiled. The resort was exiled down at Maria and sometimes SO36 as well. We did some parties there too. And then the new location was found, but it took a while to... to get it all going, because it was this rough industrial building. Everybody knows now, I guess. But there was nothing done, so you had to build the upper floor, and the downstairs had to be also done. And in comparison to the old club, it was not like that. You just opened it, and you just did some renovation, put in a bar, and then you were able to open it. That was the case back in the days. This time it was with the Berlin institution that was responsible for that area. Everything had to be stamped and everything had to be okay in emergency access. So that took longer than expected because they needed to do this, that, then, then. And then one day it opened. And in the meantime, though, Berghain was... opening from their former place, Osgoode. Then they found their new industrial hall and we know what's going on there now too. So I think it's fair to say that Berghain and Trezor are institutions. So what was their relationship like when they first started emerging and how have... How has the climate in Berlin changed? It's difficult to say that because you have to imagine or think that if you are in a club, labor world you are in an own world if Trezor if you work for Trezor then everything is around Trezor and I'm sure that's the same in Berghain so when Trezor was about to open again and this all happened, there was not a lot of focus of what's going on. It was just, how can we get this going, our thing now going again? And I thought, I think I was a little bit older than two. And I figured also that's a little bit, yeah, you have to be more open. And I'm not saying that as something that you say, ah, the Traserva people, or we were. not open enough. I think in general it's important that if you are in this club world and in this, how you say this, home base, that you never should... lose to watch a little bit over what's going on in Berlin, in the other cities, in the rest of the world. And I think that can happen easily. So I cannot really remember. I just know that it was about to open and Beckham was already there. And then when it was open, then of course the story started that. How can you now also exist next to Bearkine that was already established in a new location that has a history but had to establish itself again, which happened now. It's all fine. It's all great, I think. Good bookings, club is doing well, but it took a while. Yeah, so essentially you had to start from scratch, but also and sort of move forward whilst still being mindful of having all of this history. I guess that in itself is quite a difficult task. What were some of the biggest challenges and how did the team move past them? Yeah, the big challenge was to understand that in these two years, the big challenge was to understand that in the two years with no Trezor, there was a lot happening also in Berlin and that it's all different because the scene was changing, is changing all the time and was changing radically too. Plus, also beforehand, the label, I mean, the distribution, the distributors went out of business because of the... internet, digital world starting and there was a lot of struggle to keep the label going too because there was the switch from vinyl to digital and the time where both was happening but of course less vinyl sales than ever before and you had to figure that all out. and the distributors were just also more traditional way and went out of business. So we saved the label one time when the big distributor went out of business and then another time. And then I have to admit that I started to fear myself that it's time to do something else. Not because I gave up because the label was and the distribution situation changed, just in general because I was already there. 20, over 20 years. So this neatly brings us back up to date. You're no longer with Trezor, but you did admit to me that you were there a few nights ago. So you're still partying there. But no, we are here in Amsterdam because two of your Pool Proxy artists are playing at Catharsis, one of my personal favorite parties. Can you tell us about setting up Pool Proxy? What is it for those who don't know and why it's special? Yeah, to talk a little bit about what I do now with Pool Proxy is I then left Trezor and decided that I wanted to check what else could be good for me in life. and met a friend I knew from before, and he was asking me about license for film. And I said, okay, I'll come by and check out what you are doing now. And he had this agency with his partner for publicity in the digital world and also booking. And then he offered me a job in booking, and I said, Yeah, I could do that, but I'm not sure. But give me a little more time. Because I was just off and I just wanted to check a little bit around. But then I said, okay, let's do it. So I started at Proxy Booking. And then later on I became partner from Philip Hofmann, who was running the publicity department, who then decided that he would like to... quit and work in computer programming which is understandable which left me with this company which is a great company and we have two departments one is for publicity we do EP and album promo and we do bookings and I have also artists that were from traditional times. Yeah, so you're heading up the booking side of things. Yeah, let's talk about some of the roster. It's quite a nice mix of old school Detroit and newer people. Yeah, when I started the booking, working for the booking, side of Proxy then of course there were some older older artists I know from before asking if they could come and join the roster. So I took some on, for example, LMX, who I know from, again, 91 in New York City. This seemed to have been a really pivotal trip, time, moment where everything happened, 1991, New York City. Yeah, because he was introduced to me by his brother Frankie Bones and I think he was 19 or something, very white, skinny. And then he said, "This is Adam X." I said, "Oh, okay, great." So we were following each other also for a long time. Yeah, and then now I have also a few more artists he signed for Sonic Groove, but I also have a developer from Los Angeles, techno DJ, but also one that is not rising just out of the blue now. He has also his background in the LA scene. be too long now. So, and Orph-X. So I'm trying to keep the special stuff a little bit. And I also like artists that are open for corporations and think a little bit further. And of course they need to produce these days too if you want to keep on going. But I think I have some talents in there. Good artists. It's not easy. The war outside is quite hard because there's so many young DJs coming due to the recording and DJ. and software that's up now that you can use. But I still believe in the good music and that's why I can keep on going with this. That's it.
