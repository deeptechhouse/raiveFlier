Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Frankie DeCasa Hutchinson. DeCasa Hutchinson founded the Discwoman Collective and Booking Agency alongside Christine McCarran-Tran and Emma Burgess Olsen just five years ago. In that short time, they've had a profound impact on dance music by shifting the discourse towards a critique of its long-standing patriarchal structures. What began as a two-night party at a bar in Bushwick has grown into a global platform with a red-hot talent roster and events in over a dozen countries. Along the way, they've galvanized electronic music media and the international festival circuit, not to mention having an impact on local scenes. Dequesa Hutchinson is an anchor for the project, and her convictions help shape the tone and conduct of the organization. In conversation with RA's Max Pearl, we hear of her journey thus far and the struggles and opportunities facing the collective in the future. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Frankie DeCasa Hutchinson is up next. I'm here with Frankie Hutchison from the Disc Woman Agency and Collective, which is a New York-based feminist DJ collective. What's up, Frankie? Hi, Max. How are you? I'm good. I'm really glad you came on the podcast. Me too. Thanks for having me. So you just finished Dweller, which is a six-night festival of all black artists for Black History Month. Yep. I was there on Saturday. I got my ass kicked. in a techno mosh pit. I'm sorry. No, I loved it. Can you talk about what that was like for you? Sure. I mean, I've been, since we started Disc Women, kind of had my eyes on doing a project that was focused on black artists, mostly because, you know, coming into this music, I didn't have much knowledge of the history of it. And I felt like... that had been sort of taken from me in like my childhood in some way. And I felt like there was, you know, a need to kind of give that back. And so I wanted to, you know. do an event focused on black artists and at that time a few years ago wasn't any space or time for me to really allocate to that and then having going the job at bossa um it was one thing that was on my mind for sure um in the past year and then ash lorin um who does the underground and black podcast for nts she reached out to me and said i'm going to come and do an event during February and I was like ding ding ding let's just do like six days of like black artists I don't know why it was six it was just completely random I don't know and so you know I contacted people who had already contacted me asking for a booking and then also you know existing promoters who already had done nights like Confused House like Bookworms and stuff and just asked them and obviously it was a no-brainer for everyone involved to do it and they kind of chose who was involved and it kind of just all fell together in that way it was pretty simple actually yeah um what's it like doing six nights in a row in terms of your stress levels? I mean, before it started, honestly, it wasn't very stressful at all to do. And I think also working with a smaller venue and the events being free puts a lot of less pressure on you. And I also, I just felt, I was like, it just felt like natural that people would come and support an event like that. I had a lot of faith in the community to come out and sort of see this kind of project through because there's so much chat about, you know, bringing this music back to its roots. Like that seems like a very like big conversation like at the moment. I wouldn't say I was like super sort of worried about it. I think my main, my main stresses were actually just physically getting through like six days of like being there. Um, that's really hard for me and I'm actually like still recovering now. So, um, I think it's interesting in terms of like as like a barometer of what's happening culturally. I was thinking that maybe just two years ago, like an all black music festival. would have even been like controversial. You know what I mean? That would have like, you can imagine the resident advisor comments. Yeah, absolutely. Of course. So do you think it's indicative of a shift that's taking place in the way people think about this? Definitely. I think there's been a lot of artists who've just been like super vocal about sort of racism within music and stuff like that. you know, specifically like the sort of upcoming Half Moon BK crew have been speaking super vocally about that stuff. And it's really nice to see like younger voices feel that and like feel able to speak up. And so when you kind of have that. energy around it's easier to make events like that because you have like a backing to you when you don't have that community backing you come out with an event like that like You're going to get backlash. I mean, that's very simply put. It might still happen anyway, but I didn't have any fear that we were going to get backlash on this. That wasn't something that at all crossed my mind. And I feel like if someone was to do that, it'd be really strange. So I haven't seen anything actually being like, you know, what about white DJs or anything like that? What about white history? Exactly. What about our six day festival? Well, I can give you a few of them that already exist if you want me to go there. Have you seen the Fabric 20th anniversary lineup? Exactly. Do we want to go into this? We'll get there. I mean, it's just so funny at this point. It's easy. Yeah. And it wasn't just techno. I mean, like the night I was there was like noise and punk and rap. Yeah. And so you. in terms of your booking, you wanted to make it as wide as possible. Yeah, absolutely. And also, like, I mean, that also just, you know, that goes in tune with Bookworms' vision for his night too. called Confused House. It's just about sort of blurring genres a lot of the time. And like, that's something that I love just in the way that I book any show is doing that. And I think it works like really well. And giving kind of each sort of promoter sort of creative license to do what they want. you know, just provides so much more diversity of what black folks are doing in music. Like we don't just do one thing, you know, there's so much. And even like so many more days we could have programmed with different stuff too. Like I still have like so many more ideas, you know, which is the exciting part about it. So yeah. Cool. I just wanted to talk about Dweller while it was fresh in our minds, but now I want to take it back. So you're from London? I am, yes. What part of London are you from? I grew up partly in Hackney, partly in Labrador Grove, which is like West London, and then in Hammersmith. Did you grow up raving? Not when I was that young. I started raping when I was in college, when I was probably like 18. I was like super scared of like alcohol, anything, like up until the point where I was like, yeah, like 18. But, you know, that has a lot to do with like family stuff and shit like that. So just like going into my first like raving situation was just absolutely bonkers. Like I like couldn't believe people did it. Where I went to school was University of Sussex. University was weird because I was already on a different foot than a lot of people there in terms of like privilege. I didn't have, you know, money to go to university. Like a lot of kids had done gap years and traveled and their parents paid their rent. I felt very different than the other people there already. And on top of that, all these kids knew how to rave apparently. And they'd throw these massive like raves at the back of the camera. like on these massive fields and it was called the rave in the woods and then we went I went back there once and I'd never seen people on drugs or anything in my life like and I went back there and I was like what the fuck is this and I was so scared like I was completely scared like and I was like this is And then sort of, you know, there were certain things that happened in my kind of personal life at university that, and the sort of social aspect of it that kind of led me to open up more as a person and to more experiences. So I raved a lot after that. I always think it's so interesting, friends of mine who've grown up in the UK especially, like, you know, drum and bass is in your blood. Yeah. You know, or just like watching Skins and being jealous that I didn't do that in high school. Right. So is that something here in the US? It's like you're like, oh, wow, you guys don't know anything about this, relatively speaking, you know? Really? I would say I've had some like, you know, authentic rave experiences. Like I've been to some really, you know, clubs like SC1 in London that used to exist under the London Bridge sort of like tube station. It was crazy. Like this like six room rave was just absolutely nuts. crazy stuff but now it's closed obviously but a lot of stuff is closed it's club turnmills used to go to a lot closed but like so I definitely have some like quintessential like raving experiences but I've never really approached music from a real like music lover standpoint it's always been way more of a social experience for me um so I've never been one to be like you've never had that You know, like, you don't know what it was like, kind of viewpoint. I saw a tweet the other day that was like, some people don't like music, they just like parties. And I was like, well, I like parties. Yeah, I like pies, yeah. As if that's what you're talking about. Yeah, exactly, exactly. I saw that tweet too and I was about to be like, and? Is that not okay? I don't come from a super musical family, which a lot of people do in a lot of ways. A lot of people I know do. And my mom literally had three CDs in our house. We didn't have any money. We had like a CD player and the CDs were... Tracy Chapman, like one Mary J. Blige CD and like Kenny G or something like that. Like really like that was the spectrum of stuff that we had. It wasn't like I was like getting all this knowledge. I still don't have like masses of knowledge, you know what I mean? But I also like, but I also appreciate that standpoint for myself too because I feel like it allows me to be open to a lot of things. It's not something that like I'm ashamed of, of not having a lot of knowledge about stuff. And nobody should be. Everyone has different access points into music. Do you know what I mean? And like, just because you don't know, like. that techno was better 10 years ago doesn't mean you can't like techno now. It's absurd. Like, I don't understand why people are like that. So silly to me. So you came to New York in 2009? Yes. And that was, it sort of looked back upon as a time that was like pretty dead for the kind of music we like. Was that the first impression you had? Oh yeah, absolutely. And that was, you know, after that, like after being... uni for like four four years I was like so into raving and so I came here there was just like there was nothing but I also didn't really have any friends so but I do remember going out like a couple times like by myself there was like this list serve that used to go out I can't remember what it was called but It would like say what parties were going on in New York. And I somehow got onto this listserv. Party report? No. There was, yeah. There was something like this. And so I would go on these like, I was on this like listserv and I remember going to this like. I guess, a rave or party thing by myself. I was like, I'm just going to go and see what happens. And it was, it was at one of those spaces that was above like a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. But I don't remember which one it was now. I mean, it was okay. Do you know what I mean? Like the music didn't pull me in. Like I can't remember being wowed by any aspect of it. I like had fun because I was alone, but yeah. I don't really remember much else apart from that. Nothing distinctive. And it was just a constant like search for the techno beat, which I didn't find really until Bossa Nova, honestly. And we've come a really long way since then. Yes, absolutely. Sort of amazing. You know, like I was just thinking about how. 10 years ago, if you had two competing parties on one night, the promoters would be stressed out. And now we have 10. Yeah. There's enough to go around. It's like so many. Yeah. There's so much. But there's also like... It's crazy, like, I was speaking, like, our club was packed on Saturday and I was speaking to, I can't remember who it was, but someone, my friend who works nowadays, and they were like, it's packed there. And I was like, Jesus, like, everywhere's just packed. It's like, there is enough people everywhere, like. Because I think now it's just become like where people go, that area, you know, that's the area now. And there's so many clubs and choices. And that's cool. Like, I'm exhausted and can't go to any of them most of the time. And then you met Emma at Technofeminism, which was a... No, well, that was before she'd named it that. I just met her on some random Tuesday when I was getting absolutely hammered. At Bossa Nova? Yeah, and she played this song, which I was like, oh my God, this is so good. I like went up to her. And then I met her before and I was like, what is this track? And she was like, it's Cool Super. And I was like, what? And it's funny now because Cool Super and I used to like friends. And I always tell him this story because I think it's super cute because before I even knew him. And then we just became super like kind of fast friends after that. I saw her there a couple times. And it was, honestly, I met her in the end of 2013. And we'd started Disc Room by summer 2014. For listeners, Emma is Umfang, who is also a member of Disc Room. And then Christine joined. How did she get on board? Emma and I kind of were like, yes, we've got to do this. John, can we do a bar set? He's like, yes. And then I'd worked with Christine a couple of times before doing various whatever events. She was just super impressive at organization and event stuff. And that's something that like me and Emma both lacked. was that and we brought her on to kind of tighten the ship essentially and the dynamic just really clicked and it's still clicking yeah I feel like you guys have a from what I know about the way it works I feel like you have a really good distribution of labor and different strengths and yeah yeah yeah I'd say so yeah can you talk about like what's your specialty I mean my specialty is just obviously talking a lot and Being kind of sort of the vocal part of the group is definitely something I do. I do a lot of social media. I run the agency like with Christine. You know, I field inquiries of all kinds, da-da-da-da-da. And Christine handles a lot of the money and the contracting aspect of it. That's her job. And Emma, for the most part, is a full-time artist. But, you know, when we have a big decision, we all collectively make it together. And also Christine runs all the merchandise too, which is a huge part as well. For people who might not know the inner workings, as an agency, talent management and booking agency, what do you do for the artists? For instance, Shyboy has an EU tour coming up. you know we sort of filled requests to kind of fill out that tour you know we get an email they're like can I book Shai Bai for XYZ date and I'm like how much for and they say this fee and I'm like can you you know come up a little bit or that's great and then we contract it with Christine and then we add that to a spreadsheet and then we add another date and date and date and then for a tour we kind of like add up all the fees together and kind of book out travel from those fees and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. But everything's kind of different. What do you, uh, what do you look for in a, in a DJ or a producer or a musician that you want to represent? Like other than just being sick. I mean, it's a personal relationship. It's, you know, something you have to take quite seriously. So it's important that you both get along and care for each other in a way. Like, that's really at the heart of a lot of the people, the way they represent people. Like, for instance, VTSS. I just started representing here. She's someone that I've built a friendship with for a while. And it kind of just organically came about that that made sense sort of thing. She's in Poland? She's now in Berlin, but she's from Poland, yeah. And she, you know, that was something that just sort of made sense because of the way we progressed and our conversations were. So it's kind of just like that, honestly. Like we get people who reach out to us and then we get people who, I mean, I've approached people too, but for the most part, I would say it's quite an organic process. Like I've been hanging out. this artist for a bit and then we're sort of like yeah that kind of makes sense um but some people don't want to be represented by what we do either and I understand that too um I think there's, you know, some women don't want to be sort of pigeonholed into this kind of bigger movement that we do, which is why we kind of tried to separate, you know, our agency from our bigger platform by doing DW artists as sort of the separate entity, because we want them to have their own voice and individuality and it can kind of get drowned out by the bigger like disc woman thing. But, you know, each to their own. I think, yeah, it works for people. Sometimes it doesn't. Yeah, I imagine that's interesting. Some people who are like, I don't want to be an activist. I just want to be an artist. Yeah, exactly. I don't want to have to feel obligated to speak as like a voice of my, you know, demographic, you know? Absolutely. And, you know, I don't want to be in a position where we control that of other people You know, I think that agency is super important and healthy. You were saying that you're feeling spread thin. And I'm curious, like, as you are taking on more people, do you feel like it's going to be, there are going to be difficulties in scaling up? continuing to expand? It's interesting. We actually just had a meeting about this today with an accountant, actually. Sorry, a financial advisor about sort of like what we wanted to do in that way. And there's like, you know, there's definitely various different options, but we would like to sort of expand and become a bigger agency where we can like employ more people to... you know, represent more talent. Like that's kind of where I see our strength in and where I see us growing. But, you know, that takes either loans or grants or like some kind of financial, like, influx. Someone's going to throw money at us. Maybe through this. Who knows? Are you out there? I'm talking to you. I'll use my most sultry voice. But yes, that's what we're kind of like, you know. thinking about at the moment. But yeah, I mean, it's also kind of the nature of sometimes when you sort of do something that you own yourself, you have to do a lot, a lot of work to keep it sort of independent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like part of the success of Disc Woman, other than the fact that it's obviously responding to a need. is the way in which you guys are willing to play the business game in ways that maybe other people who are full-time artists like don't feel prepared to or don't want to. Is that something that you've like? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, like, I mean, me not being interested in playing music or anything like that is definitely a strength to what we do. Because you don't mix it. I'm not mixed. You know what I mean? I'm just business. And it's also like something I really love too. Like, I mean, you know, getting better at it and kind of, you know, we also still make so many mistakes as you do. And like, we're very open about that as well. Getting better at that, you get better at troubleshooting and it makes me just want to get better at what I'm doing all the time and sort of making a better. space and home for the people that we have. Yeah, but it's still like very much like a work in progress. So having gone to all these festivals and panels and events all around the world, do you feel like you can sort of see behind the curtain of like the music industry? Like, do you feel like? you have this sort of like not necessarily like the gossip but you sort of see what's really happening these sort of forces yeah definitely there's definitely like sometimes a contrived element to why people invite you somewhere you know like they don't quite understand what you do you know what I'm saying but they know that everyone else likes what you do so that's why they invited you there um and they want a piece of the action yeah exactly like And, you know, whatever happens. And then there was like an instance last year where this guy from this like, you know, quite like known like booking agency, I was sitting with him and he was talking to me about our agency and stuff. And he was like, yeah, you know, like. I really wanted, I really want to like Book of Women, but I just haven't found any. And I was like, Jesus, I can't even believe you. Why are you telling me? Don't tell me. Don't talk to me. I don't want to know that you're an arsehole, please. I already have enough space taken up by men that I think suck, but I don't need another one right now. And I just, I was just like, well, you really are the issue. Like so bold as to say like you just really couldn't find any talented women are you joking it's embarrassing well it's another thing I was going to say I feel like in in any aspect of what we do it can feel like we have made such great strides and then all of a sudden you're reminded that there's this sort of mainstream world out there where some of the changes that have taken place in this scene still haven't been felt. Absolutely. Speaking of fabric. Yeah, absolutely. It gets to the point where it's just laughable. I don't even get angry really at those things anymore. Do you know what I mean? It's like the persistence of trying to like... like book like Constantine and stuff I don't really understand like just like okay go off like do it like you're the only one who looks like a dickhead like I don't I can't there's only so much you can like fight that same point like and people don't get it like they don't like I just there's only so much that we can do in that area too do you know I mean if they don't want to care like Okay. Yeah. So speaking of people wanting a piece of Disc Woman, obviously like there's a phenomenon right now where brands and their messaging, like they're doing more campaigns that are based around empowerment because like, you know, everything from the Nike hijab, you know, it's like, it's a message that's powerful and that resonates with people. And I think advertisers are seeing that. And so I imagine a lot of people are coming to you. Yeah. Um, because they see an opportunity, because they like your message and they like what you represent. Is that hard to mitigate that and navigate those decisions? Well, we recently did a campaign with Reebok and stuff. It's mostly met with support, but then people, and rightly so, have criticism about that kind of collaboration and stuff. I understand it, but I also... You know, it's like people have to understand there's so few avenues and ways that we can survive and operate. And sometimes we have to make decisions that... necessarily aren't like the wokest thing in the world. Do you know what I mean? And that's just me being brutally honest. And yeah, I mean, it's really, you know, case by case in those situations. It depends on what they're saying. And also it just depends how much they kind of engage with what we're doing. Do they really understand what we're doing? Like what I said before. And you can tell like pretty much immediately like what's going on, you know? Well, obviously, because any sort of blanket attitude against selling out is just not going to work. Nor does it even make sense ethically. It's not, you know, as a philosophy. So I imagine it's definitely like a case by case basis. but that there's no way you can fully write that off. And I, you know, and I used to kind of like really used to get my anxiety up a lot for people to sort of think of us in that way. But, you know, they're more than entitled to, but I also like. know how hard I work and what I do, you know, and no one can really take that like away from me. Like, and that's just the reality of it. Like if people really saw everything, it would be probably have a different state of mind, I think. And you know, what's interesting is I think Disc Woman has gotten more coverage outside of music. magazines than like any other music organization um yeah like i was looking it was like npr you know the guardian x like huffington post art forum and i think it's interesting like people really like the story of this Yeah, for sure. Yeah, they did. I mean, we've been really blessed. And then, you know, when we first started, that's really kind of what propelled us onto any sort of like, for other people to see us and approach us. Like that's the reason because they saw an article about us. And so we're always so thankful for like the press that people have given us. But there does come a point where it kind of gets old, I think. You know, I like people have read every article possible about us at this point, you know, and I'm very cognizant of that as well. Like there being kind of a sell by date for this kind of thing. You know, there's always just like a cool period for these kind of things. And then that will run out at some point, which is why we focus so much. energy into the agency and that running that because that's actually like a real thing that we're doing um it's not an abstract like political like platform or however anyone wants to see it that's actual work yeah yeah that's the difference between being a collective yeah which has like more of a symbolic function and being an agency totally exactly providing a service exactly exactly um and as the face like as the press person um you've done a lot of panel discussions um and those kinds of engagements um do you ever get fatigued of like having to put on your face and talk to the press? I mean for sure like it it's always gonna be exhausting saying the same thing constantly but you know I think it's always important to bear in mind that the people who are hearing it it probably isn't their first time hearing that information so I think it's almost part of your job you know if someone's invited you there to kind of not have a really like apathetic attitude to what's going on. So for me personally, I think it's important to like put your best foot forward and like be nice. Yeah. And not look completely bored out of your brains. But it's really rare that it's like super boring, honestly. Like I honestly, sometimes I like dread it before it happens. But then it's always so nice, like, having feedback from people and, like, I don't know, people engaging over these things. Like, when we were in Japan, it was just, like, one of the most moving, like, experiences. Like, just, I don't know. It's hard to put into words, like, sort of. connecting with people in this whole other place that like I've never been or I'm not even familiar with and just having sort of the same understanding or something it's like super powerful about that yeah yeah so you you really felt like you were able to share a lot in common despite such different like yeah absolutely yeah it was so cool yeah it's just like It was unreal. I can't believe that we got to do it there. It's crazy to me. What are some of the other really exciting regional scenes that you... to see so one place that we've had a really huge connection with is warsaw uh working with like brutage and like the label there um yatsik who runs it we've become really close friends and emma was booked to play there like a few years ago and then from there we just sort of built a relationship we've done a couple disc with and collaboration parties with them And it's just so, it feels really random that Warsaw would be like really a place of connection. But it really is like, you know, the government is highly conservative and their underground is just like really crazy. Like people really go out. And I remember one of our parties like... people bought like picket signs of signs being like feminism it was like awesome like I'll never forget it because it was just like the coolest thing ever like I don't know just like that kind of thought and like just that being one of so few spaces where they can express themselves like that like in New York it's like not the same because I mean, there are a few spaces, but theirs is like one, you know what I mean? And I mean, there's a lot of places like that too. So yeah, just like the energy in the room was crazy, really crazy. Oh my God, there's so many. I can't even, Italy was great. Milan, when we did Macau, that was really beautiful too. Yeah, there's so many moments. You, like what, six months ago came on as a booker at Bossa Nova. Yes. Which for listeners who don't know, it's the coolest bar in Brooklyn. No, I'm not going to say that. But it's a tiny bar. We were trying to figure out if it was 100 capacity or 70 capacity, but it's sort of got an outsized. you know, impression on the city. I was wondering if you could tell us, like, what do you think the role has Bossa played for you and for the scene? Well, you know, the obvious one is that we threw our first event there with Disc Woman. But even prior to that, I'd been going there because Joanne and my friend Adam had worked at Trophy Bar and I was a frequent person who visited there. And then they moved over to Bossa. So I naturally kind of drifted over there as well. Just like some club rap, basically. I was a mess at this point. Yeah. And then that's, you know, when I started hearing all techno music. So it's been a huge role for me in terms of like, that's where I met all my friends. I mean, I met my best friends there in the city. I've met my business partners there. It's just crazy. And I'm not the only person who's met people there for those similar kind of reasons. There's so many stories of people like Magic Bossa, kind of. And I've always really wanted that job as well, being the booker, and I've said it explicitly. That was never given to me. And then he offered it to me and then it just sort of felt like it made sense, you know. And it's just an honor to do it, honestly. And Instagram, you talk a lot about like self-care tactics. I know you bach and you talk a lot about... I don't know, I just think you're like, you also have your advice column. So you talk a lot about what you're going through and how you deal with it. It's funny, my boxing instructor follows me on Instagram and it was like, I went to boxing the night after I posted all these things about sex toys on there, like masturbation or something. And he was like, Frankie, I went on your story last night and you are crazy. And I was like... That's why I'm here. You've only just looked at them? Like, you know, I talk about whatever. But, you know, I like to be open on there. Like, it's fun. But yes, yeah, self-care is great. Boxing has been really awesome. You know, aside from sort of like physical benefits, like it's really just great punching a bag. Like it's simple as it sounds. It's fucking awesome. And I also started going to therapy as well, which has been interesting and cool, but I'm pretty early on in it. So it's kind of hard to tell the real benefits of it, but I'm going to stick with it for a bit. And, you know, having those kind of like, think like, there used to be a point in my life where I prioritized like getting wasted a lot. I mean, I wasn't producing anything in that time. I was just like not doing much and just very depressed, honestly. So it's really like nice for me to have some structure. And, you know, I put certain things in place like paying, you know, putting my money towards going to boxing classes so that I'll commit and do that instead of prioritizing going out. And it's just really shifted my whole like schedule. Like I probably wake up at like 6.30 in the morning or 7 at now. Whereas before it wasn't like that. And I'm a lot happier doing it that way. But everyone's different. That's not for everyone, trust me. But that really works for me. I brought it up just because we're talking about BASA and working professionally in nightlife and how that can be unsustainable sometimes. I mean, it is. That's like kind of the really, really dark and sinister side of the whole scene is really like that, you know, is people struggling to keep their head above water while partying all the time and addiction problems are really rife like in any community. So it's quite scary and hard, you know, to talk about because it's also a very taboo subject, I think, a lot of the time. And also, like, around addiction, it's kind of like it's hard to help somebody who doesn't want help. And so... A lot of times you just see people kind of fall away sometimes and it's kind of a really sinister part of the whole thing and it's kind of hard to know how to address. So, you know, I think it's good to sort of like... encourage people to do other things and I really like this idea that um I can't remember who's talking about but like bars kind of like promoting sobriety in a lot of ways like having sort of you know mocktail menus and stuff like that where people can kind of engage with being at a bar without having to drink like I think that's fucking awesome like and I think there should be way more of that like I really want to try and do it at Bossa too. Yeah, I'm like terrified if one day I have to give up drinking. I'm like, am I also going to have to give up clubbing? Yeah, exactly. Am I going to be able to do this? It goes hand in hand, but it doesn't have to, I don't think. Do you get social media fatigue? Yes, I get super tired, yeah, for sure. I mean, occasionally I'll take a break, but I also run so many different ones that I can't actually ever really fully take a break. But yeah, it's exhausting, but it's okay. I'm okay with it, I think. I heard you have a South Park tattoo. I do, yeah. What's the story behind that? Is this from the dark time? This is from my dark times, yeah. I mean, it literally just says South Park on my legs. That's what it says. But my friend who just was doing tattoos at his house was like, let me give you a tattoo. And I was like, I know what I like, South Park. It's tattooed on my legs. Luckily, I still don't regret it. But as soon as, you know, I do, I think it might be easy to cover up. I remember in another interview you said your mom was like, "You're never gonna get another job, Frankie." She literally, yeah, was like, "Okay, mom." But at that time I believed her because I didn't have a job. I was like, "She's right. You're right, mom. People with tattoos don't get jobs. This is what happens in society." She was lying. Is your mom proud of the work you do? Yes. Now she knows it's actually a job. Yeah, she... I mean, she referred to it as a hobby for many years and then she realized that it wasn't anymore. But yeah, she's absolutely, I wish I could bring her with me most of the time. Has she come to any of your events? She did. She came to my show in London last year. She actually lives in America, but she was over there last year and we did a thing at South Bank Center last year and she came. Someone offered a drug, so that was interesting. I was like, okay, all right, bye mom. It's the authentic experience. That was good. Great. And what's it like going back to London, having had this experience in New York and now being involved in this scene? Um, it's strange. Like I have such, I've had such like rough experiences in London, just like in terms of racism and stuff. And it has, gives me a lot of anxiety being there sometimes. So I kind of have a love-hate relationship with the place. But there's a lot of things that like, you know, I love about it. I don't know. I don't like being there for a super long time, but a few days is cute. And it's nice being there when there's an event, because it gives me more of a purpose in that space than just being there. But it's very rare that I'm just there without something to do. And you recently started an advice column. I did. Do you like that? Do you like giving advice? Yeah, I love that. Awesome. I know, I can't believe people actually like what I'm saying. I actually was surprised, to be honest. But, you know. When you sort of speak your own truth, like people are going to gravitate to it. And I think that's what's happened. It's really nice. It feels like a therapy as well, you know? Yeah, educating the youth. Yeah, exactly. Leaving your legacy on the surface. I'm leaving my legacy, exactly. It's cool. It's not just... professional stuff you guys talk about dating and yeah it's like a mix of everything exactly I'd love talking about that stuff I would love to talk about that more than music honestly any day of the week yeah well um I heard you like to date people who don't use Twitter I do can you talk about that well I recently started dating someone who does not use Twitter, which is great. And I'm really happy about that because my Twitter is just like... I don't know. I mean, I just talk so much shit on there. You know what I mean? And actually, like, my brother is on my Twitter too. And he's like, what are you tweeting about? Like, this kind of thing. I hate that kind of feedback. I just, like, want to be left alone. So it just, it feels like an independent space for me. I prefer that. Yeah. And if I'm talking about stuff to do with that person, it's like, can I just have some privacy to talk to my Twitter people? I also read, speaking of your Twitter, that, well, today's Valentine's Day and the person you're dating spray-painted your name on a street in Prague. That's very sweet. Really sweet, I know. I was like, shit, don't get in trouble. But that's great. I'm really glad you did that. It risks your freedom. It's a beautiful Valentine's Day present. It's really, really nice. I mean, I'm 31 and I've never, ever had a Valentine's. So that makes up for all of those years. So that's nice. Thank you. Wow.
