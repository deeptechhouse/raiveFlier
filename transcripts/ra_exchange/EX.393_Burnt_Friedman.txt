Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Bernd Friedman. Talking about music with Friedman is usually a striking experience. He's the kind of guy who thinks artists should strive to be like scientists making new discoveries that are universally true. For Friedman, gravity and physics are things to be understood and respected by musicians and are of much greater importance. importance than plain old self-expression and creative freedom. As such, he's become a master of rhythm and groove, especially so in his collaborations with Cannes drummer Jaki Liebherzheit. In this conversation with Angus Finlayson, recorded in RA's Berlin office, Friedemann offers his distinctive take on what makes art valuable and his quest to harness the power of the universal rhythm. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Bernd Friedman is up next. A lot of your track titles are in French. Why is that? What's your relationship with French? Only a few track titles were in French, in fact. "Latency" is a French label. Okay. Coming out of Paris. I thought it would be a nice gesture to put the track titles in French too, because eventually I choose to have track titles in general, but I draw the decision when everything's finished for the titles that make most sense to me. And this can take sometimes a few days to find a meaning. that could be going with the piece of music and it's determining the music a little bit as well so it's not an easy process but with this french i firstly avoid the notorious english language And secondly, it's better sometimes than those numbers, because with Jaki Liebezeit, we decided to have numbers, simply because to avoid the question how to put it, with two personalities, it's more complicated than with one persona. And the numbers are always given. By the time we start working on a piece, it has a certain BPM number and a definite rhythm. So if it's 122 slash 12, we know what it means and we can remember the track. So this is the most appropriate. working title for for still for me i used to have those numbers so i'm a little reluctant to using english track titles sometimes i have german ones or french ones and i'd rather not mix the languages up on one record. This is why it may have appeared to you as if I was using French all the time, but I don't. You mentioned there the Secret Rhythms series is the tracks that you were talking about with Jackie Lieberzeit with the BPM and the number of beats in the bar as the track titles. Could you talk a little bit more about that project? Because I had kind of interpreted that titling as being to do with, you know, the music almost felt like a toolbox of rhythms and feels that perhaps someone else could go through and take one of these grooves. Or is that the way you saw it as a kind of toolbox of rhythmic ideas? It is a kind of toolbox, if you like. It's always a disappointing situation when you finish a track by mixing it down or putting it on a record because the reality is those grooves, if you like, those rhythms develop over time. So sometimes a 120 slash 5 number. would appear several times on various records over time in different versions. It's a kind of versioneering and therefore tool is the right term to put it. It represents the malleability of those tracks. Since we have rules to the game, those numbers are more or less the rules. It's an indication of what kind of rhythm and how we play it. So this is the fixed parameter, but how we do it, how we arrange it and so forth, what kind of sounds we use. can always change live and on the record. So finishing a track is actually not the nature of those rhythms. Could you talk about how you first started to work with Yaki Libertide? I've moved to Cologne in the 90s and by the turn of the century, in 2000, I came back from my annual touring to New Zealand and Australia. was asked to play a concert in Cologne, but I didn't want to do it like the many concerts I've played beforehand, standing behind the mixing board on my own mixing tracks from five minidisc players at once. So I decided to get in touch with Jaki Liebezeit, a friend of mine, Markus Schmickler. whom I had worked with during the 90s, he passed me his telephone number, so I just gave him a call, and he came over immediately, and we started discussing the music. for this gig I got offered in Cologne. We had two months time to prepare for it. So I think in the same week we got together in his rehearsal room, which is where we ended up for the next 17 years, and started puzzling out this new duo project, if you like. But at that time... my rough tracks weren't prepared so well. They weren't destined to become sequences for somebody else to play drums to. I wasn't sure about it. Jacqui confronted his philosophy of natural rhythm, which was new to me by that time, and I realized I had to compose and record new material for this concert. So actually we started from scratch from that point on. And could you explain what this theory of natural rhythm is? We are used to talk about animal nature and the human nature. but rhythms have a nature too. They have certain requirements to be played properly. And Yaki discovered those rules. He's done a lot of research, not only by his own practice, but also by researching. traditional musics mainly during the 60s or even when he was recording with can the german quote-unquote rock band that was popular and they're working in the to be precise from 69 to 79 during that period he you could hear this on can records that There's something going on which was not so much connected to Western rock music. So what Yaki discovered was that there's a nature of rhythms that could be heard in traditional musics mainly. There's a certain method that was fundamentally different from what, let's say, rock or jazz drummers were doing by that time. If you listen to Elvin Jones on John Coltrane's records in the late 50s to the mid 60s, for instance, you would hear the exact opposite. That the structure, that the groove would be destroyed by... the volition of the musician by expressing themselves. So you mean in some way that those records were going against these laws, is that what you mean? Do I understand you correctly? Yeah, the game's rules were abandoned in favor of a newly discovered freedom. And this is a process. It's still continuing to this date. And it's one of the dominating paradigms, I think, in Western music, in jazz and pop music, that people think the main aim is to express themselves. Whereas how Yaki and I see it, to play with those rhythms, they require a restriction rather than destroying the sound barriers of a genre or going beyond the boundaries or whatever. You mentioned that you feel like this tendency is still ongoing in Western music. In what locations or in what kinds of music or in what ways do you see this tendency to abandon the rules in search of some kind of freedom manifest these days? I was convinced. I knew we would touch that topic. Therefore, I brought the most actual example for this freedom fighting process. I mean, there are so many examples, but this one is quite telling. It's the Transmediale 2018 theme called Turmoil. And another theme from the years before, Discontinuity, or look at the Unsound festivals, branding Unsound. Quite recently, they've had a festival going on at the Hauster Kultur in der Welt in Berlin called No Music. There's a strong emphasis on freedom. You have to abandon the rules of music as if there was an authority that we have to fight to free ourselves. That's a paranoid hallucination. Music offers you possibilities. I see it as a gift and my intention is to understand the rules to be able to play music properly instead of abandoning those potentials. So if I'm interpreting what you're saying correctly... Are you saying that this kind of freedom fighting, as you called it, this struggle for freedom in music is kind of an expression of a Western idea of individualism and the search for complete individual freedom as being the sort of holy grail of culture or of society? Is that what you're saying? Yeah. I don't know if you've seen Adam Curtis' Hypernormalization. that was released, I think, in 2016 by the BBC iPlayer. And he was also pointing out that in the 60s, the idea of this individualism was propagated by the hippie movement, so to speak, by the dropouts. So let me quote Adam Curtis. One of the most giant shifts in recent history that started in the late 60s really took off in the 70s. was the rise of a powerful individualism, a feeling throughout Western society that began in America but came to Europe very quickly, that I, as an individual, are the most important thing, that I feel what I want is the most truthful and authentic right thing, and the idea that you should be told what to do by politicians, by those in power, is wrong. and you should be true to yourself. And it rose up. It was good in many ways. It liberated people and stopped us being told what to do by old corrupt elites. But it had a very strange effect on politics because when you run a political party, you have to get people together, unite for a single goal. But when you've got a society with millions of individuals who all have their own desires, their own truths, their own idea of what is true, then it is very difficult to get a collective movement together. And the real effect, not just on politics, was on the radicals. left because if you look at the 60s both in US and Europe it was called the new left it came out of the civil rights movement and they gave themselves up to a movement gave up years to struggle to change the world, and they did. If you then get individualism rising up, what you don't want to do is give yourself up for years to a movement which you subsume yourself into. You want to express yourself. He references Patti Smith as one of those figures who went into art instead of engaging in the collective. Free jazz came about by that time and in the 60s it was already finished. I mean, it was so radical. The freedom that was achieved in such a short time span can't be topped really. I always tell people when they are making noise, improvise noise music. me it sounds like free jazz and it's something not so radical as most proponents think it's you you can't smash any more sound barriers today so to me the most radical thing to do is not express yourself to to learn properly the rules of the music the rules of the rhythms and which is hard anyway i mean you're doomed to fail who's able to play super precise i mean the computer can but Humans can only fail. There's a lot to it. So I think that's a more interesting challenge to me to end up with something, some kind of meaningful music instead of claiming to set me free. I mean, this has been done 60 years ago. And it's almost etyrical to try that. So looping back to this certain rhetorical tendency that you mentioned in experimental music at the moment, in the transmedial theme, turmoil and things like this, do you think they found the wrong answer to the question, as it were, in a world of political turmoil, the response shouldn't be in some way to... throw rules away or to discard orthodoxies but should be to go in the other direction and look for some common aesthetic framework or a set of rules that people can agree on or how would you see a For instance, a transmediale theme that you could really get behind, that you really agreed with. How would that look? Good question. I mean, the current transmediale theme is uneasy times demand uneasy music. That cancels out our pains with pain, like einstürzen Neubauten. their claim in the 80s was heal with pain. I mean, I don't know if that's technically true, that if you have a phase inversion when you have pain or when you're depressed and listen to pain, that this would cancel out or help you overcome your depression. Maybe. I mean, I can't argue with that. But what I can argue with is uneasy times demand uneasy music. But why is making noise uneasy? To me, that's the most easiest way to make music. It's just to destroy something or to produce dissonance. So all the other things that I've mentioned, like unsound, discontinuity, no music, they all have a quest for dissonance. I don't think that's really so challenging. To me, more challenging is to get things straight, to sound properly, to create a harmony. But this is not very popular amongst those promoters, I don't think. When you talk about this idea that destruction in music is not interesting, that shredding the rulebook is somehow not, doesn't to you seem aesthetically interesting or productive, people might then assume that what you're saying is... we should stick to a very conventional aesthetic idea as propagated by Western tradition, Western musical tradition. I understand the question. Could you talk about the differences between that Western musical tradition and the kinds of traditional rules that you consider important? So the opposition is definitely not the self-expressing individual on one side. and the classical orchestra on the other side is playing according to sheets to the text in front of them. That's not the opposition, because there's nothing conventional about applying the natural laws of the music, because they're not going to change. They are unimpeachable. It's just like the laws of gravity, for instance. If you played a drum, unless you walk in space, you would have to follow the laws of gravity. This is a restriction, if you like, a limitation. That limitation is not reflected in programming rhythms so much. So that's why. A lot of the ideas that come from the natural rhythm concept, if you like, do not translate very well into how people program rhythm when they don't have a practice, when they don't have a musical background. So when we want to understand rhythm, we have to look at the source. The source is not the rhythm. It's the motion, what you do. And of course, the machine doesn't have that motion. You just set some impulses on a sequence wherever you like. And the machine doesn't care if it's wrong or right. So proper groove isn't easily found for someone who has no practice. For someone who practices a long time, it's immediately apparent where the problems lie with programming beats. So by practice you mean physical drumming? Physical drumming, yeah. So unfortunately, when drummers learn by sheets, it's like programming a sequence on a... computer or a rhythm machine, it's equally handicapped because the practice is missing. I mean, you could notate anything on a sheet and a good drummer will be able to play anything. There's nothing natural about it. But this is not how you can engender grooves. I mean, this is nothing you could dance to. If you dance, you don't aim to land on a particular spot. The dance is always about dancing. And this is the same with rhythm. You don't do this to achieve a certain cluster of impulses. You do this to have groove, something to do. It's like an energy device that needs to move somehow. So what you do is you apply minimal force to it and you find the right pathway the energy wants to flow. Depending on the certain rhythm, it would require the drummer to play in a certain way, meaning you use your left and your right hand properly to... create a waveform if you like a swing between bows that can be maintained over a long period of time easily because if it wasn't easy it wasn't natural either so the most natural the easiest way to do it is the most appropriate it allows the drummer to apply the least or to put the least effort only minimal force into maintaining the rhythm so to find the right way of playing a rhythm is most crucial. So often when you see rock drummers, they're using both their left and right hand and they're using pedals as well. It's very difficult to do that properly. Therefore, hand drummers are always more advantaged. And that's also one of the reasons why rock and jazz drummers don't understand the difference so much. And you've talked about rhythm. Does it also apply to pitch? So do you think there is a similar natural laws at work, certain pitches, certain harmonies? do just sound objectively good and others not. Is that the way that you see it? Yeah, for sure. It's just equivalent to rhythm, if you like. You could say rhythm is the infrasound of the harmony. On the x-axis, so on the horizontal axis, we have the rhythm. On the vertical axis, we have the frequencies. But the rhythm is just a low frequency, in fact. If you speed up the frequency, you reach up into a higher scale and it's becoming tonal. Or the other way around, if you pitch down and pitch down... you will eventually end up with having impulses instead of a tone. But these impulses will be metronomic if it's a monophone sound. But when you have a chord, which is a proportion between two or more tones, then when those are in harmony, you will also get a rhythm out of that. There's a law of frequencies as well as rhythms, a set of natural laws, of which one is the octave, the doubling of the frequency, and a variety of overtones which is attached to it. When you're making music, how do these ideas that we've been discussing feed into that process? So when you're thinking about... coming up with a rhythm or when you're thinking about harmony in a track, the use of chords and melody, are you very consciously referring to certain rules or restrictions that you've set yourself or are you working intuitively with what simply feels good and that tends to follow these laws anyway? When it is right, it also feels good. But it's a process which can last for quite long until the proper groove has been found. Trying to find the appropriate, most casual way of playing it, this comes first. So at the core of the music is the rhythmic motion pattern that will allow me to create the whole piece from this tiny cell of motion. Because any other impulse, be it... percussive or be it tonal will have to succumb this rhythm rule which is an harmonic rule if you like but then if everything was totally in order then that could be quite boring too so to me it's i mean i want to go into unknown territory as well if i choose to work on a rhythm number that I haven't used before, which is most exciting to me, to discover a new rhythm, a new groove, then I don't want to nail it down and then restrict it to that. pattern but what i'm doing is to allow me to be just on the edge of let's say on the edge between chaos and order so that with a tiny tilt to the left or the right everything could fall apart So in many interviews, Jackie referred making music to a football game. And I like the idea to compare it to if you play a game with somebody else or in a team, you could only play the game properly when you have a set of rules. many ways to play a game. If it's only one game, then you certainly want to win. But if you see the game more like an aesthetic effort to produce, let's say, a beautiful interplay, something interesting for the audience to hear or to watch, then you might be thinking of passing the ball onto somebody and scoring a goal is something similar like sending a signal out to your neighboring musician, making some space for him to play some more melody. And then this melody would be accompanied by the appropriate signal so you could communicate between each other while playing that game only on the basis of a set of rules because what you do is not rehearsed. That's what proper music making is about. You don't want to... just play something that was programmed at an earlier stage. So to me, a concert which would only present some pre-programmed tracks that would be played 100 or 500 times, that's not what I mean. You could say that's the game, but this game has finished before it started. There's no challenge to show. I wouldn't even say concert. That's those kinds of shows. And who would want to watch a football game that was set up like this? And in fact, that's why so many people everywhere love watching football games because it's uncorrupted entertainment. why is watching the news or talk shows so, or like these to stay with sports. watching these wrestling shows so disappointing in comparison. So I don't mind using the term rules at all. To me, they don't have any negative connotation. Electricity or gravity, this is something to discover. It's not an authority that we as a musician have to oppose to or overcome. I don't want to... overcome my nature. I want to overcome let's say, the cultural implications maybe of music making, which is the essentialist point of view that, for instance, music is always attached to a territory, like sports is attached to a territory, like the German team. opposes the French team, for instance. There was one interesting, remarkable incident quite recently when the Russian sports team... was required to stay away from the Korean Olympics because of the doping issue. But then they claimed that not all of the Russian sports people were accused of being doped. So they were offered to appear without a nation. attached to them so this was quite radical so i thought what would have happened is two possibilities the russian the russian sports people would have gone without presenting the Russian nation or they refused and of course they refused because it was their solidarity with their fellow sportsmen then it would have been amazing if let's say everybody else this would have been a real great chance everybody else would have said wow none of us is appearing in Korea without the nation sticker attached to our sports presentation that would have been something else yeah so your label is called non-place do you see yourself and your music in some way as a a Russian athlete appearing without a flag? Do you see it as a music that maybe has come from a certain geographical location but which isn't affiliated with any place, which in some way is outside of these territorial... It's easier said than done because of course everybody has got cultural imprints upon birth and before already. And those imprints are not going away. And they allow us to negotiate our identity in our community. This is essential. Everybody has prejudices and they are based on those cultural imprints. So I'm not saying we can ignore those, but what non-plays tries to represent is the fact that music is traveling anyway and music maybe has something else in it that is not determined by cultural imprints. And one of the axioms of a non-placed music is that it doesn't relate to a territory. It's the opposite. Music travels. That's the nature of it. So whenever somebody hears a piece of music and, let's say, likes it, a musician would appropriate the technique or the sound and would carry it on. That's something that automatically travels anywhere, especially in a time when we have all recorded history at our disposal at any time. So especially these days, we can realize how stupid it is to make up those identities, which I like to refer to as group identities, because I'm interested in new music. That's what I research. I like to find interesting music, but it's never accommodated by any genre. So when I stand in a record shop, I'm quite lost because all of the genres represent group identities. But the interesting stuff is, to me, always happening in between those genres. It's interesting that when you were talking just then about... process by which a musician might come across an idea and in some way replicate it in their work and in that way that music travels across geographical borders. You use this word appropriate. I don't know if you're aware, but in the last few years, there have been a lot of discussions globally about this idea of cultural appropriation, discussions about when it is or is not OK to borrow an idea or to take an idea from another culture. And I wondered if you had thoughts about this. Because obviously that in some sense could be seen to be supporting the idea of fixed group identities. You know, these ideas belong to this group. You belong to a different group and you're therefore not allowed to take those ideas. Yeah, but isn't this racism? If I would follow that logic. It's predicated on the idea that group identity is paramount. That means we are not negotiating art on the level of the individual, but on the background of cultural imprints. But the thing is, we shouldn't mix up culture and art. We have to realize that art and science belong together in that an artist and a scientist have to stand up claiming that what they do is universally right. If it wasn't so, then what's the value in science? let's say a Chinese scientist would come up and say well this is how physics work in China but it doesn't work here like in Germany we have a different science that doesn't make sense and with the artistic utterances it's the same viewpoint in a way because When you stand up as a musician or a painter, for instance, whatever you utter into the public has to be interesting. Otherwise, why bother? So an artist is in the strength... challenging position not to have any cultural institution behind him. It's a sign of independency because what an artist negotiates is his own finding. It's not a collective finding. Therefore, it is not a cultural finding. And if you look into the science world, you have similar conditions, which are individual observations that define the history of science. And to think that it could be a collective effort, it's just not the case, since hundreds years roughly we don't have any we didn't come across any major scientific revolutions maybe because a lot of scientific research is done in teamwork as opposed to individual research Going back to this idea of cultural borrowing across geographical or cultural boundaries, this idea of cultural appropriation. So you're saying that the endeavour of an artist is in some way universal or aspires to be universal and so attaching it to certain group identities. cultural groups is in some way does a disservice to the art. Am I understanding that correctly? Absolutely, yeah. That's what I mean. Maybe I wasn't clear enough. No, I think you were. But I just wanted to sort of add to that. Whilst that... perhaps is true in the abstract do you think that there are other dynamics that perhaps come into play so the reason why I'm saying this is because one thing that you said in another interview stuck in my mind which is that western musical culture is a kind of soft imperialism. It's like an exercise of imperial power. It's imposing a certain set of cultural norms across the world, certain chord progressions, certain kinds of rhythms. And I wonder if you thought that this kind of borrowing from a Western musician of music from other places could also in some instances be... an exercise of a kind of soft imperial power. You mean some kind of exploitation? Sure, yeah. Yeah, well, the question is, what do you do with that? If you sampled someone, let's say a gamelan orchestra, how far would you go with that? I always say, why reissue all the records from the 70s out of Africa, for instance? Why put the effort into uploading some rare tape to the internet, to the world public? Was it in the... the purpose of the originators to be exposed to such an enormous public forever. So yeah, this could be termed exploitation, but what I think is not. under exploitation is when you make music with that yourself, make your own stuff, I think, and appropriate the musical method because the musical method... is based on those rules and they are the same everywhere. For instance, that's why I say the universal lies in the local, which means there are commonalities between local groups of musicians in the way they produce the music, in their methods. For instance, if you look at the way people play percussion, the rhythms they come up with are the same often in very disparate. parts of the world there are commonalities not in sound but in the structure not necessarily in the tunings too much but even there you could you could say at least the octave and basic harmonies are common everywhere even between groups who have never ever heard of each other. So that's not exploitation, that's proper use of natural laws of music, if you like. But I mean the devil is in the details because of course when you sample somebody else's music then that's clearly some form of exploitation and the West and in the East is never going to change and it's very lame. Some musicians say everything's been composed anyway, so why bother? You can't come up with anything new. But I don't really buy that. It's, I think, an excuse to do, to apply sampling and finally regurgitate the same soup over and over again. When you last spoke to Resident Advisor, when you spoke to Will Lynch, one thing you said was that electronic music... offers freedom, the freedom to break free of musical idioms because it allows you to, I guess, transcend the familiar sounds and familiar musical modes of certain physical instruments. But I wondered when you look at electronic music now, what you think the state of... that freedom is. Do you see that freedom being exercised in contemporary electronic music or not? And why might that be? Well, I think you're right. There's a promise with electronic music and promises that could be something new, but often it is referring to a new sound rather than new music which is form and sound to me or if you say if you like form and color the color to me seems quite arbitrary so at the core there is a form something that drives the proportions of the rhythm or the harmonies how it's set or played out in time And it could easily be something acoustic or electronic. Just imagine a drummer on an acoustic set of drums playing the same groove. But while he's playing that groove, he would replace the acoustic set of drums by an electronic set of drums. And he would play the same groove, but the sound would immediately drastically change. Why would the music, the music hasn't changed. The drummer is continuing playing, executing the same kind of groove. So it didn't change. Only the sound changed. Why would the music from then on be termed electronic when it was acoustic before? I don't really get it. So maybe make the mistake when we... analyze electronic music that we put the focus on our hallucination of electronic music which is maybe not very sharp so we would need to be more precise I think electronic music techno music or what kind of music? Well, it would be interesting to talk about techno music in particular, because I understand that that was something that you had a certain enthusiasm for earlier on in its history and perhaps have lost that enthusiasm over the years. So have you seen a kind of a gradual shrinking of that? of possibility or freedom in that kind of music, in dance music, in techno music? I don't expect everybody to puzzle anything out or reach, aim at the best or at the most challenging, not at all. Because even though on a resident advisor page, for instance, Thousands of people are considered artists. I don't see so many artists amongst the people. I see designers, public servants like DJs, record selectors. These are the types of people amongst the term artists. So I have a different approach to music in general, but I don't expect everybody else to have the same approach. I investigate a lot of time to practice and to go into unknown territory and come up with something new because that's, to me, what creativity is about. If it wasn't something new, then what's creative about it? I don't see it. So this can only be managed by acknowledging what's been done already. So if I look back into the past. I have to see, I mean, there's just probably a tiny spectrum left to do, but this is exactly what I'm interested in. It's increasingly challenging to do that. Of course, if I listen to most functional music, like techno music, you can hardly find it. So that's a bit disappointing to me, but maybe that's exactly what other producers want. So I can't measure it with my own demands. But what I'm saying is I claim that an artistic position is not painting the same picture 500 times. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
