Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music. landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Riva Star runs into a bit of trouble sometimes. Too pop for the underground, too underground for the mainstream. But that's just the way that he likes it. His motto? Don't follow the rules, make them. Too full of energy to sit still for long, Star started with drum and bass, made his way to breakbeats under the name Maddox. and finally got to house just as he was touching down in London at the turn of the century. Inspired by the way Jesse Rose and Claude Von Stroke were injecting a bit of fun into the genre, Starr's productions since have been typified by a tongue in his cheek and an ear that wanders around the world in search of new sounds. This has led to huge success and a massive amount of touring. We started our recent conversation talking about the downside. How, because of his constant evolution, journalists and fans often have a hard time pinning Riva Starr down. I think people have a certain idea of what you do and maybe it's not what you think you do what you know you do yeah I know I know and sometimes it's pretty much the same for you know for a lot of people like I remember a friend of mine just told me that He had like three dogs, two big dogs and a very small one. The thing is that they grown up together. They're growing up together and the small one think to be a big dog, acting like a big dog, but he isn't. So he really believes he's a big one. you know sometimes it's really funny but yeah i i should probably take care more about you know like also the the the cool image side of my of my project but you know what um i'm pretty much a producer i'm not marketing manager and sometimes people are lucky because they have a good image or they find the cool trend, they wear the right sunglasses at the right time, with the right picture, with the right sun on the back and they... They become like, you know... But yeah, I agree with you because I come from a musical background. I used to work with a lot of musicians and stuff. That's why you will never find myself producing one style of music. I should probably use different names and I will probably do in the future but because I will do very different kind of music. it fits within my house style. For me, everything is welcome in my production. I can use real instruments, like I was using some brasses for this kind of Balkan experiments I was doing. Or maybe I will use some real orchestra for my next album and stuff, but it will always be Riverstar. In my mind, I've got a whole orchestra and every time someone just comes out and expresses himself. Yeah, it's interesting the perception thing you mentioned, using different names for different sounds and how that might be a good thing and a bad thing. Once someone has a perception of you, whichever the first track that they hear, I am drunk or something like that. I remember reading a lot of interviews saying, oh, you're a Balkan house producer. And you were like, no, that's just. one track, that's one thing I do. That's why the second single was completely different. I mean, I could definitely, you know, I had like 10 tracks I made on that style because I just wanted to try and make something different. But the whole album was completely different. And the second single was completely different. Again, I could easily just make the same thing and go top in beat porting. gain and getting you know a nice major contract and whatever but it's like it's pointless because it's not my style it's i mean it's just i'm having fun with music i know that sometimes it might sound strange to someone because you know like to a lot of people music is just a business at least looks like lately you know people are serious yeah i mean no it's not just about that it's like like people is more is busier trying to copy what's going on and what's charting and rather than having fun in making things you know like okay you you make a hit with this kind of sound okay i will do 10 you know like copies of that one so i'll be sure i make like 10,000 downloads every freaking release till people will get bored and then let's see what's going on. I don't like to reason like that. And I don't mind if people don't understand me. or don't want to understand me, you know, because I find a lot of people around that just understand, you know, my path and what I'm doing. I'm basically someone that is just having fun with music and I try to make it real, to be true to myself, which is more important than trying to appear true to people. How did we get to Riva Star? How did we get to the point where Riva Star began? You were doing... breakbeat and drum and bass under a different name and then you moved to London and then RivaStar began? Yeah, I basically started from scratch when I was 30. So I've been doing... I was born like a hip-hop DJ basically doing scratching and turntablism and stuff with my small crew. we're teenagers in Naples and stuff and then I you know from hip-hop you just speed it up and then it comes becomes breakbeat or drum and bass so I was doing this radio show on an Italian radio it's very underground radio and yeah playing all sort of breakbeats and stuff so I got like a big funk collection of records and so I come from the funk basically anyway and And then after a while I got bored. There's another problem of mine. I just get bored really quickly about, you know, things. I just want to try and find something fresh that excites me, you know, in order to make something that, you know, might excite people as well. I think there's a kind of connection. If you don't have fun, people don't have fun anyway. It's the same as DJing. If you are just DJing for money or for whatever. I really believe that people are still kind of feeling that you are not having fun. At least the people I care. So I decided to stop with breakbeat and to move to London. I've been playing in London for a few years, like Fabric and stuff, so I decided to... Sorry, you decided to stop with breakbeat. Was it because you were bored with where that sound was going? Yeah, I mean, when you arrive to the point where 99% of the tracks you're playing are yours... or from your friends. I was doing stuff with Santos at the time and we had a project together called Trouble Soup. We were very prolific. I mean, we've been doing a lot of tracks since the early days because, I don't know, probably we got an old school way to make music. I got my analog mixer, some keyboards and stuff and our style is very simple. I mean, so... Yeah, after a while we were just bored because we were finding, and that's the transition point, you know, like a lot of very interesting sounds coming from San Francisco or from Jesse Rose labels and stuff. So Barclay and Jesse were my, you know, my main references when I moved to house music. And to be honest, my early releases, my first releases are on Dirty Bird and Front Room, which I think still are two of the main underground and forward-thinking labels. Dirty Bird is still doing a lot of good things at the moment. Front Room is a bit slowing down at the moment, but they were huge. and um and i was it was unreal for me to release my first two you know releases onto of such big labels and um so i decided to move to london so um i was pretty much bored of all the the scene going on in italy and what i wanted to do was different from you know what was going on there so i just decided to move and then i moved to london in previous interviews it it seemed like you felt like you also had hit a ceiling in terms of how popular you were. could get in Italy with what you were doing yeah of course I want to make a living with my with my job as well you know and I've been doing underground stuff for ages man I mean I'm 37 now and I've been DJing since I was 13 14 so I just arrived to the point where I wanted to spread out my music a bit more. And in Italy I've been doing several projects now with different names for major labels as well, like Virgin and Aedil in Italy and stuff. And every time it seemed like all your work was reset, every other time. And then I decided to move. And also because I was not living very well in Naples. As you may know, it's a difficult city. And I was feeling like breathless over there. So I decided to move also because I wanted to change lifestyle. So there was a good... underground no no no but there's plenty of very nice things in Naples but you know like living there for 30 years just make you I mean fed up of some things And I've always been in London, like, with my head, with music. Like, I was going there to buy records at least a couple of times each month, you know, in Soho or Black... I used to go to Black Market when I was playing drum and bass or Vinyl Addiction when I was playing breakbeat, you know. It was like the finger-licking labels record shop in the basement. And, you know, so I had a lot of... friends there i was playing fabric uh as a maddox you know my breakbeat um project since 2002 2003 or something so i had a lot of friends there and i was spending a lot of more and more time there it seems like also musically the city is more well suited to what you do basement jacks you mentioned yeah exactly and they're taking things from everywhere London seems like a city that just so if I should choose like a perception I would like people you know to have of me would be something like basement jacks or you know in a way probably groove armada definitely fat boy slim Not for the style of music, exactly the style of music they make or they've made, but because of the approach they have in music, you know, like No Boundaries, just having a wide music culture and they have no problem in just, you know, picking up things here and there and just making their own, you know, mix of what they like. And I'm a big lover of bass, as you may know. So I try and, you know, like they've been big inspiration for me. And so it was unreal for me when I managed to make a track with Fat Baseline, to be honest. Yeah, this just came out recently. Yeah, it just came out like... the end of early December. It's been top 10 house for weeks now, so I'm pretty happy. And also, again, some people just don't understand that it's just a fun track. We are just having fun. What is it called? Get Naked? Get Naked. We are just birdie men. Yeah, just birdie men trying to... to let people know who he is. Do you know who I am? You have to get naked right now, man. And also the video is a spoof of Duran Duran. Even Simon Lebon just tweeted it on Twitter as a Christmas gift. I mean, I know that if you want to be super cool, you have to be more serious, but it's not my thing. I like to have fun, as maybe my friends may know. and if I want to remain true to myself I have to express this funny attitude into my tracks as well. Of course I've got some serious sides as well but you know. It's part of my personality. I can't hide it and I don't want to fake it. Exactly. You mentioned bass being a big part of what you do. I was looking at the SoundCloud mix that you just put up and it said, don't play this through laptop speakers. Please play it on a good system. Is that something you're very adamant about? That your music needs to be heard on good sound systems? Well, in general, music would need to be listened to on a good sound system. But because there's a lot of young listeners, they were just born with laptop speakers. So sometimes it's... And like a lot of DJs surprisingly just listen to promos on the laptop speakers. It's like oh no You joking? I mean at least put some headphones on or whatever because I mean if you do club music I think bass is a very important part of the track and and sometimes you miss the the soul of the track if you if you don't feel the bass in the right way Plus this particular mixtape I'm doing, Back to the Bass, is just based on bass. And there's no point to listen to it on a laptop speaker. You miss probably 90% of the vibe of the mix. You, in previous interviews, have regarded Club as a laboratory. for your own productions, I suppose. And I guess that goes back to that idea of bass being so important. You have to hear your own stuff to make sure that it's, you know, EQ'd correctly and has everything correctly. Are you doing a lot of tweaking to tracks after you hear it for the first time in a club? Okay for me it's a bit tricky because I play and mix everything analog so when you make a track and and then you look pretty much satisfied with the mix down and then you start mixing some other tracks so just all the mixer settings are gone and then after a few weeks you realize "oh no, maybe it will take a bit more of this, a bit more of that" it's never gonna be again the same sound so you have to deal with it if you want to be an analog producer, analog music producer. But yeah, sometimes I really need to play it in the club and see how it goes. But now I just bought some DJ booth monitor to put in my studio with a mixer. So when I do the mix down, then I just play it on the DJ monitor. function one monitors and so I can have that you know the club feel a bit more which really helped me because you know it's a good reference it's different from the studio speakers they are a bit more you know set for mixing. You want some other kind of punchness as well when you are into the club. So maybe a track that sounds good to you on the monitor speakers maybe sounds strange or different on a DJ speaker. So that's why I bought this one and I do the double check every time and this really helps me. But at the same time you're traveling quite a bit so you must be doing some work. on your tracks? I do everything while I travel. Yeah. And I go to the studio, I just plug my laptop to the sound card and all the equipment and I mix it down. I couldn't make so much music without, you know, my laptop and without working while I travel. This is the only way I can do that. I lately had a son as well, which takes probably 70% of my free time when I'm not traveling or working or whatever. So yeah, the only way I can do stuff is just working. And I'm actually working now just with Ableton Live. and logic sometimes and this really sped me up, I mean doing things, whatever so on. And I actually did all my new album on Ableton even if I've been working with musicians and plenty of tracks and stuff and it's really changing my way of making stuff as well. How has it changed your way of making stuff? Because probably with Logic it was everything a bit slower, a bit more, you know, like on... I don't know, maybe I was too much used to the working technique of Logic. So when I started a track, when I was starting a track, I was like, okay. I should start like this and like that. It was always the same thing. And with Ableton, sometimes it's different. Every time you just find a different starting point from a sample, from a kick drum, and every time there's a new thing that just... give you some different ideas or whatever and for me it's definitely easier and for my style it's probably even better because I like short loops as well in the tracks and I like to play a lot with glides. you know um transpositions and and stuff and it's just it's the right software for me at the moment so it's really helping me a lot what analog gear could you not live without what do you rely on the most i got a few beats um i just bought some new speakers and they're amazing talking about bass, they are called Barefoot Micromain 27 and they are really just helping me to improve my sound even more. On the B side of Get Naked, this track with Fabio Suleim, there's a track called Flexi Lady, which is the first track I did with these speakers. I don't know if you listened to it, but it's... very basic, it's all about bass and then my mixer of course, I got like a German mixer they are called ADT Audio, they were the old Telefunken I don't know why they changed name, maybe for legal issues or whatever but it's a 16 channel mixer and it's amazing, it's so warm and very punchy and then I got a Distressor, which is something between a compressor and a distortion machine for the bass and the kick drum, and I got my Moog for the bass. You mentioned you had worked with Santos, and I've also... seeing you talking about how jesse rose among other people have kind of given you tips along the way and sort of helped you out are those the two main guys that you've learned a lot of your well of course uh barclay claude monstro as well he was absolutely the first one to release one of my record my first record ever um he met jesse and uh and i got a lot of friends i you know like on the way I just sometimes for some reason of course I have I just you know connect with people that are closer to my way of looking at things and stuff. But I'm a nice guy, so I'm friends with everyone. And also because I have this label, Snatch, where I can just release stuff that sometimes is even different from my style, but that I like to play in the club. And this label is doing really well at the moment, so I'm pretty happy about it. I'm getting some new friends, also from some unusual suspects, some people that it's usually far from my style or my scene or whatever. I was kind of interested by looking at the people who have released on the label. It's a good thing and a bad thing that it doesn't seem to have. a defined style you know you know all these people kind of cherry picked from all over the place yeah was that always the mission when you when you began for me there's no point to i mean uh i got a few releases of big names like sneak of course and um and a few remixes. But I try and work with new people or people that are saying something different or fresh or whatever. I'm trying to sign a lot of Italian producers because I still believe there's a lot of very good talents over there. and they have problems like in i mean i know that it's hard you know to make things in italy it's very like one in a million kind of you know chance um and um yeah so i mean my main aim is like to to try and release fresh and different stuff something that really just blows in the club and really works in the club. Even if it's not that kind of stuff that might go on the charts on Beatport or whatever, because Beatport seems to be the reference at the moment. But if it works in the club, I'm happy. Sometimes releases do 100 copies, sometimes they do 10,000, but it's like, you know, good balance and I'm still happy with all the releases. You mentioned it's very hard for Italian producers to get noticed. Why do you think that is? I mean, from an outsider's perspective, it seems like... Italy has a great infrastructure for clubbing, like huge amounts of crowds. You always hear about Italians going to Ibiza and, you know, the Italians in the crowd. Like, there's clearly an appetite for music there, but the producers don't seem to be coming. out of their international prominence. The funny thing is that in Italy there's big clubs, big structures and stuff, but they just love foreign DJs most of the time, 90% of the time. There are really few DJs that just are big in Italy. or maybe i i had i had to go back to london and you know come and play in italy from london like kind of half english dj you know to become someone you know that might go into the big clubs in italy And now I did, because I moved to London, I had the chance to work with big artists in Italy and I did a couple of tracks that were really big over there. I Was Drunk was really big and I did a track with this Ragamuffin band over there. Still talking about crossover shit, no? And it was huge there. So now I do a lot of really great parties in Italy. It's probably one of the countries where I got more requests. Yeah, but because I was in London, I've been working in Italy trying to, you know, make things for a number of years. I think it's a natural inclination, though. Like, if you're living in a city, to take whoever is there for granted and to go out to see, oh, this person is from Detroit. coming in type of thing. Of course. I don't get a chance to... There should be a balance, no? Of course. Like in Berlin, you got this, but you got a lot of promoters trying to push the local talents and stuff. So that makes even more difficult for local talents to grow up and to get the chance. Even if you make a couple of gigs a month... you know you got enough money to to just stay at home and try to make music without you know wasting time and doing other jobs because you need to pay the bills and stuff you know that's it's a circle if you know what i mean and it's hard for them even to get a gig in a month which is like something that just makes it hard you know to be prolific in music what is up with the album yeah i've read that you were working on an album it's almost finished actually okay uh well it's even more different from the previous one it's a song based album but because i i'm still a club dj and uh and i'm a hard worker I'm just finishing this song based album and I'm going to do a club version of the same album. Try not with some different tracks. I did a track with Chromio, which is more club here than, you know, the style of the first album. So it's going to go just on the club version album. So it's going to be. Yeah, two different album one song based with a couple of singers one main singer he comes from leases leads it's called Russell and he's amazing and I've used a few samples a few musicians as well and um it's pretty much different it's definitely not just club a club album i would say it's kind of pop popish album but i hope it's good pop you know it's something i like to listen to and um and yeah it's gonna be different it's just something that i was feeling and uh is it gonna come out on snatch Probably the remix versions. I'm gonna do some remixes myself and I'm gonna ask some friends to make remixes. So I want to still keep the club feeling, you know, but then doing something different as well. Because as I told you, I like to have fun in music and I do plenty of club singles on my label as Riverstar as well. So there was no point to make just a club singles album, if you know what I mean. And also I had the experience of the previous one, when you release 10, 11... tracks all at once and all of the tracks are clap clap tracks no one will buy everything unless you're skrillex of course or unless you buy the tracks by yourself sure so so yeah i just wanted to do something different a lot of people will hate me hopefully someone will love me some new one The amount of club gigs that you did last year was slightly ridiculous. It was the year before as well, and maybe even the year before that. Is it too much? I mean, is there a break? Can you see I got no air in some parts of my head and everything is white on the sides. Yeah, I did roughly 200 gigs last year, 190 something. I was finding myself doing three gigs in one day in August as well, like for a few days in a row, crazy. But I just wanted to do that because it was my... you know like with a big single and stuff and I know that it's pretty much based on the on the like press volume and people talk volume you have no So I just wanted to make the most of that year. I was like super energetic because I had my first baby, I had my album out, I did a compilation with one of my favorite labels from back in the days, Defected. And I did a few things here and there, a few big remixes for bands that I used to love. stuff so i was like okay let's go let's do that but i can tell you now it was too much i had fun i mean the last few weeks i was like oh god i hate this job now i don't want to feel like that so i decided to stop for a few weeks and i'll feel better and ready to start again but i'm a bit more picky now with gigs and stuff so trying to Also because of the baby I don't want to spend more than one, maybe two weekends, you know, gigging, touring or whatever. The biggest tour I'm going to be doing is going to be in America in March. It's going to be a three-week tour because of the WMC. We're going to do the Snatch Party. and I got a huge tour in America, like three weeks, played pretty much everywhere. But other than that, I just, even in Asia, I just go there for a weekend and just come back because it's becoming too much for me at the moment. So the baby's growing, first words and stuff. And every time I was finding myself, every time I was touring, even for just a weekend, and then coming back on the Sunday, something new was happening to him. I know first word, walking or whatever, always when I'm touring, it's like, oh man, wait for me. So yeah, at least for now it's going to be a bit more, also because I want to make more stuff in, you know, in the studio and touring just, you know, destroys you. It's like, so. Do you find yourself, Do you regard yourself as more of a DJ than a producer? Or is it equal at this point? That's a good word. I don't know. I was born as a DJ first, to be honest. With 10 vinyls playing at the birthday parties in the 18-year-old birthday parties in Naples. So playing whatever and stuff. So yeah, I'm basically a DJ, but probably there's just a three years difference since I started producing. So I equally love both. And for me it's like, I mean it's good if you are like a club music producer, it's good if you are a DJ as well, because you know, there's nothing better than that, because you only can understand what you like to play and which kind of people you want to connect to with your style. and how to experiment with your stuff in whatever way. So I'm totally respectful of every kind of music. I mean, I find very stupid if people just judge you because you do like mainstream, club, trance, bangers or super cool, minimal, Detroit, break, hippie kind of house or whatever. You know, like it's just like at the end of the day, it's just taste and it's music. So whatever you do, you have to be respectful of the other people because it's something that just can affect your way of thinking about people if you don't even know them. And that's really important even in the way you make music. Because I feel that sometimes people just make music because, talking about perception again, because they want to appear in a certain way. And sometimes they don't even feel that. Or even when they play, sometimes you feel that they're getting bored, but they have to play that kind of music if they want to be in that scene, and they want to be represented by that. scene and be friends with that cool DJ otherwise the other DJ won't love you it's a difficult world if you had any advice for someone coming up you mentioned earlier about the laptop speakers this like younger generation If you had any advice for someone coming up as a producer or a DJ, what would it be? Well, I think they should be original. They should be original and just try not to please everyone and do whatever they like because that's the main thing. I mean, I was talking with this guy, I won't make any name, but he made an amazing first release on a very big label. And then after the first release, he was just trying to emulate other producers and stuff. I was like, man, you are... fucking ridiculous on that release. It was your first release, it was banging sounding, it was fresh. Why now are you trying to please someone else because you want to go on that label and on the other label? I mean, the label that released that track is usually releasing different stuff. And you know why they released that stuff? Because it was fresh, it was good, it was different. So he got much more promotion on that release than in 10 other future releases. So for me, being original is the main thing. Being original and trying to make stuff that you really feel that you like to play in the club if you're a DJ as well. That's the main thing.
