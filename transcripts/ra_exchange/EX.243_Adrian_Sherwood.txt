you Hello and welcome to Resonant Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Aaron Coulte and I'm the news editor at Resonant Advisor. Adrian Sherwood's love affair with reggae began as a teenager in High Wycombe. He started DJing in his early teens and then threw himself into the music industry. By the time he was 20, he had run a record shop, set up a distribution company, and run multiple record labels. In the 1980s, he forged a name for himself as a producer, putting his own distinctive, uncluttered stamp on all... kinds of music from reggae to industrial to jazz. The number of projects he's put his name to is staggering. He's made Psychedelic Afro Dub with Africa Head Charge, remixed Depeche Mode, hit the studio with Lee Scratch Perry, dabbled in experimental hip-hop with Packhead and overseen reggae collectives like Singers and Players. He burst out of the blocks in 2015 releasing a collaborative album with Pinch and announcing a new compilation series called Sherwood at the controls. He stopped by a London office this week to discuss the highs and lows of his four-decade career. How did you discover reggae? I think like a lot of people in England, our society is quite multiracial, so we were listening to every type of music, you know, pop music. The first exposure to reggae would have been Milly Smalls' My Boy Lollipop. when I was probably six years of age or something, I think, when that came out. But, you know, you viewed that just as a pop song, we didn't say, this is reggae, for example. Then I started hearing the skinhead reggae stuff, and I, again, just saw it as pop music, I didn't think, oh, this is particularly, I was, like, analysing it. When I reached 12, I used to... I started getting really into what was coming, the flow, because I was buying the pop tunes. I was running a little disco at school from the age of 13. But the consistency of good tunes coming that we knew were coming from Jamaica. I also liked Calypso's at the time, you know, the mad... I used to like the Rude records to start with. Things like Prince Buster's Big Five and the novelty Jamaican tunes. And I was buying them in tandem with John Tonkus or T-Rex or Slade or whatever else I might have been buying. Plus, I was really into the soul stuff, like all the other kids, Tamla, all the Motown Chartbusters stuff. But the reggae just went on and on and on with like one gimmicky tune or one rude tune or one funny one, which is what got me into it to start with. And then these amazing songs came after. So I think what got me into it was I had a particular friend, Gilbert Barker, who is sadly dead now. but we were best friends and I used to sit with him and his sister in her room while she steamed her hair, listening to one of those little record boxes, you know, the little box in your bedroom and just putting one seven-inch on a pile of them after another and listening to Cherry-O-Baby by Eric Donaldson or Count Prince Miller. meal train or whatever else and then one thing led to another I became quite obsessed with it and as you mentioned there you got sort of started in with DJing as well tell me about Newlands and what that was like The Newlands Club was a soul club in the town originally. It was run by Joe Farquharson, who had lived in South London, had been to school in South London. And it was really weird because he'd moved to High Wycombe with his wife, Carol, and he'd promoted dances in London. And my father died when I was five. And he lost everything when he became ill. It was quite a sad story. My mum had a really hard time. But he owned three hotels in London. And one of them was called the Liam Court Hotel, which is on Liam Court Road in Streatham. And Joe, the first ever dance he ever put on, which is in the early 60s. because he was Joe's, got to be 16 years older than me. And he put it on in my dad's hotel when my dad owned it. So it was a really weird connection we had. And he became like a father to me, but he started the Newlands Club. And it started as a soul club and then it became more of a reggae club. It kind of, you know, the weather and the demand and... Some people stopped coming. And we started DJing there, my friend Steve Graham and I, in the afternoons with our little roadrunner disco show we had, playing to the under-15s on a Saturday and a Sunday, eventually. First Saturday afternoons, then as it got more and more popular, we did both a Saturday and a Sunday. And eventually I'd play early evenings, even though I was underage, while people were coming in and, you know, before the main act would play. So I ended up... playing alongside some really great people like Emperor Roscoe, Judge Dredd, Johnny Walker, even Dave Lee Travis down there, Steve Bernard. We then had Benny King down there. We had Johnny Nash actually opened the club. This was where it was more soulful because he was a friend of Joe's. We had some matte things down there. Was it kind of unusual to have names like that going to a venue in High Wycombe or was that happening across London at the time? Well, I think everyone was looking for venues. That club, you know, we could see, I think they squeezed in 900 when Johnny Nash was in by taking the windows out. You know, it was that kind of time. I think the club comfortably held, you know, say, well, not comfortably, but you could squash in 500. And that's to this day a venue where, you know, a big act would play. You know, nowadays if a band's wanting a gig, you know, it's good. they've got a gig on a Thursday night or a Friday. Or Thursday night, you know, maybe on a more provincial place. But, you know, why not? It's good playing smaller clubs. And if you've not played High Wycombe, High Wycombe at the time was, you know, a couple of years later, the whole punk thing, the Nags Head with Ron Watts and everybody were promoting dances. We promoted the Town Hall in later years, you know, a couple of years after that. Chiltern rooms, there was lots of things going on in Wickham. And it sounds like there was quite a bit of momentum there until one summer the weather was just too good, too warm, is that right? Well, what happened, the club was doing well and then I think, you know, with a really hot summer, people don't want to, when it's like 85 degrees, be in a hot club. And that summer was the balance when it went from being more like a balance between soul and a bit of reg to being nearly much more reggae. And that, to be honest with you, for business, it was quite well known at the time. you know, the reggae fans would come and have like two special brews and a spliff. And the soul boys would drink 10 pints and their girlfriends would be swilling baby sham all night. So as a club owner, you're much better off having a soul crowd. And then that really, I think, sadly, because obviously I'm a reggae head, but that was more like the end of the club in the long run because it couldn't sustain itself on the... The reggae crowd didn't help keep Newlands going. Although, you know, that was where I think Rodigan played, if I'm not mistaken, his first or one of his first gigs. Because he was from Oxford, just, you know, David. And he worked a lot with Joe, putting dancers on at a lot of holiday camps. These are two kind of like West Indian parties and stuff. And Dave was a big player in establishing a lot of that. And how did things evolve from DJing at Newlands? getting more deeply involved with the music industry? Well, Joe, again, was my link. He kind of took me under his wing. He was like a father to me. And in the 60s, he'd worked for... the Palmer brothers, and it worked in promotion. And he did work with, you know, Max Romeo on the Wet Dream record, that Wet Dream campaign, which if anyone doesn't know, is a rude reggae record, again, that I'd known prior to knowing Joe. And it also worked... With the promotion department for the clubs. They had a club, I think it was Club 67 that Palmer's owned, and they also owned, to this day they still own, I do believe, Jeffrey's got the Apollo Club in Wilsdon. and Palmer had gone out of business when they had that property crash, I think it was 73, and enrolling the tights, you know, then they'd, well, 72, and they were just, like, trying to re-get everything back together again. again. So they started at Palmer Records and I got a little job there when I was 15 running around the north of England. I stayed at my uncle's up in Lancashire in Leyland and I was going up to Wigan where the Wigan Casino was and all these odd places. promoting the new releases that Palmer had just put out on the train. I was doing train jingles and going around doing a promotion campaign for them. With the goal of trying to get these other record shops to take these things in or...? With the intention of trying to get the record shops to take the stock. Also... Palmer had a catalogue of Northern Soul stuff, Clifford Curry and other things, so I went up there and saw Russ Winstanley and his partner and did a couple of things there. And then I was trying to promote, I think it was Wolverton Mountain and Claudette Miller, Tonight's the Night. the reissue of Wet Dream on the Ocean label and a few other things. And he'd also done Sinners, Where You Gonna Run, and Reggae Hit The Town, and was just reissuing, was trying to get Palmer Records back again. And I then ended up working in a shop for a while. Then I got my driving licence, and I could go back and forth. Wickham to Halsden quite quickly because it was not actually that far and you know like a 45 minute drive in those days or something and then I finished myself at college And Joe said, "Look, the Newlands Club's had it basically by then. We were promoting things in other venues." And I was helping him. I was doing stuff I think called Interspin all around Hillingdon area in schools as well. And then he proposed to me we started a little distribution company. And that was J&A Distribution. Tell me about how that lasted for a couple of years. Tell me about that experience. Well, J and A, it should have just been called J-A. It stood for Joe and H for distribution, but it should have been called J-A, you know, as well for like Jamaica. We had a few friends driving, Frank Rock, Dr Pablo, Pete Stroud, Richard Charlton. The problem we had, though, because it was like embryonic days of distribution, we were operating out of 78 Craven Park Road to start with, which is where Jetstar started. And he definitely took the idea, well, if they can do it, I'm going to do it after when we moved out. And that's when he started Jetstar after we'd done J&A from the same building. The problem we were facing, we were taking all the little labels like Ethnic Fight, Click, we had Grove Music, all the little labels. They all had their own van and they'd go and distribute all over the north of England. It really wasn't worth their while a lot of time. Unless they had a new release, they'd be going up there, driving to Huddersfield, and the bloke would embarrassingly buy six singles off them or something. It wasn't perhaps worth having your own van. So we made the proposal to each of the labours, look, give us a discount, we'll do the distribution for you. But the margins were so small that by the time we were distributing Virgin and they were giving us like 7% or 8%, off and then we were crediting back big shops like HMV and or taking Trojan again a very low percentage they were giving us but we wanted to carry them because we were we were then started putting our own records out because we were making much bigger margins on them and trying to promote our own label alongside carrying other huge tunes, maybe filling our van up with a tune that we were making 6 or 7% on. All we needed was a couple of bad debts and eventually, two years into it, J&A hit the wall. and I was left holding a load of debt secured against my mother and stepfather's house, which was a bit painful. So finishing J&A, I then started Hit Run at the age of 19. Now, as you've got to bear in mind, I was only 19 two years in, and the debt was like, seriously, it was basically a third of the value of a house. So I was like crapping myself, to be honest, at the time. So you've started Hit Run, you're sort of saddled with this debt. How did things sort of... progressed from there how long did it take you to sort of climb out of that it took me to be honest with you it took me until I was 25 and I've been running on you for three years before I actually managed to clear all the debts off from that period and everyone thinking oh you make a lot of money out of running record labels or you did I worked my way out of paying off the debts more by doing jobs than I did um by ever releasing anything like kind of production jobs remixes to start with yeah yeah well I I guess I wanted to ask you about in terms of getting into to production um How did you sort of get into that side of things behind the mixing desk? I bullshitted my way along, really, to be quite honest. No, what happened was the first record I made, I literally made completely for fun. I hummed the bass lines to a Calypso bass player called Clinton Jack, who lived in High Wycombe. I then met Fish Clark, who was Prince FireEye's drummer. I met Crucial Tony through my friend Glenmore Junior Williams and his family and friends. Tony's cousin was Bigger Morrison, who did Jazz Jamaica, the Great Clifton. And I went in the studio and made a dub album and named it Creation Rebel after Burning Spear. song it seemed it was an idea my mate jerry had from all ears a record shop in house and because we kind of started a little label called Creation Rebel first and then it seemed it would be a good name for a band and then the idea with it we thought that could become a good band for Prince Fire Eye as a backing band so I thought it could act as a backing band and I put the record out and John Peel picked it up and he played three tracks in a row one night And that was it. I was kind of, oh, everyone's like, oh, that's really great. I love that. And I thought, oh, this is easy. I'm going to make my own ones instead of licensing tapes. So any chance I got after that, I kept, you know, blundering into studios and shouting on that album, shouting to Dennis Bavalo who's engineered it for me. More delay, more delay, more delay. After doing a few gigs, I then started actually physically mixing the gigs myself. Again, after realising it was a good way to go because the sound man didn't know what he was doing and I at least knew how it was supposed to sound. And then adding just a space echo to start with. And then when I did get into a studio, it gave me the footing from doing the live sound first to understand the bit that, you know, and also from everyone saying, you know, about... having your own sound. So I quickly picked up on those two little guidelines really too. I'm interested in how you went about, you know, being sort of self-taught, getting your own sort of signature. I think you get influenced by people. Prince FireEye's productions were very, very, very raw, very empty. And he also tried to do the slowest one drop possible. So he definitely tried to make it very slow and things that suited his mood. So watching people like him working, he gave me credibility just by working with him. Also, I'm not a musician, so I'm not a proper producer. in my own mind to this day. So I ended up more like a sound man. I remember a journalist who worked for Sounds, Edwin Ponzi. I don't think he... particularly like me or like what I did and he described me in a derogatory way I think as a fan who got his hands on a mixing desk but Edwin was really right I was a fan who got his hands on a mixing desk and didn't let go of it I just kind of persevered on the live gigs and then before you know it I got people complimenting me saying wow that's amazing you're sounding you got it sounding great I then bluffed my way into a studio. And then by working with great musicians and then great singers, it makes you look good. It gave me a chance to experiment, trying ideas, things I'd heard. I could realise how they were made, making my own experiments from reading other people, what they did, people like Connie Plank and other non-reggae producers and applying ideas about playing things down tubes and experimenting with ambient recording, playing things through speakers and re-miking them. the use of the effects and in spending hours and hours with my then wife and partner Kishi Yamamoto experimenting together in the studio on using synths and hiring for one night and things like that I think experience is the best teacher as they say being in the studio and putting that amount of hours in And, you know, spoiling myself by allowing myself to experiment on things. I was very lucky. You've said before that you like to kind of balance new sounds with something that sounds ancient or something that's breathing. Is that a kind of style that you've taken throughout your career? I think you've got to pay a nod to whatever's going on around you. Not pay a nod, but take it on. I think the best way to judge it is if you hear something, or if I hear something and I'm jealous of it. Not jealous isn't quite the right word. I think, wow, that sounds brilliant. I wish I'd been there when that was done. I'm like, wow, that sounds great. It's worth investigating who did it, how they did it, and what spirit it was done under, so you can try and perhaps get some of that fresh spirit in something. I don't mean to just nick things, because it doesn't happen very often, but sometimes I hear something, it's like, wow, that is just absolutely nuts. And working with new people with new ideas and new engineers and trying to stay abreast of the things is very important. And also, I think at the same time, knowing all the tricks I've picked up over the years. the understanding of micing um or the need the main thing is the need for having good microphones and good performances on your recordings in conjunction perhaps with a lot of digital stuff and how you um how you approach anti-production things it doesn't just sound like everybody else's stuff and bore the life out of you i i mean you've worked on records you know that It's stretched obviously far beyond reggae. There's industrial jazz records, all kinds of stuff. Do you employ the same approach across the board or do you sort of tailor it to different genres or styles? I think if you're listening to sound, you hear it a certain way. So, I mean, with me, I tend to try and just make whatever I'm doing not cluttered. So I try to sometimes strip things down and make the musicians play half as much sometimes when we're recording. Sometimes I think, that's really good, but it's just too intense, everything. I apply those techniques all the time, or approaches. And I'm very aware that you've got to be open-minded as well because if you don't, you know, you miss out on loads of things. So I try and create an environment where whoever I'm working with feels they can do something special that day, magic. and express themselves and usually get a very creative involvement happening. That's the idea. I mean, before you mentioned the gigs where you kind of cut your teeth doing live mixing. There were people from the Clash, Sex Pistols, going to those shows. What was your relationship with punk as that was coming up? By the time the whole, in inverted commas, punk thing happened, a friend of mine in town, who again became one of our partners, we had a little shop for a while called Sidewalk Records in Harlesden, which was in the building we had, and that was Ron Watts. And Ron worked with another friend of mine to this day called Dave Morisoli. He ran the shop. And Dave had always been turning us on to the residents, lots of stuff, you know, Throbbing Gristle, Genesis Porridge, all sorts of weird stuff that I'd just be sat there thinking, oh my God. this is, you know, like, whatever. I liked certain things that were becoming, or, you know, Devo and whatever else, stuff coming from the States. Then suddenly it seemed like all this stuff was coming from England. My mates would be banging about, this is really exciting, this is really great. And we'd drive over to Friars in Aylesbury to see, you know, I remember going to see the Ramones and the Ravillos in 75 or 6 or something. And I might get all my dates wrong, but it's around that similar period. Ron Watts, who we worked with, who I mentioned before, he had this band called Brewers Droop. And if my memory serves me correctly, I think he had Mark Knopfler on guitar in the band. It was a horrible band, really. It was not my cup of tea. It was all bawdy kind of songs, and Ron pissed in the front singing. But Ron was a great bloke. He was like a big ex kind of boxer. And Ron promoted the Nags Head. and he promoted some venue in Uxbridge, and he also promoted the 100 Club on a Tuesday. So he could put, you know, he had Generation X, you know, the Pistols playing this circuit. Now, I didn't, you know, I went to a couple of gigs, and it was, oh, my God, get me out of here, you know. But all the people, to their credit, like Leiden, you know, the Clash, the Slit, the Ruts. lots of other bands, they all were getting off on the reggae stuff. So for me, it was being aware of this movement going on more through the eyes of my friends than myself because Dr. Pablo, who I work with, is my partner at Hit Run. You know, Pete loved it. Pete was going to Tuesday nights and driving Ron because Ron would get like a bit lashed and needed his chauffeur to take him back to Lane End in High Wycombe where he lived. And Pablo would be telling me the next day when we were driving back. to London to sell the reggae records. Oh, he was, you know, the jam had been on last night. He had this great band. He loved this band. And I'd listened to them all. And to me, it was cool. It was okay. But it wasn't something I'd be sitting at home like, wow, I like this. I've got to be quite honest. But I was very fortunate I was there and witnessed like lots of mad evenings that I'm looking back on. You can see why people were kind of fascinated by just the sheer energy and people thinking they could change the world at the time. And that's what we all kind of shared in that. And, I mean, one of the first major remix commissions you had was for Depeche Mode, is that right? Yeah, well, we all used to hang out at Rough Trade Shop. Rough Trade was run by some really brilliant people. You know, there was Pete Walmsley, who's dead now, and his wife at the time, Richard Scott, obviously Jeff, Travis, Scott. There was a whole crew there. It was a really, really amazing, buzzing place. And I'd always see Daniel Miller in there. And Daniel had started his label and he was selling his records out the back of his car. And we'd done Silicon Teens and Normal, a couple of singles. And he said to me, oh, we should do an electronic dub album even then, just laughing. You know, we'll do it. You know, your funny dub records, you do electronic dub record. I said, yeah, we should do. We never actually did, although we were friends, you know, like, and then when he, the very first remix he started, he said, oh, do you want to do a remix for me? So I said, yeah. And then I did a more mad one called Our People People. which is like nuts. And he's like, can I use that one as well? I said, okay. Did it on a four track in my house. And that was one of the first remixes I got invited to do that really got people saying, oh. You know, that's mad. And from that time, it tended to me that people would get me to do the mad alternative mix rather than produce or do the main mix. So I think that in a way that worked very well for me because I preferred that. But I always ended up as being the one who got the wacky weirdo version rather than, you know. So were you able to, you know, sort of knock out these remixes in parallel with getting On You Sound, like sort of back on track? Well, the remixes, to be honest, if you're doing that for Daniel, I didn't get a fortune for it, but that helped me. Because in those days you could buy a house in East London for 24, 25 grand. I know, the old days, which is what they should still be. It's just disgusting what's going on now with all these trillions of World Bank money just being poured into people's countries. Normal people can't even breathe. That's another whole thing. But that enabled me to get... deposit down to buy our first um our first uh house our little house in east ham and um i was very grateful for that but what happened for me was i kept doing the jobs uh to keep on you afloat and to be quite honest but you know i i don't know how many countless jobs i did to get the funds to keep OnYou going and to keep sponsoring projects I wanted to do on OnYou. I kept thinking that OnYou would sell tens, I'd add a nought to my sales. I never managed to do it. Well, in terms of how things sort of progressed from there, in the early 2000s, you relaunched OnYou Sound, but what happened before that? Did it go into a kind of hiatus or? I never stopped running the label, to be honest. What happened was the signs were on about what was going on. I was working with a distributor in France, another one in Germany. And we would sell out to each territory, not sell out, send out the stock to each territory. get whoever, you know, Head Charge, Clay or Mark, you know, we started with Taka, Mark Stewart, whoever, going doing gigs. And we would organise tours to promote the records. Now you do records to promote a tour, you know, but those days, literally, you could make, on paper, you know, if you got one away, you could get paid properly on a record. So we were working each market with our partners. But firstly, the French record label, the gentleman who ran it, suddenly said to me, oh, come into my office. I'm into this now. Now this is a man who'd been working as a pure reggae head, looking after Burning Spear and amazing other projects in France. He had his foot on the desk and started playing this absolute shit house music to me. Oh, I'm into this now. And like, I thought, I won't swear because there's no point, but... I wanted to think, are you joking? And he wasn't. But he suddenly, I think, got so disillusioned with how things seemed to be nose-diving sales-wise, he'd convinced himself he liked this horrible stuff he was playing. So I said, sir, with the greatest respect, I'm out the door. But the writing was on the wall because... The next thing, EFA, our German distributor, went out of business, took me, you know, took on you for some money, but other people, it just closed them down. So you're suddenly in a position of going, you know what, to make the effort to run this. quite like I have been doing with having to work myself crazy to keep propping this up with all the staff and everything. It just went, I got into a bit of trouble, to be honest, and reached a point where... I found myself in quite a lot of debt. And I either didn't pay the MCPS, didn't pay the pressing plants and all the other suppliers who'd been helping me and who I actually owed. So I just sold everything I had. And I spent two years... repaying all the debts but i've got a friend who's actually from adelaide in australia and he said to me he said mate this is if you've got no honor you might as well be dead And I thought, you're right, Ray, you're right. And I spent two years renting a place in London and the last day I paid off all the money I owed. I then managed to get another loan to... get another place to live to buy again. But for a time, I was really on my backside. And it's in that time, it's really interesting to see you find out who actually supports you and whatever. And then at that time, I again then had a rejig and rebooted the label. But it took me quite a long time to get my head around what was going on, why. Record shops were closing everywhere. There was no proper thing you could rely on. It got very, very, very, very odd for me. So for a time, it felt like not even running the label again. But I did continue putting records out under the umbrella of the label. You got kind of caught up in the demise of EMI as well, is that right? Well, the next thing I did was I thought, well, look, for me and everybody else involved, it'd be good if we go through EMI. because they were offering us, you know, not fortune, but a reasonable, a little bit of money up front on each project. But then it all went wrong, because then they started going down. So I ended up sharing out the money that we'd got in amongst people that I thought the records were going to be released by. They then said, we want to release a couple of others that I hadn't advanced people on. They then didn't release the other ones. We had one example where somebody was supposed to do a tour. It didn't happen. Their record was just left on a shelf for like... ever, never got released, didn't help their life. And then bit by bit I'm thinking to myself, what are you doing? You're dealing with like, the whole reason you started a label was so you didn't have to deal with these people, having them making decisions for you. And now they're causing me all sorts of stress and problems. I'd rather be selling out of the back of my car again than going through having some dickhead telling me, like, oh, we've got to release a different record, we can't do this, you can't do that. And you signed an agreement with them. To be fair, I don't think it was their fault. I think that kind of character, you know, that banking character who bought it, you know, thought he was heaven sent and was going to, like, suddenly enlighten the whole of the... music business and sadly he lost billions but I don't know you know to be honest the whole collapse of the record industry on one hand is quite funny but the impact it had on a lot of us was wow because suddenly musicians couldn't earn any money and everyone had to rethink what they did and make new tactics. It must have come as a bit of a relief to be running the show again yourself with On New Sound then. Well, to be honest, I got... I felt like giving up for a while. And I was discussing that with my friend earlier. You know, I was saying, like, you know, you reach a point where you feel, well, you know, this is whatever. Then you have to just dust yourself down and say, well, hang on a second. What are you defending? What are you standing for? You have to keep making tunes if you feel inspired to. And getting back, like, you're a zest for it and feeling like, right, we're going to do something proper and powerful. Sometimes it means meeting some other young people. I'm not young. I mean, meeting some younger people who, you know, recharge you almost. And then, you know, in recent years, I've had a whole bunch of, like... brilliant younger folk around. Youth, you know, I've got old people can be very young and young people can have a very old spirit, but not just that young, but a lot of people around really, really, you know, come on, come on, you know, with a positive vibe. And, you know, I feel a bit revitalised, I would like to think. Well, I mean, in terms of your solo career, putting out your first solo album in 2003, was that a bit of a spark? provide a bit of a spark for you in terms of your career? That completely coincided with the end of like EFA and everything and then Amanda Jones and Sue Johnson who'd been one of the original rough trade people, my friend from way back, the wonderful, wonderful women. She said to me, "Oh look, do you want to come and do an album of remixes, you know, or do some remixes for me of some of the catalogue?" And by the time we realised some of it for religious reasons or whatever, they didn't want remixes doing, I said, "Well, why don't I make a..." a record in my name for you. You say, well, how would you do that? Because, you know, you've never done one. And it actually all made sense because I'd been doing gigs in the previous years in my name. And the problem with me is my name was on the back of a sleeve as the producer. And there's not very many producer artists at all. So I think, you know, you've got Lee Perry as an exception. But if you put on a bill live... tonight Trevor Horn unless it was promoted like however how would anybody know that you know that the amazing amount of hit tunes Trevor Horn's had I'm not a Trevor Horne because I've never had anything like that success, but the point I'm making is to establish yourself as a live entity and by then to have that album, to get to make an album where I could put my name on it and I have all the decisions completely on my own and make that record, that really was a good point for me. So for the last decade or so, I've like... being a person propelled from the back to the front, and also when I'm on posters or little things now, it really helps me that I've got now three records under my belt, well, four, including The Sherwood and Pinch. Well, you mentioned working with younger producers and a newer generation has sort of revitalised you. I guess Pinch is probably a really key example. How did you first meet up with him? Well, Pinch invited me on a tectonic night. I'd heard about Pinch before, his name kept coming up. I'd heard a couple of things until you actually see somebody in a live context and realise how good they are. It's difficult. But he invited me on a tectonic night in London. We got on well and I invited him on a non-unite in Paris that I'd got going on. And then I think it's down to how you get on and what things you've got in common and how you can work together. And tell me how it got from that sort of dialogue or friendship to... to get to a stage where you're like, okay, let's go to the studio together? Well, we went to the studio immediately. We said, oh, let's get together. I invited him down to Ramsgate, which is like now Studio City. There's so many, you know, we've got Congo Natty, Serial Killers, Adamski. The whole place is full of like, you know, Allo Darling. There's all sorts of like. funny bands down there. It's actually quite a mad place where we are now. I said, come down. And the first idea we had was just to cut some tunes to make dub plates. Because, you know, when I'm playing out, I still model myself on the sound system idea that you're making tunes that no one else can play back at you. Because if you're sounding like everybody else and just playing everyone else's tunes, you're a DJ, which is good. I'm not a great DJ, so I try now to push myself forward, do a wee bit of tempo matching, but put tunes that no one can play back at us, and that's how we started. What ended up as the Sherwood and Pinch album is that's like a proper meeting between the two of us and it's like a nice vibe, that album. And I think the two of us as producers, we could do some brilliant work. I'm interested in how the late night endless record you've made with Pinch. uses and deconstructs music that you've worked on throughout your career, why did you decide to go down that route? Like I said, we started with the first tune we cut was the Run Them Away tune, which I wrote with Bim years ago, the lyrics. Obviously, it's terrible because Bim Sherman's dead, Lizard's dead, Prince Farai, and last year, Stiles Scott was murdered. And it's like very, very heavy duty. To me, it's almost unreal when somebody dies, but it's right in you and it does kind of hit you for six, I must be honest. And we still miss Bim a lot. first starting point was I wanted to try revitalizing that tune because I thought it was quite relevant with the um you know the American militarization of the planet I thought it fitted in quite quite uh well and I thought I'd like to try and do a quite a um a thumping chip version of that it ended up more like a meditative one than how some of the other versions we did were much more digital or whatever but that one's quite um a beautiful little piece of music but we started with that for that reason and we only touched a couple of the old on you samples the rest of it's all new stuff you know um with the vocals in nigeria the the the stuff with freddy and all sorts of other bits on their all are all new but finding that balance was important generally speaking what kind of vantage point did you have as the sounds of dub and reggae were absorbed into Jungle and Drum and Bass and Dubstep in the UK? To me, it's just all evolution. I think the, you know, you look at... If reggae just stayed in its one form, and that was all it was, it would become nostalgia and it would be dead. I mean, to some degree, it goes in and out of that, but the reggae has established it as an international music of force. It's many variants. The legacy of Jamaican music going from, you know, ska, rock, steady, into reggae, into dub, into dancehall, into raga, then evolving into jungle, into dubstep. It's all bass music anyway. I still like the stuff with the flavours, more minor chords, more... You've got lyrics, good lyrics, conscious lyrics. I think for open-minded fans of the Jamaican stuff and the original bass music, and it's the good end of anything though. You've got absolutely awful drum and bass and you've got awful kind of dubstep gratuitously, just press a button and make a load of bollocks really but there's so much of that but the top end of both are just as great as anything, stunning. And, you know, things like Burial, Mala, Pinch, you know, the Junglist movement, you know, Congo Natty, it's right up my street. It's got the right flavours and carrying the flame, keeping the torch burning. And it helps us because you can drop, in an evening without music, you can still drop a Roots tune from 1972, 73 that... almost fits in perfectly, you know. You mentioned before some of the people you've collaborated quite closely with and been friends with, you know, who have sort of passed away down the years. In the mid-'80s, Prince Farai was murdered. It seemed like... 83. 83, yeah. You left behind Regé for a few years there. Was that a kind of reaction to that? Yeah, I was really angry, really, when he was murdered. Or I'm upset. So was everyone, you know, so was my wife. all of our friends and everything. But again, it just wasn't almost real because you did all these stories about Jamaica and the violence and suddenly it's real and it's like you're part of a movie or a dream or something odd. And I felt, to be honest, it just coincided that the next year I met Keith LeBlanc, Doug Wimbish and Skip and Mark Stewart and Ari Up and everybody was all in, you know, my other friends were into what was going on in New York. And I suddenly... got invited there because of a tune I made with Aqabu called Watch Yourself with Steve Beresford and a crew. Got invited over and I ended up meeting all these... amazing people who remain firm friends to this day. So for a period there of about three years, I really didn't do any reggae records till I did Time Boom The Devil Dead with Lee Perry. Well, and I guess, you know, Lee Perry is someone you've been working with for probably nearly 30 years now. Tell me a bit about what he's been like to work with. Lee's just the best fun to work with ever. He's great company when you get to know him. And he's got a really good sense of humour. And he's got this mischief about him. He's like a kind of a naughty person with a really abstract sense of humour and amazing spiritual kind of things going on. that are making music. He believes in magic. He believes something special is going to happen if you're working. And I learned a lot of things like that from him because... I've seen him, you know, set fire to somebody's sock while they've been sleeping in the studio. I honestly have. And he kicks people out if their energy's bad or they're asking too many questions or it's too, like, negative things. Boys, he's sensitive. He really is sensitive. He picks up on it. And, you know, if you're going to go to the studio, you're going there to do something, you know, he thinks you're going to do. holy work he doesn't think of it you know that's how he views things and it's a very good way to go because if you if you saw him going to sit in front of a computer screen and program some foot drums it's kind of oh my god get this fella out of here. Let him go and do that on his own in a room. And that really is what happens a lot now. I think with Lee's, his pursuit of stuff, he's still exactly the same now at nearly 80. And he's still got the mischief and he's still got the energy of a kid. I mean, I did a gig with him a couple of weeks ago. He just got... off a plane from Jamaica. We're due to go on stage at midnight. We ended up going on stage at half past two in the morning, freezing cold outside in Italy. And, you know, he just danced around the stage for an hour and 20 minutes, like nothing. Never sits down, so his back's got his, you know, perfectly straight. You know, what a man. Having worked with him, I just, you have to just make sure you contribute and, you know, push him and make sure you do your best when you're working with him because he's... He's still just flying so many ideas. You have to try and condense them and get the best result out of him, I think. And there's obviously that school of production, but the role of a producer has changed so much over the past 20 or 30 years. What do you see as the role of a producer now? I think the word producer is very, I mean, some people are producers, the financer, and he's the one who's got the ultimate choice because they're putting up the money. Another producer is somebody like Quincy Jones, who's just a musical genius kind of thing. You've got someone like Lee, who is just bouncing off his musical. And then you've got someone else who's controlling everything in a box. you know, I think the words just, whatever, you know, the musicians are producing. I always think I'm producing with the people I'm working with or, but, you know, if I'm financing something, I'm calling the shots. I don't know, the word producers, quite a wide word, really. Nowadays, it tends to be one man and his box. It's quite funny, but I still like the interplay between people. And the fact is, if I'm choosing something, the chemistry might, if I've got, for example, George Oban playing bass and put George Oban with Bruce Smith or Stiles Scott or Keith LeBlanc, it might work better. that the chemistry between those two and knowing the chemistry might work with somebody that hasn't worked and those kind of things, that's a... a part of my role perhaps if I want to make some magic or getting a wonderful programmer like Jazz Wad or Pinch or somebody and say, look, why don't we get a little bit of live performance from Skip McDonald or one of our other crew and try or get somebody from outside we've never tried before and see what we come up with. In the late 80s, you had some chart success with Tack Heads MC, Gary Clayle. How did that? collaboration come to pass? Well, that was just a weird as freak situation because Gary was a mate of Mark Stewart's. We cut a tune, Skip cut a tune with him one night. I cut another tune with him and we just let him MC a little bit throughout an evening from the desk till we kept the evening running. The idea was the doors would open and from the beginning of the doors to when people went home, all you heard was our music. So we let Gary DJ a little bit and then we wrote the... the human, the beef track and the human nature track. And then Bobby Marshall got Paul Oakenfold and Steve Osborne to remix it. It weren't even my mix. It was the hit. If you hear my version, it would have never been a hit in a month of Sundays. Um, so. To be honest with you, we just had this fluke hit and suddenly you've got Gary propelled as like an artist. You know, it was quite amusing. And it kind of went a bit downhill after some initial success, I guess. I think, you know, if you look back on things, you probably have regrets in life about, you know, not looking after yourself properly with, you know, maybe drinking too much or whatever. might do um and i just think things you know if i look back on things like that you know it's not like regrets i think it's uh it was what it was it's just um maybe people shouldn't you know Maybe all of us go through lives and you think you wish you hadn't maybe got taking drugs or do whatever and get disconnected from where your head should be probably. You've also just started a new series called At The Controls. The aim of this one is to kind of show, showcase your skills as a live sound engineer and as a DJ. Tell me about. about this series? - I think a lot of people haven't, don't know, what happened is I made lots of records in that period, lots and lots. I was like working, I only slept every other night for quite a few years, so I'd get up on a Monday, go to sleep on a Tuesday night, get up on a Wednesday, go to sleep on a... Thursday night and stuff like that. I was literally steamrolling making tunes to try and pay off debts because I was owing so much money to studios and stuff. They'd rather have a flow of money even though they had the debt. And studio time in those days wasn't cheap. It was like £28 an hour looking back on which was quite a lot of money in those days. So what I did was, the result was I made lots and lots and lots of records. And with this, my friend and I, well, my friend put the compilations together. He's just suggesting, well, try this, try that. And it's good because I was working with someone who I trust and we're highlighting a lot of things that I'd even forgotten about, to be quite honest. So the idea being for people to see the aspects of stuff. that we made then that isn't just strictly the more obvious reggae ones. It's basically non-reggae really. Yeah, I wanted to ask you a bit specifically about the African Head Charge project and how that sort of came to pass. African Head Charge, Bon Jo had been in Croatian Rebel and he was a really great percussionist and he liked... reggae percussion but also the Nyabingi and African percussion and Afro-Cuban kind of stuff so I'd I wanted to experiment in the studio a bit more. So I basically heard about, I heard Brian Eno's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. And he did an interview and he talked about, I have a vision of a psychedelic Africa. And at the time I thought, oh, you're pretentious, you know, but then I thought about it for a minute and I thought, no, it's actually quite mad. Why don't we? Because we were working in Berry Street Studio where I was taking all the credit time off. make an album and just make like a mad, really tripped out African type dub record because I still to this day think it's not enough of the black African heavy rhythms in much music. It's just not enough because it's, to a lot of people, it's just almost too dark for them. I don't know. So we explored that and I made... an album of like basically experimentation and built it around Bon Jo's percussion with the you know we did the music and then the layers upon layers of him playing percussion and sped things up, slowed things down, tape manipulation and stuff like that. And that was 81, I think, did the first one. And that album was a slow starter, but we started getting people saying, oh, I actually love this, or I'm lying on the floor with this mad record playing, running over my body. And it found quite a few friends, that first album. And it was probably not until we got to the fourth album that it really started getting more cohesive. And by the time we got to the fifth album, it was like eight years later before we even did a gig. I think the first gig was kind of 88, 89, I think. Bonjoe came to me and said, you know, would I mind if he did it live? And I said, would I mind? I'd be really happy. And he put a band together. and started kind of representing it live and that evolved into Songs of Praise and In Pursuit of Shashamani Land and so on. In terms of all the different projects you've worked on, is there something or are there some specific things that you find a lot of people... uh are rediscovering now i think um hopefully this new you know these new releases will get people kind of curious to investigate um the back catalog of stuff are done because um a lot of it's just lost in space kind of thing so i think um a lot of the reggae heads might not like the whole show that the controls but then a lot of other people curious about music and whatever they'll say that's really interesting i can see wow that's from you know 79 88 one or whatever and it still sounds good some tunes don't sound as good as others but i can hear evolution of sound and things in it I mean, it feels like in 2015 you're keeping busier than ever. You've had the late night endless. You've got the controls. You're doing a residency at NTS Radio. What else have you got sort of in the pipeline? Well, at the moment I've been evolving a live show with Pinch that's like we take a recording studio on stage. We've got like a 32-channel analogue mixing desk. and we're basically doing live mixing. And that's quite... So it's slightly different. We're pretty different every night. I'm doing a pretty similar thing myself. And I'm adamant that I'm going to see a lot of my productions handled properly and out properly. And at the moment, I'm quite happy with the way things are set up. And getting it promoted for the first time in probably 15 years isn't doing any harm at all. And that's a wonderful job that's being done. that front and I'm quite you know I'm actually feeling quite positive and confident that the next set of new productions I have will be will be wonderful Thank you.
