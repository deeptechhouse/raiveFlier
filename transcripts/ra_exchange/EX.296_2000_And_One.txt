Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch, and I'm the Associate Editor of Resident Advisor. On this week's Exchange, we sit down with Dylan Hermeline, the Dutch DJ and producer better known as 2001. Hermeline has, as they say, been around the block. He put out his first record in 1990. Barring a short break later in that decade, he's been utterly devoted to dance music since then, DJing, making tracks, and a small cluster of labels, including Remote Area and 100% Pure. It hasn't always been easy, but in the end, Hermelina masks a staggering catalogue of productions and helped define a generation of Dutch DJs and producers. I caught up with him at our office in Berlin to talk about what the last 26 years were like from his perspective.

The Exchange of 2001, up next. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ I don't want to, everybody asks what your name means. That's not, basically the reason I bring it up is because I know that part of the reason 2001 sort of sounded cool to you was because at that time it was futuristic. It was a year kind of in the distant future. And sitting here today, it's the opposite. It's a time that we actually can feel nostalgic for, you know. I guess that's why I think about all these parties and festivals and making records and all these sort of extraordinary moments. At this point, do you still have... you know the experience of having an extraordinary moment like that like an extraordinary party or just can things still feel amazing to you at this point? Well it's like a continuation of amazement feelings. Most of the feelings I had already experienced all the parties but when I get into those parties I still feel amazed like it is the first time. It might sound cliche or something but it feels not all but Basically, a lot of them feel like the first experience because it's like a continuation of the same feeling. So the feeling doesn't go away. It just stays and is kind of different due to the fact that it's like 10 years ahead or 20 years ahead. But the feeling is basically pretty intense like it was the first time. And I know it kind of comes in waves, it seems like. You've had these moments over your career where there's a distinct moment where you sort of get way back into it. Is that right? That's right. That's correct. It's like I've been doing this kind of music for three decades now. And it comes and it goes, you know, also with the certain styles. which are You know, techno comes, techno goes, house music comes, house music goes, and all these sub-charts. Like I just said before, it's so intense, also with the diversity of the styles, and I kind of experimented with all of them. That makes it so interesting. For me, it's so difficult to stick in only, for example, a specific style. For example, Chicago house music or Detroit techno. Sometimes it can be, you know, doing experimental stuff, electronic. Like I also did drum and bass. and stuff, even down tempo, loungy, trip-hop kind of stuff. It's basically all this spectrum of electronic music which has evolved in the last three decades. For me, that's what keeps it interesting. Yeah, it's interesting to imagine that the time that you got into it and kind of, you know, the age you were, you were perfectly... at the right moment to watch the entire thing unfold. Like you were there buying records when all these sub-genres you just mentioned. first came out. What do you think about the way it is now? Like, do you feel like things back then came out at a more sort of exciting rate? Or does it feel like maybe things aren't as fresh these days? Or how does it feel from your perspective? Well, at that time, what you mentioned it was all new so all the shards were new and that was so excited now we can real I can realize that it was all zero day in all those shards and nowadays you can say well is it new or is it we've already done it before nowadays I can hear for example people say that my sound sounds old school but it then has also a combination of old school and new school like new influences so you can say okay we've been there we've done that but it's there's also a new element involved with the charas evolving now and that still makes it same interesting as it was back in the days For example, I can imagine people who are now 18 or 21 who get into this music. For them, the feeling is exactly the same, I guess, what the feeling in the beginning was. That must be because the experience as a person, the interaction with that music. You know, it's the first interaction. And it doesn't matter if it's already there for a long time, you know, because back in the days, older people were saying, well, this music was evolved from disco. It's the same, you know, we've been there already. But it was not. It was completely new. And that's also, it's not new new, but it's... The experience of the newness is the same. Yeah. Over the years, you've seemed like you've had a very kind of hungry approach to the whole thing. As you said, you made records in almost every imaginable style of dance music. As far as I could tell, you had about a half a dozen different record labels at one point or another. And then, of course, on top of that, like DJing all the time. these days, what's your main thing that you're working on? I know you're making records and DJing and stuff, but what's the sort of, what are your main projects at this point? At this point, I'm exploring the 2001 project, which I started in 1990, which is the Detroit house techno kind of. influence and nowadays i'm really doing that kind of stuff in my djs sets and in the studio so if you most of the people when they listen to it they say oh you have that old school Detroit style. And to me, it is the new style for me, you know? So it's a combination of new techno, like techno, techno and Detroit kind of influence, which is strong, you know? deeply rooted into the sound of 2001. And that's what I'm doing for the last three years, really intensively focusing on that specific style. I guess that's always been the common thread. Exactly, exactly. But nowadays, also, was kind of like maybe... 10 years or eight years seven years ago it was more kind of a housey kind of flow in that amsterdam based sound which was more like funky kind of uh club music rather than strong detroit festival techno and that that last is what i'm really focusing on now because i've really feel close to that emotionally, you know? Why do you think that is? Why is the Detroit stuff doing it for you right now? The first emotion was, I remember back in the days, in 1988, when I was listening to Acid House music, and there came a record across, which was called The Dance by Derek May. And that was a kind of weird acid sound. And that was called Detroit Techno. And that style is so futuristic. And it still is now. There's so much respect and so much joy into that fact that it's since 30 years and it's still fresh. So that in the studio, when I'm making those kind of beats, then I still feel like I get excited, like, wow, this is great how those guys invented that stuff. did they even realize that it is like such a timeless kind of dance music? And that turns me on. And also when I see the reaction of the crowd, especially the young crowd, and after my DJ says they come to me and say, wow, this kind of music, man. I just realized and found out that I wasn't even born and it still sounds the same even those old records. So that's pretty exciting to me when I hear that from young people and then I feel the same emotional feeling of that true sound. So that's the reason why I... stick to that kind of style currently. Yeah, it's crazy. People often say it's about Acid House, but just earlier today when I was listening to some of your old Acid records, it's hard not to think, like, it's pretty weird how easily this could come out today as a new record. And, you know, no one would think it sounded old. It sounds completely, as you said, kind of timeless. So in a way, hearing Acid House for the first time, as far as I understand kind of the like moment for you where that's sort of what did it. It's interesting that all these years later, that's what you've sort of come back to. And it sounds like you're kind of that same experience that you had. It's intentionally or not, you're kind of giving that to people that, you know, are as old as you were then. At that time, I was really young. I was the youngest around others. The youngest in the scene. In the scene, yeah, especially in Amsterdam. I was one of the youngest persons who was making actually a record, you know. And then this guy came up to me. He was like a newspaper reporter. And he said, that's unbelievable, such a young guy making that kind of music. Amsterdam you know because that's acid house style was done by the guys from Chicago like Armando and future and DJ Pierre was was so excited at that time and but that acid house what you mentioned that is so simple music but so original only with that 808 or 606 and a 303 Roland bass line. It still is the same, you know. It kind of evolved. influence of Detroit techno came into it and then that whole thing became techno but you know at that time it was a separate genre like acid house music you know how old were you exactly when you put out that first record I started in 88, got involved with that music. A year later, I came across the 303 bass line in the 606 drum computer. made the tracks in 89 and released the record in 1990. Like the beginning, I think it was January 1990 at that time. And you were already kind of involved in the club scene. Exactly. I was buying records. I was really young, so it was difficult to get into all those fancy clubs. But I was buying the records at the record store. At that time, they were like all on discount because nobody wanted to buy them. The Acid Records, you mean? Yeah, the Acid House, the... It was at the Trax Records. At that time, it was maybe two euros or something, if you translate it back into... It was all the new records. So I was listening to and buying and playing that stuff. I wasn't DJing regularly, just small bedroom parties. And when the record came out in 1990, that kind of blew up because I was one of the only persons who was doing that. So then I got asked to do a live performance of the 606 and the 303 on just improvising on parties. That really blew up because that, yeah, was just hitting the buttons. Go for it, basically. But that was really exciting, hearing that stuff on a large PA. And it just sounded exactly like the records from Chicago because those were the machines. What kind of music was... popular in Amsterdam at that time when you started playing all that stuff? The acid house music was like the underground stuff so that was already underground. Popular were the kind of piano kind of house music Ibiza style at the moment so at that time we called it like really commercial kind of vocalist house music and sometimes the my favorite dj at the time at the roxy was dj dimitri he was doing all those experimenting with detroit techno sound and with chicago acid house and his party on the thursday and later on the friday became really popular during the early 90s like 92 93 94 at the peak at 94 i think and most of the parties around amsterdam were yeah maybe more the catchy kind of house records which are now classics but at that time they were for me they were kind of cheesy sounding you know but that's how it blew up when it came from Ibiza all those ravey kind of piano records and vocalist riffs and samples. Most of them later came from the UK. For example, Playing With Knives from Bizarre Inc. was a really big record. And of course that Technotronic, Pump Up The Jam, which was a big, big, big one. It began at the club and later it was in the mainstream chart. But those kind of records are... The Humanoid by Stacker, that was a big one as well. That was actually a real Asset House record, which was number one in the UK for a while. That's pretty amazing. So basically all that which you now consider old school classics, those were all played around all the parties in Amsterdam and the clubs. So when you showed up and started playing these acid jams, was that just more raw and intense than what you normally hear in a club? Yes. The stuff I was doing and into was more played on underground warehouse parties. Those were, like you said, the raw, not so common raves. Not all the known DJs were playing there because it was too difficult already at that time for most of the people. But those parties were for me the best because... the most futuristic kind of techno and acid was being played there by the underground DJs. Did you ever get a bad reaction? Not myself, but I witnessed one time when a DJ was playing at the Roxy and then the staff was complaining about the music was too difficult. They rather wanted to hear something more uplifting. Yeah, I wanted to ask you, I heard a story about the first, your sort of moment of first hearing an Acid House record. You were at a record store in London. Would you mind sort of running me through it? The thing was this, I was buying regularly records in London because before my techno house period, I was into hip hop music. And I had the luxury that my father was working for Royal Dutch Airlines, so I could fly very cheap once in a while to buy actually good records, because the record stores in London carried all the good hip-hop stuff, but also the rare grooves, the funk breaks. So during the beginning of 88, those record stores were importing, of course, from the United States, hip hop music, but also at a certain moment, the house and the asset and Detroit techno stuff came along. the guy in the shop was playing that kind of music through the sound system in the record store. So I was like, wow, what is this kind of freaky electro sounding futuristic stuff? Because yeah, the electro, what I'm talking about is that old school electro boogie electro, you know? And then I came across with that sound and then the guy behind the counter said, yeah, we also do parties, so maybe here's a fly, you can come to the party tonight. And I went to that party and I was like, wow, what's going on? The first experience was, what is this crazy music? I've never heard this before. not realizing that it would be such a big sub-chart of a whole complete chart that's going to blow up for the next decades. With that knowledge now, knowing, that gives me goosebumps, you know, because at that time, this is a crazy record. And he played tons of those records because he got a whole package of releases at that time, yeah, of new stuff from Chicago. And it's weird knowing that, you know, with the knowledge you have now. Like, yeah, those records just came in the record stores and they were... who were ordering that stuff, never heard it before too. So they thought like, okay, well, let's try it out. Whose party was it? I think it was Baby Ford. Right, right, right. Baby Ford, yeah. Peter Ford at that time. And he had... But he was also into the music because he had this track, I think it was later, it was Uchikuchi or something like this. It was amazing. That's kind of a funny coincidence too that you end up seeing Baby Ford playing. Yeah, but at that time, you know, he was just starting with that music also. He came across maybe... knew it longer already because she was older but It was new for everybody, I guess. It was new for everybody, yeah, exactly. So how did you know that all the good record stores were in London? Or how did you become this kind of record digger at such a young age? Yeah, because I got into music very early. I was buying my records already when I was 12, 13 years young. And my dream was to buy one record every week. That was my biggest wish. And I came across with that stuff during kind of pirate radio stations in the Netherlands. They were playing. I was always interested in kind of crazy sounding music. The hip hop, early hip hop stuff like Beastie Boys from DMC. Cybertron. That stuff really got me going. So I was collecting those records, going to the record stores in Amsterdam. But at a certain moment... They didn't carry all the stuff. It was too little because it was too underground. The stuff didn't sell. And then, I don't know how that got started, but maybe through the DMC Mixing Championship that all the stuff was happening in London. My father said, yeah, why don't we go there because we can go up and down for a really cheap fare and then sort it out. So I first went with my father and my mother to all those records, those groove records, spinning records. And that was heaven. They carried all the stuff. So I was explaining to the guys at the counter, I want this and that kind of stuff. And he said, you know, we got all what you want. And I saw all the... ultimate breaks and beats and all the rare grooves and it was unbelievable that they carried all the stuff because they imported much more to London than Amsterdam was importing the stuff so that's then that was the reason why I came on a regular basis maybe that started in 86, 87, well then 86, 87, 88. And then the spring of 88 was the encounter with the house music. So it was just forced upon me, you know, I was in the record store. So yeah, that's really amazing if I think of it now. And so how did you get from there to being 2001, being a DJ and producer? I know you started it with someone else, right? Exactly. I started to get it 2001 with my friend at the time, DJ Dano, who later became like a hardcore, hardcore cabaret DJ. We did the first project together, then we did a second project together on a Dutch label based in Eindhoven called Evolut Records. Then we kind of split up and continued with 2001, which was at that time only one project I was doing. I was doing in the 90s, I must say, that people were doing multiple projects. Like a 2001 project, Detroit Techno, doing Edge of Motion, Acid House, kind of hard stuff. Babies from Gong doing freaky kind of down-tempo stuff. And the 2001 project, which I'm DJing under the name now of 2001 more often, basically got during the last, you know, the first decade, it was multiple projects. Then the second decade in the early 2003, 2004. starting that project again with Detroit Techno. And then I thought, okay, maybe now I should stick to one name and not doing multiple projects. And then I continued with the 2001, making more records under that name, got more known, played out more at that time. So that's how I decided to continue with that project alone. which I'm still continuing now. Why do you think it was like that? Sorry, I guess the way I should put it is what you just said about how you've got a million different projects. Was that a normal way of doing it back then? Was that common? That was really common. There weren't many people who were producing under their real given name. And so they made up kind of aliases and they had multiple, like, for example, a good friend of mine, Steve Rachmuth, he had multiple projects at that time as well, you know, Sterak, Tons of Tones. A lot of people, I think maybe 80% of the producers were doing that at the time. It was more, yeah, it was... Fashion, I don't know, it was like a trend. Everybody was doing that. And later on, maybe end of the 90s, there came a new wave of producers and DJs who were using their real name, like Adam Bayer, Kari Lekebush, you know, all those real, real names. And then the multiple projects disappeared. So when I started in 2003 again with my project, I thought I should stick to one name. not too much diversity. And now at the time I see more diversity starting, you know, and more names behind the name. So, you know, more monarchies than the real given names. Interesting how it all comes back. So as I understand it, the name was basically the code for your bank card. Yeah. That was in 1984. I got my first bank card and the code was 2001. And that was such a coincidence. It wasn't, but I thought, hey, let's do it. And I was also a fan of the movie, of course, and the book. And what you mentioned in the beginning of the interview, it was far ahead in the future. So it was like futuristic sounding. So let's do it 2001. Make it more kind of. fancy 2000s numbers and one written. And now it's ancient history. And is it right that there was for some reason you had to come up with the name quickly? All of the names. Yeah, because we were making the tapes and then we came across Fierce Ruling Diva. who were running the Lower East Side record label, and they said, let's make a record. And then we had to invent a name. So it was maybe we had to do it in a couple of days or 24 hours like this. So that's how it started. It was not like we started inventing a name and then made music. The music was already there. But because we had to put out a record, we had to invent a project. So we had to do it kind of quickly. Yeah, that's correct. So is that the first moment where... it kind of became real like you've been messing around and then someone says i want to put out a record let's do this yeah i remember that time when he was saying yeah let's make a we should make a record we should put this out on record because we're doing the live sets at the party and first lunduva was throwing down that party and he was so enthusiastic And he said, look, let's make a record together out of it. So that was really serious, but I couldn't believe that this was happening because as a record collector enthusiast and then making your own record, that's like a dream come true. Nowadays, people putting out records every month. if it's like a normal thing. But at that time it was a huge milestone. It was like, wow, I can make my own record. with my name on it and the project name on it and my music on it. And you hadn't envisioned that happening already. You were surprised that it was happening. Yeah, I was completely surprised it would happen. I dreamed about it, but I was completely surprised. That's actually like a young boy who's... becoming like in the future a professional football player. You know, that's the same. It's very rare that it would happen. It's unlikely that it happened. And when it happens, it's still unreal. So it felt completely unreal. From there, over the next, I guess, 10 years or so, there are a lot of sort of different sounds coming in and out. as we were saying earlier, you got really into a lot of them, but then there was a period where you weren't feeling it, you know, it didn't connect with you as much. I think it was that, I guess the late 90s or so. What was going on that you didn't, you know, connect with anymore? It was, like a combination of things, multiple of things happening at the time. I experimented during the whole 90s, like I said, with all the new genres which came across into the electronic music, down tempo, drum and bass, techno, Detroit techno, etc. And at that time, I felt that it became more like a business, the whole scene. And that scared me, kind of. A lot of people came in for the money, not only for the love of the music, putting out records which they thought they'd sell, playing out tracks what people on the dancefloor want to hear. And then my distributor at that time was going bankrupt. But that same company was also had a different, same owners had a different company who were doing the pressings. And I still owned their money from the pressings, but the distributor got bankrupt. You can't really sell those records. Exactly. And then also before that time, trance music was becoming very popular from the Netherlands. So I was doing like Detroit stuff. who were buying that stuff abroad at the wholesale company said yeah the records are not selling because it's not good trance sounding music so it was very depressing for me at the time music did not sell this music got bankrupt people making more music because of them only for the money and I thought I've done it this is it this is the end I'm going to quit doing this stuff. It's already, I did everything. Forget about it. And of course I had to pay back that money. At that time I had to work for, I had to do a real, go work for like a real job. I have to do a real job. No nine to five style. And I went into the IT business and it was good. I could make money and pay off the debt. But after a couple of years, you know, I was very emotional. I still had my studio in the attic. I was afraid to go there. One time I thought, fuck it, I'll go there. And I broke. I was like completely emotional, like, wow, I miss this kind of music so much. And even if I think about it now, it still gives me chills, you know. So you would completely shut it out. When you had the IT job, you just didn't even want to think about DJing and making music. Exactly. I was still listening to music at that time, but I was listening to reggae, dancehall, heavy metal. I think I've never said this before, but I was... hoping that this whole music, electronic music, was dying off. We've had it. That's it. It's the end. Because that would be easier somehow. Exactly, exactly. But it kept creeping up to me. And then I also... I remember I was on a mutual friend's birthday, his son's birthday party, and then I met a girl who I knew from the 90s. Goes by the name of Shinadu. I said, how are you doing? Are you still doing that house techno music? Yes, of course. And I asked questions. Is Dee doing it? Is Lauren Gagné still doing it? Of course, they're all huge now. I was like, wow, wow, man, it's still going on, but really big. I said, yeah, why don't you come with me? I have to play next weekend. I think you might like it. It's actually on a festival, it's called Awakenings. And I went there, wow. And then she took me to another festival. And now a couple of months later, Dans Valley in the Netherlands. I think I heard two DJs, two German-based DJs who were from South America. It was Ricardo Villalobos and Luciano playing there. They played, for me, they played old-style music, old-style like early 90s. People out there saying, yeah, this is the new thing, what's going on. I thought, wow, if this is the new thing. And I want to join. They were playing not only the old stuff, but they were making a perfect combination. Of course, they were playing records who were just brand new at the time. But for me, it was sounding old school. So I was very excited. What is that sound exactly? What made it sound old school? Kind of an organic, true sound, which you can hear that the person, the producer who's making that music actually feels that music and is making that music because he loves that music. Not like no presets, no preemptive thinking about it. That makes it... real and they were playing the non-stop back-to-back set for maybe I don't know maybe four hours maybe longer and so that was a big part of how you got back in or that was a key experience yeah that was the key experience with the combination I said that I was really emotional because I kind of missed it, you know? It sounds like you really missed it. I really missed it, yeah. Exactly, I really missed it. Then seeing Shinne-Do, then it was... I got convinced by all of those parts. Missing it, meeting Shinne-Do, saying everybody's playing and they're now huge, and then went to those parties. Those DJs played Ricardo and Luciano, playing all those records. Then I thought, I have to quit my job. I have to quit my real job. I remember I was sitting at the desk with my manager and he said, you're doing great. Maybe in the next five years you're here and in the next 10 years you're there and over 15 years you're manager of the unit. I said... I don't want that. And he said, what do you want? I said, I want to start my own business. He said, really? That sounds great. He thought I wanted to start my own business in the IT business. But I thought, quit my job. I don't care if I lose money or not. I paid all the debts. I want to just be part of that music. Just the feeling, you know, because that's... feeling was so intense and that's how I got back into the whole yeah music industry again around 2003 2004 I think 2003 and when you had that um I was thinking when you had that the quote-unquote real job had you ever had a real job before Not like that. Because you were so young when you got started. That was kind of a first experience, working in a normal office and whatnot. Exactly. I had a job, but my job was on a Thursday and a Saturday in a record store. That's basically a playground for me. But that was exactly what you said, the real job in a suit and tie and 9 to 5. So now I know how that felt and that I don't want to do this anymore in my life. Never again. You don't never say never, but I mean, going back to that music industry without... Even thinking about how I'm going to pay my rent, how I'm going to live, that didn't matter. Because that emotional feeling, that was the most important thing for me. So I started again doing that kind of music and then started 100% Pure again, starting some new labels, starting a label with Shinadu. And then from one thing came the other thing. And then I put records out, I played music more and DJing around the world. But that was not the key, you know, that was not the main thing, that was not the focus on like, oh, I'm going to start this music again because I want to make money or something like that. You had already had 100%, you had started 100% Pure before this break. And so you kind of had, you didn't have to start completely fresh. You could sort of, you know, rekindle some things you already had going, right? Exactly. I started 100% Pure in 1993 due to the fact that me and my friend Sandy Hooner were making kind of different kind of techno house music and no other label wanted to release it. So we were kind of forced to release it ourselves. And we thought we'd do just one white label and see where it goes. And then it got kind of successful in the underground. And then we continued the label. But like I said before, we had to stop at the end of the 90s. And when I started again in 2003, the first thing I thought, I'm going to also pick up my making music and pick up my 100% pure doing the label again. So I was already, I was kind of not new, but it was still difficult, because there were a lot of new people involved who never heard of it, because it started after, you know, it started at the end of the 90s. For example, Laurent Gagné, who was already, of course, playing a lot of 100% pure stuff in the beginning, he knew that we got a lot of support by guys like him, you know, him and Sven Veit. So that was a good thing that those kind of legendary DJs knew this already. they supported you they supported us yeah they supported us so that was that was that was a really really uh a huge thing for us what was it like entering into i guess re-entering into the amsterdam scene The Amsterdam scene was, at that time to me, the Amsterdam scene was more a DJ-based scene. There were not so many producers or DJ producers. So I found out there was a lot of young guys clicked together, doing a lot of parties and playing a lot. kind of trying to make music but not in a professional way like putting out records so for me it was very interesting to connect all of those guys with my experience in the record business and knowing how to release records so that's how We got connected and I started supporting them to release records. And that's where I started a new label, Remote Area. Area Remote, just purely based on those new Amsterdam talented DJs who were starting to produce. So that was really interesting when I re-entered the scene. back in 2004, 2003 in Amsterdam. So you came back, you weren't just playing music and making records, you were also a certain kind of figure in the scene, pushing people towards being producers and releasing their music. Exactly. I was so eager to, so proud of Amsterdam. Amsterdam back in the days. And I saw this potential new group of young, enthusiastic, and I thought I just connect everything together and I will help them out. And we help each other just build an Amsterdam-based international, you know, known in the international scene, you know, Amsterdam-based scene. in the whole scene. So that was my goal, to make all the producers and the DJs play out across the world. And all the music. But at that time it was really talented producers and a lot of good records came out at that time. So who were some of those artists? Boris Werner, Bart Skils, Lauhaus, David Labey, Julian Chaptal, Anton Piet, those, and of course, Sinead, but she was already in the 90s. So basically that was the main group. How did that time off affect your feeling about that scene? Exactly. It's a good question because the time off was kind of a recharge also in a creative way. So the beginning where we just discussed like the early 90s and end of the 80s. was like a start of something new. But in 2003, getting involved with all the young new generation and me being out of the scene for a while was kind of that same feeling of... doing something new it was more like a 2.0 situation and but it felt really I felt really energetic to do it and also very inspired especially about the whole international scene being so professional that time most of the good music was coming from Germany in that so-called minimal house music period. But there was a lot of new producers and a lot of great sound coming from that country in a combination of those young guys. In Amsterdam, it was so good at the time. It felt exactly the same as in the beginning. It's interesting that you said before you were getting a little weirded out at how much of a business it had become. Later on, it's probably not the same thing exactly, but you were impressed that it was professional. I guess in general, it must be strange if you've seen something from the very beginning when it was this tiny, completely unknown thing. It must be strange to kind of watch it grow into a world where people are employed and everyone is professional and knows how to work together, I guess. Yeah, that's great to see that. I mentioned before that I got out of that because I was hating that kind of seeing that happen. But it also brought a lot of good things because businesses got more organized. managers, journalists, agents. They got more professional and that benefited the whole scene. When I got back into the... the business in 2003 starting all those the labels again it was much better organized than it was in the early 90s in the early 90s like you mentioned it's kind of it was total anarchy if it still was like that probably the scene would died out because it was so bad organized so that was that was the good thing and also clubs and parties and especially festivals. That was for me surprising that it was so huge and so well done. And that's why the business is still alive, I think, because of that. Otherwise, I don't know what would happen. So that was the good part of being more a business commercial kind of thing. I guess also it's thanks to that element of sort of professionalism that it's possible to stick with it as a career, I guess. It might be difficult to stay at it for decades if it was, as you said, total anarchy. Completely, because nowadays I can say, yeah, this is my job. This is my real job at the moment. At the beginning it was just an outraged hobby or something like this. And now, due to that fact of that whole business being more professionalized, everybody has a job in it now. There are still some parts in the scene which only folks... It focuses on the money thing, but there's a lot of, a huge amount of people who are still doing it or doing it, also in a professional way, but they make music straight from the heart, and that's a good thing. I thought the whole scene would be spoiled. Money thing and all the music. Because for me, kind of, I always had this also in the past. It's not entirely true, but for a large amount, that when money becomes involved... the music changes and not in a good way. And then a lot of people say, yeah, it's about taste. Of course it's about taste, but people start to think when they go in the studio, I had this huge hit. I should maybe continue that because it makes a lot of money. And with that knowledge going into the studio, I think it's already... kind of spoiled but that's my opinion you know so I thought it would happen to the whole scene but it did not that's a good thing you mentioned earlier that you realized it was possible to be professional and still do it straight from the heart I guess is that kind of how you see yourself At the moment, definitely. And that's also my main goal. If I can pay my rent, pay my expenses, just live a normal life and continue with that kind of music, that's my main goal, to continue that, making that kind of music. I don't want to be in a position that I say, okay, I have to make this kind of music because I have to pay my rent. then i have to do that that's not a good thing so for me i want to continue that making music because i like the music not because i have to yeah i liked um you had a line in actually your last ra interview yeah where you said sometimes you feel like people say i really need to make my next record i need to go work on my next record. And you said something like, yeah, you have to pay your taxes. You shouldn't have to make music. But I guess maybe that's sort of a key to what you've been doing this whole time is that you're actually just following your impulse of what you would enjoy doing or what you like to do. You've never had an element of obligation. Well, you know, especially when you've been around for such a long time, it's like business goes up and down. Trends come in and out. So, of course, there's always a period when you have less gigs or less income due to the fact that your music is not popular. But now I know that it... it will come back again. So I can understand that it's sometimes difficult, for example, oh, this is this new sub-charm. coming out i have to focus on that because that's really popular that gets you that's of course but you should always realize that the good will always come out if you stick to your own feelings rather than focusing on something you might not really like but it's popular you know It's difficult to make that decision, but at the end of the day, it pays out to just go to follow your heart. It might seem like in a short-term sense, maybe it's not paying off, but... as you found out in the long game, it works. Exactly, exactly. And then I think you can, if you stick with that, you can continue it for another three decades. 30 years, yeah. Why not? I can say this now. Like a while ago, I thought, hmm, this music, what should I do after, after, what should I do after? Then I think after. then I'm dead. That's what happens. Yeah. I can say now as a fact, if I stay healthy. Everything, I will continue this music business. Definitely. And I also see, you know, some people around me, not any moment say, yeah, but DJ is getting old. And what do you think? When you're 50 or 55 or 60, you're still in the DJ booth. But now a whole generation is getting older. That's the first thing what's happening. The next thing what's happening. Who's the first child of a famous DJ who's going to be successful, you know? That's going to happen next. In a way, do you feel, even though it was not a good event at the time, do you feel thankful for that break in a way? I can say now, definitely, because it charged my battery. creative battery and my whole vision and my whole enthusiasm that what happened I can say now when I felt really sad at the time and I missed my studio and I missed the music and I was hoping that this whole music would die out I can say now well that period might be the reason why you're still going now so it was like forced sabbatical you
