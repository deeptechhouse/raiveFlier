you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. We're back this week with another edition of the Critics' Roundtable. I'm joined in Berlin today by our news editor, Will Lynch. who just recently attended a few of the first events in our new event series, RA Horizons. Will, for those who aren't aware, can you describe what the series is and where you went? Yeah, sure. Basically, the idea of the series is to put on events like a house and techno party. in cities around the world where that either wouldn't normally happen or is only happening on a very kind of underground, esoteric level. And the idea is to kind of hook up with local promoters and put on a party that has an artist that wouldn't normally come to that part of the world and kind of bring something special to the small, dedicated. crowd of people there that are into this music. So we did three. The first two were in China, in Shanghai and Beijing. And then we did one in Nagoya, Japan, which is a smallish city a couple hours away from Tokyo. It was an interesting experience. Basically, part of me kind of wondered, you know, we had LaVon Vincent for all three of them. It's like, is bringing that kind of music to China, you know, is that sort of like trying to bring cricket to the States or something, you know, like it's just not part of their cultural DNA or whatever. But it was actually the opposite. The music itself might have been kind of foreign, but to my surprise, in Shanghai there are many, many nightclubs that are full all night, even on weeknights and stuff like that. It's not really what, if you haven't been, it's not what you would picture a Chinese city to be like in that regard. you know, big audiences, big clubs, and everyone likes staying out all night. So there actually is some kind of interesting potential there for... a decent techno scene. We're going to be doing parties in a bunch of different places around the world. And as you said, Will, the idea is also to shine a light on promoters and cities that are doing great things already and maybe just saying this city's kind of awesome. You should know about the scene here. Right. One of them is Portland that's coming up. We're going to be at Holocene with... I believe, Martin and Max Cooper. Philip Sherburn, who's also with us this time on the Critics' Roundtable. You're from Portland. You've been to Holocene, and I haven't. Tell me what it's all about and what we're in store for. Yeah, hi, Todd. Hi, everybody. I should say out... At the start, I'm a little biased because I'm friends with the owner there. Full disclosure, I love Holocene. It's an excellent space. I grew up in Portland and I moved away. many, many years ago and in the last few years have gone back fairly frequently. And Holocene is a space, I don't know, unlike any other space I know in the States. It's a smallish club, two rooms. They never really utilize both rooms simultaneously. Sound-wise, that doesn't work. The depending on the night, indie rock, kind of experimental music. I've seen Hauschka there. I've seen the books there. I've seen not a winged victory for the Cellen, but the group before them. Stars of the Lid. Stars of the Lid. And DJs and live sets. So, I mean, I've seen Chloé, the French DJ there, Matthew Deer, Portable. They do a lot of great stuff with the Portland scene with artists like Miracles Club. And there's gay nights there, like kind of gay DJ culture in Portland. Hip-hop nights, and they have excellent pulled pork sandwiches. They have really good cocktails. There's kind of cool art on the walls. It's very Portland, but not in an annoying way. Not in a Portlandia. Not in a Portlandia. I mean, a little Portlandia, but not so badly. I really like the place a lot. It's quite nice. Cool. Well, we're really looking forward to heading out there. But for now, this time on the roundtable, we're going to be tackling three topics. First up, visas. If you've been going to parties for any length of time that feature international guests. you'll likely have run into one with a cancelled international guest. Australian-born DJ producer Deep Child is going to be joining us to talk about that. Second up, pressing play. That's the phrase on everyone's lips these days, it seems like. Deadmau5 called out himself and fellow producers for simply putting on a show and not doing all that much on stage. We're going to be talking with Jim Mazur of Native Instruments and Peter Kern of Create Digital Music to see what Deadmau5 is on and off about. Finally, Will, Philip, and I will be talking about GEMA. It was announced earlier this summer that the German Collections Agency would raise the tariff on GEMA. clubs throughout the country to such an amount that famed venues like Berghain, Watergate, and Weekend would likely have to shut their doors if it came to pass. We'll sift through the situation to separate myth and reality on this incredibly hot topic in the club scene here in Berlin at the moment. Thank you. We're joined by Deep Child, Rick. Thank you for joining us, Rick. A pleasure, Todd, as always. You have a story about a visa issue that you wrote to me in an email a couple weeks ago. You were trying to get into Canada. I was wondering if you could just briefly walk us through that. I mean, it's been a really interesting year for me in terms of travel legalities. And the thing was, I was actually traveling to Canada where I was supposed to spend the next three months. And I had just the day before canceled a whole bunch of US shows, which I was writing to on the plane. And the irony is, as soon as I landed in Canada, I was sent back to Berlin pretty quickly. So, I mean, in short, every... I had a really fantastic three or so years playing quite regularly, mostly in the US, but also in Canada. And I've always insisted on the artist visas and work permits and stuff like this. I cancelled a bunch of US shows because after three years it had been decided that there wasn't sufficient evidence to suggest that I was still an, quote, established artist, which was funny because I had just come out of the US a couple of months previous playing a whole bunch of shows. Anyway, so I postponed that leg of the tour. For those who don't know, the established artist thing is something that the immigration people need you to have when you apply for a work permit. They need to have, like, press clippings and things like this. It's a really... It's an expensive and time-consuming process. And I was really fortunate enough just over three years to have a big festival in the US foot the bill for my US exceptional ability visa. The funny thing is the options for actually getting a visa as a performer for the US are very small. Basically, you do it illegally or you do it with the exceptional ability visa. And the types of evidence they want you to show, they give examples like a Nobel Peace Prize or a Grammy Award. These are on the official documents. It's kind of a system that is suited to perhaps a different sort of artist than a techno DJ. And given that there are three, how many Grammy Awards a year? You know, you've got like a dozen awards, so that means a dozen foreigners get to come in a year? That's fair. Yeah, but it is possible, you know. It requires a lot of time and a lot of groundwork and a lot of press clippings. It's funny. I've been asked to write letters for artists in the past, and they have this sort of form letter that booking agents will send you. And I always think... to myself like if I put that they're in the resident advisor top 100 DJs is that gonna like get to an immigration official and they're gonna yeah oh yeah of course it's really at the discretion of the particular immigration official as well you know and like I've with my visa I've when it was previously valid I had traveled a lot in the U.S. and I would even come across border crossings and they'd be like, so you part of a sporting team? I'm like, no, sir. You were, what do you do? I'm a musician. What kind of music do you make? Are you in a band? Do you play guitar? And always I would say, no, look, it's kind of more left field. And then you just see their eyes narrow and you'd be go, no, no, I'm a singer. I'm a singer, honestly. So even, you know, I think that's why I don't have an instrument with me. There's a little bit of suspicion or it's a confusing quantity. And they can rightfully, well, they have the power to stop you. entering the US whether or not you have a visa. So it's, I mean, that visa has just been like gold to me just in terms of the communities and parties that I've discovered in the US. And how long was the visa good for? For three years. The thing is as well. Once you apply for it, you can wait up to six months to get an answer. Then you can pay something called the premium processing fee, which is another $1,200, and they'll give you an answer in two weeks. I've heard they sometimes don't even meet that deadline. People pay the money and then it still isn't ready in time sometimes. So I applied for an extension. of the existing visa, which now I have to do every year. I can't get it for another three-year chunk. And the interesting thing was that sparked this first letter to Todd was they wrote back saying there's not enough evidence. And I was kind of thinking, hang on, but I've been touring here for three years really successfully. So, yeah, I mean, now I'm in the midst of... That's got to be the worst feeling in the world because you've already done the visa process the first time to go through it and not try to mess around with them. And then for them to be like, well, you're not... Yeah, and then I paid another $1,200. Because if it's... If it's a one-year visa now and it might take six months to get the answer, I kind of want the answer before half the visa is gone because they will renew it from the time the previous one expired. So I paid this. They said there wasn't enough evidence, so we're appealing it. Yeah. Do you have to, I understood you had to actually have your tour booked before you could get the visa, which to me seems like a real catch-22. Exactly. Because any artist on an independent scale can't really, I mean, they're not going to book a tour on which they could lose all this money, the promoters could lose all this money if they don't have the visa in hand. Yeah. Nobody's going to take a risk on that. This is the heartbreaking thing as well. You have to have They ask you to have shows booked for the entire duration of the visa, so basically spaced out over a year is what they want. I think realistically you could sort of book three months in advance. But, you know, then if you have to cancel these shows, it ends up costing everyone a lot of money. Like, I mean, me for sure, but also a lot of these promoters. And this was the heartbreaking thing this time. I was looking into ways because I hadn't heard back about the visa and I thought, oh, that's okay. I'll come to the US, I'll play the shows, but they'll all be charity gigs. I don't need to get paid. I just don't want other people to have to get burnt by this. But then the law states that you need an exceptional ability visa to play charity shows as well. I was talking to another artist who said that they were doing WMC and they were playing like six gigs and five of them were for free as a lot of WMC things. But one of them, like they were, it's just that they were even charging entry. He was like, I'm playing for free. And they were like, well, if they're charging entry, you can't come in here. You have to leave. I'm really fascinated by... like what the masters of Google, these immigration officials, have probably become. They're going to their office and typing in something. I mean, this is what segued into the Canada experience. So I guess the first part of the story was I had written to you and I'd cancelled all these US shows, kind of thinking, I definitely don't want to be stuck in the US without a visa. That's safe. I mean, the shows were cancelled, but I didn't even try to enter the border illegally in any way. And then I got to Canada, and the irony was, and they picked up my passport, and they saw that I'd come to the US a lot to play. I'd come to Canada a few times. I'd always got work permits. And basically they took me into a side room and started sort of grilling me. And they're like, what are you doing? I'm like, I'm a musician. Here's my... my work exemption for the shows that I'm playing. In Canada, it's different. There's a lot more room to move, you know. If you play in a certain type of venue, like if you play in, on the official website, if you play in a bar or a restaurant, you need what's called a labor market option, which is an exemption from a work permit. It costs $150 and you play it when you touch down. If you DJ in a club... According to the official information, you don't actually need any kind of visa. It says, you know, as opposed to Grammy award winning, blah, blah, blah. On the Canadian website, it says the following people don't require work permits to play here. Buskers, DJs. I mean, regardless of this, I had some letters from the venue. How does it feel to be next to a busker? Yeah. I feel more at home than being next to a Grammy award. It's probably closer to the truth. But I had letters written from one of the places that I was playing, restating this information, which was on the website. But it was funny, I was cordoned off to a little side room and then just really grilled about drugs, about why I was there for 11 weeks. And really the second premise of my trip was just to spend some time with my girlfriend who's working over there. But it was a very strange barrage and it really threw me. I got quite distressed. I'm not really good with people with guns in black uniforms. And they didn't have numbers. They didn't have names as well. They were all numbers, so I couldn't even say Sergeant Smith. And then the thing that really alarmed me, and I'm quite passionate about this outside the visa context, is one of the officers picked up my mobile phone and he started going through the text messages, asking me who these people were. It was like my mother-in-law. And then they said, we need the login details for your personal email. And I said, oh, I feel really uncomfortable about this. And they're like, just write them down. We'll destroy it later or something. And then they went into a separate room without me present. I went through my email, printed out certain personal ones and came back, you know, with names of different people in Canada. Who's this person? Who's this person? It looks like they're putting up to lying to be here. What are you trying to do here? You know, and I'm like, I'm just a DJ. Oh, God. And of course I had printed out all the official information from the immigration website saying, this is what it says about DJing here. Here's also my letter of invitation from this festival. You know, this is what I understand how to do it. You've seen I've been here before. And the first time I came to Canada was in 2009. I did exactly the same thing and I was completely fine. I showed them the letters. This time it was kind of close to an interrogation. And as soon as they started going through my personal emails, I got really, really scared. And I'm not good in these situations. I start to get really sweaty and shaky. And they're like, why are you sweating so much? What are you trying to hide? And I'm like, I'm really scared. That's all I can say. I don't know. I don't know. I'm just really scared. I'm freaking out here. And that was kind of enough for them to just dig in harder. They took out my prescription medication, aspirin, all this kind of thing. At any point did you consider either saying, you know what, I'm out of here, or asking for a lawyer? I'm sure if you said, look, I give up, I just want to go home now, that would probably create even more problems. But I'm curious what happens if you ask for a lawyer. Yeah, me too. And I've had a little bit of difficulty online finding out what your options are. Well, you have a bookie. agent do you think to be like just call them and be like or did you even have the chance to contact anyone no i i mean i really froze up and and and then but then when they were printing out personal emails um this was strange like who's this such and such i'm like that's my friend in canada you know it looks like they're trying to put you up to working here illegally or something I don't know. The lack of privacy, look, I didn't deal with it very well, okay? But I think in retrospect now I would have been like, you can't have this information. Send me back. There were other sort of people in this area and a lot of them were being a lot more assertive and aggressive, like, how dare you look through my stuff? You can't do this. It's hard to keep your cool in a situation like that. I got detained at the border entering Glasgow one time and I was going to DJ there. there had been no discussion of getting a visa or anything like that. I didn't think about it because I was coming from Europe. I thought that Schengen would cover it. And I came in and I had a record bag and they asked me what I was doing. And since I had a record bag, I was like, well, I'm going to DJ. And they said, do you have a work permit? Well, no, I don't. And they said, well, are you getting paid? And at that point And let it be known that I lied. And I was like, no, no, it's just some friends. And they were like, okay, you come with us, wait in this room, we're going to go find your friends. And they went out and they found the person that was booking me. I don't know how they found them. They must have, I don't know. And they come back after a while, and they're like, well, we found your friend. We spoke to them, and it turns out that they were planning to pay you 150 pounds, and so that's working. And it snowballed from there, and they took me into a little side room. And I remember getting worried because I realized that, like, in this room, it was a plexiglass window, and all of the furniture was bolted to the floor so that you couldn't like pick it up and strike. And I was like, not that I want to, you know, strike back with the furniture, but you're at that point, people might, it's kind of freaky, you know? And we went through it for a long, long time. And then they asked what I did. And, you know, I explained that I was a journalist and then I just DJed on the side. It was a hobby. I was playing at like There were no Grammys involved in this at all. And they came back at some point, and I told them this, and they're like, oh, we know. And they had Googled me and everything. I got lucky. Nobody asked to see my emails or check into my laptop or anything. And then, fortunately enough, the last flight back to Berlin had left, and they're like, well, we could keep you overnight, but we don't really feel like dealing. you can stay if you sign this form that says you won't perform, blah, blah, blah. And by that point, I was like ready to sign anything. And then another guy came in and was like, okay, come with me into this other room. And he started pulling on. Gloves? And I was like, you know, rubber latex gloves. And I was like, no way. This is not happening. I must have looked really freaked out. He's like, you're getting fingerprinted. I'm like, oh, thank God. I thought it was full-on cavity search there, you know? And, yeah, so I didn't play. I had a nice night in Glasgow and came home the next day. The one last thing I wanted to just touch on, because I do find it interesting, we already talked about it a tiny bit, is, I mean, this is the type of thing for promoters, maybe I'm crazy, but I think especially in New York. it just makes them really gun shy about booking artists in general because they're taking this chance and, you know, you can't book out a party. Well, you can, but it's tough to do it six months in advance and hope, you know, and this, this is just another thing that kind of is a reason why building a scene in America. or even other countries, Canada, Australia, all these places. It's just so incredibly tough because you have this other thing that you have to deal with. And, you know, one cancellation like this on a big scale can... end your promoting career, basically. Yeah, totally. I would like to know kind of who, what are the powers that be that are deciding these things? Obviously, there are legitimate security concerns in the United States, you know, and occasionally somebody will have the terrible luck to have the same name as a terrorist, and they're probably not going to get in. No fly list, no entry list, whatever. But on this kind of independent cultural scale, what is, you know, why won't the United States open up more? Whose interests are being served by keeping it so restricted? I know I was reading in the Times that there are union payments that sometimes you have to pay. You have to pay into a fund to... sort of secure that union jobs won't be lost by your performing there, but it seems to me that DJs should probably be exempt from that because there's no DJ union that I'm aware of. I think it kind of shows that the U.S. culturally doesn't rely on foreign performers as much as other countries might. um, like in a place like Australia or even just like a European country, it'd be ludicrous to shut out the country to foreign performers because they're very important just to have like a lively, you know, uh, culture of any kind, but I think in the U.S., there isn't as much of, like, a great clamoring to have foreign artists come in, you know. But obviously there, I mean, there are, there is a lobby, you know, for the people from our side of the cultural scene, you know. I mean, obviously, like... people that are playing at Lincoln Center. You've got symphony orchestras that basically can't get in the United States now. These are cultural organizations that have... ties in Congress and they have people on their side. And if even they can't get these rule chain rules changed, then I'm curious as to kind of who is, who's blocking them, like who's in charge of this and what are the interests being served? Yeah. I think in general though, whatever their reasoning is, is completely mysterious to us. Like it's not really, you know, is it like a. terrorist concern or just like a working illegally concern or, you know, like I remember I read that. So it really started in 2003 when they set up Homeland Security or whatever. But for whatever reason, it. scaled way up in the past two years, which seems very arbitrary on our end. You know, it just shows, I don't know, you really would struggle to put together any kind of devil's advocate argument about like why they might be doing this. You know, we just have no idea. There was an interesting point in Larry Roeder's Times article that I wasn't aware of this, but one of the reasons that the visa fees are apparently so high, you said something like, like $1,200 or something, is that Congress dictated that this program has to be budget neutral. So they can't take state funds to pay for this massive federal bureaucracy. And so all of that is falling directly on artists and promoters. So we can thank the Tea Party for that. Yeah, I mean, that was one of the notable things about the New York Times article. And the more research I did, the more it seemed like, yeah, it's totally kind of, it's, yeah, I mean, the artists, why are the other visas different? Well, you look at a, sorry, you look at a budget neutral situation, and that is exactly the reason why they aren't going to go to any lengths. fix it different levels because it's like well we'd have to hire a bunch of other people and we have to figure out all these interests and it's like and we're already really in debt here so yeah uh so basically uh just get ready for more cavity searches artists Be like nothing is true. We're joined for this section of the podcast with Peter Kern of It's Create Digital Music. That's right. Correct? Yeah. How long have you been running that? It's coming up on eight years. Okay. You know, it started slow, but it's getting close to eight years now. And you're doing it full time now? I'm doing it full-time. I mean, it's not the only thing that I do full-time, but it is one of my full-time jobs. I know the feeling. Full-time jobs. And Jim Mazur from Native Instruments. What exactly do you do at Native Instruments? That's an interesting question. My title is I'm the head of product design for Tractor. So what that means is I basically look over all the concepts and product development of the tractor family of products. So that's hardware, software, how they come together, and basically look at the interaction of artists and our gear and define all that, how the equipment should look, how it should function, what the software should do. and work with engineering teams to make it all come together. And you only have one full-time job. Yes. Although sometimes it feels like two. I brought you guys together, along with Philip, for this section to talk about pressing play, Deadmau5 Rota. Humorous, I suppose, to me, at least. Humorous to some people, serious to other people. Tumblr post a while ago saying, basically, I press play. My show is a show. Also, everyone else does, basically, in the scene. And then, Peter, you wrote a response to this. Yeah, where I said, no, we don't. There was a succession of opinions from Deadmau5. So the first, as I understand it, was in Rolling Stone. He was critical of the claims that Skrillex was making about his live performance. So his point in Rolling Stone was Skrillex is claiming to be doing things that he's not. And the Tumblr post, I think, was meant as a follow-up to that. There was kind of an inner dialogue. There was kind of a debate he was having with himself, though, because he's... critical of himself for just pressing play. But it was sort of a, let me tell you how it is. What we're all doing is pressing play. I don't know anybody at a certain level of DJing who's not, who's really playing live. And he had an explanation of why he felt that you couldn't do anything else. My rebuttal of sorts to that was, look, that's fair. At a certain level of DJ stardom, I think that's true. And based on what I know, that's fairly true. But he left out a wide range, I thought, of what's happening in DJing and performance. I didn't personally feel that it was fair to only look at the highest paid DJs and extrapolate the reality for everybody else. And some of what he said, technically, I felt wasn't accurate. It's very difficult to do, it's more difficult to do a live performance and risk things going wrong when you have a lot of people in front of you and a big festival and lots and lots of stuff synced to your performance. All of that is true. But it is possible to have what he was describing, have... elaborate pyrotechnics or lighting or visuals or whatever it is synced up with your show and still improvise over top of it. So I thought technically it wasn't quite right. I had just come back from Sonar, so some of the stuff that I saw at Sonar was fresh in my mind and some of the conversations that I had had with some of those artists. There are... folks like Mouse on Mars playing big festivals, and they're really playing as a live trio, almost like a jazz trio. And they have synchronized visuals, and they're playing pretty big venues, and I think they're pretty well-known artists. And they're running elaborate stuff synced to Ableton Live, in this case. But they're drumming over top of it, sampling over top of it, processing sound over top of it, and it's different each time. And they've talked a lot about why that was important to them and why it was important to them to take some risks. In the sort of big festival venue DJ realm, I've talked to Richie Houghton a bit about this and his live show. And he's doing a whole lot of control and live triggering and manipulation of individual drum sounds and has something like a 100-track Ableton session view. I'm sorry, these are all becoming Ableton. examples. We're here with Native Instruments. Feel free to jump in with some Native Instruments examples. Well, one good Native Instruments example was, and I put together this super band of people doing live music with your products and kind of demonstrated that that was possible. We're all big fans of guys like Jeremy Ellis who are... finger drumming entire parts live that I can't play in the studio. So there are lots and lots of examples of people doing quite live music, I think. Isn't part of the problem, if this is a problem, I think it is, but isn't part of the problem that it's about audience expectations to a certain degree? I mean, this kind of... the succession of posts and blog posts that came out of this whole little debate, I mean, like Carrie Mason from Billboard pointed out on her blog, is that it seems like people, and especially younger people in the States who maybe don't have a long history in dance music, they're going to hear the hits. They're going to hear the top ten hits, and DJs can get away with playing these top ten hits in order. And not only do, is that enough for crowds, but like crowds might actually respond negatively. I mean, I can't, I've seen Mouse on Mars live many times and I love them, but in the places that Deadmau5 is. playing, I can't see people really having the patience to stick around for Mouse on Mars. Well, yeah, and I should say, I'm not necessarily trying to make a dead mouse. They both have mice in their title. But other than that, it's hard to make a musical comparison. Well, Well, and I think this is why the web is kind of becoming controversial in this way. You have clashing groups of artists, clashing groups of audience members with different expectations. And clearly where this comes from is the rock model going and hearing bands play essentially their album. And so, you know, I think we can appreciate why people might want to hear things in that way. I suppose what pushed a button, if you like, for me, was the claim that because this is what I'm doing, and this works for my audience, this must be true of everyone else. Yeah, I think there's a problem. Something weird about that, right? And some of the reactions were the same way. Because some people were saying, well, but I don't want to see that. Therefore, no one else should want to see that either. Or there's something less valid about you doing that because I want to see something else or the artists that I love do something else. So there's something, and some of the artists were kind of making the same sort of argument. There's something a bit peculiar. We're not having a, this sounds incredibly naive. I've been writing a blog for eight years. Boy, it's funny how people on the web sometimes are not very nice to each other or decide to put their opinion before they kind of try to understand where the other person is coming from. Somehow there's an assumption, I think, that because we're all making electronic music that it's all part of the same culture. There's a fallacy there that, well, it's all technology-driven, so it's all the same thing, right? There's a lot of resentment on sort of the side of the underground currently because the mainstream media is shining such a spotlight on these big earners and their big pyrotechnic stage shows. And I think a lot of people who have been making electronic music for a long time, who have perhaps different values about performance, about aesthetics, whatever, are feeling... either sort of tarred with that brush or just left out in the cold entirely. Jim, in terms of what you're hearing from artists and what they want, I mean, are the expectations for something like Tractor wildly different? And you're trying to kind of collate all of these like, oh, this person wants this out of performance and this person wants this. I think I look at it from a couple of different angles. One is like the artist. themselves. Where do they come from? And they have to make hard decisions on where they put their time, whether it's in the studio or perfecting kind of being a live performer and really taking some sacrifices at some point. And I mean, I agree that it's possible from a technology point of view to do some of these things. But I know talking to our artists, they definitely come into those situations where it can be really... challenging to have such a syncopated show with audiovisual pyrotechnics so on and so forth and still be kind of non-linear and of the moment and keeping all of this running and I think that you know we definitely or I definitely hear this on a I wouldn't say on a constant basis, but I definitely think it's there. The expectations of the audience are growing, and I think that there does come down to some hard decisions in terms of how nimble you can be on stage based on fulfilling those expectations. It can help to make minimal techno. It's possible to do something that is extremely intricate and live and have it still sound to your fans like it's minimal techno. And I'm not sure that fan members, I'm not sure that I'm always able to tell the difference between somebody playing CDJs or playing a fairly elaborate four-deck tractor set or playing out of an Ableton session set. Sometimes you can tell the difference. Sometimes you really can't. At some level, some of these people are actually doing this sort of improvisation and soloing for themselves. No one may be able to see what they're doing. But I was a bit surprised that this doesn't come up more often. Part of the reason why you might play live is to avoid boredom. you know, it's exciting to have this kind of risk. And if your audience will attack you or if you blow it, that makes the risk all the more exciting, it seems. I mean, I know this is true for some artists. I know that part of what they're doing is they're going up there and they're doing things that they don't have to do that people may or may not be aware of. not just to entertain themselves, but because it's part of what gives them satisfaction as performers. That's the interesting thing, though, is that they may be doing a ton of stuff to keep from being bored, but if what's coming out of the speakers isn't performative, you would never know. I like to check my email, of course. Well, that's how I entertain myself, but other people may want to. may want to do something more musical, I guess. I've said this before in a Critics' Roundtable, but I think the most interesting thing, or the biggest challenge, I guess, is for electronic music performers, looking like you're actively doing something and actively doing something, and so the audience knows it and can actually, like... Get the sense that things are being done and that's it's tough to pull off Right, there's that question of what people can see and what you're doing for them visually. There's the sense of what you're doing musically, because part of what may happen, and this is what came up with this Deadmau5 discussion is, if you do a set that is exactly the same and has songs in the same order and they sound exactly the same way because you're pressing play, you're certainly not going to surprise anyone, particularly if they see your show more than once. If they want to be surprised the second time or get their ticket price worth out of the experience, they'll notice if it doesn't change. So you can kind of communicate with them. With them visually, you can communicate with them musically, and then you can have this experience yourself that they may or may not share. But it seems that people are finding a lot of different answers to those three questions. And yeah, it does seem to come back to audience expectations. I mean, I was sort of enthusiastic about some of the stuff that was happening at Native Instruments. moving track in a direction that allows you to do more live performance, more sort of live remixing. And some people said, you know, hey, I don't necessarily want you to do that to my track. while you're DJing, maybe I don't really want you to do some complicated four-deck mashup. Maybe I'd like you to just play the song and work on the level of a DJ over the course of an evening instead. Yeah, I mean, that was one interesting point out of the post that I took away was... actually this really playing on this sequence set, but almost, I mean, I think it was mentioned more in the, I just play on the fringe and kind of more make minor tweaks, but also if say for one show was to really go bananas and totally start rearranging things, what would the, how would specifically his audience respond to that? Would that be appreciated or not? I mean, yeah, you do kind of feel like if Deadmau5 went on some wild, raging solo in the middle of a set, I don't know. I kind of feel like maybe people would be into it. Maybe I'm naive, but maybe there's some Deadmau5-y way to do a solo. Part of what he said was that he felt that he couldn't technically make this possible. Because as he put it, he was running SMPTE, which is a form of time code, which was synchronizing the visuals. And I think there are still some misconceptions among artists about what is and isn't possible, technically. Those of us who make the tools and write about the tools have some obligation, I would think, to correct some of those misconceptions. We had this conversation last weekend. Laura Escudé, who is a certified Ableton trainer, has also done a lot of work with Native Instruments Tools, and she's an educator and does shows like Jay-Z and Kanye, but also Cirque du Soleil and also things like the sort of experimental laptop and violin set that she did last weekend. And so we talked about this last weekend at a space here called Feed. And Laura talked about that a little bit, having gone and worked with those big shows and had to communicate with artists and kind of allay their fears about what is and isn't possible. And I think that kind of what she came up with was there's a lot of stuff that's possible that either people may not know how to do or they may just be unwilling to take that risk at a certain point. So yeah, sure, it's about audience expectations, but I don't think it's exclusively about audience expectations. It's also about the willingness of artists to take risks and how well they understand how the technology works. Hopefully, as people are using more of it and these tools mature, some of those bigger artists will better understand or feel more enabled to take some of those risks. Who are some of the big artists that are using tractor and native instruments type things to their fullest extent in your mind? Big artists that you would be like, wow, they're taking chances. You mentioned Ritchie in terms of the Ableton set. So in his Traktor sets, really watching him is always quite inspiring. I mean, we kind of live in this interesting area with Traktor. We were kind of the first company to bring another debate, which we shouldn't get into here, but syncing in a DJ context where everything was manual. Also mentioned in his post that DJing, beat matching, if that's the only kind of skill. that comes to the table. I'm impressed. But, you know, Tractor really is about, from my perspective, allowing... the kind of mental bandwidth on stage to be opened up in a DJ context. So now that you have the time and ability to think more about your song selection or what you want to do with the music, to actually more go live, go improvisational, have happy accidents. And yeah, I always... I'd like to go back to looking at Richie's set with Machina and also bringing these different elements together, running loops, or Chris Liebing, who was actually using two versions of Tractor because four decks was not enough. you know, two laptops synced together and really bringing tracks in and out dynamically, working with effects and, you know, really playing the tractor as an instrument and not as just a souped-up record player. Do you think that stuff's appreciated by audiences? Sure, definitely. Do they know that Chris Liebing has two laptops up on stage and that adds to their enjoyment? I mean, probably not by all, for sure. But I definitely think that a lot of the people that follow the acts, especially some, I think, I think that was another point in your article about more of these smaller venues where you can have all these mad experiments going on in stage. I think there's a certain group of people within a fan base that do. And probably, I mean, it goes back to the whole audience question, does that group really drastically get smaller as EDM as a whole moves more into it? mainstream and Madonna like venues, do those groups of people actually really appreciate that or are they there for witnessing that or not? I would assume not, but in terms of looking at guys like Richie or so on, I mean, definitely I think people do. pay attention. But this is not a problem unique to the electronic dance music world either. I mean, in almost any form of music, you have some kind of mix between people who are enthusiasts and people who are not. So, you know, you might have an opera. You go to the opera and there are people up in the score reading desk section of the Met following every note. And then there are other people who are just kind of there to hear the fat lady sing and see some drama and some costumes and sets. If you hear gamelan music in Java, there'll be some people who gather around the gamelan and stay up all night to hear them play, and then there'll be other people just off talking and drinking and eating and enjoying weddings. So it seems like this is something that's common to all forms of music. Maybe it's some fear of the technology and fear of this new identity that some artists are trying to form around EDM that is making people more anxious about it. I don't know. I think that's definitely the anxiety is that it's becoming this mainstream thing. And as you guys kind of touched on, it's like for people who've been in it for a very long time, this is the moment and these are the guys and this is what they're saying. It's like you stupid kids with your Skrillex and your, and your big raves in California. Yeah. The one thing I wanted to, maybe it's a half. baked idea theory but the one thing I really am frustrated by with Deadmau5 is that he seems to rarely make the distinction between a DJ and a live act it's not just him I mean it's a problem all over the place but like he and then him making that problem it's like perpetuates it to a degree that's... And in some way he's sort of neither, right? I mean, and that's not a criticism, but in some way he's neither. So that was why people got so upset. The DJs were upset because they said, well, you're not DJing. You're not selecting different tracks. You're not kind of making this narrative over the course of the night. You're just playing the same thing over and over again. And there's this big spectacle. And the people who improvisatory live performance. So he's something else. He's some kind of mass spectacle, which is itself kind of interesting. And there's a lot going on in the visual content of these performances. So as a person who's also a VJ, that's interesting to me as well. But he seems to be kind of neither category. I don't know what you call that third category, but that could explain why those people are so upset. And that's not really new either. I mean, that's... I remember 10 years ago seeing Kid 606 in San Francisco, and he was basically playing, at the time, the word we would have used would have been mashup, and he was playing kind of a mixture of his own tracks with hip-hop and drum and bass songs that you knew, and they were all kind of mixed up and re-edited. And it was sort of a live show, but it was also sort of a DJ set. And I feel like our vocabulary hasn't really evolved to accommodate this third category, this sort of gray area. You're making it really hard for us journalists, Jim. Sorry for that. Jim? Yeah. Jim? You've tried to differentiate your product line and everything, though. It's right there. DJ, producer, guitarist. Yeah. No, but I mean, also DJing in itself has just evolved in the expectations of, you know, from playing just... these vinyl discs on a record, you know, is no longer also the main cluster of what you would call DJing. I think the whole art form is evolving. See, I don't see that. I mean, maybe I'm just a traditionalist, but to me, that's still what constitutes a DJ. Yeah, the core, of course. It doesn't have to be vinyl. It can be CD-Rs, it can be Traktor. I play Traktor and vinyl both, but... to me, ultimately, it's about the selection and the mix and whatever you do to kind of complement that is great. And if I were not as lazy as I am, I might make more effort to use the third and fourth deck and stuff. But for me, it's enough. And when I'm listening to a DJ, that's all I want to hear is selection and blend and... That's it. And you may not want to hear four songs at once, which is what we might be implying by having four decks. You can mix four songs at once. It doesn't mean you should. You're absolutely right. At the core, at the end of the day, it's about song selection and really, as you said, creating this story for the audience to follow through the night, creating a journey, if you will. But then we didn't talk about the last chapter of this trilogy of rants from De Red Mouse, which he got kind of depressed, right? I mean, we were on a sinking ship. I don't know if you guys saw the last of these rants, but there were sort of various metaphors. I think we were on a sinking ship, but some of us needed to get off the ship, and he directed that at the controllerist that if he thought that he was... not interested in controllerists, then you needed to get off the boat. But I thought the boat was sinking, so I thought getting off the boat was a good idea. And it was the boat of EDM, and it was a cruise ship, like a Disney cruise ship. ship and it was sinking. I just didn't ever figure out exactly what that meant. Start from the proposition that maybe he's not choosing his words and laboring over them for a very long time. I write every day. I don't always necessarily labor over my words. I've been known to mix a few metaphors myself. But I guess what I found interesting about him, not to make fun of his Tumblr, But the fact that he seemed anxious about this, he was anxious about the direction of EDM. I think that's what makes him one of the most fascinating public EDM figures. It's a tragic figure. He's created this thing. Maybe is he not happy with it? No, of this sort of public suffering. suffering for his art in some weird way? Deadmau5, if you're out there, I hope that you can relax about this and not be so concerned. Yeah, I don't know. Because I think the perception of him is that he's created some of the... things that he's, or helped create, some of the things he's complaining about. But, you know, I mean, maybe this is natural tension and natural friction. There's a desire, I guess, in the dance music community to forge some kind of shared identity across very, very different music and very different audiences out of very different cultures and countries and the rest of it. So I'm still fascinated by his desire to speak for EDM, even as sometimes I'm frustrated by his apparent desire to be the spokesperson for EDM. But obviously there's some desire to try to bring together the... It's like bringing together the European Union. It seems impossible. But somehow people want to forge this shared identity and currency and festival crowd. For better or worse. For better or worse. So Berghain's going to close on January 1st, 2013. Or at least that's the alarmist take on things right now. German collections agency has passed a law, or I guess it's a law, a rule, something. Tariff system. Tariff system, a new tariff system that basically replaces the old one. And the short version of this is that the rates that clubs will have to pay is going to be raised to such an extent that... it seems unlikely that clubs will be able to shoulder the burden of paying these things because it's so much higher than it used to be. Just to give an example, a club that was paying €12,000 a year would have to pay €120,000 a year. These are the types of numbers we're talking about. Will, you've been talking to some people. What's your take on this? I mean, are clubs going to close in Berlin and other cities in Germany? Well, I guess basically uncertainty abounds. There's not really, you know, I think. These sort of, like you said, alarmist one-liners sort of came out of it, like the idea that Bergheim will close. which ended up in a couple blog posts and even in that Guardian article. But that was totally just sort of made up. Berghain absolutely never said they would close. They did have an announcement on their official website, which is significantly more outspoken than they would normally be, and it didn't say that they would close. So this idea is sort of obnoxiously infectious because that's such a... I think the distinction in the Guardian article was that if we have parties like we do on New Year's, we would have to close. Right. Which makes sense because one of the parts of this new collection thing is that the longer that the club is open, the higher the rate is. So if a normal club is open for five hours, you pay a rate. and then it gets exponentially larger. Right, and then the next three hours is another raid, and then three hours after that it ratchets up again. So, you know, these would be incredibly crippling costs, and it's hard to imagine how clubs would afford them, but that still is distinctly different from we will close on January 1st. And I've heard, you know, some interesting things like... this idea that if there was no door fee, but the drinks were all dramatically more expensive, then theoretically maybe they could sidestep some of it that way. Yeah, it wouldn't work. Right. But the point is, we don't know how it's going to play out yet. And some clubs possibly could afford it. They would just have to, you know, the door would be... unbelievably more expensive and it would completely change the vibe inside the club and they wouldn't be able to have these never-ending after parties and and so on and so forth but they still you know it's it still is distinctly not certain that they would close um but you know which isn't to say that it isn't you know an extremely grave situation The one thing that we do know is that this law, this tariff is passed. Yeah. It's going to happen. But it's funny. Well, for instance, like when you said earlier about it, you called it a law, and people say, like, if the tariff passes. But this sort of points out people think of GEMA as a government office or something, but it isn't. It's a private company. So the tariff didn't really have to pass, so to speak. You know, there weren't elected officials voting on it or something. They just decided it, you know, and then it went into effect. And, you know, I think GEMA sort of has this swagger or authority of, you know, of like the tax office or something. But and it's so it's easy to forget that. have a lot more freedom than that. They're just a company that, you know, they, a small number of board members can just make these decisions. Could you theoretically be a club that played only music that was certified? not to be a member of GEMA and then get out of it? Well, that's, yeah, but that's an interesting point because I would say, um, a incredible portion of the music that gets played in these clubs, um, isn't represented by GEMA. It's not registered with GEMA. But since GEMA has, you know, this, uh, monopoly on, um, rights to a single organization like this in Germany. So the presumption is that the vast majority of music is represented by GEMA. But I think that's like much of this issue on GEMA's part is a combination of sort of cultural obliviousness and, you know, maybe to some extent willing ignorance. I don't know. But it seems like I've spoken briefly with Kima's spokesperson and, you know, their angle is always that they're there to help artists. They almost position themselves as sort of like a charity for artists or something. And they're doing this. social service for artists. And I asked her, is the do you consider the DJ an artist and Her response was kind of like she sort of didn't know what I meant or didn't you know, I think that there is Genuinely, they aren't that familiar with how without DJ culture works club culture works and I mean most their biggest clients are um, you know pop musicians or like schlager artists and stuff like that like the playing Herbert Grunemeyer But in terms of the portion it represents of all the music being made and how much money it makes, I think house and techno and stuff like this really is just a small, small blip on the radar for GEMA. It's just not really significant for them. The one thing that people have mentioned and talked about, and it's an important point, is that this is a collections agency that takes this money and then distributes it to the artists that are signed up. an official, and basically they apportion all of this money by, you know, your importance in the overall GEMA structure. So if you're making an enormous amount of money, you get an enormous amount of money because GEMA is not tracking what track. are being played so they can't say, oh, well, LaVon Vincent was played quite a bit at Berghain last year. We need to give him, you know, this amount of money. Well, most of the artists that we're talking about, or the artists in our, you know, tronic music world that would be playing at Berghain or whatever, the ones I've spoken with who are clients of Gima, they usually get... you know, at most like a couple hundred euro a year or something like that. Like, like they truly are not benefiting in any material way from GEMA. What they benefit from materially are, you know, their gigs at the clubs that would be, you know, undermined or. demolished by this new tariff structure. And therein lies the kind of irony of the whole thing, is that GEMA's supposedly helping these artists, and in doing so, wiping out the industry where they make their money. What seems surprising to me, I mean, a couple years ago, when everybody was playing just records, it's understandable that perhaps you wouldn't, there was no tracking for the records being played in the night, because obviously no DJ. Even though some countries, I believe, require this, no DJ is keeping a set list as they play, not if they're playing records. But now there's really, with most DJs playing mostly digitally, there's very little reason that that couldn't be done, at least in a majority of the time. So at this point, if you... But wouldn't it require GEMA to get enough money to... purchase those things. This goes back to the discussion we were having about the visas thing that I find kind of funny. You know, these agencies, government agencies, private companies that, you know. to get enough money to get the infrastructure to properly like do the job in the way that we would want them to do the job they just don't have it they don't have yeah but if rishi hatton's tractor can automatically tweet the tracks that he's playing. Exactly. There's no excuse for them not to be. I think it's going to take a concerted effort on the part of our industry and our culture to say, you know what? We've put together this reporting system. These are the tracks that have been played for the night. Here's the playlist. I expect to see royalties at the end of the year. You know, I mean, because otherwise they're just taking money from us. and that's taxation without representation. Well, right. You know what happened. Don't tread on me. You know what I'm saying? Well, that's, yeah, I had a brief conversation with Dr. Mata about it, you know, the guys at Love Parade, and his biggest point was that GEMA, the people making these decisions were not elected in any kind of democratic way. It goes back to the idea that it's, you know, it's just a company making money, but they make these decisions. decisions that affect everyone. I mean, it's a protection racket. They're shaking you down, basically. But BMI and ASCAP are the same way. If you have a bar or restaurant in the States, you have to become a member and pay your dues. And if you say, well, I don't play music that you guys license. They'll send a representative to just sit in your bar day in, day out, waiting until they hear Michael Jackson, and then they slap you with a fine and you're screwed. But yeah, I mean, I think, to kind of go back to your point, Philip, I think the interesting thing about this is a lot of people do feel that artists should see more of their own royalties, and they feel that there should be some kind of better system in place. And this new terror system clearly isn't it. But this could be an interesting opportunity to suggest something, because I also think it would clearly really strengthen the argument against schema if there was some kind of counterproposal. But, you know, I don't know how likely it is that. I think, you know, sort of rallying the electronic music industry in Berlin is very much like herding cats or whatever. But I think, first of all, it would scratch a niche that a lot of artists have felt for a long time in terms of actually making some money from their records instead of being, you know, in some cases, obligated to be. a DJ when it's not even what they really want to do. And at the same time, I think it would, you know, massively enhance the argument against GEMA if they actually had a better idea. Or the argument for GEMA if they were actually distributing royalties fairly. I mean, then it would be great. I don't really have a problem. I mean, they sound very reasonable when they say, well, we think that 10% of the door is a reasonable amount to distribute back to the artist. If that were happening fairly and with accountability, I could think, yeah, I think. one euro of the 10 euros I'm spending at the door, that ought to go to the artist. Or to, rather not to the artist playing, but to the artist whose music is being played. You talk to club owners and they say... listen, we'd probably be fine with that, but why should we pay into a system that's not paying the artists that are being played? Right, yeah, it's the essential. And I think also they're really the... It feels very drastic. It feels like to have these 1,000% rate hikes or whatever it is. Yeah, 1,000% rate hike is never appropriate. If this is what you're looking at, maybe you should phase it in over the next five years or ten years. You know what I mean? So the question, and it's been brought up in a couple of different places, is this exorbitant rate hike, is it just a... situation where they're bargaining yeah this is the first step in the bargaining process where they're like well we should have made this change a long time ago so let's go ahead and do something crazy and if we just get a decent amount of a rate hike that'll be enough but you know the fact is is that this tariff is going to happen So clubs are going to get an invoice, I don't know, three months after the beginning of the year for this hike. And then what happens? I guess, you know, the interesting thing is where can this discussion be had? What I've read is that it's just going to have to be taken into the courts in Germany. And it seems like the Pirate Party would come out on the side of the clubs, at least. I mean, they've been... Well, and there is, I read there is some, like, you know, official government office of some kind investigating the legality of it. But it seems like, yeah, like you said, Todd, it is going into effect, and it's just a matter of whether it can be repealed or whatever. Or negotiated. Yeah, but a lot of clubs won't be able to afford that first invoice. Yeah. I don't know enough about the German legal system. system rightness but I wonder if there's the possibility of a class action suit where you could get all of these clubs together basically so that they can continue to stay open basically and you're gonna have so many lawyers calling you tomorrow Todd I mean, I think, you know, it's an interesting question in the ramifications it has for Berlin as this sort of split identity that Berlin has as a the capital of world clubbing, world capital of clubbing. And also Berlin is a city that wants to mature and that wants to become, you know, a city for software and industry and intellectual property. And you have these two things in tension and you have, you know, rising rents and you have gentrification. And this question about, you know, what should clubs be paying and what's the proper sort of role of nightlife in a city? I mean, I think it's... it's not an easy answer, but I think it's something that Berlin is grappling with right now, you know? Well, and also, yeah, on the same token, I've... last year when we were filming the real scenes Berlin, this big topic that everyone in the music scene here kind of disagrees on is, so Berlin has this really unique identity, not just in music, but in many areas, you know, culturally, artistically, et cetera, that is. largely thanks to, you know, low rent and just the sort of lifestyle that's possible here. And so kind of a thing that people disagree on is how permanent is that? Or is that just sort of an essential part of Berlin that will be there forever? Or is it something that could be completely different five years from now? And, you know, there are plenty of examples of other cities that... over the course of a decade you know it was a completely different place and um i think right now Berlin, it's, you know, it's too difficult to imagine, like a version of Berlin with very expensive apartments and clubs that end at 5am or whatever, you know, it feels inconceivable. But in reality, you know, much crazier things have happened. Oh, yeah, it's totally possible. I mean, it depends on the The will of the politicians, basically. So I guess I'll just see you both at Berghain on January 1st, 2013. And hope for the best.
