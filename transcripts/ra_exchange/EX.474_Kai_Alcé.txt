Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Matthew McDermott, and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor. This past Sunday, 20,000 people gathered at a public park in Atlanta to dance to house music. House in the Park, founded 15 years ago and thrown by Ramon Rosol and Kai Alce, sees a majority black crowd turn out in droves for soulful dance music. But when Al Say arrived in Atlanta 20 years ago, the house scene was virtually non-existent. For this week's exchange, we're thrilled to announce a collaboration with Underground in Black, the radio show, blog, and party run by Atlanta via Detroit DJ Ash Larn. We'll be working with Ash for the foreseeable future on exchange podcasts with key figures from the past, present, and future of black dance music. As Ashlarne came up in Detroit before moving to Atlanta, she was a natural choice to interview Alce, who brought the lessons he learned working at Detroit's legendary music institute to the Deep South. The son of Haitian immigrants, Alce maintains a deep connection with Detroit, as well as his native New York. He throws an annual movement afterparty, Deep Detroit, each year. and the name of his label, NDATL, reps the cities which have shaped his sound. Through his label, parties, and his own standout DJing and production, Alce is concerned both with preserving the rich legacy and fostering the future of black dance music. What's up everybody this is Ash Lauren coming to you live. Today I am in the studio with the one and only Kai Alce. For those of you who don't know Kai is a DJ and producer from Detroit who's been based in Atlanta for 20 plus years now. Really happy to be here with you today, Kai. Just gonna start this out. What you been up to lately? You want to tell the people, give a brief little introduction of who you are, what you're about? I mean, I guess you just gave a brief one, but I just got back from... touring over in the EU, just a few dates. Again, I'm based here in Atlanta, like you said. I run a record label called NDATL, which stands for Three Places Where I've Lived, which is New York, Detroit, Atlanta. Yeah, I don't know. So how was your experience this last tour? I know you just got back a couple days ago. Yes, actually, two days ago. So two places were recurring. I played in Berlin and I played in Barcelona and places where I played before, which both of them were just as gratifying as the first time that I played for them. Berlin was for diversity. Some friends of mine named Stratos, they run a night at About Blank. As well as a night in Barcelona at Razzmatazz. Mark Germano, he invited me and yeah, it was great. It was my first time also playing an event called Free Rotation. which my understanding is very quite esteemed to be invited as well as like even for the patrons to get to go. It's sort of like a lottery. You know, you have to be invited by someone who's already been. But yeah, it was really cool. So, yeah, I saw a lot of talk about. free rotation just after the fact I guess online you know there's a few people kind of buzzing about it being that you just experienced it like what separates free rotation from some of the other large festivals you've played like what makes it you know what it is and separates it from everything else well for one obviously all the you know, obstacles to actually get there. Yeah. I think from my understanding, the capacity is a thousand, maybe even a little less. They have camping grounds and the hotel. And it just seems like so. Which I think is requested by the promoters. They request that the DJs who are playing that after that weekend that whether or not if you're playing on the last day or the first day, they request that you stay the whole weekend. Oh, just to experience like the whole festival. Correct. That's awesome. And, you know, the people that see in the girl, this is like, I guess, some industry. And then there's some like people who are just, you know. lovers of music and so they get a chance you get a chance to talk to a bunch of people you know where they're from you know some some people you know how long did it take them to actually make it to the festival and where does the festival take place? in Wales so outside of it was about two hour drive from Birmingham the airport which I flew into funny enough I guess it was at the Hotel Baskerville which is like So if I'm getting this correct, this was like the school that Sherlock Holmes went to, the writer who wrote Sherlock Holmes. You know, he wrote a book called The Hounds of Baskerville. Wow. This was supposedly the school in which like those kids got ate by the hound or whatever, which someone was like laughing because they were like, yeah, great place to have a, you know, a festival. And people are like running around to get all. all day and all night, you know, in this old hotel that kind of winds around. But it tends to be, you know, part of the character of the actual festival because they actually have two big rooms or two rooms within the hotel. And then kind of like a tent where they're just playing ambient music. It's almost like being in a little yoga hut or something like that, you know? Okay. And then outside they have an outside dome, which they play music during the day. And I think at 6 or 7 it ends in the dome and then moves to the hotel. And they play music until 6 in the morning. Okay. Now, were there any performances that stick out? So did you end up staying longer? Like, did you do a whole weekend or did you just do it? Yes, so I did the whole weekend. Was there anyone you saw that kind of like you were impressed by? Yeah, a few people. Thomas Sumo, you know, did a great job. I've seen her a few times and she's always good. Pete did his first live show early on, which was quite minimal, bubbly, and it fit that afternoon setting. Who else? Did you see Mr. G? Yeah, Mr. G was amazing. So Mr. G, that was my first time catching him live. Wow. And yeah, he was, yeah, it's amazing. Just to see him do what he does with what he has, you know, and like so many other people want to emulate or copy or bring that type of energy and like he does it with effort, you know, effortlessly. Yeah. definitely someone I would love to see one day in my life personally. Huckabee, Patrice Scott did real well. Okay. Yeah, Huckabee did play, I guess, after me in the Dome on Sunday. And that went real well. So when you're traveling and on tour, like, how does it feel? Like, does it ever feel like a family reunion in a sense to like be over in Europe, like hanging out with your homies or friends or colleagues? Definitely. From back in, you know, from the D, like back in the day. And you're like, wow, we're just over here in Europe. Right. So, yeah, definitely there have been times where, you know, you just might be three or four of us from Detroit that just happen to be in the same town. So when Sherrod was there in Berlin, actually, I didn't get a chance to catch up with him. But, you know, I saw Carl Craig while I was in Barcelona. So, you know, it's great to like just run into people in our travels and just say that they're doing, you know, they're still pushing the sound. They're still out here working. So, yeah, definitely. All right, so now that we talked about what you're up to currently, we're going to take it back a little bit. Your label and the ATL is basically a representation of you being born in New York, raised in Detroit, and now you're in Atlanta. What are your early memories of music? But would you say those would be in New York or in Detroit? In New York, of course. You know, because my father was sort of like a high-five buff, so he always had, like, a real nice turntable. He had a mixer. Not that he was ever trying to be a DJ. He had a reel-to-reel. He was into music. Yeah, he was into music. Quality, yeah. Correct. So he listened to jazz, and then my mom would always kind of bang. or Caribbean music. And then being that we were in New York, we were just in the hotbed of disco music, what would now be hip-hop and all that kind of stuff. And so that was being played on the radio and played at my home and in and around everything I was doing. So those were my earliest, because I... I probably bought my first 12-inch or something like that before I left New York. When you were still living in New York. Correct. But not trying to DJ at that point, just buying music. Yeah, yeah. And I moved to Detroit. And not knowing what to expect, what I would have gained from moving there, you know? So we're going to rewind it back a little more, too. So your parents moved to New York, but are both of your parents Haitian? Or is it just one? Both are Haitian. Okay, so what brought them to the States? Well, it worked. Work? Okay. And that was the same reason you guys ended up moving to Detroit from New York? Correct. So work with father, yes. Okay. So when you got to Detroit, how old were you? About 10, 11. 10. Okay. And what was that like? Like, was it kind of a, I mean, do you remember, was it like a kind of a difference? Yeah. So that was a total difference because I had no idea where Detroit was. Nothing about the culture. We didn't even know who it was. Detroit wasn't even in my existence at that point. So did someone get a job or something? My father got a job. My mother-in-law probably had to pull out a map and was like, yeah, this is where we're moving. Get in the car. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you know, we moved. It was funny. I just brought that up. DJ Stingray was one of a few people. He actually lived on the same block as I do. Wow. Or maybe about a block up. Okay. So he's maybe about the third or fourth person I remember meeting in Detroit when I first moved there. And he just kind of rode me around, introduced me to a few other people. So you've known him that long? Yeah. That's crazy. I never knew that. Okay. Shortly after, you kind of just fall into it. So what kind of music was he into? What was the scene? Was it like... Electro, so what he's doing now, electro music. Okay, like the early days of that. Yeah. So that was still going on. And, you know, you know, he was he had a few records early out that, you know, you could look them up. They were like borderline just that electro dance music, which was kind of just what everybody was doing. You know, Juan and Derek at that time. And not even at that time. You know what I'm saying? This is because this is a few years before that for those guys. songs were released. Just, you know, they used to be the high school, because I had a sister, so let me say that. I had a sister who was about three years older than me. And so, a lot of those parties were thrown by high school, these kind of like high school groups. Okay. They were called like Snobs, Darla, Shari Vare, which now... Yeah, I was going to say like Todd Johnson, he speaks about those. these little girls would be my five or six teenagers and they had some sort of name and they would throw these parties. So my sister would go to them and my parents had this weird notion that if, you know, my sister took her little brother that that would keep her out of trouble. And so that tended to, you know, I was able to go to some of these parties maybe a little younger than I was supposed to. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it just kind of stuck with me. I ended up thinking of one of those early friends, Scott, his brother, took me over to this other guy's house. They had turntables. So this is about 83, somewhere around there. Or maybe a little earlier, because I think I bought my turntables in 83. So within a couple months after going on some... Oh, after kind of being exposed to that. Yeah, to the actual turntables, you know, DJing. Before then, I was always still into the music. But again, that music was, at that point, electro disco. maybe some hip hop at that time you know what I'm saying it wasn't quite house wasn't quite house yeah exactly so is that like the type of music you were playing early on when you did get the turntables like that's the type of record you were buying so that's what you know i think there's a record right here in this pile uh call me mr telephone which was sort of like a pop song i guess you know uh for progressive which actually wasn't it was produced by some italian disco people And then some Americans recreated it. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Okay. So that was like, that was the music that was being played at that time. And then, you know, House came along. And, yeah, I just was there for that, you know. It's always in the argument what was the first House record. I can't really say, you know. But I do remember, you know, buying time to Jack or, you know. Now, were you in high school still at this point? I was in high school, yes. You were in high school. Yeah. Okay. Maybe not even high school. Was I? Yeah. Because, again, this is 13, 14, you know? Okay. So I was probably either eighth, ninth grade, somewhere in there when I first probably started buying some records. So how did you go from... Just being a kid, like, just getting some, you know, new turntables, buying some records, like, go from that to being, like, involved in the Music Institute. Were you, like, trying to kind of make your way into that scene? Were those people older than you, or were... So, yeah, so most of those people were about five or six. years older than I was. I just actually happened to go funny enough I went to go see Farley at maybe Taboo on a Wednesday night. They were trying to promote the Music Institute so they were there passing out flyers like you know come at least come check it out. that night it wasn't open per se and we went I mean a friend of mine and he was like you know we're actually hiring next week and so we came back next Tuesday when they were hiring you know they hired me as like a co-check you know boy and Yeah, the rest is history. But, you know, again, I was into the music. So what was it like, like, I mean, working the door there? What type of people were walking through the door? Like, these were mostly young people, right? Like this, and it was like sober also, I hear a lot. Like it wasn't revolved around drinking or drugs. It was just kind of maybe more fashion. or like being fly? No, so, I mean, people got drunk and high. I mean, you know, but there was no, there wasn't, you couldn't sell, you know, you couldn't sell it in the club. So it was a juice bar. Okay. But there was a parking lot, so. Oh, so people would just like, you know. Yeah, so Lou, I mean. Do whatever before and then come. Correct. So, you know, it was funny, like, you know, around 1 o'clock everybody would just kind of like get out their cars and just file file and there'd be a line you know if you wanted to go back out and drink you could you know so that's how we got around that yeah so did you ever get to did you ever play there from like your days when you were working the coat check or I might have played like a few records with Shay you know so say shade I'm getting out to Miller ran a Saturday night Derek D win and so the guy named Chuck Roper rest in peace ran Friday night as well as they had a few you know they had guests like wine and Kevin and all this kind of guys would come through where I said like pretty much stayed standard just Shane Alton And since Shay was sort of like my mentor, you know, while he'd be playing, he'd be like, you know, you want to play a record? Or, you know, why don't you play a few records? That was to the extent of it. I never per se had a full set where it was like, okay, I'll sing. Yeah, yeah, okay. You were still the early days. Okay. But yeah, what I learned from there. both of them, or both the difference in the evenings, always will stick with me. with me. Okay, cool. Moving forward to when you moved to Atlanta, so probably post-Music Institute, you moved to Atlanta to go to college. I'd assume you were about 17, 18 years old. Did you know anything about Atlanta prior to you going down there? I mean, I guess you had to know a little bit if you decided. You knew it was a good school. Yes. I think that was about all I knew. And your parents probably wanted you to go. You know, I don't know where they want. I knew where they didn't want me to go, which was NYU. So I got accepted to NYU. My father was like, because I was already traveling there to go like party at times. And so he was just like. The distraction. Yeah, he was like, oh, yeah. And would it have been a distraction or maybe I would be doing what I'm doing now? I don't know, you know. So, you know, I decided to move. I didn't want to stay in state in Michigan, so I moved to Atlanta. I think another choice may have been Howard. Okay. But, yeah, I went somewhere else. And, yeah, no, I... Can't say I knew anything about Atlanta per se. So when you got here, I mean, like, what did you think about it? I mean, I know for me personally, I had never been here. I thought it would probably be like extremely country or southern. It's kind of a, you know. Yeah, I think I had all those preconceived notions of being country and blah, blah, blah. Once you get over the accent of the people, it's the same. The difference was that they did not have history in dance music per se, like as a Detroit or New York or D.C. Yeah. So that it was totally void of that, you know, outside of the few gay places that played house music. So there wasn't like a house music culture per se. No. So at the time when I was here, the impression like. You know, on campus, Ron Pullman would play some pipes for some New York promoters, as well as Ted Patterson used to work at this place called Color Box. But then outside of that would have been the gay clubs like Trax and Loretta's and 688 Weekends. So the house was at the gay clubs? It was at the gay clubs, yeah, that was it, strictly. You know, again, for the few little things I said. that would have been thrown by some of the college promoters that were from New York or whatever, D.C. I don't remember what the Chicago promoters were. So it was kind of like influence from people that were maybe in school down here. That were in school down here. Yeah, it wasn't like the locals that were throwing house music events. Correct. And one particular year, Ron Pullman and Ted Patterson moved away. Pullman moved back to like Denver I think and Ted Pastner moved to New York and I just found sort of like a vacuum of just like if I don't do it now I mean either somebody else will or there won't be any house music you felt like that was a time you could really step up yeah so that's what I did and luckily I had a friend of mine named Samir who he was one of the promoters that would have like Ron Pullman and he actually invited a few people from New York at the time he was from New York and he kind of like put me in on one gig and we started doing party at a Thursday night party at a club called Velvet. And from that point on, it just kind of... Was it the Velvet Room? No, Velvet. So actually the original owners of... Well, one of them is now part... tongue and groove which is still open yeah yeah um yeah and uh you know i just kind of stuck to my guns and just always kind of continued to play house music instead of anything else because there wasn't no one else really playing it down here So I just felt like it was a small niche, but it was a niche that I could feed. It was like a void that needed to be filled, and you were right there. Then a place called Oxygen opened up after that. There were other things. Then the rave scene was starting to grow huge in the 90s. So you had things like Liquified, and Liquified would bring the... King Brent, Josh Wink, Doc Martin. And they still have to... Yeah, but it's pretty much a lot more EDM now. They do it at the district. But definitely they, you know, another scene that also contributed, you know, to where we are now. Okay. So you obviously brought your turntables, like, down to school when you came? No. Actually, I didn't. I think I may have brought it. Did I bring any? I don't know. I think my parents were definitely trying to squash that. Oh, like your dream of being a DJ. Because I didn't want to be a DJ per se. I wanted to know how to DJ, but I didn't see it as a profession at that time. I had not seen anybody live their life as a DJ at that point. And I saw some people doing really well. And by the time I got to Atlanta... That's when people like Shea and Ron and... Derek and them really started to take off. It was more so watching it happen as opposed to knowing that those guys would be still DJing right now 30 years later. Yeah, you probably wouldn't have thought that. Correct. So it's crazy. So what would you say has kept you in Atlanta? for so long. Being that there are a lot of, you know, producers who maybe are from Detroit or from New York and, you know, they decide to move to Europe, you know, because it's, you know, it's easier. They can make more money. They can tour more. or even moving back to New York or maybe somewhere where dance music is more known or more popular. Like what has kept you living in the South and Atlanta specifically for all the years you've been here now? I guess partly, you know, the backstory I just gave to you, you know, it's kind of part of. the the fabric of house music being here in atlanta and i've always believed that part of your environment you know helps you create whatever it is that you make um so atlanta's been an integral part of you know what i've done and who i've become and uh it's made it easy like so i find if i need to go to New York I mean it's a $200 ticket and you know a little time so um and I always go Detroit and New York I probably go to both at least four times a year you know and so I'm never too far away from either one of them. So I've never, you know, I knew I never wanted to necessarily move back to New York. It's hard living there, you know? It's expensive. But I truly enjoy the energy. You know, it's like no place else in the world, you know? Yeah. But luckily, you know, for myself, I've kept friends. I've kept my connection to New York. So, you know, it's just like going to my second home there. So Atlantis has been more comfortable and easier for me to survive. And again, you know, I made my. my name or branded my name coming from here, you know. And it helped to expand the people that I brought here from Detroit, as well as the people that I brought here from New York. Like, I've opened their eyes to that there's something here to be seen, so. Completely agree. Even in the years of me living here, I do feel like the scene has expanded a lot more. And there is the conversation of Atlanta. There's people there. They can name names, parties, record labels. So it is cool to see the growth. You mentioned liquefied. Are there any other crews or people that you can think of that were kind of instrumental in bringing Atlanta to the forefront? back when and also currently back then so like Karen was part of a group called Earftone or Karen on the owns a club music room okay um so earth tone was sort of like they would bring the people like diy sunshine jones the wicked crew from like san francisco he would bring more of that kind of like dubby you know house stuff um then carl was um and jackson were now on sound table um carl was um very integral and bringing a lot of that broken beat sound. So he was very intertwined with the whole jazz and all the bugs in the attic. You know, Giles Peterson, Benji B. So he kept that very strong connection with them. And then I was the one who kept the connection to Chicago, Detroit, and then built. some of my relationships with New York as I became more of a DJ here in Atlanta. Okay. And Satellite Records, I just want to briefly speak about that. That is a record store. Oh, yeah. So Satellite Records was born out of New York. A guy named Tommy Sunshine convinced the owner of New York to open up one here in Atlanta. I don't know how. I don't know why. You know? But it was in the bottom of a store called Wish. And, you know, I happened to go in there. Wish and Little Five Points? Wish and Little Five Points. Wow, that's where it was? Yeah, it was in the basement. Where all the shoes are now. Yeah, where all the shoes are now. And, you know, I stayed there for about a year. Yeah, about a year. And then it moved across the street from Wax and Facts. I had a storefront there. So when did that era end? On satellite? Yeah. Satellite ended in 2006, if I'm correct. Oh, okay. So it was open for about 10 years. Yeah. Yeah, satellite was huge because, I mean... Satellite was like, they had one here, they had two in New York, and one in Boston. And so they were like the largest distributor, seller of records for years. Wow. Yeah, we were selling records everywhere, definitely. So, I mean, what was it like working in the record store? Do you think that influenced you? your sound at all just being around music all day every day maybe some of the people you meet the connections you make uh definitely with the connections i made you know with the record labels you know they want to know you know because they were sending the records down here they'd want to know who was the buyer okay and so you know they'd make sure i got promos which you know or if records came in and I wanted to be like, yeah, keep me in, you know, and play with, you know, some of these records. And then because I was at Coldplay, actually with a lot of people from Detroit, I was actually helping them sometimes get their records into the store. Okay. So, yeah, it was a great grounds for me at that time, you know, because I think while I was there, I was also playing in MJQ. So, you know, yeah, it kind of went hand in hand. Okay, that makes sense. Through MJQ, I probably built more of my relationships with the producers because I would, you know, bring them down to come play. And, you know. I think back then was when I always knew I wanted to start a record label. So whoever I kept brought down, "When Damna call you, do something for my label." They'd be like, "All right, no problem." So far, so good. Everybody's honored their... - That's dope. Moving forward to now, like from back then, what do you think about the scene in Atlanta, like the current state of the scene, if you will? - I think it's grown a lot. I want to say there's more people, but it's more fractured. It seemed like more people partied together a little bit more in the 90s as opposed to now in the early teens. Through the 90s, some of those older clubs that I could think of like Kaya and Velvet. they were a little bit more of a melting pot of like the people who went and partied together. It slowly but surely has fractured into, you know, these people hang out with these people, blah, blah, blah. You know, I don't want to say it's a bad thing. I just think that it was a little more fun when they all partied. Okay, so you're saying it wasn't as clickish, if you will. Yeah, and the music has evolved into so many sub-genres as opposed to... Yeah, and everyone has their little specifics about what they like. But I will say, for me, living here and seeing you... play like over the past 10 years or so um i think your crowd is definitely one of the crowds i see like at your parties is one of some of the most diverse you know people i see so so kudos to you so sticking i guess with the atl a little bit uh so you just celebrated 10 years of your label into ATL. So congrats to you on that. I recall one time we were, I think, maybe me and a friend over here but we were talking to you we're asking you about production um and you said that you waited a while before you got into production like you were just djing for a while uh what do you think kind of made you get to that point where you're like already i'm i think i'm ready to start like making tracks I don't know. I think I was just starting to maybe been at them jigs. for about a year maybe that was like maybe 97 98 somewhere around there not just you know start you know hearing the music that was being out I was like okay I think I can do that and you know yeah yeah and just you know maybe I'd hear songs that I'd be like I wish they would have done this I wish I was like So I was like, you know, let me stop saying that and let me just start putting my... Let me just do it. Yeah. And I bought my... I think I bought an MPC first. And shortly after that, I think I bought a Juno and a Mackie, like, board. That was pretty much my... That was my studio for about the first couple of years, definitely just that Juno, MPC, and the Mackie, you know, maybe microphone or so. And that worked for some years. And I just kind of learned the craft over those years, learning a little bit from every person that came from out of town. Everybody knew something different about. the MPC or knew something different about this and that. And then, you know, of course, then in front of them, there's the, you know, computers get into the game. So I'm trying to think of when I, maybe around the time that I actually started the label. Is when you started incorporating the computer? When I got a computer. Okay. By that time, I'd already had, you know, like a few couple tracks that were R.E.L. and those recorded on. Some of them were on mini-discs and I think some of them were recorded on the VS-880. And yeah, here we are now. So what would you describe the end to ATL sound to be? Is there a sound... like there is a type of sound like there's a lot of just feeling in it you know like it's definitely not like a lot of other stuff I hear I think it grabs from those three aspects you know Chicago so you know I think you know some of my friends from Chicago always said you know don't forget you guys you got some Chicago and you know and I do because you know I you know I went there being from those the three places or you know how I came about I got to see things that most people didn't see not all of them So many New Yorkers have only seen New York, especially during those golden era. New Yorkers, rightfully so, they just stayed in New York. They didn't go anywhere. Most Chicago people didn't go anywhere. Detroit is never, you know, some of the, you know, but the friends that I had, they traveled. And then I had friends, you know, just because my relatives were still in New York, I would go back to New York. So I would go to the clubs there. So you were kind of getting bits and pieces. Yeah, from all of them. And you can, you'll never, you'll never meet somebody from New York that was like, oh yeah, I went to the Music Institute. Or, you You ain't gonna meet somebody from New York saying, oh yeah, I went to the music box. You know, so maybe you know if we do gonna be weird, but I'm one of people that can say yeah I've been in music. I kind of traveling to party back then they were kind of just I've been to you know clubhouse in DC. I've been to booze in Philadelphia I've been to you know the world in New York. I would say robot I've been to you know, I've just you know when I went to New York I would you know Yeah, I was I was anywhere I could get in, you know? So when you were like bouncing around, like, were you, were you doing gigs at the time? this time or you were just like a music fan like i'm just a music fan yeah i was just hanging out i was djing you know so i would go to these parties and then you know maybe try to hunt down those records like the next day yeah you're like getting that inspiration correct you know uh which i think is very important uh i mean just as an artist as a dj like it's it's okay to be a fan too you know and to go out there and put in that time and just get that education. I'm still a fan of many, you know. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm still a fan of many. Speaking of Enda ATL, you started doing the special edition. Like, what was... the ideology behind that. Okay, so the ideology behind that was to just make something special for those people who came to the party. The first one, so I don't know if we could consider a special edition, but the first one was Andre said they're remixed on feeding. And so I've had that on 12 on one side. And then there was some other mixes of... Power through on the other side. So I kind of just did that at that party. It kind of caught on, you know. And then the next party I did was with Larry Hurd and Theo Parrish. So, of course, you know, those guys are huge as well. I wasn't really thinking about it. I was just like, yo, let me do this seven. I did a seven inch and, you know, had, you know, three, like four minute tracks, four minute track. Actually, I think Theo's and then was a little longer. Um, were you calling it the special edition back then? I think so. Yeah. Yeah. So I think that one was the first one. It was special to the, to the party, basically that event. So, Unbeknownst to me, you know, so I thought, you know, novelty, you know what I'm saying? That's now a phenomenon. Well, yeah, because, you know, I didn't realize, but like, yeah, so I think like maybe like the Tuesday after that party, someone was already on disco. I was trying to sell it for like a hundred bucks. It was like not even the greatest pressing, you know, because I was, again, I was just trying something different out and it was something But anyway, you know. But the music was there. And then it was Larry Heard and Theo. So, you know, people. So, I mean. okay let me keep this in play I think so the next one was um was a single-sided Music Institute and so then what was the next one after that one I was a 10-inch with me Spector and Marcellus Pittman then the next one was I think me Norm Talley and Kyle Hall Then me, Mike Huckabee, and J. Daniel. Then the next one was me and Stefan. Then the next one was me, Shea, and Alton. Then Patrice Scott, me, and Goucher. Then I had to double pack. Last year. With a bunch of the artists who played over the years. Yeah. And then this year. And then this year was me, Nick Holder, and Brett Danson. And so, you know, people have always complained about, you know, that's expensive. So my thought behind it was that people pay $20 for it when they go to the party. That's not taking consideration of what it took for them to get to Detroit. You know, they paid $20 to get into the party, you know, and now they're paying $20 for the record. So for me to then sell it afterwards to people who never made it to the party for the same amount of money. feels a disservice to those who did, you know, who did make the trek and made the effort. to be at the party. Oh, so you sell it for less at the actual event? Of course. At the event, it's usually $20. Okay. And afterwards, it's $30. Or whoever else on Discogs. $100. Yeah, there it goes, yes. And then, you know, and then also I give a box. I usually give a bunch of copies to the artist in which they can sell as well. Oh, okay. And there's only about 300 to 400 of them ever pressed, you know, so we keep it tight. And, you know, again, sometimes people always complain about the music, and I say, I've got records that I've had longer than any pair of shoes or anything else that I've owned in my life, so if I pay $30 for that, I think it's worthwhile. investment exactly because it stays with you what is uh the future of deep detroit i know you were doing it um at the location that used to be the music institute um and well was that it was actually next door or something down the box so music institute was at 1315 broadway And then when Music Institute closed, a lot of the parties ended up going to 1515. Not Music Institute per se, but just the idea. So people threw underground house parties. I think Carl Craig did in his own orchestra there. So these kind of things, they gravitated to 1515. So yeah, we did 1515. We did that for the first eight years. then the ninth one was at one space and then the last two have been at red door digital which i hope to stay there you know until that that changes um i love the 15 15 broadway space just with like the little bar upstairs The owner hated us having it, you know. Yeah, yeah. It was super underground. Yeah, we would enjoy that. But I think definitely for where you're at now and just the size of the party, like the new venue is definitely like, you know, it's a way better fit. You know what I mean? because you saw, I mean, even this year, I was like, wow, like last year, like it seems like the turnout is even bigger than before. So it seems like the party is actually growing. And growing at a nice pace. I've seen some other parties, you know, really grow really fast or just kind of hit the scene in Detroit during the festival. But we've always kind of just tried to stay true to. just a true underground formula and I'm glad that it's stuck with the people that have come and they continue to come I think one thing that helps is that it's kind of family run I got my sisters working the door, my mother friends of the family everybody's kind of helping out so it's always been good so far So speaking of your family, what do they think about you being this star-studded DJ? Do they think it's cool? Yeah, I think now they do, you know. For a little while, my mom and dad were... feel like you know get a real job and now yeah I think now they finally understand and they're kind of like they're a lot more supportive now you know if I need something now that I totally I think they have a better understanding so another thing I want to touch on mentorship. So, you know, being that this collaboration with Resident Advisor, with my brand Underground in Black. which initially was started with the idea of preserving the roots of dance music, like keeping dance music black, keeping dance music American. And a tool that I think that makes that possible is something like mentorship. You know, I guess the older generation coming with it. a new generation of people and kind of working together and collaborating or, I don't know, asking questions. I'm sorry, I've totally, I mean, I don't know, you may have to ask them, but I think I've always tried to keep my door open. Yeah, plenty of people come and ask me about things about, you know. distribution, making records and all nine yards that, you know, they tend to tell me that some of the old school guys were a little bit more guarded about passing on that information. I see that to be unnecessary, you know, because no one can, it's just like a record, you know, telling somebody with the title of a record, they can't do what you do with it, you know what I'm saying? So, so you shouldn't be scared of what, what it is. I know. Yeah. I'm totally for any people, really anybody, but people of color in specific, you know, in America that are trying to do it, I'm trying to be there for them. You know, like I mentioned before, like Stefan, once I first heard his music, I was told about trying to push him and, you know. tell him to get his music out there, you know? So, because I think nowadays so, so many people in the youth, you know, and kind of make it and feel like, you know, it is what it is and it'll do what it do. And you can make it do what it do, you know, if you know the proper channels and you have the belief in the music as, you know, as you should. So I think I told you that, that like, you know, I feel like I definitely helped bring some light to Stefan. Byron Aquarius, who's now flying all over the world, and Javante. You know, these are like three people that, like, they've always had the talent. So, you know, I haven't given them the talent. I just kind of showed them the door and showed them how to open it, you know. And, yeah, I just want now the world to receive them and whoever else I can help along the way. try her and I think I have. Agreed. And I definitely, I think that that's important because to touch on what you said about there are maybe people who've been in the game for a longer time, you know, they're more, you know, guarded or, you know, quick to judge or say, you know, oh, they don't get it or it's not the same. Me personally, I just kind of look at it as an each one, teach one type of thing. If you have knowledge, there's nothing wrong with sharing it, especially to a culture that you're trying to keep alive. This is underground culture. This isn't something that's at the forefront. Although you could say it's popular in a sense, I think it's still important just to... have that connection with those that came before us, you know. Of course. Because things will never be what they used to be. So, you know, the only thing I can do is tell you about how the world or, you know, Sound Factory or things like that were, you know. And to tell you that it can happen again, but it'll have to happen on your terms. And you guys will have to invest the time and the energy to make it happen. You know what I'm saying? Because, yeah, it's not going to happen for me. I might be able to, somebody like myself might be able to give you the venue, maybe give you the tools to do it. But it will take the energy of the youth to make it happen again. You know, it won't happen for me. us. So what's next? What's next for you? What's next for Enda ATL? I know you're in a new studio space. Which we're recording from right now Yeah, everything is a new inspiration It took me a while when I moved in to me a few months, but once I finally got back and You know, I set up my studio which Stefan helped me do Like I I had a few remixes and things of that nature that were just, that had already been commissioned. And so I was able to knock those out pretty quickly once I finally got everything up and running. Yeah, this year's actually been kind of a whirlwind because I put out a few releases. I put out the Andres. Well, Andres was like late last year. I put out The Spinner. That Gregory Porter. The Gregory Porter and the Kamasi Washington. Got the Who Do You Love, Ricky Corey, which is also, you know. So that was like the four pack you've been kind of promoting. Correct. And that did really well. Correct. It seems like it did. Yeah, no, it did. It did. It did. And then now I'm looking forward to the next 12 mentions at 9. producer out of Chicago. Then after that, another Chromatic Just, which will be my official 25th release in the ATL, which I got high hopes for that. I really like it. It's a really weird, cool record. Yeah, you know, there's people probably writing a few remixes out there already. Like I did one for Just One. on Visions recordings. Was that the Dreamer G one? Oh, so the Dreamer G, no, so that's something totally different. Those are just edits. So, you know, with the new Fascination in 7-Inches, me and DJ Spinner said, well, why don't we go back and put some classic house records that never were on 7-Inch on 7-Inch. So that's what we're doing. The latest one was the Dreamer GI Guide feeling and definition of a track, which has been a really cool experience, you know, being able to, because I'm not doing much. I'm just shortening or making them four minutes. But sometimes you got to do certain things to make sure it flows correctly and whatnot. So it's been challenging on a few, but most of them have been pretty easy, you know. And they've come with a... a great reaction to them. A lot of people are enjoying them. I'm doing a remix with these guys, Jan Kinsel and them out of Croatia, where they're doing some real nice good stuff. Any gigs? coming up you're looking forward to? Any more touring in the future? So the last few days you know that I just did but then the next one's in November I think. Okay. Just I think going to France, Berlin, probably Amsterdam. I'll do you know a few again like I did just now but in November. Okay. And then I think from that. The biggest thing I think that I'm looking forward to is the House in the Park thing that we do. That was my next question. So, yeah, so that's probably the biggest thing on my plate coming. So, yeah, House in the Park, Labor Day weekend. Guess we'll kind of close talking about House in the Park. It's really created or turned Atlanta into a destination for house music. Just how does that feel for you just to be a part of, you know, the beginning of that and see it grow and literally just. affect the whole climate of Atlanta dance music? It's amazing in the way and just how it doubled every year to where it's gotten to where it's at now. That was probably the growth of it was pretty... big spurts you know what i'm saying but the other thing about that's great is just seeing it keep the family orientation uh feeling about it you know uh people still bring their kids you know people yeah so it's just uh something we just never expected but it's here and um you know shout out to ramon rossol because that was his brain child um I just came on along and helped him. So it made sure that, you know, things were paid for, you know, first couple of years after that, you know, donations kind of supported everything. And now we've got this small little cover charge of $10 and we got a gate and, you know, everything, you know, things are. Now we can kind of, you know, it's kind of legitimized and made a little easier, took some of the burden off of us, you know, because... I mean for some years we literally had to be out there at 7:00 in the morning the next day cleaning up the park or you know just something crazy you know so we've been able now to kind of delegate those those chores to other companies and whatnot it brings people from across the country now even some people from out of the country All right, Kaio, I just want to thank you for taking the time to talk to me today. And for everybody out there, this was the first edition of a series of exchanges in collaboration with the Resident Advisor and Underground in Black.
