You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. The hour is RA's monthly blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. On today's show, we find out why the techno artist DVS-1 recently built a wall of sound in Rotterdam and Daniel Avery tells us how he went about making a mix for the much-loved DJ Kicks series. But first, each month we ask five people from across the world to tell us what they think about the show. the dance music industry the same topical question. With our in-residence event series about to reach Mystic in Seoul, South Korea, we asked, what makes a great club? First up, AJ Jayaram, promoter from Clock Strikes 13 and the Hydra. So one of the things I've always been really interested in is the dynamic between venues and their patrons. Largely because I feel that those establishments which foster that relationship thrive and those that don't are perhaps less successful. There are a handful of widely regarded tenets of what makes a club good. I think safety is absolutely paramount. We all want to feel comfortable in a particular environment. We want to feel we have confidence in the people from the team behind the venue. The other thing I think is really underestimated is the anticipation that is involved in the process of going to a nightclub. It's something that nowadays people can probably manipulate more in terms of artists and promoters. The social media campaigns that go on. but certainly my formative clubbing experiences were underpinned by the anticipation of standing in a queue, perhaps feeling a little bit compromised already on my way in, and just really looking forward to a DJ, being in a venue that I knew well and had that kind of relationship with and felt safe in, and just being very rude. Taito and Zviad from Vasiani in Tbilisi. since in the end it's just an entertainment they say which is a wrong perception of clubbing in my opinion in most major cities all over the world there are or have been in the last few decades outstanding nightclubs with essential social and in many cases political importance and influence. Musical direction and its uniqueness is vital here of course. For me with no doubt it's the most crucial criteria because the music stands first but once again setting priorities is a false attitude here. worth mentioning that there is no great club with no great sound. And surely knowing your space and people well, presenting them the right concept and messages is of an existential importance. And I think no curfews, at least the early ones, because they are too evil. For me the place is amazing when it has its own identity. You can get everything from DJ equipment to lineup, but you can't buy vibe there. If you take this group Here's Hugh Taylor from RA's events team. What makes a great club? With the In Residence series we've been doing this year, I've been lucky enough to do a lot of travelling to a lot of clubs that we'd handpicked as some of the best in the world. There's a lot of elements that go into making a good club. Obviously, booking is probably the number one aspect. Sound is also incredibly important. The buildings themselves can be a huge factor as well, just in the sense of all you might get in one. But all of these can't, on their own or even all together, really make a club that's great. What makes a club truly great is a unique and personal vision behind it from a hard-working, dedicated, passionate team. When all of those things come together and there's someone that's really steering the ship as it were, you can feel that in every element of it from the crowd to how it looks to how it sounds and that's what really makes you come away with a great club. DJ Heinrich Birkvist. A good club needs a good crowd. If the crowds are not there or if the crowd are douchebags, it's... hard to make a good party I guess. So that's the first thing I would say. I like wooden floors in clubs because first of all if it's a little bit bouncy it's nice to dance on and I guess you can dance for longer if it's a little bit softer than concrete. Also the acoustics tends to be better if it's like wooden and it gets I really like these Buddhist sounds. When I think of a great club, I imagine a warm, nice, dynamic clear sound first of all i imagine like a nice dance floor in a sense of like i look at the people that are really into the music i have smiles i have like a kind of like a good mix between boys and girls i guess if you have too many guys like the energy goes in a different direction if there's a lot of girls you know and they're having fun the guys are also in a good mood you know like this is somehow how the game goes you know and if there's too many men you can feel that sometimes that there's maybe too much testosterone in the club and you have to kind of try to balance it with maybe more mellow music not escalate the situation probably also I think of the owner that is probably really into the music and that actually supports good quality in sense of choosing the right people to work there choosing a good sound system making the club comfortable to hang out there. Actually, some of the best clubs that I know, they also have a good coffee machine. This is Will Lynch, Associate Editor of Resident Advisor, and I'm standing on a dock in Rotterdam outside a massive industrial complex, a former grain silo actually, called Masilo, which will be the venue for... Tonight's Rave, The Wall of Sound, hosted by Zach Kuduretsky, or DVS1 as you might know him. The party will be a bit different from your average house or techno night. It's the first date on a tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of Hush, which is the umbrella company for Zach's various projects over the years, including his record label, his sound company, and his events. So the wall of sound is inspired by the raves Zach went to back in the 90s in Minneapolis. And in particular, there's one detail of these events, which is the wall of sound. Essentially a monolithic wall of speakers sitting on one end of the room that kind of takes the place of the DJ in a way. The crowd stands there facing. this custom-built sound system as they dance. The DJ is sort of out of sight over on the side. Sonically, it's got a different effect from your average club sound system. Basically, it's a bit more physical. Standing there dancing, you don't just hear it. You really feel like you're in this vortex. of sound and pressure and you feel kind of physically moved by the sound system. Naturally, doing this kind of thing takes a bit more effort than just turning up to a club and playing. Zach worked with Danley Sound Labs, a group he's respected for many years, to custom build the rig and then teamed up with a crew on the grounds here in Rotterdam to set it up. for about two days on it. So now everything's ready to go. The club's about to open. You got me? Yeah, I got you. All right. And I'm here with Zach and his main sound guy, Robert. What's happening, we decided to set up more speakers than we need, push on people a little bit, and give them hopefully a little bit of a different experience. You know, something a little different than what they're used to on their every Friday and Saturday night going out to hear House and Tech. At first we needed to design the system so that it's just sticking around some subwoofers and loudspeakers so that we easily can make noise but also it needed to sound well. So of course we started to need to make some simulations in specific software. Then we found out that, well, it actually was going to work. So, well, yesterday we set the system up here in the venue and... With our guys, we tune the system, align the subwoofers to the top cabinets, make everything working right, and hopefully we can give the people who are coming a very nice experience. I mean, the background of getting it ready is really just getting everyone on the same page to understand the idea and the vision of the night. And it's not necessarily about just turning it up loud and showing off. It's about the pressure, the sound. I mean, we play body music, and on this level, it becomes body music. It becomes physical. So with their help and maybe my idea together... we can deliver that kind of vision or that thing that I'm imagining and remembering from my experiences that I already had. The focus is less on the DJ and more on the sound system. The sound system takes center stage. The DJ is only to the side. And of course, we're the conduit. We're playing music. But ultimately, it's people in the end, when the lights are off and the energy is going, people are looking at the sound system. They're always looking where the music is coming from. And when you put the DJ center, we're normally at a club or a festival, everyone's ultimately looking at the DJ. But tonight, I'm hoping that they're looking at the sound system. They're going to physically see the music coming at them. So it's just a change of perspective, I think, for that. And of if necessary, much more louder than usual setup because we can fill up the room with this amount of speaker. We can have a room which is about 10 times the size of this. Normally with six of the big super-woofers you see inside, we do a festival for about 5,000 to 6,000 people. So now we have approximately 2,000. Yeah, 2000 or less. It's completely different than a normal club or festival sound system. I mean, to me, every time I did sound on this level back in the day, it was always, I hate to compare it to this, but it's like riding a wild animal. I mean, this thing is a beast. You have so much headroom, so much energy, the slightest adjustment. can be too loud or not enough. And so it's the whole night you're kind of riding this wave trying to find that perfect sweet spot where it's like it's tremendous, but it's not overwhelming. Robert talked us through the technical side of the sound system. We have 24 single 18 subwoofers. It's all kind of technical terms. And we have six quadro 15-inch subwoofers. So in total, we have 30 subs. which is a ridiculous amount for this venue. When the room fills up and the energy of the sound is high, to me the idea is that everyone in the room cannot stand still. I mean, the physical energy in the room, whether you're at the bar, you're in front, obviously the fanatics, we call them the speaker freakers, those people will be in the front. They will be against the sound. They will be in the field that's the most intense. And then those who are a little less brave will go back further and further. But anywhere you are in the room, as you walk around, you'll see people moving. They can't stand still because there's this energy in the room that's pushing on you. And like the water and how bass works with the water. It's physically moving your insides. It's moving your body. And it feels good. I mean, when the tone hits from the mid-range to the bass, it physically feels good. It makes the hair on your arms stand up. It makes your heart rate sync to the sound. It makes everything kind of come together. So it's beyond just listening. It's beyond just that normal experience. I want somebody to come here and understand why this was better or different than the other experience they have next weekend or the weekend before. I want them to demand in their future something better for themselves because of maybe this experience. Like, wow, this was, I totally heard music. So this is what I'm chasing now. I could tell it was a very powerful system. After a set, I caught up with the night's main guest, Detroit techno legend Jeff Mills, to find out what it's like to DJ on the wall of sound. I knew that the concept of the night was based around the spatial dynamics of a large sound system. So the earlier tracks were kind of testing the system. getting the people used to, I guess, the different dynamics of the sound system. So for about the first hour, it was just very constant, very pulse-like type of, and then once I realized, you know, I could then maybe go off a little bit, then I changed it a little bit. A perfect scenario would be if everyone that came into the club left not feeling exactly the same way as they came in. transcend it to something or somewhere else or realize something within a few hours. So you just kind of hope for the best. I think that as many options as a DJ or a music programmer has in order to be able to use the music, the better. I think the more rich we make our genre, if we expand out more by trying to do or doing very different things, you're going to learn. something in the process. And what you learn, you can bring that back into dance music. So making a setting more dramatic, there's lots of things that you can learn in how to position the music in a way to lead the listener up to a point of uncertainty. And then, you know, you really have the person. A week after the show, I caught up with DVS1 at RA's office here in Berlin to reflect on how the whole thing went. Last time we saw each other was before ongoing. What were your main thoughts coming away from it? So every time we do this, it's an experiment. It's properly an experiment to what I envision in my head and what the... reality is of what happens once we actually set it up. And so this year, like, I don't know if we mentioned it before when we were talking, but we reversed a few things. Like we changed the direction of the room. Most times the sound was always on the other side of the room. We put it on the back side. tried to put the DJ booth on the ground instead of being elevated because I wanted people to be connected to the DJ. We had all these pre-thoughts of things that like, just before I even touch on like the sound system itself, that's where the fine tuning comes in of like how to get that right so that that becomes the focus because that's my whole concept. The concept behind it is, you know, dance to the speaker, don't dance to the DJ. Stop dancing to the DJs. And it just happens to be, the DJ is always front and center. And that also just happens to be where the sound is. But in a lot of places also, there's barricades between you and the sound system. There's literally a barrier because they don't want you to touch the speakers. And I wanted to take that away so people can hear it. could lean on the speaker, they could sit on it, they could, you know, hang out on it, they could do whatever. And I think that's at least something that's unique, that regardless of my opinions or thoughts of the party, I think that was created, and that was something new for them. So at least in that sense, I think it's a success. Here's Dasha Rush, who also played the Wall of Sound. I did have an idea already of that kind of scenario from because I had experienced similar scenario in like late 90s in during the tech novels where it was more focused on the music and the sound rather than a person who is playing. But when Zak came up with the concept, I found it great because I think that's what Technovent should be about. It's just immerse yourself into the music and sound and not having, you know, telephones taking pictures. all the time and kind of focus basically on listening and then through listening you can really fall into this living in the music process. Besides the physical aspect of the sound, which is great because it affects you, we talked about it, it affects you in different ways, different frequencies, wherever your body oscillates also on the different frequencies. But actually I felt way more comfortable playing. that I was kind of, you know, like in my studio, an intimate corner behind the sound system. So I just concentrated on what I was doing and was not preoccupied by anything else. So it's actually also from the perspective of an artist, it's nice sometimes you kind of... Just really having this space where you can just, you know, like intimate space. Did you notice anything different in the way the audience reacted or in the general kind of vibe of the party? Maybe not everybody were familiar with the concept. The positive side, I think the people who... let themselves go and emerge, really emerge in the sound and the music, I think they probably had an amazing experience. Well, I heard some feedbacks from some audience or friends that they had a great experience being just in the darkness and in the sound. And I guess that was the initial idea. Are you excited to do it again, to give it another shot? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. After the event, actually, I called... I called one of the guys that I learned everything from in Minneapolis, my buddy Chad, who did a lot of my early parties with me and taught me a lot that I know about sound. And I kind of brought up to him where I was happy with things and where I wasn't and what was I missing and what was his opinion on certain speaker boxes. And I sent him the specs of the system we used versus what we used last year. Asked him what he used at these parties that I remember being the legendary ones that I experienced as a dancer. And I think we fine-tuned a little bit of what I need to do different next year. And actually, if I can pull it off next year, I'm going to fly him out and have him actually organize, set up, and design the system with me because he's the one that I learned from. And so if my idea is real and not just a fantasy, he can make it happen. So maybe that might be the missing element for me is to bring somebody in that was there for the fantasy that I experienced and was there for that part. And that might be the last key that was missing at the last couple years, you know, that maybe I now understand that I need that. In terms of your own parties, you putting on parties. Sure. The chase continues, kind of. It always does. So I've owned like three sound systems since the 90s. And the one I own right now is the biggest one I've ever owned. And I just kept buying more and more boxes. So right now I've got pushing probably 100 speaker boxes in Minneapolis. And I mean, I haven't even been able to set them all up in one show yet. And I'm waiting for the opportunity to do it. So to do the experiment, you need all these elements to work. with it. The reality is having a venue like Masilo in Rotterdam or having some other future promoters that are looking for the right venue for me now in other cities, I think we'll be able to get it fine-tuned in the next year or two and then be able to repeat that in other places. to Will Lynch, DVS1 and everybody behind the wall of sound. Over the past couple of years we've been running a written feature on RA called the art of DJing where we have some of our favorite DJs go super deep on the craft. Now on the surface some people might think that there's not too much to talk about here. A DJ just selects some music and then mixes it in front of an audience right? But, of course, the exact opposite is true. There are an infinite number of variables to be considered when it comes to DJing, and it was with this in mind that we asked Daniel Avery to break down how he approached making a mix for the world-famous DJ Kicks series. So something of adventure to get down to your studio. You want to tell us a bit about the space and how long you've been down here? Yeah, so it's an old shipping container that was used in the Olympics as a dressing room, I think. All of these around it, this whole place is built on shipping containers. It's in East London, right next to the water, on a wharf, kind of stuck in the middle of nowhere. But you can see the views are kind of crazy. You can see London from here, but it feels kind of a bit disconnected from London. But I like that. It's very quiet and peaceful, and it's a good escape down here. I really enjoy it down here. It's an impossibly cliche question, but do you find the cityscapes and the surroundings inspiring? Does it directly feed into your music, would you say? I like the idea that I am in London. It's a nice reminder to see that. But I also like being able to turn around and kind of walk away from it very easily down here. So yeah, it does have an influence for sure. We're obviously talking about the DJ Kicks mix which is coming out next month. Do you recall what your first thought was when you received that email or that phone call? Well, when K7 approached me, we talked about doing a mix we've been talking about a little while and then several things happened where They said actually you could do it sooner than we talked about but they said you need to, can you do it in just over four weeks from start to finish and that included licensing. And I've been playing a lot recently so I kind of felt quite match fit as a DJ. I knew that I also had something in mind for the mix. It has to represent where I am right now as a DJ and where I've been for the past two or three years since Drone Logic came out. The general idea being that I wanted it to be a techno mix or at least have the mask of a techno mix but to have some kind of depth to it. Almost the illusion of a mix that's just thrown together but one that... had something more to it behind it really. So four weeks is pretty tight. I'm wondering how did you begin the process? The first thing I did was I spent a week here in the studio just with all my records and just going back and forth on my DJ setup, just endlessly trying transitions and writing down stuff. Things that worked and things that didn't. I knew there were certain labels I wanted to include, that's for sure. Semantica being one, Northern Electronics being another one, and some artists like Rose and Iori from Japan. I knew those guys because those guys have been very important to what I've been playing recently and we share music between us. feels like we're sort of part of something together don't quite know what it is but so they were top of the list but that's how i began just transitions and uh some things just instantly click together and also from djing out a lot as well i know there's certain tracks that just were made for each other almost um maybe we could i can play an example actually one thing that i just new straight away. A track by Rico I've been hammering recently and a track by Artifact and let's play it like they kind of have matching keys the drums totally match as a DJ it's the kind of like dream dream combination. I could feel why that transition worked but are you able to articulate why you think that transition worked? As a DJ I'm very interested in the idea of maintaining energy throughout a set and tracks feeling like they come from the same place almost. You know you can hear changes but there's a certain energy to the air. I'm also really fascinated at both as someone who goes to clubs and as a DJ in the idea of music working in a hypnotic way when you're in the heart of a club and feeling like the music could just go on forever You can hear the changes coming and going, but the music just has this propulsive line through every track that's played. And that's something that I really wanted to try and capture with this mix, for sure. So it's the idea that as an audience member, you don't even necessarily know where one track begins and the other ends. I think that's a part of it, yeah. I mean, I don't want it to, you know... Tracks have their own identity, for sure. But the general, overall feel of the mix is something that just flows throughout, for sure. So let's back up slightly. You said that you were demoing a bunch of the mixes. Was this something you were doing on the CDJs? Yeah, so I've got a CDJ set up here. And this is what I do every week anyway. I come in here, I like to come in here at least once or twice a week and just do that, just back and forth, back and forth, trying what tracks work together, what... and definitely what tracks don't go together. I've got notebooks full of things that work and things that don't and tracks that work well towards the end of a set to pick up the energy or something in the middle that would give you that sort of hypnotic quality or something that would begin a set. Yeah, I've got reams of paper and notebooks. Just full of this stuff. So you would tend to replicate those mixes in the club context? Yeah, absolutely. Then when I come to putting stuff on my USB keys, it's full of different folders. This works at this time, this acid section would work nicely after this slightly deeper section. That's how it's all constructed in my folders. So how do we go from kind of messing around and experimenting on the CDJs to getting into Ableton? Well, it generally just goes, I group stuff together in almost families or sections. So we've got like a, there'll be like a 15 minute section that I know works. And then, so that's how I begin by getting right. So how do I get from this section to this section? That's the next stage. How in your mind were you defining these sections? Well, I knew, I guess to take one step back, I knew that I wanted the mix to begin and end on an ambient feel. The 'Inatenum Veil' track, I got sent that week. I knew I was gonna do the mix and it was perfect. And I'm someone who I hugely respect so it's perfect way to begin the mix. From there I spent a day in here making the track 'Space Echo' to fit. I wanted it to sound very similar to the 'Inatenum Veil' in terms of sonic quality. and it's also in the same key again. So the idea being that the moment you go to sleep at the beginning of the mix and when you wake up from this kind of odd dream at the end of the mix, I want it to feel very similar. If the mix looped around, you couldn't quite tell the difference between those two tracks. even though they have their distinct features they are very much part of the same group and that's how I do it with a lot of the tracks a lot of the groups all have these little their own characteristics there's a deeper section there's a slightly more abrasive section That's how I began, by putting it on the computer. The next part in that process presumably kind of takes on a jigsaw quality. Were you kind of testing different sections next to one another and was the art kind of established out of that process? Yeah, that's exactly what happens next. there's two big things that happen next in this. One is that the beauty of using something like Ableton, another thing I write in my notebooks when I'm doing mixes is like what tracks loop properly over each other or under each other. So I had a good idea of kind of some of the things I wanted to try. But then Ableton allows you to do that extremely quickly as well, just the idea of looping stuff. I knew with this mixer, I wanted to approach it kind of like a producer and how I make my music and that. My music. is quite densely layered and I want to do the same with this mix even if it doesn't seem like it even if it's not something you can kind of pick up on immediately with your ears it's something that you can just feel in your chest I think it's a good point to show another example of that So you're going from what track into what track for this mix? So this is the track Vertigo by Shlomo This comes quite early in the mix, right? And then this is going into the Trek dungeon by Planetary Assault Systems. The bells that have come in there from the planetary assault systems track. and they last, they kind of continue for about 10 minutes I think of the whole track. They're just there, just love that loop, very hypnotic loop. They could just go over and over. But as that track is coming in, this, the track before it, the Vertigo track, I really like that breath, human breath. And that continues. You can't really hear it, but it's there. It continues for another two or three minutes under everything. So, that idea of tracks being there for a long time. was something I like to do as a DJ when I play in clubs. But I really like the idea of patience in a club, both from the DJ and from the people there. If you're all locked into the same waveform almost, for me they are the best moments where everyone's on that same page and no one's... like got their fists in the air saying when's the next track coming in it's the opposite everyone's got their eyes closed and they're locked into you so that's why I was keen to have like this those bells for instance happened for like 10 minutes of the track And there's an artifact track right in the middle that kind of takes a while to unfold, but it's there for, I think, nearly 11 minutes or 12 minutes, which kind of in the DJ handbook is probably one of the rules. They say don't do, in the middle of a set, don't do a long, repetitive track. But it was very important to me to have that idea of you can come on this trip with us if you want. It's going to be an amazing trip, but you have to go with us at our pace. This is the way it's going and you can come with us, but this is how it is. Would you say that this is a newer technique or approach for you? I think... People who know you from maybe from Drone Logic or you're DJing a few years ago might be surprised even to hear you talking about locking into the groove, like 10 minutes tracks, music with hypnotic elements. Is this a newer technique or a new approach, would you say? I think it's always been there inside me. I've always liked it as someone who just goes out to it. nightclub that idea actually when I made when I first started making this kicks I put my fabric CD on which is from four and over four years ago four and a half years ago I can hear the differences there but at the same time there are definitely moments where particularly with looping vocals that last a long time and go over whole tracks. I think I've just taken ideas that already existed and just pushed them much harder now. I don't feel that... I definitely feel like I've moved on somewhat, but I don't feel like I've jumped ship. I think this is just an extension of what I already had inside me. So it's... long been established that Ableton is the go-to tool for putting together commercial mixes. I realise some DJs maybe still do it live on turntables or CDJs, but it's established in everybody's minds that Ableton is the programme. Could we actually just back up and have you tell us why this is the case? Why is Ableton so good for projects of this nature? Well, for me, I've got plenty of recordings of me playing live off a mixer and CDJs. It's well documented. With Ableton, the way I see it is that you can push... ideas harder, these ideas of loops that go on forever and being able to layer. Throughout this entire mix it's basically three tracks playing at once nearly the entire time even if you can't even if it's just like a tiny hat from from one of the tracks. is all quite densely woven together and that's what Ableton is so perfect for. Another big reason is that you can treat a mix like you would a track as a producer. I always say to myself that the mix itself as a whole is king. The mix is king. There were tracks in this mix that I was desperate to get on. A track by Blauan and there's one by Peter Van Heusen and I was convinced that they were going to go on it. They fit exactly just what I was. going for um and i even said to the the label like you know when you're you make sure put these I need them first. I need to make sure I've got them first. But both of them, as great as they both are, and I've been playing them a lot, when it came to the mix itself, they were kind of jolting me out of that slightly dreamlike state when I listened to it. The transitions weren't working as well as I wanted. And it's very similar to when I'm making a track or... in the studio you can have an element that is great and there's not technically it's nothing wrong with it but it just doesn't quite fit into a mix and it's such a liberating it's a difficult decision to make to kind of stand up to your initial instinct but if you just press that delete button your whole the whole track becomes free again And I think it's very similar what you can do with Ableton in a DJ mix. If something just isn't working, you just have to throw it out. And the mix just has a new, just breathes a sigh of relief almost. And that's something that... is very interesting to do with Ableton. So thinking about the development of the process, when did it become clear to you that you were approaching something like the finished product? This mix is probably version... 50 odd from different versions of it just what I always do is bounce a mix down and then walk somewhere I've walked miles around London to this mix and you can hear how a flow is working or not working I don't really have a specific answer to your question. Other than that, it just feels like it's there when you've got it. It's no more scientific than that, other than it just feels right. Tell us about the exclusives on the mix. It's obviously a big part of the project that K7 asked the DJs to write exclusive music. Is that something you did at the beginning of the process? did you stop the tracks in afterwards how did that work there's three exclusive things on the mix and they came at different points the space echo ambient one happened right at the beginning because i knew how i wanted to end the mix um a mechanical sky which is the club track of mine on it um that came right towards the end i knew that at that point I wanted to pick up the pace a little bit, have something that was quite, had a sort of sense of urgency to it. So I went in with exactly that in mind and that's what came out with that track. It has urgency to it but it also has these quite lush pads in it to kind of... Throughout the track, throughout the whole mix, it can get a little bit abrasive at times, but never aggressive. Aggressive is not a word I want to throw out immediately. I don't want anything to wake you up from that dream, almost. Then the third one is rote, which is my project. with volt fast um that is something i'll play you this actually that's something we've been sort of messing about with for a few months this vocal loop and we could never make it uh work into a track but it was perfect as we just decided how about just use it as a dj tool something we're both very much into and it worked perfectly in this mix so that comes right in the middle. Me personally I'm very much into the idea of quite cold female vocals that appear in a lot of tracks I've made in the past. That sort of post-punk-y, new wavy thing. So it was a perfect fit for this mix. I'll play a bit of the actual track that came out of it. um You've talked a lot about how the club and kind of sensations in the club inform the mix, but obviously this is a piece that's going to be listened to away from the club. Where do you imagine people... most keenly enjoying the mix? What's the zone or the headspace or the situation you think would be ideal for it? I think it works because it's got so many layers to it. I think headphones is a great thing. I also think a drive works. I've actually been on drives with it. Or train journey does seem to lend itself to that idea of propulsive movement. That's what I was aiming for with the mix anyway. You've joined quite an esteemed club in recording DJ kicks. They've had some of the very biggest DJs in the world over the years. I was wondering, do you have any favourites from the series? I've always collected DJ mixes from... From all over. And DJ Kicks being a big part of that collection. So yeah, the James Holden one in my past was a big deal to me. The Fortet one, a very early one. And then even recently, I thought Nina Kravitz's was very impressive and showed a different side to her. I thought the actress one was really interesting. So yeah, I feel proud to be part of this club now. so you
