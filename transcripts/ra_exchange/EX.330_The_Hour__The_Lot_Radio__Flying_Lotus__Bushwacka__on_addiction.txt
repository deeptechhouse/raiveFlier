You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. The Hour is RA's monthly blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. On today's show, we spend time with Flying Lotus at the UK premiere of Royal, his debut film, and also hear from the Salad Fingers creator David Firth, who's become something of a filmmaking mentor to Fly Low. Matthew Benjamin, who you might know as Bushwhacker or Just B, tells us about his darkest days in the grips of drug addiction and his slow road to recovery. And Patrick Fallon finds out how a grimy corner of Brooklyn was... transformed into an exciting hub for New York radio and the local music community. But first, each month we ask five people from across the dance music industry the same topical question. This month, in light of the chaotic political situation that so many of us find ourselves in, we asked, how is club music political. First up is Forrest Usyk from Surefire Agency and Trip Metal Festival. One of the most exciting aspects of club music is its ability to live in the underground outside of so-called normal society where people can hopefully regulate themselves so that someone else doesn't have to step in. cops or whatever. People can consume what they want, they can participate for however long they want. The experience is considerably more broad than a lot of other underground experiences. And without doing anything completely stupid to yourself or dangerous to another human being, you can have all the freedom in the world. Electronic music typically comes at a higher price so you have an economy that lends itself to higher production values in underground spaces and in all these ways there's not really anything like it in any other genre or medium for people in the same age group especially now that we live in a time where you can't help but find out about all the terrible things going on in the world more quickly and in more detail you can ask yourself as a promoter do i want to provide escapism or can I also provide something else? And for me, escapism stopped being enough. And this is where that strange economy of electronic music can come into play. Because if you can cut into profit and redistribute that money to a cause, where will you put that money that makes the most sense to your community and in turn lengthen the longevity of your work. Here's Dr. Luis Manuel Garcia, RA contributor and lecturer at Birmingham University. There are lots of ways that music can be political, including electronic music, despite the fact that it often has no lyrics or uses sound samples, especially verbal sound samples that have been processed in various ways to make. words unintelligible or barely intelligible. But despite all of that, I think at a very general level, music tends to reflect, either to reflect reality in a realist way for some artists or to reflect a reality that an artist, you know, like a possible future that's desired or for that matter, a possible future that is feared. At the same time, music is also something that speaks to not just life experiences, but to... relationships to belonging in various forms, social belonging as well as closer familial belonging. It points as well to cultural identities and sub-cultural identities and our families of choice versus families that we might be attached to by blood and so on. And through all of these ways that music can express attachments. of various sorts that's already political again. Even if it's not the kind of politics that gets listed as such, as far as party politics and electoral politics, you know, all those dynamics of our lives have real important political connotations or consequences. Katarzyna from Annex Agency. Even if you look at the whole lineage of club music or underground club music and where it comes from and what social circumstance those musics were kind of created, that lineage is very political. If you think about Detroit Techno and underground resistance, Juan Atkins, and the kind of articulation that it gave to the ideas of a different future, of a transformed society. You see that tradition carried over into very kind of fresh sounding music cultures of today. If you think about labels like Non or Nafi or younger music cultures that are focused on inclusivity in the club spaces but also on the stage, that tradition is clearly carried over. Through sampling vocals, through sampling voice, through sampling political speeches, you can use sound as a weapon. It's very interesting to look at the dance floor and think about whether you can fully create a dance floor that would be representative of society at large. And whether or not that's possible is a completely different question. It's a completely different point. But that that should be attempted is a really important thing. I think if we look at how grime parties in London are being continually shut down by the establishment, if you look at the social circumstance of techno parties in somewhere like London, then you have to ask yourself the question how far that situation, that social situation is removed from the situation that created that music in the first place and how the ideas that allowed for that music to be created and exist, how they're kind of not being honoured in a sense. If you see a club that the dancer is predominantly middle class, predominantly white, predominantly male, then there's some element of understanding of that music culture is missing. Here's Susie B, co-founder of Free Rotation Festival. For me, dance music's political in the way it brings people together from different backgrounds. It creates an environment where people feel connected despite their differences. The music and the culture can really help us believe in a more equal and more compassionate society and to feel a sense of community, often with people we've never even met before. There's something so special about that feeling of collective consciousness when everyone on the dance floor really connects through the music. It's really powerful and it's something that's always been a huge part of the dance music scene. It's what got me into dance music in the first place. I remember noticing how people would dance with everyone around them and that often the DJ is at the same level as the crowd, so we're all sharing the experience together. It's more important now than ever because now the human race and our environment are at a crisis point. I think dance music has an important role to play. in helping people to imagine a fair and empathic society and to become a connected human family. And finally, Will Lynch, RA's associate. editor. One way that club music is political is it has a way of harnessing a political moment. In fact, some of the most famous rave scenes over the decades have had a really strong political dimension. Something like Berlin in the early 90s is not just famous because of how good the music and the parties were, it's famous because in that time techno music embodied this political moment of the wall coming down and the country being reunited. Dimitri Hegemon, the founder of Trezor, had this line that without Gorbachev, there'd be no techno, which kind of shows the link between the two, I guess. This is the hour from Resident Advisor. I'm standing on the corner of Nassau and Banker Street in Brooklyn at the north end of Williamsburg, just before it becomes Greenpoint. There's a lovely view of the Manhattan skyline down past the East River and an old brick church across the street. Had I been standing here just a year ago, I'd also see a fenced-in lot filled with an abandoned RV trailer and other piles of random junk. It was an eyesore in this otherwise scenic corner of North Brooklyn. But since February of this year, this small triangle-shaped space has become something more like a public park, where locals come for coffee and tourists take in the view and listen to the eclectic music coming from a black customized shipping container. This is all because of a grassroots project spearheaded by a small crew of Brooklyn music lovers, an online radio station called The Lot. Hello, everybody. You're listening to The Lot Radio. We are here with another episode of Cherry on Top. I'm your host, Chris Cherry. So I'm Francois. I'm the founder and do a little bit of everything towards the radio and the coffee shop also. And I'm Pauline. I'm the station manager. Same. A little bit of everything. Trying to keep Francois sane and keep the schedule tight. My name is Lloyd and I do a bunch of the programming as well as show. Let's start from the beginning. Francois, tell me about just the epiphany of starting the lot. What was going on in your life at that time? So yeah, I was a freelance photographer and videographer and it was kind of dull more and more. I was more and more panicking about the future here in New York. And that's when I saw that little triangle was available for lease, that little triangle in Williamsburg Greenpoint. And I took it as a sign and I took it as an occasion to do something closer to what I love, music. And I think it was brewing in my head. It must have been brewing in my head somewhere because it really came. directly, I thought online radio would make a lot of sense in that little triangle. And as soon as I got the idea, it was absolutely sure I was doing it. I was doing that. And that's exactly when I went first to Lloyd to make sure that I was not crazy and that there was actually room and kind of need somewhere in the community for that. And I think he agreed. Yeah, I agreed. We had talked about setting it up for a while, and I think you and I went silent for a while, and then it was just here. Because the thing is that when I started, when I fighted for the lease of that little place, etc., I thought it would take like maybe a month or two months to set it up. It literally took more than nine to get all the approval, and that's what... alone job where I was alone in my office getting crazy and depressed and super annoyed and from time to time I would tell Lloyd no no it's still happening I'm doing this I'm doing this but then it took way way more time almost a year and then closer when I realized everything was getting in place I got back to Lloyd I was like okay be ready it's gonna happen It's going to happen. And then we opened in mid-February. When did you get the lease, though? Do you remember? Yeah, way before, sadly. Like June or July, right? I don't remember the exact. they did start because I negotiated with the landlord so much. Just for the lease, it took more than three months to agree on something. And then it was departments of building, departments of health. Every department of New York City knows about that crazy project now. Thanks for tuning in, everybody. It's Christine René. You're listening to The Lot Radio. And it is Friday. What was it that you felt was missing from maybe the New York music scene or Brooklyn specifically that the lot had to fill? Personally, you know, I've met so many different people that I wouldn't otherwise because of this place. I think the community was missing, just like a very strong community. The music scene is incredible in New York. It's kind of everybody in its corner, in its club, in its circuits. There are a lot of different circuits. And to create a... A place where during the day, actually, because it's mainly a day activity. So we're taking all the people from the night and giving them a day place to hang out, to come and share outside of the clubs, the concert venues, etc. I think that was important also. And then to have a real location. So it was a foundation of your idea in order to have like a physical brick and mortar area where people could... congregate. I think that was the most important part of the radio station. I would have never done it if it was not that triangle. When I was getting crazy during the nine months, all of my friends were like, just rent another place and rent a studio in Bushwick or something. But they didn't, it didn't make sense for me. I think the radio is as strong as it is because of the location, because we have a brick and mortar place where people can come and hang out, people being DJs, friends Because we get all our support from people of the neighborhood coming for a coffee. That's how the radio lives. It's through little coffees that we serve to everybody during the whole day. So I think that's super, super important. The radio would have not existed. And there have been some big names that have come through. A guy called Gerald, for instance, I know. Is it something that they seem surprised to see? Have you talked to any of them about their reaction to what the lot is? Main acts and people we highly respect when they come in, I think they're the ones who are the most surprised. think they are impressed by the setup and just the form already like the studio is well done I think we put a lot of work into that the view is mind-blowing and we try to to keep a high standard in that and also I think I really hope it's that it's that because the most important part for me is that the project is 100% independent We are self-funded. We fund ourselves through the little coffee shop that we have. We worked a lot on this. It's a lot of work, but it gives us a strength and a base that we are free of any branding, any sponsorship or anything. And I think that for some of the main acts to come and to see a place that's totally independent, totally self-run, etc., they're kind of sensitive to it. They can feel that we all do that for the love of music. There's no question. We all do that and we don't make money out of this. And so I think there's, I hope they're sensitive to that. And also a lot of DJs who are coming, all of the DJs who are coming regularly, all the regulars, I think they're sensitive to that too. Hey, this is Fawlty DL. You're listening to HotRadio.com. A little duo by the name of Leatherette. The tune called Dog Brush off their new album, which is out next week on Ninja Tune. Got some more exclusives for you. Just keep it locked. My name is Fawlty D.O. I have a regular show on Wednesdays from 4 to 6 p.m. And I've known Francois, sort of the organizer behind The Lot Radio, for many years. And this was an idea that was floating around in his head for the last two years, maybe, a little bit longer even, I'm not sure. And he once told me while we were shopping at a supermarket together, he was like, oh, I'm starting this radio station, you've got to come through I'm not sure what that means. But like Francois gets things done. you know, not without his incredible team. You know, they've created this incredible platform and I get to come and do basically whatever I want. My show changes like every week. Sometimes it's just Blueberry Records stuff I'm putting out. Sometimes it's just demos that I've been sent that I really like. There's no, there's zero organization put into my show. What does the existence of The Lot represent for you? And what do you think it means for Brooklyn and New York music in general? Well, I feel like the timing of The Lot was incredible because there was nothing like this here. I was doing actually something on East Village Radio for a while, which I really liked, but this feels like definitely the new generation being given a platform to do radio. For me it's this great outlet to be able to put my finger on the pulse of dance music in New York City without necessarily going out every night. because I meet lots of people here at reasonable hours. So I come here and I go to the shows they do at the church across the street, basically just to hear new music. So that's sort of what it means for me. Tell me about the relationship with the church. I started when the lot was completely empty. I was just cleaning that place to make it ready. And I started to notice that the church next to us was getting more and more active. They changed the door. I would see the priest more and more. And I had a lot of issues with my internet, with my water, with everything. Every aspect of the project was hell at that time. So one day I went to knock literally at the church just to meet them and see what was up and to present my book. project I was really expecting to get like old grumpy priests really like not nice and being like the radio station with like music but actually I met we met incredible people father Nicholas and father Raphael were like incredible people and they've been helping us a lot by giving us water for the coffee shop, helping us with the internet, etc. And because for them, I think they were happy to have something in that little triangle in front of the church. Before it was a dump. So it was nothing. It was a no man's land here. It was in between streets. There's nothing. And so for them, it's fun to have some activity, to have young people hanging out all the time. And I think they were happy about that. So it's a win-win situation It grew really. I think we have a good friendship with them. And we're helping them, for example, fundraising for the organ that they're trying to renovate. It's actually ongoing. It's almost done. We did a series of concerts to raise funds, and it works super well. And we're going to continue after the organ is there. We're definitely continuing. We really want to do more events in that church. I still think Friar Nick needs a show. Yeah, that's the future of the radio. Friar Nick's talk show. I am here with... Friar Nicholas Spano. Father Raphael Zvolenkevich. When you found out that it was going to be a music radio station, did you have any sort of reservations? Not at all. It was wonderful to know that somebody wanted to take an interest in this lot. Because prior to it... It was unkept in all areas of that word. And so with Francois coming, it's improved it. And truly what he's doing as far as the radio station and the coffee kiosk. it doesn't affect what the church is doing. If anything, it really kind of enhances it because it just brings the community together. And that's what we're trying to do. So you've seen a positive effect in this community in general? Father Raphael put it very politely in saying it was unkept. It was a public eyesore. I mean, there were broken down cars, there was garbage. It was horrible. So the positive effect has been... astronomical. The radio really came into existence to allow musicians, composers, artists on the fringe of the music scene a place to showcase their creations. You know, the mission on our end came into existence as a way to reach out to the same people on the fringe of the church circle to give them a place to also worship and to pray. So the two missions, I think, go together exceptionally well. What comments, if any, have you received? congregation about what they've seen going on here? Well, for the most part, it's been very positive. You know, change is difficult, I think, for a lot of people. The gentrification of Greenpoint and Williamsburg is something that's impacting our congregation and other congregations in the neighborhood because the demographic is changing. People that once were here Now we're no longer able to stay here because of rising rent, rising most part. Our congregation is very supportive. Probably 95% of them are supportive of what we're doing to try to reach out to the neighborhood. Have you seen any of your congregation at any of these concerts that you've hosted? There's been a few. We even had a group of sisters that came from one of the local parishes. Really? It was techno music, a little ambient music, and so I don't know how much they really got into it, but again, it just showed their support for what we're doing here. As much as a DIY spirit and dedication to artistic freedom is at the core of the lot, community seems equally, if not more, foundational. So it only made sense that we hear from some of the station's regular DJs and let them share what they love about the lot. My name's Christine Rene, and I love the objective that Francois has put forth, his focus of having this platform that is freeform and accepting of what everybody wants to do. encourages me to just be here and and yeah I love I love having people come by and I love just showing up and having a coffee with my kids or yeah I come by all the time. My name is Ben Steidel I run a record store called Co-op 87. For me the lot is great like on a personal level it's really nice just to be able to DJ for two hours anywhere, you know, where there might be people listening. It's fun for me. It's something that I really enjoy and I get, I like the feedback. You know, there's the chat room and people are asking you what the track is and stuff like that. And it's really nice to be able to do that. It's actually like a really beautiful community thing that doesn't have a sinister agenda and it doesn't seem like it's at. severe risk of just all getting shut down immediately. I'm Lindsay. I'm a DJ. I live in New York. So I've been doing my show since March. It's been really awesome. It's a great place for all those DJs who aren't big enough to do different radio, like bigger radio shows. And I think that perspective is important because there's less pressure. It's just you know, people playing stuff that they really like. So if you're into discovering new music, or if there's someone that you really like that's not huge, then you can tune into their show and kind of get their perspective. So this is kind of like soul cleansing to be able to come and play exactly what I like. And I think... what a lot of these other DJs like about it. My name is Barbie Bertish. Together with Paul Raphael, we run Love Injection fanzine. It's given so many diverse music. lovers a home. Not just talking about the DJs, but people that live in the neighborhood, that bring their kids, the church across the street. It's really great place for people to gather. And, you know, it's grown organically and, you know, even Javaspeeders in supporting it. I think it's a place where just creativity brews and the community gets the support it deserves. To have something like this in the neighborhood is just priceless. What I love about it is that it's now the point of unity between scenes in Brooklyn that would otherwise be segregated. And I really believe that it's an accurate picture of what's happening here right now. Thanks to everyone who spoke to us over in New York and remember to tune into the lot radio at the lot radio dot com. On November 16th, Flying Lotus flew from L.A. to London for the premiere of Royal, his debut as a filmmaker. Fly low is, of course, known as the. artists behind a string of visionary albums for Warp Records, but it's been a long-term dream of his to make serious moves in the film world, something he's been intensely focused on in the recent past. His friend David Firth, who you'll probably know as the creator of the unsettling internet animation series, Salad Fingers, has been teaching Fly Low the Ropes, and as part of the evening's program, Firth presented... two new films called Cream and Umbilical World. The event also served as the launch of Brain Feeder Films, and if the collection of work shown this evening are anything to go by, the studio should be turning out some of the most challenging and deeply disturbing films you're likely to come across. I met them at Regent Street Cinema on the evening of the event. So, yeah, welcome to the show. Hey, what up, dog? Yeah, you're the richest baby. Oh, what up, homie? This is the, I guess, the UK launch of Brainfeeder Films. I just wanted to say if you guys are... Easily offended by grotesque moving images. Get the fuck out, man. It's not that bad. We'll see. Alright, we'll see you guys after that shit. Okay. So maybe we could just begin by you talking us through the program for this evening. Oh, yeah. First up, we have David Firth's Cream, a short film, followed by Royal, a short film by yours truly. Then we have Umbilical World, a feature-length collection. by me that's David he debuted royal at the Sundance next festival of all in August that was right yeah how was that experience for you it was it was so fun I had a great time actually it was it was you know so much time and work and energy and money and everything gone into making that thing so it was nice to let it out you know and just to unleash it on people and to have them react the way they did it was all it was all worth it after that you know it just felt it felt really good it was yeah needed that how was that reaction they're pretty vocal They're pretty loud, shouty and laughy. Exactly what I was hoping for. So, yeah, I'm grateful for that. I think for me, one of perhaps the most illuminating things from the outside, looking at the screening, was the fact that you gave out bath bags. Well, there was some information conveyed on bath bags. Maybe that was a play. full gesture on your behalf but it would point to uh kind of an extreme content matter let's say yeah exactly that that just gets you ready you know i need to get people ready for this actually because it's not you know it's there are some things in the program tonight that might offend people Don't disturb people. So I think, you know, you see a barf bag, you know, okay. All right. What's the synopsis? The synopsis is, uh, it's a very crazy-ass movie. No, I don't... I know, I don't want to say too much. You know, it's weird. Maybe Dave will tell you what it is. Yeah, I don't want to spoil it either, but it's like a love story, really. It's just a love story with a sort of crazy twist. Very mischievous love story. So you've put out the fact that you have these characters, Missy and Kenneth. Mm-hmm. kind of leading the tale. Maybe tell us a bit about them as characters and kind of the development process and kind of dreaming them up. Yeah, what happened was I was in New York and I just had this weird image of this cheerleader girl, very pretty overachiever type girl who's having sex with her brother. And I was just wondering what they were doing tonight. I just started thinking about, like, what are they up to right now? What are they doing? I just started writing. And then, like, on my, yeah, I was in New York, and I was headed home to L.A., and I just wrote the whole bit on my journey home. And I was like, oh, that's what they're up to. That's what they're up to. You'd also mentioned there was a gif. Yeah. It was you and Tom York. Do you want to tell us about that? Yeah, so I was on Twitter and I saw this gif going around of me and Tom York DJing. and it was really hilarious. I was driving and I pulled over and watched this thing and it kept going and going and going and I was like, this is fucking hilarious. And then I thought to myself, I was like, man, this was made very easily. No one had to do anything too crazy to make this animation work. There's just like a couple zooms or whatever, like close-ups. I was like, man, I can do this. could do that and um so i just started started fiddling around with some stuff and then you know some ideas started to form and you know it became concrete and then i just started calling david every day you know the this the story takes place you know i'd say months after a giant earth Southern California. And it's kind of a story about the survived. David, what's your involvement been up until this point? Well, it started with me. I do a voice in Royal and, you know, I thought I was just going to do any old voice, but it turned out to be very specific and it was refined a few times before it got there. But I think I found the right voice eventually. We just made it a little bit more British. Some of the parts, you know, just made it sound a little bit more. like he would actually say it. Yeah, I was trying an American thing at first. It's not very comfortable for me to do that. It doesn't sound natural. It is funny though. But you guys have been working together from a technical perspective for some years now. Would that be accurate? Yeah, we started with the Ready or Not video that I did for You're Dead. Was that the album? Yeah, that's the album itself. Shit. Forgetting my shit. No, yeah, we worked on that. And then, you know, I just kept bothering this guy because I wanted to learn animation. And when I first got inspired to make Kuso, it was because of this animation idea. And I went to him and was like, please, just make me your student. Show me how to do stuff. Show me how to make cartoon. I need to learn this. How was the process of getting to grips with animation for you? I mean, maybe thinking back to your formative days of learning computer music. Were there similarities in the process? About writing? I'm interested in this learning curve for you, let's say. Yeah. Animation. Well, animation is just fucking hard, man. It's hard as shit. I just wanted to make music. It's just so much easier. It's so much easier to make music than make cartoons and make films and shit. Why is that? I mean, I can imagine, but why is it for you? It's easier because it doesn't require much help. And I have more of an instant gratification. Whereas with a film, it takes a long time for an idea to become a thing. And it takes a lot of people and a lot of talent. It becomes a huge collaboration. Whereas music I can do alone or with a couple people. Technically I feel like I can make music but I find it really difficult to describe with music like I do with film so it's almost like I feel exactly the same as you but the other way around. Let's let this go on the record that... David worked on Cream for like a year, diligently, diligently, every day, chipped away at this short film that's like, what, 10 minutes? Yeah. It's 10 minutes. It took a whole year to do on his own. And, you know, it's like, he's over here talking about making music is difficult. You know, it's like, yo, this shit is crazy. I can't wait for people to actually see this because I think even for animators. we see it, they're always inspired by it and I think that's always a crazy sign. Cream wasn't supposed to take a year. It was just supposed to be like a little project between projects. The thing is with After Effects it just offers you this this platform where you can constantly refine what you're doing more than you can with like just drawn animation so you can always just look and see I could add a shadow to this or I could change this background, make it more 3D. I could make this more... And there's so many tools in there, and you can just... It can just never end. I could spend another year making it even more human-looking, and it's just... I don't know, there's something obsessive in there, and that's why it took so long to make. Basically, it's a cream that fixes everything, and that's the overall concept. Has the... idea of a cream that fixes everything become more resonant in the past week, would you say? Yes. It's funny. A lot of the stuff that we're working on just feels way more relevant now. But it doesn't feel good. You know, it doesn't feel good at all. It's like really, really, really... discouraging time in a lot of ways. Have you thought much about how this might affect artistic communities in the coming years? Yeah, it's going to be good. The art's going to be good. He's going to make art great again, at least. Everybody got cozy off the Obama shit, so at least the art is going to be all edgy and in your face again. Say if I was to characterize some of your video work over the years, you're someone who I think people are used to the idea that you're going to push the M. envelope, let's say, draw strong reactions. Yeah. What is it that draws you to these extremes, would you say? Man, I don't know. I don't know what draws me to the extremes. I think it's just, I just want to see things that are going to make me laugh. You know, I think that that's what I want to do with films. I want to do things that are just silly and will make you... forget about the crazy world we're in. I think it's just like an escapism thing, really. But I'm also just, I'm here to push it, I guess. You know, I don't know. I just always want to have that experience for myself, at least, you know. share it. I mean, do you, I mean, I guess this is a question to both of you. Do you ever have any concerns that you're kind of in danger of being pegged as kind of shock value artists or kind of known as the unsettling guys or the gross out guys or something along those lines? Sometimes you can do something and it... It feels like there's nothing else there than shock. And then you just have to kind of review that and say, why did I do that? Is there anything else you can grab onto there? But usually if there's humour involved, I think it kind of softens it and says, you know, this is not to put you at unease. It's actually to express something that's quite interesting to you and showing that it's not too serious at the same time. If you ever do, I mean, I've done one, a couple of things that haven't had any humour to them and they've been quite shocking and it doesn't feel right afterwards. It feels like I've just said, it's almost like an angry outburst as a teenager or something. Whereas you can be a bit more mature than that and make it enjoyable and funny and at the same time it doesn't feel like it's just... you know, a finger up to the viewer. Making movies is hard as shit. You know, you have to wake up hella early and, you know, yell at people and, you know, making a movie is hard so I want to make some stuff that's going to make me laugh while we're doing it. I want to be able to have fun with the stuff. The best part of working on this thing so far has been being around these crew people who are having a blast. And they've done this stuff for years and years, but they've never done the kind of stuff that we're doing. And it makes them just explode with laughter and they're smiling. And that's the first audience right there. If they're having a good time, then the. people watching it might have a good time too so this evening is doubling is the launch for brain feeder films um what kind of led the decision to go this extra mile and you know encompass like a you know studio element to it i mean one of them is actually just having david right here he's been someone that i've always been inspired by but have like yet to see him like really you know, do what he's meant to do. I think as far as like his reach and, you know, um, I just wanted help. That was where it all started. I was like, dude, let me just help you however I can. Let's get people seeing this stuff. Let's get a TV show going. Let's figure it out. Let's get your merch together. I believe in what he's doing so much that I just want to see, as a fan of his, I want to see his work go farther. So what could the next couple of years look like for Brain Feeder films potentially? Yeah, more films and maybe a Salad Fingers TV show, some shit like that. That'd be great, right? It's good that Brain Feeder are behind everything that I want to do. It's not too shocking or it's not too dark. If anything, it's not dark enough. I think there's a lot of potential. I think that... you know, this night's going to kick off a lot of things. I have a good feeling about it. I'll see you next time. Matthew Benjamin, who's known by the aliases Bushwhacker and Just B, has been a successful DJ and producer for around 20 years. He's travelled the globe, played most of the world's best clubs, and he's produced plenty of hit records, both solo and as part of the duo Leo and Bushwhacker. But... For a significant amount of this time, Benjamin has been what could be described as a functioning drug addict. For many years, his problems formed a secretive backdrop to his professional and social life. But a year or so ago, he completely hit rock bottom and decided it was time to get help. In this very personal and honest interview, he explains how working in the famously hedonistic dance music scene provided a smokescreen for his addiction. And we hear how he ultimately confronted his issues before it was too late. Well, Matthew, thanks for coming in today. I really appreciate it. Yeah, I mean, especially as the nature of our discussion today, you know, something that doesn't often get talked about, you know, something that comes with certain social stigmas and complications. So, yeah, really appreciate you coming in. It's a pleasure to be here. So to break it down a little bit, in terms of you first, taking drugs are we talking about something standard you know the way that most young people would get into taking drugs you know you're a teenager and you start smoking pot or something along those lines Absolutely. I mean, you know, in that respect, I guess my own personal story is quite similar to a lot of people's. You know, it was trying drink out of, you know, the grandfather's sort of drinks cupboard. It was smoking a joint behind the bike sheds at school. You know, magic mushrooms on the playing fields sort of in the later years of high school. And then... I left school in the summer of 1988 and I got a job in a disco, in a disco hire shop in Kentish town. And through doing that, I was, I was meeting lots of people that were coming in and hiring equipment. And, And the Rat Pack came in every week and they were hiring lights for their warehouse parties that they were putting on. And they'd come in week in and week out and invite me and my friend who was also working there to these warehouse parties. And then, you know, one day I went to one and... Went to my first acid house party in an empty swimming pool and that was my entry into the dance music scene as it is still now with me. But that's when I got involved in the revolution, took some LSD. came home at midday the next day to a very angry mother and told her that she didn't understand and that I knew what I was going to do for the rest of my life. And, you know, that was the kind of what I thought was the good bit, you know. Yeah, yeah, sure. So presumably when you've got to do this professionally, you know, in terms of drug consumption, it was just a kind of a continuation of that almost of the early days and these things going hand in hand with the lifestyle Very much so. I mean, I remember I had my 18th birthday party at Rage at Heaven and Kevin Millins had given me the whole of the upstairs, the back room, the lounge and lots of tickets for my friends. And I'd gone back to somebody's house afterwards and someone gave me a wrap of Coke for, you know, on my birthday. and I'll never forget, you know, another DJ saying to me, you know, be careful with that stuff, you know, you want to be careful with that, and I remember doing it and thinking, you know, it hasn't really done anything much to me, you know, but no, for me, you know, it really was being part of the whole Acid House explosion and the Summer of Love. with my connection with the music, with the DJ producing, with the whole scene, with the whole loved up vibe. It was incredible. Regardless of the journey that I've gone through and the dark times that came later on in life, I don't have any regrets about being part of that, being a massive, massive, well, totally being my life for such a long time. But they say that addiction is a progressive disease and it was a very kind of gradual slope. for me i i i didn't really realize that it was kind of happening until until quite quite a long way down the line really and yeah no it wasn't till the sort of the early noughties that uh when my ex-girlfriend sort of threatened to leave me and said that like i was doing too much too much too many drugs and that i needed to sort myself out otherwise she was gonna um leave me and that's when I really realized that you know things were going pretty wrong. There was no kind of real cut-off point for me and it didn't become obvious to me that I had a massive problem. I think partly because nobody told me and I was kind of lost in the moment a lot of the time. Do you think they knew? I think that... Maybe I wasn't hearing it. Maybe I wasn't really picking up on it. Another member of my family had some problems as well and their problems were, in my head, significantly worse than mine. So that took quite a lot of the... focus away from what I was doing and you know my my substances of choice you know in the early days were more ecstasy and and theirs was more kind of crack cocaine and alcohol and it I always felt oh well I haven't got a problem you know they they've got a problem I'm okay But then as time went on, I felt like no one was seeing my problems because all the focus was over there. And basically, you know, it was me waiting for somebody else to pick up on. on the problem rather than recognising that there was one and trying to do something about it myself. And then, you know, it got masked by the success as well because I was, you know, doing a lot of gigs and travelling around to... play in pack clubs and was being looked after to a very high standard. And it was very easy for me to function as a functioning addict. You know, I could go to work wasted, you know, and people would appear to be enjoying that, the fact that I was, you know. Whether they were or they were just being polite, I will never know because it seems like a long time ago now. But it was very easy. I mean, one of the difficulties, I think, of having addiction problems in this industry is the fact that we're working in... in one of the places where people actually go to recreationally use drugs. It is progressive and as time went on, the negative impact of drugs in every area of my life was a lot more prominent. And even with the DJing, you know, when I, you know, I would regularly, you know, play every month at the end and there was... many occasions that I can remember turning up to do my gig at the club with no sleep from the night before I may well have DJed somewhere and stayed up all day and you know I'd get to the club and I wouldn't you know I'd have so massive social anxiety and paranoia I wouldn't want to be around people. I'd go and hide in the office until literally two minutes before I had to play. And then once I started playing, I could communicate through music. I could, you know, get away with being around people because I didn't have to actually talk to them, you know. And then by the time I'd finished playing, I was kind of... lost in the moment again but er The same applies to recording as well. I mean, taking drugs and the recording studio never really went hand in hand for me. It took my creative soul away, you know, over a period of time. You know, I'd end up either not wanting to go to work or just staring at the screen and having a complete blank, which was bad working on my own and really bad. working with my partner because obviously he was on a completely different wavelength and I was Trying to be the engineer, trying to be the producer, trying to be creative. But at the same time, you know, sort of trying to fake being kind of sober and just waiting for the hours to go by till the day ended so I could go home, you know. And it was a very destructive period. So this period that we're discussing, how long would you estimate you had gone on like that? It was over a period of time, on and off, because I did first go to some meetings, to some NAA meetings, to find a way to sort myself out and clean up my act. And from about 2005, 2004, 2005... I started going to meetings and I got various periods of clean time. So there would be a lot of positivity and a lot of progress again. But falling off the wagon was very difficult because I'd have a lot of guilt around it, a lot of guilt and shame. I guess each time that that did happen, it did become progressively harder to be able to sort of pull myself together and to function and to work. And, you know, things got, things were, it was a very difficult period when we were working together. When you say we, you mean? When I was working with Leo, yeah. It was a very difficult period for the times that I was, you know, back in a dark place. I feel very privileged that I had Leo as my partner because he was always very understanding when things had gone wrong and he was very supportive and gave me a lot of hope and a lot of faith in myself and in sorting things out and a huge amount of patience. with me as well so so that was really important I struggled a lot with with my problem I think because I was quite isolated and quite insular with it all towards the end of of those days and nobody really knew what I was doing so tell us about um you know when the time finally came to properly do something about it you know how did you come to that realization and what happened I mean, this is, you know, it's not an easy thing to talk about, you know, but things kind of came to a head at the beginning, sort of the spring of 2015. I ended up just at home all the time using, not sleeping, not eating, not leaving the house, not leaving my bedroom a lot of the time, not listening to music, not watching TV, not talking to anyone. anybody not even on the computer just literally wasting away and incredibly depressed feeling suicidal uh you know i can remember the times when i did kind of leave the house i can remember Going and sitting with friends for a nice lunch by the beach and trying not to kind of burst out crying because I was convinced it was the last time I was going to see them again because I was absolutely sure that I was on a path to destruction and death. You know, it was a really heavy time. My birthday came around, had a party in Ibiza at the end of July and they couldn't even wake me up to go to my own birthday lunch because I'd passed out from being awake from the days before that. And I did the party and then I went away straight after. afterwards with with um for a short holiday with my son and with some friends to sardinia and i decided as soon as i got there that i needed to take myself out the loop and get some help and go to rehab because i i felt so scared that I just wasn't sorting this out myself I wasn't going to be able to do this on my own no one was going to come to my rescue that I felt like I'd been I felt like I'd been sitting around waiting for someone to come and find me and rescue me and I kind of I smelt the coffee and realized that the only person that could sort me out is me. I took myself out of the loop and got on the plane to Thailand and went to rehab initially for four weeks but I extended to six weeks because I realized at the end of three weeks that I was only just starting to get my head clear. So I spent six weeks in Chiang Mai in a rehab center and I came back on the 22nd of September to Ibiza and straight to space to play at a party. But I can safely say I think it's the best thing I've ever done, taking myself out of the loop. I couldn't see the wood through the trees with the situation that I was in. It had been two years of madness leading up to that, particularly with cocaine and ketamine, but it had got to the point where I didn't really care what I was taking anymore. I just didn't want to feel real. I didn't want to feel my feelings. And it was dark, very, very dark. So what have the last 12 months been like for you? The last 12 months have been an amazing period, but not something that I'm complacent about because I know how easy it is to slip up. But because I took that time out last year and learned about my triggers and learned about boundaries and learned... about my core beliefs and the fact that a series of events lead me to feel very, very... root feelings about myself the world is out to get me or I'm not good enough or various things like that and time and time again when when I see things happening now I realize that that this isn't true I can challenge those I can challenge those thoughts and those beliefs and and and see that this is a temporary situation that is going to pass That's relevant to the last 12 months because there's been loads of times still now where things come up for me during the day which could quite easily make me want to go and use again. I feel quite blessed that my... It's a weird thing to say, but I feel quite blessed that my experience was so bad and that I could recognize that I was kind of just losing everything in every area of my life. You know, it affected my work. It affected... My family affected my health, affected my social skills, it affected my finances, it affected everything. Last 12 months has been great. I've been, you know, I've been physically fit. You know, I last year I went around the whole of Ibiza in a kayak, bicycle and hiking to raise money for the homeless. I've been writing lots of music again. I've been doing lots of work in the studio. I've done about 30 gigs in Ibiza this summer. Residency every Wednesday at Sankey's and my own parties at Pike's and playing at Space a few times and all sorts of other things and then touring a bit as well. How difficult has it been to change your relationship with the nightclub environment? Well, this is the thing, you see. I, in an ideal world right now, I would only like to do two gigs a month. And that's not because I don't love the music or the parties. You can't beat that feeling of playing great music to a crowd of people that are responding. That side of it's great, but I find when I'm in that environment a lot... I start to feel out of sorts and I start to get too tired. So it's affected my relationship in a way that I'd rather have less work, less income, but more of a life and more early nights, more of a healthy lifestyle. It's definitely doable, clean and sober, our lifestyle as DJs. It is. I feel that boundaries are really important for me and I say no to quite a lot of gigs because I feel that they're not necessarily going to be safe places for me to be hanging out in. So it's like you've got a good thing going, you know, you've got some momentum, you know, you've had some success in your sobriety, but I guess the idea of pushing it too much or, you know, triggering something in you is kind of the danger. There's a saying in meetings, in the AA meetings, we talk about... Something known as HALT, which is hungry, angry, lonely and tired. And there are four really common triggers. And, you know, I tend to find that if I'm tired and hungry and lonely, I get angry. And then when I've got all four of those things going on. the chances of me going out and doing something stupid are a lot higher so I prefer to not be in those environments that much anymore and it's unavoidable you know like you know with with DJs you know we're going to be in those environments but I don't do the after parties now I don't do I don't really go out that much when I'm not working you know I spent the whole season in Ibiza only really going out when I was DJing. But I have a personal rule myself which I find really helps which is that if I find myself in a place for more than 10 minutes at a bit of a loose end questioning why I'm there, I just go home. I don't just hang around anymore. Having been through what you have and obviously gained some clarity on things, do you feel like the There is a fairly big network within dance music of people who have been through similar things and now kind of doing the industry sober. You know, I do. I think it's, I know quite a few people that are. in the same decades generation as me who are successful DJs and producers and entertainers and and who have come into into sobriety quite recently and are Working the program and and it's been a life-changing experience for them and a real joy for me to see that's happening to people I think that the the hardest thing is going in the first place and I think it's because there's a massive amount of ego attached to being an entertainer and I think as an entertainer you need an ego in some ways to be you know it's part of of the mask of what you're doing as an entertainer you know but I think that some people would find it very find it very hard to admit that they've got a problem and um I think that that I think that some people find it very hard to ask for help as well, you know. So how are you feeling about the future at this moment in time? Ah, the future. I'm feeling really good about the future now. I feel like I lost some serious momentum within my own personal career due to my using and due to getting myself into a very dark place and then having to... patch up the damage and and get back on track um you know i i do feel that that affected me a lot but i i also feel that as part of my journey having time away from the whole scene and from everything and being taken into a place where I saw other possibilities about life and ways of life and interacting and, you know, group activities and all sorts of other stuff gave me a lot more perspective on... how to live because I think for a very long time I couldn't see further than the next weekend um and anything further than that just seemed like a sort of an inevitable doom and gloom because I'll be oh you know I'm getting older and I'm still taking drugs and I'm you know I'm not working as much and you know how am I going to do why am I not doing this and how am I going to do this and sure you know it was you know it was quite a scary place to be in but whereas now I feel really connected with myself and grounded I feel like I've got my feet on the floor but I've got my head up in the clouds again with my creative side and I'm really enjoying just letting letting my energy flow again now and I'm enjoying being able to talk to people properly and you know my my using affected my moods a lot um and isolated me and cut me off from a lot of people you know I feel like I've managed to sort of get myself out of a very dark place and I'd like to be of use and of help to other people you know I don't want to be this guy that's just stuck in a dark room like wasting away it's it's not what I'm here for no now is the time Thank you to Matthew Benjamin for being strong enough to share his difficult story with the world.
