Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Omunit. Jim Coles often grounds his music in established genres such as footwork, drum and bass or jungle, but he's often looking for a drum pattern or a mood or a texture that combines things to make something new. He's worked with boundary pushing labels like Metalheads, Civil Music, and Idle Hands, but these days he's pretty focused on his own label, Cosmic Bridge, which he set up to bring together artists from different musical backgrounds. Coles tends to speak openly on most topics, and on the afternoon Ryan Keeling sat down with him in his house in Bristol. This included his views on McKissimo and John Bass, and his struggles with depression. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Omunna is up next. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Okay, so you moved to Bristol a couple of years ago after 20 years of living in London. Guilty. Guilty. When we were setting up this interview, you said something along the lines of, I try not to go to London if I can help it. What made you say that? I mean, I lived there 15 years, but I'm a country mouse, really. I grew up in a little village in Berkshire. I never really felt like I could put my feet down in London. I was always kind of surfing on the edge of various waves of either just financial issues or just kind of feeling like... I just never really felt at home, if I'm honest with you. As I moved into my 30s, I think it was like, it just started getting tiring. It's quite an exhausting place to live. If you want to live as an artist and not work three jobs, it can be difficult, you know? So I had some personal issues as well that I just wanted to get out and kind of have a little break as well. So Bristol felt like the move. And how's it worked out for you so far? Really good. It's been an interesting place to come back to, especially from going abroad, gigging, kind of coming home to this very quiet environment that we're in now. We're in my house, for anyone that's listening. So you can hear a pin drop. It's just very, it's quite zen, livable in comparison yeah so creatively speaking how do you respond as an artist to this sort of enhanced state of quiet let's say yeah well I think I've been doing a lot of experimenting since I've been here you've just got access and availability to so many different things here living here it's just easy you can walk down the road and hear someone playing a load of mid-80s ebm music or go and hear some reggae some dub on a sunday you might see the young echo guys doing their kind of random selection of mad tunes or be in the bell pub and hear andy payback or john from wanted you know playing stuff out of their collection that they've been building for 20-30 years you know it's just it's quite an inspiring place to be as a creative person and that's just music you know there's other stuff here too crafts, visuals So, yeah. You know, from the outside looking in, everybody is sort of on a level, let's say. You know, it doesn't feel like there's a spirit of competition here. Yeah, no. More like, you know. That's very true. The community aspect is a real thing. Sure, sure, sure. I haven't come across competitive people in terms of nothing that isn't friendly. I think, you know, what it is is people can just, they can afford to not have to feel like they on people's shoulders. People always make this Bristol-London comparison and it's pointless because London is just chalk and cheese anyway. I don't know. It's just everything you get to mention. Yeah, it's pointless making a comparison like that but you can't come here and think you're Johnny Big Bollocks because you're just, you know, no one's interested to be honest. Yeah, sure. Have you noticed a difference in the stuff you've been writing? Well, see, so much has changed for me in the last two years. It's hard to sort of compare. I don't think it's Bristol that's done it. Sure, I guess there are so many factors that go into this. There's a lot of factors. I've been on a personal journey too that's been crazy. I've started working out. I've been seeing a therapist. I've been going into, I mean, you name it. It's just all these health changes and life changes that the music has I've been really productive but not really finished much but at the same time I've just about finished my next album you know so it's been interesting it's been it's been quite a journey the last couple of years years so before we go on probably be helpful to ground the discussion by explaining that your career can be roughly speaking split into two so you spent a significant period of time making him playing hip-hop as tutorial then around 2008 you started to use the om unit alias which um you know people listening to this will probably know you for Tell us what led to this switch. It was quite a significant one from the outside. I wondered where you were at at that point in time. I guess the two-tool thing, I got tired of people saying to me, oh, you're not that tall. You know, it's a bit weird. I just got over the name. It just felt like an old skin, you know, creatively. And you've been using the name since? Well, it's 2001, something like that. When I was doing DJ battles and kind of... Yeah, it's a funny thing. Hip-hop in the UK is always placed second fiddle to where it comes from, naturally. To me, it's American music. You can get into a state where there's a healthy sense of humour about how reappropriation twists things up and you've got to have a sense of humour about it. And a lot of the sort of British hip hop world I found, even myself included when I was young, when I was like 1920, I was trying way too hard to sort of fit in. And I think over time you either learn to sort of compromise and understand that the music you're making is always going to be a reappropriation of someone else's culture. Or you just kind of walk away from it and say, well, like for me, what I took away from it anyway. was the discipline of making music using certain techniques and from the DJ side of it as well. Being a hip-hop DJ, being a scratch DJ has given me a lot of... skills in that environment in terms of being in a club and DJing as well sure you know like a lot of people if you scratch the surface they've actually got roots in that world being a kind of DJ nerd yeah yeah yeah see you see you know what I mean like even your Paul Oakenfolds and people like that they were they were battle DJs back in the 80s you know they were Pete Tonga I think even was, you know, scratching it up, so to speak. So it's just a funny thing. It wasn't that long ago that, you know, that whole thing felt like it was more like ingrained in the DJ conversation, let's say. It was in terms of mixtapes and like people making cut up tapes. You know, on the techno side of things. Oh yeah, sure. You know, like you would hear DJ scratching, you know, it was like a showmanship. aspect of it you know we're not talking like loads and loads of time ago okay you were competing and you know in order to compete and you know do dmc and those kinds of things i'm imagining the hours that you must have spent on that was just kind of mind-blowing yeah just tell us a little bit about that and you know how did you get to that skill level Okay, I was about 19. I should explain just to get a background. I've kind of recently acknowledged I've probably had quite severe depression for most of my life. And when I was about 19, 20, it was like, it was kind of a way of focusing and doing something motivated. You know, the discipline of it was the catalyst. Once you get into that thing, it just eats you up. Like scratching, for example, you can, you know, six, seven hours sometimes just cutting with tea breaks, eating something, go back, keep cutting. Scratching online, you know, even before Skype and all that, there was, in fact, there was an online gaming thing that came free with... some game that I bought for my PC and that had like this kind of chat room side of it it was a bit like Yahoo chat or something where you could like people in a chat room basically except it was with audio and randomly there was a room there where people were like they go online and then scratch and you could like listen to other people cut you know it's so geeky but like that world sucked me in. So there was a whole bunch of people online on like forums and we, you know, we get together and eventually it spawned actually a night and a label. This is back in 2001, two, three, four sort of era. Yeah. And so, yeah. I've forgotten the question now. No, no, no. I just wanted to explain the ins and outs of how one gets to that level, let's say. It's maniacal. You have to be maniacal. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I imagine. It's an obsession. But did you have competing in mind when you were doing this? Because obviously when somebody dedicates themselves to something to such an extent, right, you're picturing something. Maybe you were picturing impressing your peers or... competing or doing something on a certain stage like did you have like a goal in mind was there an ultimate thing you were aspiring to well yeah you know what it was i used to buy the videos they're vhs tapes and i and i wanted to do that i want to be that guy on the stage which i now I think after some years and just age and experience, I recognize is what all artists have, which is this need to be heard. You know, we want to be recognized. And that often comes off the back of being misunderstood as a kid, for example. So absolutely the time was like I wanted to be. it's not like I even wanted to win. I just wanted to be on stage being like, hey, this is my moment sort of thing, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I guess it gets into matters of like identity in a way. Yeah. Yeah, true. Which is tricky. Yeah, of course. You start chasing that all the time and you almost start creating almost like a fake persona. there's kind of this persona that you have to then channel through. Yeah. You know, in terms of competing, art and competition. it's oil and water really and again the reason I walked away from that is because it's reappropriated from a culture the origins of DJ competitions were literally for street reputation in the Bronx in the late 70s and early 80s DMC as a company turned that into something else for example which you know for better or worse it's got it's own place in culture but Again, it's still a sort of weird kind of reappropriation and just became a bubble of its own, you know? So you almost arrived at a point where you felt like I can't make an authentic expression through this style of music. Well, I got frustrated with it, yeah, exactly. Because it's one of the things where you either toe the line, and I was always the guy to turn up and do something a bit weird. And not as weird as some people. I could still... make it work in a club environment but I think I realized after a couple years I was like I kind of should be up here with like a drum machine or something or why do I even need to compete why don't I just make a live show and so that's what I did after I kind of like got some pedals together guitar pedals loop station that type of thing it was like looping sounds of turntables and That was a bit more comforting in a way, I guess, or comfortable, I should say. A couple of videos on YouTube of me doing that. And that was me at like 23, 24. So thinking about this transitionary period, I was listening to the Softed Diagram. That was the last album you did as Too Tall. Yeah, that's true. There's another album that came out last year, which was stuff, but that was from before that. yeah so yeah yeah anyway yeah so off the diagram was the last one yeah yeah and sort of comparing that with the earliest dom unit stuff it felt at least to me like there was some crossover if not in the rhythms but certainly in terms of the moods you're exploring yeah wondered if you would agree with that yeah it's funny if i listen to that stuff it sounds very naive to me that's in what's in what sense i just didn't know i was doing and that's another reason why i switched from that whole thing i just didn't but at least I kind of like to think I do rather than just kind of I was doing lots of faffing around and lots of talking you wrote several albums so well yeah but it was I don't know it's a different thing I wanted to learn how to really engineer and really I always felt frustrated like I can never really get this thing out of my head to sound how it sounds in my head like now I can pretty much do that So it was a discipline really. It was about discipline. So I was releasing music but at that point in life I kind of had another tricky phase and part of that reset was like okay I'm going to start this new project. I started to get frustrated with the environment. known for yeah the kind of turntablism thing the hip-hop thing as well trying to work with rappers rappers are like the most disorganized people on the planet in terms of like it was just it got really frustrating and i was like do you know what this just feels fake like what else is in me that's just true you know that and took with me the technical stuff I learned and said okay restart okay you know yeah and what did that look like in the earliest releases like what were you trying to express I'd been going to plastic people a lot and been enjoying hearing Disco and kind of weird Balearic stuff and EBM stuff and listening to, and also being inspired by the whole LA movement of people like Flying Lotus and Rast G and labels like Plug Research and obviously the Brain Feeder Camp and the Hudmo thing, all city records over here. So people like On Ra, Hudmo, Lucky Me, that whole thing really. It really messed my head up because it was like, finally, because even from back in like 2004, 5, I was always frustrated with hip hop. I was like, you guys are still stuck in the 90s. You're just trying to copy Premiere still. It's like, there's got to be more that we can do with this. And labels like Plug Research and certain offshoots of labels like Warp were kind of doing that kind of thing. there was this big wave and I was inspired by it but I didn't want to copy those guys I wanted to kind of make this amalgamation of stuff that would work on a dance floor but was still a bit wonky and weird yeah sure so the Tootle thing yeah that last album Soft the Diagram starts to touch on that and then the earliest Omnium things like The Corridor the thing I did in Old City the Light Grids Lavender release was again touching on that yeah it was about exploring the connections between all these things yeah I mean I can see how from your perspective if you've sort of seen so many of your peers as you were mentioning looking across the Atlantic and back in time how you've got this new homegrown weird distinctive thing that's coming through I can see why that was appealing yeah well it definitely spoke to me because I think I think a lot of people were the same as me. We were just frustrated with hip-hop in general. People wanted to find out what was possible. And I think it was in music in general. It was a magic time. People like Marianne Hobbs, like her Radio 1 show, careers were getting broke every week. It was a magic time. Dubstep was just really coming up. Yeah, electronic music started to really, I would argue it's where electronic music really started to get recognised as like, okay, this is something actually to stay, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see. Yeah, I think so. All right, let's play a track of yours. So it's from 2012 called The Slow Fast Matrix. We'll explain afterwards why this one's significant to you. Thank you. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ So that was Slow Fast Matrix. So I'm saying this is connected, or this release was connected to quite a memorable club experience you had. Yeah, definitely. We used to do a night called Tempo Clash. And that was kind of a London residency. Myself, a guy called Kutmar, who was part of the origin of that LA movement. and Kid Knievel and a guy called Blue Daisy. Yeah, we had D-Bridge over to DJ, and this was just post-Autonomic. That kind of, like, finished up. Yeah, he was just playing all this mad stuff that I hadn't really... I'd heard bits and pieces, I'd heard Amit tunes, and I'd heard the Autonomic thing, obviously. But this was something different. It was stuff for the club, but it still had this kind of etheric vibe behind it kind of thing. And I'd already kind of messed with the footwork thing and stuff, connecting that with Jungle and my roots in Jungle. But yeah, D-Bridge really... He's a master, really, to me, of electronic music. I mean, you can only look at his 24-year career from all the way back to Arms House, working with Lenny De Ice, all the way through to Free Bad Company and Exit Records, Autonomic, you name it, Future Forces. Tunes like Dead By Dawn are just like Stone Cold classics. That's 20 years ago now. so yeah anyway so yeah back then hearing music at like 170 and it was rooted in drum and bass which is something I really connect with personally but done differently was just like yeah that EP the Aeolian EP is kind of like an expression of several different directions that I wanted to go simultaneously. Yeah, sure. To get it out. Yeah, just get it. Exactly, yeah. So what is that point of difference that you just alluded to? It's called the SoFast matrix, you know, and this word crops up. continually you know when I'm reading about your music so could you explain like what that means what that term means to you it's a device I mean it's based on a boomcat review of one of my records someone from boomcat used the word slow fast and I really like that it's the idea in my head of it's like slow on the bottom fast on the top And that's kind of what Jungle always was to me. If you watch a crowd of people dance to Jungle, I feel like the ones who really get it actually dance on the downbeat on the half time. And a lot of people try really hard to kind of like... jump around at 160, 170 and it, okay, you can do that for like 20 minutes but if you want to dance for like four hours, it's more about the push and pull underneath to me. Sure. That's just a device. It's not really a genre or a kind of creative technique. Well, I suppose it is but it's just a kind of rhythmic device in a way. Yeah, I see. In terms of the actual composition of a track of this nature, what is it about the programming that gives it this feeling? Is it just about sort of an attitude where you're thinking both simultaneously at sort of 80 and 160 BPM? Yeah, exactly. And this is where footwork comes in. When you've gone from Duke into the tech stuff, the Chicago guys talk about, it's like for them, for example, and actually the same way, interestingly, hardcore went into jungle. You've gone from this 4-4-4. kind of thing, and once you get to about 150, 160, the human body, it's hard to move to that, so then you start to break it down again, and I think that slow-fast is those two things combined, it's kind of, you keep the fast stuff, but in terms of the downbeat on the kind of like, on the bottom end of it, the sub end of it, the lower frequencies, then you start to break it up. And that's what that is. Yeah. So we're talking about a release you wrote around 2011. It's still, in talking to you now, seems like an approach or a concept or something that's still really exciting to you. Yeah, definitely. It's become a norm. yeah sure actually i think at the time at the time it was they called it halftime which now means something different but then it was like halftime was just that it was you know there were people in germany people in the uk not so many people in the states but kind of yeah this kind of movement of people making what they called halftime drum bass and people like instrumental Debris, that autonomic thing, you had Darkestial Records. People like Sabre, Amit have been doing it since the early 2000s, to be honest. Yeah, just basically half-time drum and bass, cutting the beat in half, so it's almost like a hip-hop beat, really, in terms of the way it's structured. Is this something you think stems from that autonomic period? No, it was from before that. Yeah, there were people actually, quite innovative stuff before the autonomic phase, although that definitely solidified it as a thing. People like Polar, Deep Blue, who did the helicopter tune, he actually, in the late, sorry, late 90s, he did a few things that had like no snares and just kind of different rhythmic techniques. Yeah, there's odds and ends out there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. If you really dig. There's even some jungle tunes that are half-time. Actually, Deebridge made a half-time jungle track in 95, which is funny. So you did briefly touch on it there, but you began also exploring footwork, kind of rhythms, expressions, if you like, around this time you had the Philip D. Kick series. You had what on paper was a fairly simple idea. You were going to sort of... remix classic jungle big jungle tracks yeah in a really obvious ones obvious ones in a footwork vein did the idea come from just a very simple place like I just want to put these things together and see how it sounds well the story goes I was at plastic people saw Mike Paradinas do you know what I was on dubstep for him actually before that and people were talking about Duke and I was like what's Duke and Iconica was on there and was like oh it's this check it out talk to Mike Paradinis so went to Plastic People heard about this thing going on what is this heard it being played and immediately I was like fuck this is like it's kind of like Jungle to me it sounds like hardcore the 4-4 stuff was just like this is like hardcore I really got the halftime thing of it when you break it down. I don't know what they describe in Chicago as like halftime. I suppose they call it tech. It's like tech style or whatever. So tech life and everything. But I like the way it was kind of halftime. But then you'd have these weird combinations of like triplet and then straight programming. Sure. that would create this weird tension which i know like code nine he described it really nicely as this rhythmic tension between layers yeah that to me also is in a whole nother level actually that to me is actually what i would describe as a spiritual thing actually where you have these kind of like multi-layered step of things happening that kind of create I think in a way could get quite transcendental. And I'd imagine that's something in terms of the dancing side of it. I imagine it can get quite trancy for those dancers, you know? So along the lines of you... you know, as someone who's responding to the music, you're being simultaneously pushed and pulled in different directions. And there's kind of a middle zone between the two. I can sort of, yeah, picture what you're explaining. There's something, I think it does something to your consciousness. I really believe that, that tension does that, does something to your consciousness. You know, on a more grounded level, it reminded me of jungle. It reminded me of hardcore. And I was like, well, if you just cross poll And I'm sure Mike Perenius knew that because he's an old Jungle head as well. It just so happened that myself and actually Machine Drum at the same time had the same idea and we talked about it and ended up doing a thing for Planet Mew as well. But yeah, I was like, well, what if I just take these riffs off these old Jungle tunes and kind of do that in a Chicago style? And that's what the Philip D. Kick thing became. And it was the best kind of project because I had no, it wasn't contrived. I had no idea what, you know, I was just making them in my flat. My flatmate was walking in going like, this is crazy. What are you doing? He knew, and that's Lauren from Tony actually, who writes for FACT. He knew it was like. I think he was like, yeah, you're onto something, you know. I was quite amazed by the response. Yeah, for sure. People wanted to book me as Philip D. Kick. Oh, really? And immediately shut that down. I was like, no, no, no, no. This isn't the main focus, you know. Yeah, I suppose it would be a bit reductive to be known just as the jungle footwork guy. Yeah, well, and that's the thing I had to break that. Yeah a lot of people would start to jump on this non-existent bandwagon. Yeah, okay. Because you're right, again, it's cultural reappropriation. Yeah. And it's actually the worst kind because it's two things. It's trying to make something exist between two pillars, you know? Yeah, sure. And it just felt really just not legit to me. After a while, it was like, okay, this is cool, guys, but... let's keep it moving, you know. But just thinking about that sort of project on the sort of creative end of things, do you find yourself when you're generating ideas kind of thinking along the lines of, well, what if I... took this from over here and combine it with this from over there is that kind of your vibe would you say it's something I've realized that it's just who I am I'm a connector like might sound wanky but read the tipping point yeah you know big up Malcolm Gladwell I'm a connector and I like connecting people if I know someone who's onto this thing and he needs this and I know someone else, it's like, I'll just put them in touch. Actually, I get a lot out of doing that and I think musically too. I think it's weird. It's like, I'll hear something in one style of music and then try and find, like, for example, like a lot of record collectors like to find the weird stuff on the edges, you know, and I think have that sort of mindset of like... reggae or dub like where's the weird dub stuff that's got like just 808s you know where's that or like where's the post-punk disco crossover where it was a bunch of kind of like white dudes from you know scotland or whatever you know just trying to make funk but it sounds a bit weird you know that sort of thing and i think you get these interesting points that that happen where things cross-pollinate and connect and i don't know i find those sort of things more inspiring than the kind of like well-trodden paths of like academic approach Let's play Mystic. So you released this on Metalheads in 2014. We'll chat about it afterwards. Yes. So to me, this feels like it's kind of working along similar lines of technique as So Fast Matrix, but maybe the mood feels inspired by a particular period of time or a particular period of music, let's say. Tell us about what was going on when this was produced. So coming on from what we were just talking about after the footwork jungle craze. 12, 13. I mean, I was DJing a hell of a lot. I put out Threads as well. That was a whole nother thing. So I'd done the Threads album, which was a lot more personal and kind of like really where my head's at of like, you know, Threads has got different styles on it. It's just more of a bigger picture type of thing. And then 2014, I was DJing like crazy. And actually, the Metalheads project came about where... I'd just done an EP for them and I had Goldie on the phone just coming up, I want to do this album and so I was like, okay, push, push, push. And I was making a lot of this stuff on planes. So whilst traveling the States or traveling Australia or just jumping on planes from Europe to here and there. I think I made Mystic literally on a plane. And so a lot of the head stuff is kind of like, it's like an almost post-club approach to drum and bass, which is again, you know, really what the autonomic thing was to me as well. However, the Metalheads project was very much a nod to like Metalheads and like me as a kid in the 90s. which we haven't discussed yet but you know all the way through the 90s i was making jungle i started in 94 so 94 95 96 97 was all metalheads to me you know and prototype and v records and stuff but yeah so this is my like little nod nod to that and mystic is you know it's an example of kind of the more minimal aspect of that but that kind of sense of dread which the darkness which I think Metalhead's really encapsulated and prototype. Was it response to things that you were experiencing first hand at that time or was it more of kind of an imagined thing? No it was quite aesthetic actually yeah and I was spending a lot of time in clubs DJing so in a way it was kind of almost a way of pushing against that. by trying to make something arty, for want of a better word. It was more of an artist's impression of myself being on the fringe of the drum and bass scene and looking into it rather than being in it. And in a way, it was kind of an expression of an homage to Metalheads, but also... yeah just kind of like saying well this is my angle as the outsider looking in that's the way i saw it at the time i don't know how well i actually conveyed that to be honest but was this the record that you were using goldie some samples yeah goldie gave me some samples yeah i only used a few bits and pieces um But he basically let me get access to his dats. So I just took a few dats and saw what was on them. And he gave me another folder of stuff as well. sort of read um an interview from a few years ago where you were talking about the was kind of you making the statement that you felt like you couldn't compete with the drum and bass masters and nor would you want to but you did feel like you had a point of difference or you know you had something to say how would you define that you know how were you sort of uh placing yourself in the drum and bass world would you say it's hard it's been it's been a really tough journey you know cool problems but yeah to be honest like i've always wanted to stay on the fringe and be a fan and that's unfortunately I've had to snub some people sorry in what sense well not snub I mean not on purpose but people have I think would say have felt a bit snubbed but when projects have been pitched to you or no I'm talking about DJing right oh okay yeah like basically DJing I'll come back to your original point but just to put it in context you know I'll get people hitting me up to play pretty underground low-key nights just because popping up in the dnb world as a sort of fresh name yeah and then i'm turning them down and saying well i'm kind of just a fan you know i'd rather just do what i do as i'm unit outside of it really and then people i imagine will probably think oh who does he think he is you know yeah but it's true i just i just want to be a fan yeah the music i never wanted to get this actually this involved as i have been is it a case of positioning yourself in a way that you feel comfortable I mean would it be to you well I know I'm speaking as if I have no control over this situation yeah no no I'm just sort of interested like you know obviously artists need to think quite carefully about you know where they're placing themselves and you know there is something to be said yeah for managing perception yeah that's kind of what i'm getting at i haven't yeah i think we've done it quite well but you know it's quite a stereotypical thing i've always been quite reticent to be labeled because i don't like the idea of staying put you know i'm a bit of a nomad musically I'm just too curious really about what's next, what's happening, you know? Yeah. What's going on. Yeah, I suppose it's interesting because even if you're not positioning yourself or aligning yourself with something, you still need to position yourself in a place that allows you to do the things that you just described. Sure. Yeah, it's funny. It's a paradox. Yeah. But the way I see it is that there's a landscape and the landscape shifts. And sometimes I think it's healthy just to kind of like keep walking and looking around as things shift and move with a natural curiosity. Nothing, you don't want to be too contrived with it and sort of jump on bandwagons or be a culture vulture. But I think that it's healthy to kind of, yeah, you can collaborate with people and like, and just be curious about what's happening. You can be, you can be inspired by. stuff without necessarily leeching off it jumping on something yeah yeah and i think that drum and bass you know drum and bass has had what 25 years of history really so it's part of the furniture it's not going anywhere and i think it's okay to reference it and not be too caught up in it all you know especially and especially given there's 25 years of history within the scene you know it's politics there's anything that comes with just you know bunches of men and money you know so it's kind of nice to also not be too stuck into all that as well you know all right let's um play something you made recently uh so this is light body transfer which you put out on your own label cosmic bridge at the end of 2016 that's right we'll talk after this so So I find this much harder to pin down, let's say. Can't really place the rhythm within a particular style. What were you going for here? So I kind of have these weird labels in my own head for certain things. This tune is what I would call soul speak. Soul speak? Soul speak. Right. Which might sound a bit weird, but really it's where... you sit down and just kind of like transcendental for me this is a trancy one that's why i call it light body transfer like the idea in my head it sort of made itself and then i sat and listened to it and i was like oh yeah it's that so in in the process of just sort of like channeling and sitting there making this kind of like weird rhythm and making it work that all just fell out of me naturally yeah so in a way that's kind of the purest type of music that i could make i would What tempo is it at? It is actually 85, I think. 85? I think, yeah. It's about 85. It's kind of on the quarter time. So the snare is like at the start of the second bar. So it's kind of like... Yeah, okay. It's super like skagged out. You know, super like stretched out. weird but i don't know it just that's just how it came out but and i call it soul speak because it feels something very just just natural about it sort of just almost like your body speaking into sound have you written others that you put in this category yeah there's been a few that mystic one's kind of a bit on that tip yeah i see more the ambient stuff like on the on the metalheads album there's a tune called layers that's kind of like that that's um in my head creates pictures because i have i get synesthesia so i have like a spatial synesthesia where i see geometrics so certain things like that to me where they're like footwork where you have these multi-layered they kind of create in my mind these sort of i get these interspatial relationships they're not colors as such or tastes they're it's sort of shapes shapes and edges yeah so tunes like that like light body transfer in my mind anyway, I get that sort of feeling. But also, it's a bit sci-fi as well. Like I like this idea of... I mean, when you're considering this track, can you picture a shape right now? Does it bring something to mind immediately? Yeah, it's like a series of woolly edged triangles that kind of interlock and then... there's kind of like speckly things above it and stuff like that. I do get colours as well. So would you be writing with that in mind? No, you do the thing. It's actually an accident that happens. Yeah, I see. Yeah, I don't sit there and say I'm going to make circles. It's like... I'll do a thing and it's often when you listen to it back or whilst you're doing it yeah you just I don't know it's weird you sort of trance out yeah yeah did this one come together in a way that's sort of typical of your creative process Are there any patterns? No, this is definitely like, this just fell out. Okay. Yeah, this absolutely just went. This is the golden, like, this is what you were shooting. It's the tune that made itself. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Does that happen very often? Well, no. No. No, it doesn't. I think a lot of people would say the same thing. It's one of those rare ones. Sometimes, like, the bangers make themselves and they do that. I've actually got a thing I'm working on that just, it's really fresh and weird and I'm really happy with it. But it's kind of almost something you could play in a club as well. So I quite like that when it happens. What do you find most challenging about writing music? Self-doubt. Yeah, questioning stuff into oblivion. It's the hardest part, I think. Is that got easier? Not really. I think it's just always there, isn't it? You have a self-regulatory system built into us, I think, that just sort of questions, unless you're a total psycho, there's a fearfulness to anything. And I think that in creativity, the fearfulness expresses itself as self-doubt. It's also the thing that enables you to want to be heard in the inverse of that. It's like when you go into the world and perform, it's the antithesis to the self-doubt is the rush of being heard. Yeah. Which is actually a dangerous cycle to get into, too deep into. I think really the sweet spot is beyond that duality of self-doubt and being understood. It's sort of just like just doing it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see. And in that state, it takes a certain degree of release and just letting go of like... agendas and kind of this need or want yeah yeah that's when tunes like light body transfer will fall out does it help at all to have kind of a group of people around you like you've got with the label you know if you're but are you the sort of person who will you know work on a sketch or something maybe you know send it off to someone you trust or you know do you have those types of relationships or are you just like seeing something through to the end honestly yes and no okay it's a weird one because I found in the past like I'll play tunes to people and they're just like yeah it's cool and that's not super helpful yeah like even close friends will sort of understand like it's weird I mean the thing you can't ever plan for is how someone is going to hear what you've made you know I can remember being about 23 24 and super broken hearted over somebody and I wrote this this song that was really for her and I was like, I played it to her and sat with her and she listened to it and she was like, yeah, it's really chill. And that's all she had to say about it, you know, and that was an early lesson of like, yeah, it was totally crushed, you know, but it's like, that's like an early lesson of that thing where, like some people just hear the snare. They literally are not listening any further than how the shape of the drums are. Yeah. Which is why. coming back to what I said before about the discipline of engineering in order to present your thing in the clearest way possible you can almost listen just to the technical layer of it to make sure that the snares and the hi-hats are all hitting right give it the right emotional impact some people literally only hear the top crust Some people don't hear that at all. All they hear is just the feeling of it. All they get off, you know, they're not even hearing even the vocal. They're just hearing the kind of intention. Sort of the overall... The shape of it. Pattern, yeah. So you just can't plan for these things. Tell us about Cosmic Bridge. Okay, yeah, Cosmic Bridge is my label which we started back in 2011, late 2011, 2012, I think. Initially, that was myself and Chromestar. And basically, yeah, we kind of put out... like 160, 170 BPM music en masse, but then there's other bits and pieces. So it's, again, it's this sort of thing of like reflecting upon jungle footwork, drum and bass, but kind of doing it in our own way, I guess. Yeah. There's people like TMSV, Jay Kenzo. who are kind of borrowed from the dubstep world who have got interest in making other types of music. So I give them an outlet if they're interested. More Sounds, who I kind of discovered through a friend, my friend Jay Scarlett, who's out in Germany. He put me on to a couple of people, Danny Skriller and More Sounds, who I've signed and done bits with in the past. Yeah, it's now currently run by my good friend and manager Mark Shelley, Sequence, who runs it out in East London. And yeah, we just put tunes out. I basically A&R the label now. It's good. Yeah, I don't really handle the nuts and bolts. Yeah, sure. If you're thinking about the sort of qualities that the artists on the label share, would you say it's just kind of a simple case of curiosity, you know, within a sort of Blue Seed defined tempo range or something? Yeah, yeah. We're all sort of exploring. There is definitely an aesthetic. but we're all exploring within for sure. Yeah. So bearing everything we've talked about in mind, I'm curious to know how this comes together in your DJing because if I had to guess and, you know, we should say that you travel a great deal. You know, you're very, very busy and you're gigging hard and stuff playing in multiple countries. But if I had to guess, guess I'd say you get a range of responses to what you do would that be accurate yeah yeah definitely again this is a whole nother string to the bow isn't it you know to be vulnerable on stage it's easier now to be honest it's now it's what uh 2017 in the back in 2012 2011 playing halftime footwork jungle sets mixing all that together. It was a little much for some people, you know? It was a little bit like, okay, what is this? I don't get it. You know, I'd have people coming up to me doing the typical thing. Can you play something I can dance to? Or like... And then you get curious people. What is this? Who are you? Where are you from? What's going on? Then you'd get aging junglists like myself. kind of at the back of the room like blah blah blah um for a minute there it was kind of hip too so you get you get some like you know very well-dressed types coming down and being like oh yeah yeah i know this stuff you know they've been through all that that's been and gone but you're saying it's got easier well it's got easier yeah because i think people now have started to really understand this thing as being something else okay isn't necessarily you know it's it's absolutely a part of the drum and bass world for sure i think it's thanks to just sheer volume of music people get making this stuff over the last five six years You know, there are now hundreds of people doing this and kind of like around the world and doing their own little parties with it. Aren't scared to have, you know, a dubstep DJ, then a jungle DJ, and then myself on the same lineup. Has that pushed you a bit further, do you think, in what you'll try, let's say? Yeah, well, you know what it was? It's funny. I've kind of come full circle. When I first started... I was taking a lot more risks and then I kind of honed it in the more it was like, you know, there's the kind of like obligation to smash it every time. So then I definitely honed down the track list into like, you know, not just all the bangers, but kind of like stuff which I knew would flow easily, easier. I don't know. I feel like I'm part of a group of people who've established something. can afford to kind of come on you know guys we're gonna play a bit of something else for a little bit you know and take risks And I'm enjoying it more because it's actually feeding me more now after the kind of like wave of like really obvious bangers. So it's a nice time, you know, where now I can kind of command a bit more and like make more of a deeper journey, you know. Sure. Play two hours, play, start out at 130, 140 and work up, you know. Do you think there are any particular strongholds for what you're doing, either in terms of venues or countries or cities? I get a lot of love in Germany. I've been to Berlin quite a lot and also other cities in Germany. Definitely Germany, Netherlands, although the Netherlands is not so much in the last year or two. BC Canada definitely has been a highlight. Vancouver, there's a crew out there called the Lighter Crew who are very much like diggers. They know their music and they do good parties. But yeah, the whole BC area I really connect with just on a personal level as well. I think it's just a nice part of the world. The festivals out there, the kind of... there's a lot of kind of new agey types who sort of connect, I think, with some of the more esoteric stuff that I'm into anyway. Is it Base Coast? Yeah, Base Coast, man. Base Coast is like the best festival in the world. I would say without a doubt, absolutely, unequivocally. Yeah, there's, Melbourne's always a vibe. And in terms of Europe, like, I mean, certain clubs, like, I mean, it's weird. Sometimes I'm thrown back. I'll turn up to a club and it's like, there's like five, 600 people here and they know the tunes. And as far as I'm concerned, I'm just like, dude, there's a bunch of little guys on the edge of this little micro scene almost, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, well yeah yeah yeah no totally cross continents yeah it's not like yeah I don't take it for granted I'm just I don't really sort of like wake up in the morning and think about all that stuff yeah yeah essentially so it's always a blessing really I'd sort of turn up and go okay cool it works you know so how do you find touring generally it's been difficult actually and in terms of mental health it's something which I'm very glad to see there's more dialogue happening about the idea of touring artists and what it can actually do to you I've certainly experienced very strange states of being from sleep deprivation for example you know and the sort of DJ's complaining aspect of like you know you're not supposed to complain about doing this because you're living the dream but people don't actually understand that this isn't as glamorous as perhaps it you know makes out you want to get into this because it seems like you know it's part of the fame game and everything else you want that glamorous lifestyle and you can have that But it comes at a cost. And part of that can be your mental health. I think Benga's a great case study of that, where he definitely got himself into a bit of a pickle, you know, shall we say. And I think that it's something that needs to be discussed more. I think that as someone who has to look, I have to look after my mental health. I think that it's, yeah, I do think that it's something that needs to be part of the conversation. seeming as like making music digitally and just being a musician and a DJ is sort of being pushed as almost like a lifestyle choice now you know you get your DAW and you learn Ableton and then you go out and start doing shows and there's kind of this cookie cutter approach to it Part of that needs to be, you know, you need to look after your health. And yeah, I'd like to see more of that talked about. So for me, it's been really challenging, actually. My initial way to deal with it was just general dissociation. So just kind of like knuckling down and like cutting myself off emotionally and just kind of being like a robot. And now I just can't do that anymore. It's exhausting. And I'm trying not to. I need to stay with my feelings. I'm sort of learning how to do it all again in a way, you know. But it's way more rewarding feeling emotionally connected to it. However, it can be very taxing, you know. It sounds like you're describing a situation where, as you said at the outset of the interview, you've had problems with depression in the past. It's been a factor in your life. And then you're faced with the situation where you have all these different obstacles and triggers and all these kinds of things where maybe your lifestyle is... running in a direction that's like kind of countered maybe not to what you need but I can see why it would end up taking you to some pretty dark places let's say yeah sure I mean anxiety is part of it you know the nightclub itself is potentially can be quite a really toxic environment right And our culture at the moment, especially the kind of the infantilism that comes with music and culture, the worship of youth, coupled with the patriarchy aspect of it, of like young men, you know, there's a big laddishness to this whole thing. So people approach the idea, like this is why you have young men dying in clubs, because they approach taking ecstasy pills like downing pints, you know. So that's a prevalent sort of attitude in the nightclub environment. Now, for me personally, I've definitely experienced extreme anxiety from sleep deprivation and having to go into that environment where it's chaos. I've got to be on stage and I've got to be on. And then I've also got to be like, hey, to the promoter. There are different ways of dealing with it. But you know what? It's actually been very rewarding and very valuable at the same time. I'm totally not complaining. Actually, it's been, I have way more insights into the human mind as a result of being so stretched in different directions. So I'm actually, I'm very grateful actually for this journey I've been on. But yeah, as I say, coming back to my original point, I do think that it should be part of the conversation a little more. You know, it's not glamorous, guys. Ask any DJ's girlfriend out there if they've traveled with their DJ boyfriend. Tagged along, shall we say. Ask them if it's glamorous and if it's... Yeah, I suppose we're only ever considering the hour or two when this person is on stage playing and you don't see the other 10 hours surrounding that. Or 48 hours of travel. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Missed flights or, you know, late flights, blah, blah, blah. I'm not going to moan, but yeah. Yeah. There's a lot more around it that can be potentially quite destructive. And yeah, I wouldn't really swap it for anything else because my last job, apart from teaching, I used to teach was, I worked in a factory, hanging plastic feet into metal chairs. So, you know, life could be worse at the same time, you know? Okay, I wanted to finish up by talking about club music landscape generally in 2017. I've read some comments from you a few years back where you'd almost warmly describe things. being in a state of chaos, let's say. And I think that's very much the case today. Do you feel as though we've reached a point where there's pretty much no going back to the old established order of big mass music, electronic music movements, jungle, grime, garage, dubstep, etc.? Yes. And the reason is, I mean, the internet really. I would say is a large cause of that. I have this philosophy about it all where it's no longer about chronology, where you've got this kind of like, although trends still exist, it's not sort of one after the other. I think we've gone from things being much more located in linear time to being now where things are just in parallel. So everything's happening at the same time. There's way more bandwidth, literally, because of the internet. So, you know, these things can exist. They could just coexist. It's fine. And it's okay. And like, if you're a young person, it's also okay to be like, I like this, but I also like this, you know? And I think it's accelerating consciousness. I actually believe that. I think it's part of the acceleration of consciousness in terms of social consciousness as, you notice how young people seem to be way less judgmental and way less hung up about. this way or that way you know there seems to be a much more acceptance what we used to call radicalism to me is kind of becoming more of a norm you know I've seen music videos that are in the top 10 that contain literally like bisexual you know kind of gestures which I'm like that's great this is like we're kicking down barriers now that's between genres it's between you know so it is creating a kind of soup like a meta soup for some people it can be hard to kind of like understand or kind of grasp as to where are the handles in that but i don't think it's about that anymore i don't think it's actually i think it's interesting just letting things kind of like just spill over into each other and see what happens i think you know i love the idea of connection i don't feel the need for to control the chaos you know I think it should all just be and it's accelerating it's thanks to the technology you know it's thanks to basically a bunch of hippies in California who did a bunch of acid and started making computers you know so there you go that's what you get *Dramatic music* Bye. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Bye. you
