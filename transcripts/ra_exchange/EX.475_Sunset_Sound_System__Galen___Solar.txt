Thank you. Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artist, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Matthew McDermott, and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor. Sunset Sound System and its annual campout, which is situated in Northern California's Belden Town, has always been about putting bleeding-edge dance music in dramatic outdoor settings. What started out as a labor of love with Galen Abbott, Solor Langevin, and other key team members like Jay Bird pushing massive speakers into public parks has organically developed into a full-fledged community. Sunset's summer series of outdoor gatherings, boat parties, and the campout draw thousands of longtime devotees, as well as converts from afar like Dixon, who loved his first sunset experience so much that he makes an annual pilgrimage. Solar and Galen now look after their own budding DJ and production careers. San Francisco has gone from a dance music mecca to a booming tech town. And Sunset's core crowd has gotten older and maybe a little wiser. But the core concept, dance music outside amidst California's natural beauty, has not changed. I sat down with Abbott and Langevin at the RS-94109 record shop in San Francisco's Tenderloin to discuss Sunset Sound System's long, strange trip. The Spirit. The Spirit. The Spirit. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. I am here with Sunset Sound System, the founder Galen Abbott. as well as Solar Langevin. They've been working together as Sunset Sound System for 25 years, with Solar coming on shortly after inception. We are here at RS94109 in the Tenderloin in San Francisco. Thanks so much for being here, guys. Thank you for having us. Yeah, thank you. Great to be here. So Galen, it's the 25th anniversary. You've planned a lot of events starting in April and moving on through the summer. This is one of Sunset's busiest summers yet. Would you say that's the case? I would say it's, yeah, definitely the case. We're running a full schedule of events. We tend to run kind of seasonally. I think that's part of... given us some longevity and yeah starting from our season opener which is an ode to our park our free park parties that how we started all the way to the Halloween boat party in October so basically from from April to to the end of October And we're kind of in the thick of it right now, right? Oh, we're in the thick of it right now. So explain, like, what's your day-to-day like now? Day-to-day right now, since we have the 10-year anniversary of Sunset Campout next week, is basically fielding lots of text messages, phone calls, and living in spreadsheets and emails. working with our amazing team to make sure the event goes off smoothly and we have another magical year up in Belden Town. What's new about this year? What can attendees of Sunset Campout expect this year to celebrate? a 25-year anniversary? Are there any innovations that you're bringing on? Well, like everything we've done, we've always built up. We always have started modestly and organically and let it grow. Every year we learn a little bit more from the previous year. And I'd say this year, the art offerings and the interactive pieces around the festival site is definitely going to be at a level that we've never seen before. We've also invited a lot of our musical inspirations and people. We love to hear play from around the world to come play with us this year. probably more so than other years. And a lot of our family, maybe some people that took a year off or two. You know, a lot of people are coming back for this year to help celebrate our anniversaries. When you're talking about the family, are there a lot of people who have been there since day one, since like the original Marina parties? Yes, for sure. I mean, it's been a cultivated family community, I guess you could say, for a long time. And it's just the nature of how Solar and I operate from just like a really down-to-earth perspective. And it's kind of cultivated this community and family. Some people have been with us maybe consistently as long as we've been doing it. Some have. maybe dipped out for a few years, maybe had a family and have come back. And there's been new generations of people that have that have come and to see the different generations meld together and everyone have a great time cohesively is part of what makes, you know, Sunset special. I'm going to read a quote from Mike B. of Vinyl Dreams that was actually printed in a piece about San Francisco that ran in Resident Advisor. He said, think that this town was set up to be into it from the jump. Even with the 60s psychedelic rock, people were dancing to that music. They're in the park, twisting and doing weird gyrations and throwing shapes, which is why the rave was so big here. I went to the third Sunset Party at the Berkeley Marina. There were 2,000 people there on the side of the hill with the city in the background and the bridges. And, you know, it was just a raging party. Solar, do you feel like there's like a tie in between like the original psychedelic culture of the 60s and like what was happening in the 90s here in San Francisco? Well, for sure. I mean, there's such a rich history here in San Francisco with the whole kind of 60s scene and the counterculture scene that was happening. And I feel like when the kind of the raves kind of started, you know, taking off here, like the wicked guys and some people came up from England and they had kind of been shut down from the Criminal Justice Act and all that stuff. And they were coming from a psychedelic scene too. One of the main guys, Alan, who was kind of the co-founder with them, he was super into the whole psychedelic scene and the beat scene and stuff like that. So he was not only coming over here from a music perspective, but also to kind of tap into that old culture. Yeah, and then the whole... kind of like gay club scene and all that was combined to kind of fuel the whole racing, I guess. It's kind of like a Molotov cocktail. Yeah, exactly. starts to go crazy in the early 90s, basically, would you say? Yeah, I feel like there was a lot of that psychedelic, raw energy left over in the city. It still wasn't ridiculously expensive to live here. And the electronic music, house music scene that was... burgeoning at that time really took hold of that kind of wild spirit and it was exciting. fun and raw and avant-garde to just to do these renegade parties that, you know, Wicked was doing and we started doing kind of in our own way. So can you sort of describe the geography of San Francisco to, you know, people who haven't visited before? And what makes San Francisco specifically like perfect for an outdoor party? Well, I mean, it's scenically beautiful when you have, you know, you have San Francisco basically at the edge of a peninsula. And on either side, except for the ocean side, but on the bay side, you have bridges coming off of it. You have Mount Tamalpais just over the Golden Gate Bridge. And then you have the fog. So you have the cold ocean with the hot valley creating this fog that comes in and comes over the hills. And part of the inspiration of Sunset was being out in Berkeley looking. west towards the Golden Gate Bridge, towards San Francisco. And, you know, with us growing up here, growing up in Marin County, where it is, there's a lot of designated open space and just there's a lot of natural beauty in this area. And to combine dancing and this new house music, acid house music, outside and during this time, this transformative time, or leading up to this transformative time of the day. just created something totally magical. You could be, as Mike said, people would be in this Berkeley Marina spot where everyone would go to the top of the hill. The sound system area would be a little bit at the bottom and you could just look out across the entire bay. And as soon as the sun would set, everyone would start cheering and run down the hill. And at that time, we would continue into the night. And so there was something really awesome about the whole day, the day building, building, building to this sunset. And then we would keep going like an hour or two into the night. And so it was such a... It's such a cool feeling to dance through that. And it was always Sunday, so it was like the culmination of a whole weekend of people being out and about, telling about their adventures. They found this underground party, or they went to this warehouse party, or this... big rave party and they could come out to our, which was a free party, just come out and just close out the weekend with friends and, and maybe they didn't see their friends because people went to different events, but everyone ended up at sunset. And. And it was so relaxed and there was no expectation. And we were just out there wanting to just play music and be in some place and do it in some place beautiful and amazing. And that was sort of the initial motive to do it, just to play music and bring it outside. And to clarify for our listeners, were these initial parties, you initially started under the name Pacific Sound System, and were these initial parties licensed at all? So originally, it was Pacific Sound System that did the Sunset Party. And I also, at the time, had started a weekly at the Cat Club called Pacific. that was like a Wednesday night weekly. Me, I was pretty, I was very young and naive and working with club owners was something that was really new to me. And I just was kind of overwhelmed by that. And it was hard for me to integrate, you know, building up this weekly. And I eventually just dropped that and just wanted to focus on, on doing the sunset. Over the years, we were going to be the Pacific Sound System that did the Sunset Party. We even did our own version of an all-night party called Sunrise, which was also a renegade outdoor party. We had all kinds of offshoots with different friends. And over time... it started getting confusing. People would call us Sunset. People would call us Pacific, Pacific Sound. And we just made a decision like we're a sound system. We're most known for Sunset. We're a Sunset sound system. So that's kind of the evolution of the name. But you guys started with... basically showing up with a generator, a sound system that you had purchased for these parties, and were basically throwing renegade parties outside, correct? Essentially, yeah. It started out as a renegade party. The first one I did was with borrowed gear. I had the idea for the party, and I was able to get a generator from someone, borrow a sound system. I brought my whole home. you know, mixing set up as the DJ booth. And that was great for the first one. Then I wanted to do another one and people were like, well, I don't know, you know, maybe give me some money or it just got a lot more challenging to like do it again. And I just, I, you know, I wasn't very money wise then and I was really wanted to do this. So I just got some credit cards and just maxed them out and bought a sound system. And in that time had met Solar and met some other friends, Jaybird and our friend Lorian, who were part of it. And everyone kind of had this piece. Solar had a truck. And I believe Jaybird had a generator and Lorian was really into sound and sound teching. And we all kind of organically came together and fit this piece of the puzzle. And also Solar was DJing at the time too. And we had met at a house party. That was kind of an instant connection of I wanted him to come out and play. And within a few months, I'm like, we're just all in this together. Also, we had Branson, too, who was doing all of our flyer work, which was kind of very creative. Yeah, my roommate that I had met, he did these really cool little line drawings. And he just started making our flyers. just on, you know, copied paper, just very simple, but very ornate with his line art. And it became like the signature look of what we were doing. Sunset has gone on to be so influential in terms of, you know, the California dance music campout, but these initial... outdoor parties were also a product of their environment and what was going on here in San Francisco. And Solar, can you talk a little bit about the Wicked crew and their influence on you, how they sort of harnessed punk rock energy into DJing and just an attitude in general? Yeah, I mean, for me, I mean, I've said it so many times, but those guys were a huge inspiration. Like, I kind of was coming out of, like, the kind of hardcore punk scene that was happening here and starting to go out to clubs a little bit. But, yeah, clubs were just kind of, some of the music was cool, but I wasn't into a lot of it. It was just kind of more a place to hang out and do stuff. Somehow I got a flyer. Somebody told me about a full moon party and we kind of made our way down there. And just to see these guys show up, they all were like, you know, in jean jackets, long hair, and just kind of brought a sound system. I feel like it was in Golden Gate Park, but I've kind of like researched the history. I don't know if they ever did one in Golden Gate Park, but in my memory, it's in Golden Gate Park. And them showing up in a van and just kind of kicking open the doors and throwing out the sound system and just staying up real quick and just like, and then playing Acid House. And I heard that music and it just had so much of that energy of, first I was like, what the hell is this sound? I was like staring at the records thinking that they were creating the. 303 sound by moving the records in some way I was just completely oblivious and awestruck and yeah I was kind of blown away and just between like the whole attitude the DIY attitude that they had and kind of not giving a fuck and just like setting up wherever they wanted to and taking that chance And then, yeah, and then hearing that music was just kind of opened my eyes to something totally new that I'd never seen before or experienced. But yeah, it had some kind of element of that DIY kind of punk attitude in it. And yeah, I was kind of hooked from there. And Galen, you kind of came more from... like an ambient and new age background prior to beginning to DJ and get heavy into dance music? Well, yeah, I came from kind of an athletic background. I was a swimmer. I was swimming. I was training for the Olympics. And I started after high school just realizing this was not for me. And it was a friend that got me out. right before I was about to train for my second year of school down at University of Arizona in the Pac-10 and discovered these events. He took me out to an underground and my eyes were just blown wide open. I think I was, I wanted more. I was searching for more, but this had been my life. My dad listened to a lot of new age and electronic-y, new age type music. In high school, I was listening to some Acid House, and I didn't even know that I was. I was just kind of drawn to 808 State and was listening to 808 State albums in high school. And I feel like that I've looked back on what laid the foundation for me to be so drawn into electronic music. And I think even bands that had electronic elements to them, whether it had been something like, you know, Rush or Yes or Depeche Mode, I really was drawn to the electronic elements of those that they had in those bands. It happened very quickly for me. Once I discovered this scene and this music, I had left University of Arizona within a few months and was home and was out now every weekend. And within a month of that, I kind of took all that swimming drive and was just like, I want to do this. I just went full, kind of full, dove in headfirst into the whole house music, electronic music scene and just, yeah, lived it, breathed it. And at the time in San Francisco, like San Francisco is sort of a mecca for this music. there are 10 dance music record stores in the city at some point. Like you have like amazing records, like coming out on Wicked and Greyhound and, and like, there's just this insane energy in the city and Sunset goes from being an outdoor party that 50 friends are at to a thousand people relatively quickly. Is that correct? Yeah, I mean, we started out, I mean, aside from the first one that had its own energy, when we all came together, Solar, myself, and Jay Bird, and Lorian, and Bradsen, the second one, I should say, was like 10 people. And we were doing it every week. Just bring that sound system out every week. The next one would be 20. And yeah, by the end of the summer. And I remember we hit these barometers. We were like, oh my God, there's 500 people here. What is going on? And then the next week, there'd be 600 people. And it just kind of grew through word of mouth. There was no social media. We had these little tiny little, you know, hand-cut little flyers, one-sided little drawn flyers that we kind of... give out when we'd be at parties, like, oh, come, you know, come hang out with us on Sunday. And then I remember by like September of that first year, it's like a thousand people. And now the wicked guys who we drew so much information from are like, hey, we want to play. And we're like, what? Okay. So, yeah, it grew through that first year, grew quite. Quite organically, but I guess, yeah, within a year, very, very quickly. Like I said before, it just came from wanting to just play music, just wanting to play music outside with our friends, and it just blossomed. And did the Wicked Crew... which includes the likes of Garth and Yano and Thomas Boa, did they actually mentor you? Did they help you get started? They didn't mentor us. I mean, obviously, they were doing sound system parties, and that idea of doing a sound system party... came from what they were doing. Everything we've done, for the most part, you know, for Sunset has been geared daytime, day into night rather than night into day. And that was our, I mean, I didn't think of it as a twist, but that was our twist of a sound system party. We weren't, I wouldn't say we were really, or I wasn't at least very close with them at that time. This is something that's grown over time, like a mutual respect. And we're now really good friends with most of the guys, especially Yana and Garth that are still really active here in California, San Francisco. I think the fact that we've kept this torch going, I believe we're sort of the only crew from the 90s that has never stopped doing events. I mean, they still do an annual event, but they had a few years where they took off. And now we continue to inspire each other. I'm happy to see them still doing it. They relaunched their label and it's inspiring to see it keep going. I wasn't sure how long you could keep doing this. And to see it become part of your life, it feels good. It feels like you're on the right path. So Solar, what were you playing at the initial Sunset Parties? I don't know. I mean, so long ago, but I mean, kind of everything. I remember I would like start with like a Dead Can Dance record if I was playing first, which I was playing probably first, first few ones, I would say at least. And yeah, then we kind of go with, I mean, obviously a lot of Acid House because that was, you know, my whole main influence, kind of some proto trance and some kind of sine wave techno stuff. I can't think of any particular records like the actual name of it, but somewhere in that kind of realm. Yeah. And that's, and that's how all our sons. party started i mean we didn't just go out there and just start banging it i mean we we all had broad musical um influences and we started every party mellow you know and whatever whatever genre that was and when we brought different people in to play with us or if it was we would alternate like doing the early slot it was nice we got to play music that you didn't normally get to play out And it would build through the day. And that was also the nice part about it, just like this slow build to as it got later towards sunset, the music energy would just get more and more crazy and intense until at night we could start playing the wilder records. I was looking at a photo of one of the early Sunset Parties and I saw the dual cassette deck. People might not know this, but there are a lot of legendary rave tapes from San Francisco, like Garth, Spun. you guys can you can you sort of like talk about the culture of taping and were you guys obsessively documenting from the beginning actually we we did and um we we recorded everything on like my my little home audio cassette uh recorder i had a dual cassette recorder and i just bring it out and record the sets on on audio tape We just kept doing that. And then when Dat Tapes came out, then we switched to Dat Tapes. And Bradsen at the time, who made our flyers, was really into video. So we had like a little hi-eight video recorder and he would video the early parties. Eventually over years, I ended up with boxes of tapes and nothing really got organized. It just turned into this mountain of content. And one of the projects we've been working on is actually getting this content organized and getting it digitized and getting it so that... it can actually be shared now. So one thing that we're going to be doing is launching a Sunset podcast, which is going to feature old classic sets and stuff that we're doing currently. And hopefully some of our guests that have played. People like Idgit Boys and Doc Martin and people like that that were playing with us in the early 90s or mid-90s, we could release some of these sets. Garth actually had just found his, he had the recording of his first Sunset set. So I was like, hey, let's get that on the podcast. I think it's going to be fun to kind of share this music and what was going on then and the different BPMs that were happening at the different times. And a lot of the video content, too, we're trying to get it organized so we can share it. It does no good just sitting on a tape in a box in a shelf. Why not share it? relive some of the days or yeah it's fun for some nostalgia i guess i mean it's an education as well true for people who weren't there and like solar what were some of your most memorable sets that you caught in the early days for me my i mean back then my most memorable memories are actually of the cassettes that I was buying. So like Yano's Inside the Mind was a huge game changer for me. It was very kind of super psychedelic, lots of kind of UK acid and some, a lot of Detroit kind of stuff, but just super heady mix. So I heard that and then I was kind of always searching. following him to always hear that mix live somehow, you know, and he'd incorporate elements of that. But yeah, because back then, that's the only way you could hear a DJ mix was through a cassette. There was no, you know, internet or anything like that. There was internet, but it was just in the very, very early stages. You couldn't, you know, stream a... DJ set or there was no boiler room or anything like that. It was just like tapes that were made and passed out or we had this another store called Amoeba which wasn't the record store it was kind of like a head shop where they sold like anarchist kind of t-shirts and a bunch of tapes that's where everybody would go and buy their tapes or this guy Miles who would go to the parties and actually sell the tapes yeah that was part of the fun you want like before a weekend you'd be like oh I gotta get some new tapes so you'd go to Amoeba or Housewares which were the shops catering towards the sort of underground electronic music rave community or yeah go find miles at a party because he always had the coolest like tapes from people you wanted to hear and and then at that time it was like okay you left the party and i would just list just listen those tapes all week long non-stop until you get more And OK, so how long are you at the Berkeley Marina location? So we were there for for several years. By the end of that first year, you know. we made friends with either the beat cop or the ranger that was out there. A lot of times with us, sometimes they'd be like, what are you guys doing? What's happening here? And then they would see how respectful we were. We always cleaned up the parks. cleaner than we found it. That was one of our main ethos for continuing these events and how we would go into different cities and be like, look, we want to help clean up the park. We just want to have a little barbecue picnic gathering with some music and everything will be fine. And so it got to a point where we got so big that that didn't work. anymore and I would have to go to the cities and get a permit. Back then, I'd go into the city hall. It'd be like a one-page thing. It would be relatively cheap. No problem. At times, we get people getting a little too crazy. and it caused problems for us. And we had discovered we would go on missions looking for locations where we could do our sunset parties. I mean, we also did them in Santa Cruz on the beach. We did them in different places in the East Bay that were kind of more renegade-y, that we thought we could get away with it. Tried to research, like, what was... What jurisdictions were we in to see if we could do this? And so we found this Point Malate space, which is in Richmond, right underneath the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, which is another bridge. And that also wasn't as nice of a park as Brooklyn Marina, but had its own kind of magic. And it was right on the water. And it was a little bit of a rundown park. And so we just started setting up there. and some Richmond police came by and were like, what are you doing? And they really liked our vibe, and they were, at the time, Richmond was a really violent place, and often they'd be coming out there, seeing us after they just dealt with some sort of shooting or something. And they actually enjoyed what we were doing. And they really helped us. And so we almost had an arrangement with them. There was a few years where we were kind of, we knew we had to give a location a little break. So we would do one week, we'd go to Point Malate. And then we'd go back to Berkeley Marina and try and not oversaturate a location. As the years went on, more crews started popping up and more people wanting to do renegade-type parties. And they didn't always have the same respect and ethos we did. But what happened was the cities didn't really understand that sometimes you're different. They'd be like, oh, well, your friends were just here yesterday, and they made a mess. And we're like, who? They're not our friends. They're like, oh, well, they set up the same thing as you were. And I'm like, no, it's not quite the same. But it was so new back then. The cities were still just trying to get a grapple of like, what is this? What is this culture? And so then it started getting kind of a negative connotation as it started spreading around the country. So things just started getting more challenging. And at one point, Berkeley Marina basically just stopped. They made like a city ordinance where no more sound systems could be out there no matter what. And that's when we fully went to Point Malate. And that kind of became our home through the rest of the 90s, basically. Which one of you dealt with the cops? I had the most innocent look, I think. So I'd go over there and be like, hmm, what's the problem? It didn't always work. Sometimes they didn't care what I said. And we've had our fair share of being busted because, I mean, we would take risks. We'd take chances. We tried to get permits when we could, but sometimes we're like, let's just give it a shot. Yeah, I spent a fair amount of time speaking with police, and I just, I don't know how I did it, because I didn't want to do it, but I just went in there and was like, I got to do this. And we're trying just... Most of the time, at first, people would be like, what is going on here? And then once they got to know us or they were cool with us and they saw that our crowd was really fun-loving, just chill, really broad range of people. As the 90s went on, the musical styles in San Francisco started defining more and there would be more of... you know, a techno crew and there'd be more of a, the house scene or there'd be the dress up house scene and the underground house scene and talking to, to the authorities. It just, it became, as soon as I'd see him show up, I would just go over there and just kind of deal with it head on. And, yeah, once, that's what I was saying, once they would see who we were, that everyone looked very non-confrontational, people just having a nice time, people being very chill, even though they were dancing and we have loud music. A lot of times they were really cool with us. Sometimes, depending on who you got, they would just see, party, not supposed to be here, I don't care what you say. But we've I've I was always persistent. If we got shut down, I would go to the city to see how could we do it there more legally or how could we get permission? What could we do? I mean, we've even had some rangers say, well, look, you guys seem cool, but I can't. allow this, but what I can do is I'm going to write you a ticket for having a generator on the beach and that's going to cover, cover me and you guys just clean up after yourself. You'll be fine. And so we, we'd get stuff like that where, where we could work with some of the, the authorities. These days it's changed quite a bit. I think liability, the, the, in this country. people being afraid of being sued and different, it's escalated. I thought it was bad in the 90s, but it's at a point now where... You know, our country has a system of people not really taking responsibility for what they do, and they always want to blame someone else, and the lawyer scene. Anyway, it's made it very hard to do a renegade type of an event now, and even to go through the proper channels, the permit process is so involved and costs so much more money. I'm appreciative that we're still able to do what we do, even with the limited amount of outdoor parties we're able to do, just by the sheer cost and effort. The days of being able to set up a renegade and have more than a few hundred people is very challenging. It's interesting. I was once reading like a profile on this architecture firm called Dillers, Ghost Video and Renfro. And one of the people in the architecture firm is like really into these like avant-garde ideas. And another person. and she said that part of her practice is she's like, I like to navigate the bureaucracy. Like that's part of the creative process to me. And it seems like from things that you said in the past, like you're like a pragmatic person where you're like, okay, it's gotten way more difficult to permit this, but I'm just going to throw myself into it and figure it out. Would you say that's accurate? Yes, I keep thinking there's still a way to do it. And sometimes we've lost a location and couldn't think, like, what are we going to do now? And just keep pushing forward. I mean, now we're in a location that's called Stafford Lake, and we've been there for over 15 years or longer, maybe 18 years. And even that has gotten more and more challenging. There's new laws with the park. A big movement in California is there's no smoking in public places. Well, when people are at a party, you naturally like to smoke. When I go to Europe now a lot, I mean, it's very symbiotic with being at parties. People smoke, you're drinking, you're... You're having a good time. It's part of letting loose. And that can't happen anymore. People at our parties like to have a good time. They do drink, but people are very responsible. I am so kind of blown away after how long we've been doing this and how many parties we've had of how much people take care of each other and how few issues we've had. And I mean, we've never had a full-blown fight or anything like that. I mean, you get some domestic disputes and things like that. But it's been amazing. And we've actually blown away some of the authorities. They're like, I don't know how you guys do this. How do you have this many people here with no problems? How is there this much? you know, alcohol here and yet people are taking care of themselves. It's part of our community. It's part of, I think, the energy that Solar and I exude and Jaybird. I've always felt, I learned early on, that a party is a reflection of the people putting it on. And when someone is out on a purely commercial venture and they're going for the money, you kind of feel that in the event. I mean, it still could be a good party, but... It may not have the richness or the depth of where we were coming from, which was to have a good party, to bring people together, play good music, have it be good quality, have it be fun. And of course, we're a business now and we have to sustain ourselves. But that's never the top priority. It's the priority is making the event good and making it really soul satisfying for everyone that's coming. Yeah, I mean, you really took the words out of my mouth. I've always said that like a party reflects the people throwing it, like the type of person you are. what substances you're into, like whatever the case may be, like this ends up being reflected in the crowd that assembles. But I wanted to run back. Let's talk about like some of the greatest hits because I heard this story about you finding a place that was sort of like private land in between sort of public land and sort of. working some magic with the police and sending a helicopter away from a party before? Yeah, I think Solar was telling the story. Yeah, this was one of those cases where I had researched property. We were looking for locations. I was going through the entire East Bay because that's where you get the view of the sun setting and trying to find locations where we could set up. through the East Bay, there's the East Bay Regional Parks, but I had found, noticed, or discovered that this one part of it was actually private property. We had to carry the sound a really long way to get to that part of the park. It was, I mean, I still have memories of us trying to push the sound on this gravel. with the wheels that weren't moving and trying to get it out there and just like exhausted to get the whole sound system out there. But then it was in this kind of tucked in, in this little mini valley, but you could still see out of the bay. But like, if you were from afar, you couldn't really see what was going on. Well, we were out there for a few hours, and I think this was one of the Doc Martin Idgit Boys ones where we had become friends with Dan and Conrad, and we invited them out to come play. the East Bay Regional Park Police came out and they had a no tolerance. I kind of knew that already. And they came in and they're like, shut it off. And I'm like, no. I'm like. And I knew we were in Richmond. We were in the city of Richmond, which we had made really good friends with these beat cops that we just had this great relationship where we respected the Point Malate Park and they appreciated how well we took care of it. We respected them and they let us be. And they would all come out and visit almost every Sunday we were there. So this time we were in a different location. And I just told them, I kind of remember standing around all these police officers and they're telling me to turn it off. And I'm like, you can't tell us to turn it off. Like, this isn't your park. and they were getting very flustered and so they called in a helicopter to find out where the lines were and I see the helicopter circles around and I hear him go yeah that's yep they're on the other side of the bridge this is another part of the okay we're calling enrichment PD like This isn't going to last long. And we're like, okay. So they call in Richmond PD and our guys come. And so they... They come out. What's the problem? Oh, you know, we're trying to shut these guys down. And, you know, we're here to help you. Like, we can assist. And they're like, no, it's fine. We got it. And they're like, no, no, we're here to help you do this. And they're like, no, we'll take over from here. It's fine. You guys just can go back to the park. And they're like, what? So he gets them all to leave. And they're like, how are you guys doing? And then they talk to me. And they're like, how are you guys doing out here? And they're like, yeah, we're having a good time. And they're like, all right, cool. I see you've got a lot of cars out there. We're going to help you park them. So they went out into the street and helped us manage traffic to get all the cars parked. And yeah, I mean, I have to say that was a pretty, pretty awesome, magical experience to being very intimidated, but just kind of standing my ground and just being like, no, you can't do that. And for you, Solar, the Hale-Bopp comet lunar eclipse? party at Point Moulaté is kind of seared into your memory, right? Yeah, I mean, that was a pretty just insane one. Just like, I don't know what was going on, but the energy of the people was pretty wild that time. I don't know if it was the subsys or if it was just the comet or what, but yeah, it was a comet and a full moon eclipse going on at the same time on either side of the sky. I imagine it was like the last one of the season, but looking back on the dates when I just was doing an interview recently, it wasn't the last one of the season. Was it like September or when? Yeah, I can't remember. So, yeah, so memories from that long are always a little bit convoluted and distorted. I think it was our third year or something like that, third or fourth year. But it was super fun. We had like three turntables set up and everybody was getting pretty like. experimental with the music they were playing and the crowd was up for it too, which kind of added to the whole. thing and I think there's yeah there's definitely recordings of it out there so maybe those will surface yeah I think we do yeah we I think it was the first time we set up three decks I think you dropped PFM was that the time you dropped the PFM one and only drum and bass track just come out and that's right when I think we got a lot of shit from the drum and bass crew for playing drum and bass at a techno house party Wait, so you were mixing drum and bass into like psych rock? I think it was more at the end. Yeah, I think I was probably playing the last set. So that's where I was getting, yeah, kind of like the last bit. Yeah, it's just kind of going off on tangents. I think it was just that energy. We planned for it too. We knew this was going to happen. And I think we were like, yeah, let's set up three turntables. Let's end. And it just, the whole thing just came together. It was, like, I do have memories of just how, it was like a warm night, too, which sometimes you don't always get in the bay with the fog. And it was... Yeah, there's something really special about that night. There's some cosmic energy going on for sure. Okay, so you would start on, is it like the spring equinox was when you would kick off the season? Traditionally, we'd always start on the spring equinox. With climate change now, though, we tried to, we had condensed our calendar in the last few years. We tried to go back to the original calendar, which was always starting on the spring equinox. And we've just been getting rained out like three years in a row. And so we just had to go back to pushing it to the late April because we didn't have a rain out for. I think it was like 18 years before the first time we ever had a rain out. And now we've had lots in these last several years. Like three years in a row. Three years in a row. We had double rain outs. So we would postpone it a few weeks and then get rained out again. And so it would take like the third one. So finally this year we're like, look, let's just. I know we want to honor sort of the original, like the spring equinox was when the first sunset party was in 94. But for the sake of the party and people coming, because that first one is now, is anywhere from 5,000 to 7,000 people. So it throws off quite a lot of people. When we have to rain out, people fly in for it. have moved away and they want to still experience sunset. So they want to come out for our season opener. And yeah, it's got, it's, and it throws us off too. It's, we have to reset everything. And financially the, to do this event is, is, you know, tens of thousands of dollars actually to be able to do our outdoor parties now with the amount of permitting and, and infrastructure that is required. and insurance from the parks. At the beginning, you were a weekly. It was kind of like this Sunday. There's a bar in San Francisco called The End Up, but this is like an end up where everybody shows up on Sunday after raving all weekend, and you're just doing it on a weekly basis. How long did you do it on a weekly basis? I think it was at least a couple years, maybe two to three years. We did it on a weekly basis and there would be, we started getting a little bit tired. We also started noticing people just taking it for granted. If we took a Sunday off, people just get mad at us. And we're like, we're doing a free party. We just need one Sunday to ourself. And I remember we moved to every other week at one point. And we did that for a little while. And then I'm not sure how it started spacing out. I don't know if we went to monthly. But as we got older and we started getting more interests and we wanted to feel special still. I think that was one of the main reasons for starting to make it less often was that people just started expecting it to happen. And we wanted to keep that. that feeling that it was something, you know, unique and to be appreciated. And, and it takes a lot, it takes a lot of energy and effort to be able to do this. So. Yeah. Hauling a sound system up a flight of stairs every Sunday after you've been out there all day is pretty tough work. Yeah. And we've had times where we've hauled it to, to a location to get it all set up to then getting busted, to then tearing it down. moving it to another location to set it up and try. And I mean, we were relentless at the time. Yeah. We're also in our twenties. I mean, the sound system lived on my third, third floor apartment on hate street and we would carry it up and down the stairs every week. And I can't even imagine doing that. No way. You guys had huge shoulders. Yeah. So the Wicked guys ended up playing the party. Idgits seem like a big part of Sunset's. early history. They came to San Francisco often, so they would come play with us. Yeah, like the DIY crew from Nottingham. They were coming over pretty often. I mean, when we started learning about them, we were really excited to have them come play because that was, you know, that's even pretty wicked, you know, them doing these renegade parties and, you know, Tonka Sound System in the UK. So we were drawing inspiration off them. I mean, we were DIY in a sense. So when they started coming over, we just, yeah, like, come on, come, come play with us. Yeah. And who were some other guests in those, you know, let's say since it's been such a storied history, let's say like the first like six years up to 2000 or so. I mean, in the early days, it was definitely mostly DJs that were either San Francisco DJs or that had moved and, you know, had become San Francisco DJs or whatever. And then it would be kind of like friends of friends would come through town. Like Kenny Hawks used to play quite a few times and Joshua is and Marky Quark. And yeah, obviously all the wicked guys, the hard kiss guys. I mean, back in the early days of San Francisco rave scene, the scene was so, the talent pool and the music, like the country looked to San Francisco in a lot of ways is like, what is going on there? We want to emulate that. So for years, you know, the massives or the raves were all local DJs. It was, there was no one flown in, you know, that was, that started happening a little bit later when. promoters from other cities moved to San Francisco and started doing their parties and they were used to bring people in. And then, you know, occasionally maybe a UK DJ would come, would come over and play some of these parties. But I mean, from what I remember, I mean, these were huge, you know, thousands of people, parties that were all done on the, the, the bigger local talent at that time. So for us, it was about getting those guys to come out. and guys and girls to come play with us. As time went on and the scene grew more out of San Francisco and you started getting influences from all over, when people would come through town, they would often ask, like, oh, we want to do this, or they'd come play unannounced because they were here for another party or something like that. And we were fine. People started trusting. there's gonna be good music there and then just be excited that, you know, whoever just came and showed up, um, after they had played some party on Friday night or Saturday night. Any, any memorable unannounced guests from, from those years? I mean, again, I think my favorite guests were, you know, I mean, The free party, if you're talking about that, it was mostly us and then there would be one guest. It would always be either one of the Wicked Guys or DJ Spun or DJ Tony. Some of Ethan that was doing the friends and family parties. It wasn't until we started actually doing some... paid parties where we could start booking DJs and bringing them in. And when was that? I mean, we did some underground pay parties, warehouse parties, but we started the boat parties in the fall of 95. And those also have still never stopped. That was, I remember us kind of thinking, we knew that Bulletproof was doing boat parties, but they were kind of a generation ahead of us. And we were like, well, what a better way to experience a sunset party than actually be on the bay and watch the sun go down. So that was obviously a pay party and we would book and then we could book a more diverse crowd. The drum and bass scene was starting to kick off. So we could have like the upstairs could be drum and bass or there's a big down tempo scene going on as well. We could have a lot of DJs that play just non house tempo stuff play with us there. And that's when we started. bringing in people maybe from the East Coast. I remember the Chocolate Factory guys. came Onions and Joski and all, I can't remember the other guys, but they all, Samir, I think, yeah, would come out and play with us. That was in the mid-90s, I think. We'd bring in the Hazy Days Collective out of Dallas. Those guys would come and play with us a little bit. They were also doing these ranch parties, these wild ranch parties out there. Yeah, West Coast. I'm trying to think who was down in San Diego. Miles Maeda and maybe Michael Manahan from Seattle and kind of a lot of the West Coast scene. They were always coming through San Francisco. So you guys are just kind of chugging along through your... first decade of doing sunset parties doing bow parties and was there ever like a dip that you guys had to like kind of like fight through and obviously like you've had obstacles in terms of venues, scouting venues and stuff like that. But did the energy ever drop at any point? And how did you keep the persistence? I mean, I think one of the things is for a long time, there wasn't so many people doing stuff. I feel like nowadays the scene's gotten pretty saturated, and even little niche kind of scenes, there's like 10 people doing parties. In San Francisco, if people haven't been here, it's a super small city. Whenever I tell people it's 800,000 people and the size of it, it's seven miles from one end to the other, people are always a little bit shocked. They always imagine it to be a much bigger city, and it's actually quite... a small city. And yeah, so you have a lot of people doing parties now. And back then it was not so many. So I feel like it was, and we'd been going for so long. So our reputation just kept growing and growing and stuff like that. So I think it was maybe a little bit easier and I feel like it was just on a constant trajectory going up, whereas it's become more saturated. Now it's a little bit more difficult to kind of. weave your way and make it special and unique but we have the you know we do have the history so that yeah i i think like what solar said we've we've it's always just been we've carved we had carved out this kind of place for ourselves and no matter what was going on if we were doing a sunset party We would get our crowd. They would come, and the energy was still very high. Still communal, see a lot of familiar faces, really great energy at the parties. I mean, if it wasn't, we may not be here right now. If our friends had stopped coming or they started getting weird, we might have shifted and done something else, but it just kept. just kept building or just kept going and just kept being, kept feeling like, well, was that just the most amazing party we ever had? Or, and that just kept. going through the 2000s. And we would chat, you know, we would evolve with what was going on then by bringing in different people, trying different events, working new venues. You know, we partnered up with the Stompy guys and started doing this daytime party at Cafe Kokomo, which was this cool salsa venue that had this big outdoor area. And it was one of the last places you could have like outdoor music at a venue. And that ran for years. And it was just, it was like two parties in one with this amazing outdoor part portion. And then the nighttime portion. And so we kept finding new projects that would like re-infuse energy. But I would say the most challenging time has been recently. It feels very saturated on a lot of levels. And we've adapted. You know, I'm always learning, learning modern promotion techniques. I mean, we relied on word of mouth for so long. I feel like that's what... kept our crowd so, so special was that we didn't blanket promotions everywhere. We let friends tell friends, tell friends, tell friends. And we did our promotions. We get the word out. We give something that people could share, but it's, it's definitely been, um, in the last several years where we've had to really think about more about how we do things and when we're scheduling things. and people want to be with us, but the demand for people's attention, whether it be through the immense amount of people doing parties. We saw a lot of clubs in San Francisco go from being top 40 clubs or being more mainstream clubs to just overnight shifting their programming and going for the so-called sort of underground house music sound or tech house sound. And now all these clubs are competing for the same market. It's created some new challenges. And we're adapting and always learning and still appreciative that we're still having amazing events. You mentioned bringing on new ventures to keep things fresh, keep things interesting. We're coming up on the 10th Sunset Campout. It's happening next weekend in Belden Town. How did the idea for the campout come about? So the first iteration of the campout, I think, was 98. We were invited to, I think it was called Tribal Future. It was the store Solar talked about Amoeba that had all the tapes. It was Mark, Amoeba, and Alan who kind of ran that store, decided to do a little campout somewhere. And it was kind of, yeah, also kind of raw. It might have been in 97 or something like that. And that may have been the sort of the idea that was like, maybe what about a sunset camp out? And I think 98, we were invited to be a part of something that was happening in this really special piece of land in Willits, about three hours north of San Francisco. That kind of turned into what was the first iteration of Sunset Campout that went from like '99 to 2004. And it was much more of a modest We put a disco ball in the trees. We had our friends that did amazing sound to bring sound. And it was on this beautiful property. We fed everybody. And those campouts, I think our biggest one when we outgrew the venue was like 750 people. And then we didn't really know. We couldn't be there anymore. And we didn't know what to do. So we kind of tabled it. until our sound guy, Pascal from No Audio, said, hey, I think I have a location that could work for Sunset Campout. It's not like Camp and Suns and Willits, but there's a lot of special things about it. So we went to go look at it, and we were like, yeah, this place is really interesting and cool. It had a river. We really wanted a water source because we had... a pond to swim in there and a river nearby. And that was like a key thing for us. And at this point we had moved along, our productions had gotten more involved. And we had now built this relationship with these amazing lighting crew called Radiant Atmospheres that are just... I mean, these guys, I've never seen a crew get so passionate about lighting and find vintage lights and recustomize them and repurpose them and create these lighting creations that are full lighting arrays and you can stand in front of it and nothing's shining in your face. And just so much attention to detail. And our friend that was... just so into sound. And I remember talking to Solar going like, what if we, what if we had this place where we could let our, our, like our friends that we've been with just go crazy, like where we could give them enough budget to, to really let, let their wings like unfold. And that became what the Sunset Campout is now. But in true Sunset fashion, we started somewhat modestly. The first year, we weren't sure how much momentum we could carry over to the next one. It was about 500 people, and it just grew. It just kept every year be a couple more hundred people. But our crews, you know, we told them that. But they brought out production that was, you know, 10 times what we could ever pay them and just created this magical atmosphere. And then you combine that with sort of the quaintness and coolness of this old mining town of Belden Town and our energy. And it just everything just symbiotically like came together. And now we had more budget to bring in. Our eyes started looking at a lot of European artists that were inspiring us. And now we're like, well, can we get them to come over here and play with us? people in Detroit and Chicago that have been big influences on us. And I mean, we've been able to bring out, you know, many of our, of our, you know, people that have influenced us since early, early DJs and record collecting to this event. And it's just kind of taken on its own magical life form. Who are some of those artists who have been influencing you from the beginning who you've managed to get to play at the campout? Well, we were talking about before we started the interview, Larry Hurd was a huge one. And as we were saying, I think it was like one of his last gigs before he retired DJing. So it was really special having him. And yeah, we've had Harvey, Trax out there playing an amazing set. Mick Wills, two of my favorites. Derek May and Stacey Pullen and I mean this year it's it's a primarily I guess more European focused but yeah the lineup is is I mean super inspiring to us and that's what is keeping us going. I mean, for us to keep going after this much time and to feel super energized about, I mean, putting on a festival, which takes a tremendous amount of work, diligence, and physicality, this keeps us really inspired to be able to share this with, you know, DJs and musicians from all over the world and our friends. bring them in and have them play with us as well. It is a bit tricky, though, because it is in the middle of summer and most, a lot of these DJs are already doing their festival tours and stuff like that. So each year I try to start to reach out to the artists, you know, as soon as campout's over, start thinking about who's going to be for next year. But it is a challenge sometimes, but it seems to be more and more people are hearing about it or coming out and spreading It seems to be more interested in DJs actually wanting to come out for making the trip over. Oh, no, yeah. I mean, someone like for this year, like Gerd Janssen, who's coming over for years, just couldn't make it happen because the European festival season is quite full and you don't really have to travel that far. So for these people that are quite busy to want to make the effort to make that journey to come over and experience it because they've heard it special has been awesome. Yeah, and, like, an affiliate of Gerd's, Dixon, obviously, like, throws his, like, lost-in-a-moment parties, which are incredibly intense in terms of, like, what they're trying to do, like, find, like, magnificent bespoke venues and then bring in an amazing sound. You know, sometimes they have issues with their venues as well. But from what I understand, like he came to Sunset and was just kind of blown away by the sound, the production, everything that was going on, right? Yeah, he was. And since then, he's come back and played for us. I think he's done everything with us. He's done a boat party. He's played. we had sunset Island for years where we were doing an outdoor day party on treasure Island in the middle of the Bay. Um, these are the types of things that, you know, we keep trying to try new things to keep us inspired, but yeah, to, to have someone like him who was, you know, you know, kind of the top, uh, DJ at the, you know, or. all around Europe and come over and hear him say those things was really, really nice and was great to have him there. And he seemed to fit right in, was super chill, and we've kind of developed a nice friendship. And at some point, like, both of you have gotten much busier as DJs, like outside of San Francisco as well. And do you feel like... the sunset identity is like intertwined with all of that. Like people found out about you from sunset and then began to bring either a sunset boat party or one of you to DJ in other places. I think the camp out had sort of the biggest influence internationally. And then that's led to them learning who we are. But yeah. And also like doing the Lover International for six years, whatever, seven years. Yeah, Garden Festival when it was about Garden Festival. Yeah, started the Garden Festival and then turned into Lover National. That's kind of like, that's been our main kind of as Sunset where we go every year. on an international thing and do it. Other than that, we just did Bulgaria, which is the Meadow and the Mountains. Meadow and the Mountains. And then mostly from that, we kind of do our individual things. traveling in europe seems like but yeah i mean that's something that's inspiring for me and for us is to to now bring the sunset energy abroad or and elsewhere and and definitely looking to get get involved in in events that seem to have the same ethos as as what we're what we're doing so bringing the boat party to croatia to garden festival of international was like so a logical move since we've been doing boat parties non-stop. It was a little bit, I guess, ironic to do Meadows in the Mountains where sunset, but we did the sunrise stage. But it's still the same thing. It's this outdoor party in this beautiful place and during that transformative time of day. So that was a real honor to be included in that this year. Sort of switching lanes here. You're both producers as well. Your first record, I think, came out in the early 2000s or 2000, I believe. And Solar, you've had a few things recently with your label Squirrels on Film, as well as a collaboration with Brother Nebula. I've also heard that there will be like a sunset label soon. Like, can you, can you speak a little bit about the label and your own productions and how that works with everything? Well, like the podcast, I feel like there's. music that we want, that I want to share. We want to share that can go beyond just, you know, the Bay area or where we're going to an event or festival. And, um, I had launched in those, those early two thousands, a sunset label. and just did a few releases as I was getting into production. I was definitely more of a kind of a gearhead at the time and was more fascinated by gear than the making of the music. That's a transition now where I'm much more music-focused. But it's always been a challenge. Doing events takes a lot of time, and it's hard when you love DJing and then you're doing these events to then also spend hours in the studio. You end up running out of time. So it's been a balancing act. to do that. And I think now we're, we're both fine finding a groove of where we can, we can do it all have time for the studio, which is something I'm definitely more passionate about and solar with, with his label, with claws and, and, and, you know, working, you know, we've each been building up our own, our own home studios more. So I definitely would want to see that happen more in the future. for sure. Is making tracks a priority for you right now, Solar? It is a priority, but with everything going on, it just gets pushed to the back. It's just, I wish I could just be at home making music, but I got to run this festival. I have a pretty busy DJ schedule. Yeah, so it's tricky. My plan is I was just talking to my agent to take, block off some time, hopefully in the winter, and just go up in the mountains and snowboard and work on music every day. And so hopefully get a lot of stuff done then. But yeah, that's what I'm itching to do and what I want to do more than anything, but it's just making the time is what has to happen. That's always, that's been the trick. I mean, doing events. you just don't realize how much time it can take. I mean, I'll be in front of my computer. I haven't eaten at all, and I'm just there just working on stuff. And next thing you know, the day's over. You're exhausted. It's really hard to turn on the studio then. So, but what's nice about sunset, it is, can be seasonal. And, um, as time goes on, you know, this year for our anniversary, really wanted to do a full schedule of events and, and we'll always do events, but maybe, maybe we won't do such a full schedule so that we can work on some of our personal projects, which is something that, that we're, you know, really passionate about right now. I mean, DJing was always our. our first love, interacting with the music that we loved and to DJ with it. And that's what spawned Sunset. So we could play music and this community grew out of it that took up, just like grabbed hold of us and is also part of who we are. And it was really hard to not do that. That's where my energy just went. But it's a full evolution. So I feel like we've really paved who we are and our path. I mean, I think we've done somewhere between like 160 or 170 free parties when we were doing them that way. And so now I would love to see us really kind of blossom as individual artists, you know, kind of coming out of this whole Sunset Sound System sort of community and framework. There's this saying about California, more so L.A., because you guys actually have seasons up here. You sit down when you're 16 and you like stand up and you're 60 years old. And like, I'm wondering, like, does, uh, does 25 years feel like a long time or did it just blow by? I mean, I think it's both, you know, sometimes you think of a memory, it seems like it was yesterday. And sometimes you think of a memory and it feels ages ago. You feel like a whole different person, you know, in so many ways. And we were, we were kids, Now we're old men. I don't know if I go quite that far. I mean, the crazy thing is I feel great. My passion for the music is still really high. I love traveling around. I love meeting people. I love playing in different places. you know, maybe after doing it this long, you could tire out from, from doing that. And I just have, for me, just like this, this kind of fire burning that just, just really enjoys it. And, you know, we, we take care of ourselves, you know, we don't party as much as we used to, but we still like to have a good time. And I think that really gives you longevity and, and. And it is weird that the time warp is trippy. I can't believe it's been 25 years. I don't feel like it has. But the same. And I'm like, what am I? Am I crazy? Like, how have I been doing this for? 25 years. But then at the same time, it just felt so natural and it still does. And as long as we feel good or as long as I feel good and I still have energy and I feel inspired and then it feels like the right path. Bye. Bye.
