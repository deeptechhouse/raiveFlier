you you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. It's safe to say that John Tejada was in his element when we sat down to chat with him at this year's Mutec in Montreal. The festival's focus on live electronic music is something Tejada, who's been playing live since 1994, can easily identify with. Since starting out, he's developed a reputation as a meticulous producer who thinks deeply about his craft, both in the live arena and in the studio. His approach has yielded around 20 albums over the years, with his most recent full-length seeing release on German label Compact. Both Tejada's working methods and the dance music album format were key topics of conversation as R.A.'s Andrew Rice chatted to him at the festival earlier this month. So, how's your time at the festival been so far? Really fun. It's nice to be at a festival. that's more focused on arts and visual arts and all of the above and just less more on an independent scale and just you know you to go to a festival and see so many of your favorite acts on the lineup is pretty exciting and to like be a part of that. cool this is your first time playing mutech right yep i did do one in um tijuana which is mutech related a few years ago but that's the only one um and you played last night and i understand the set that you did last night is a new one uh what what's new about it I went back to just using hardware machines and it's a pretty small setup of Electron Octatrack and Analog 4. The Octatrack is a sort of a phrase sampler and the Analog 4 is four independent monosynths that are analog mostly. It's kind of limiting in a way and I think my brain just kind of functions better that way in a live performance setting where I've never gotten good with like controller is controller ism and and Ableton and all that I just it's too kind of limitless and I don't quite know where to set the parameters for myself And I kind of enjoy not having like the glow of a laptop in my face and stuff. So I like to have kind of limited instruments and if I'm kind of closer to home, bring stuff like a 909 or SH-101 type simple things into the picture because you can just kind of on the fly start putting things into them and it's all kind of idiot proof. You know, you can just, even if you make a mistake, it's not that big a deal. So it's just kind of more fun to... perform that way and the set really does kind of from the beginning of a tour to the end it really does kind of mutate in a big way and things you kind of make up on the spot are still kind of stored in the machine and it just sort of keeps adding and adding and adding and then after about four or five gigs you really kind of have a whole different thing going, which was a lot of fun. And just more fun for me being sort of a fourth grader. to really make sure I'm not going to make a mistake instead of kind of just, you know, being on autopilot. So is there a lot of rehearsal for these things, or is it just kind of on the fly? Yeah, it actually took me way longer than I thought it would, and that was slightly challenging, but also a lot of fun. I was doing live hardware sets. in a similar way with some of Elektron's older instruments and added mono synth around 2006 and I would also do a tour with Justin Maxwell who I work with and Aaron Leviste as well and we would kind of do the same thing we would just sync up like as many boxes we can carry on and That was the most fun I ever had, but when I was doing them on my own, it just kind of got to be too complex and slightly too limiting as far as what I was trying to do with it. So because of the possibilities and the new instruments, there's a little bit more room in there for me to... set things up properly. So it was really comfortable. It was the first time I tried it and I think I'm going to be... doing it and expanding on it for the rest of the year. So with this set you're working with now, is it based on the songs you've already written or is it kind of improvised? It's a combination of both. The kind of really fun thing about it is I end up coming up with new works literally kind of on accident. I want to fill it with some new things, but I don't have any really high hopes for them. So it's kind of a fun way of writing because sometimes at the end of it, in this case, there's two things I really would like to properly record when I get home. And that's kind of fun. It's kind of like throwing paint on a canvas or something and it actually coming out cool. Out of the 12 songs in there, eight of them are from previous works. And what I did, instead of just grabbing chunks of audio, like longer stems... is I would take individual hits or in the case of mono melodies, I would recreate them on the Analog 4 and I would actually enjoy the fact that they ended up coming out a little bit different so it kind of had an updated feel like it's maybe familiar but you kind of know it's different. And then for the... more complex timbres, I would, instead of just looping a phrase, I would take just individual pieces and then sort of replay it on the, you know, sort of MPC style melody stuff. So everything was kind of like rebuilt from the ground up. and I actually ended up finding some old parts on a drive I thought had gone, and it still booted up. So I found some stuff I actually never got to play live before, and it was pretty fun. How do you handle having all that equipment in front of you on a small stage in a dark club? Do you ever look down and be like, oh shit, I don't know what I'm doing. Yeah, totally. It makes a difference. In my home setup, I... I've got it in a rack, so I see them one on top of each other. And I was going to bring this portable thing like that that a friend was offering, and I didn't get it. So then when I was testing in the hotel room, I was kind of testing out how it was going to go. And I had to make a decision, like, okay, one goes to the left, one goes to the right. And I thought, okay, this is comfortable. But I didn't realize at sound check I got up to play and I was like, "Ah, this is really different." But you know, it's just like little things like that. And actually at one key moment when I really felt good about myself, instead of hitting like track two, I hit the stop button. And it was, yeah. But that's the kind of cool thing, too. Like, one machine is still kind of playing. So, like, it's kind of fun to have little accidents because people might recognize, like, you know, oh, you messed up. Oh, but he's really doing something, you know. So that's cool. And keeping the gear kind of small helps with that whole factor and to keep it a bit limited. But, I mean, between those. two machines, I've got quite a lot of capability to playback samples or longer stems in some cases, and then four very good sounding analog monosynths. So I think if I can't do it live with that much, then I feel like I'm kind of doing something wrong. It would be nice and flashy to bring tons of stuff, and in some cases, like... Getting closer to home, if I can drive, I'm probably going to try to add some things to it. But again, then it just gets too complicated. Already, with both hands, I'm constantly changing little parameters and things. So do you find it hard to travel with your hardware set as it is now? No, that's the thing. I get ultra paranoid about checking in gear, so the whole idea is being able to carry it on. For the most part, I have it figured out. There are a couple of airlines that will try to weigh your baggage, and that's where arguments ensue. worried about that. So I might try to build a little foamy thing that if it gets taken away, the machines won't be destroyed. Little things we worry about. Or I worry about more than my friends, I think. I can't afford another two pieces if they get smashed. Has that happened a lot to you? No, because I'm always too afraid to check them. So I'm always like, for I don't know how many years, like everything has to be like with me, with me. I think even with records, I've barely checked in records. And the one time, the first time I did, I remember like, oh, yeah, please put Fragile stickers all over that. And I realized it's kind of like a dare to the baggage throwers because they were just kind of too, like just the wheels have been like shattered off and the handle just bent, you know, and then after that I've never put a fragile sticker on ever again and I've never had a problem, you know, so that's the lesson for today, like don't put fragile stickers on your luggage. So, I mean, obviously live electronic music has been around for a long time, but I feel like the past few years it's really gained a sort of currency, especially for DJs trying to make a bigger name for themselves or make themselves a bigger attraction. When did you first start playing live? My first live gig, I guess, was like in 1994. Obviously it was a hardware set. We didn't have a laptop. instruments and that sort of thing. But that's always been kind of like my main interest and that gets me really excited to try to like recreate my own stuff in a different way, in a simpler way and like just see how fun I can make that for like myself and the audience. Did you feel a bit like a bit of an outsider playing live in 94? No, I mean I was definitely a noob but it just seemed really exciting to me and there was a live electronic performance club which I ended up being involved with a bit. called Public Space, but it was a weekly thing just based on live electronic performance, and it was like $2 to get in, which I still have fond memories of, because still you don't see that too often. I think that kind of got my juices flowing as far as the idea of trying to play live, because it just seems like if you make music, that's how you perform. And I think a lot of times we just kind of get thrown into DJing. I mean, I did grow up on that as well, but it's always kind of like... You kind of know which gigs are going to be exciting where they just want to see how long is your live set? How long can you DJ for? Can you just DJ? I'm just going to play the same stuff your opener is going to play. That can happen. That's how you can kind of gauge what's going to be a fun gig where people are interested in the kind of art you're trying to create. Do you ever feel like the fact that it's a live set, even though it is quite dance-oriented, that people might not be as interested or excited about it? Yeah, I had a lot of experience with that last year, so I'm pretty used to it. I kind of, I put all my energy in the last couple of years into the two albums I made for Compact and I think trying to be as honest as I can be as an artist or whatever, I like to sort of give a grander idea of like, you know, everything from beatless pieces to kind of clubby pieces and everything in between. In my ideal performance situation, like here for instance, you can kind of do whatever you want to do artistically, creatively, but if you're on between two DJs that are just kind of banging it and you're shoved in a DJ booth, I'm more than happy to do that. I feel really lucky to do that, but sometimes if you get ten of those in a row, you just start feeling like, nobody wants to hear this. So the previous live set was more album-based, and it worked some places, and some places just didn't really work at all. I think this new one has the idea that it's easier to change and combine things in a different way. If I wanted to have it be more of a listening thing, I can just have a completely different rhythm section for the night or something to that extent, as an example, or have there be another whole bank set of this sort of club remix style. That's why I'm kind of... happy to have put this new set together. Is the new setup, are you free enough to change direction mid-set if you had to? If things weren't going the way you wanted them to? Yeah, it's still kind of a work in progress. I mean, I am limited to what I prepare, but I think having two versions of things is... is quite possible and being able to add to them or subtract to them on the fly where like I'm just not that good at that using a computer. How many live setups have you gone through over the years? I don't know how to answer that. Quite a few, I think. There's different incarnations of trying to use a laptop, different incarnations of doing hardware. At first, it was kind of like an ASR-10, Juno-60, Innovation Base Station, a rack of effects, a little mixer, and then it went to kind of like MPC, EMU-6400, Ultra on top of each other with like a Nord. micro modular for like effects and then the sort of early days of Ableton on like those first little white iBooks I think they were and then different computers and controllers and then computer and adding a synth and then just going back to trying to do stuff with just the machine drum and the mono machine with monosynth for a while and doing that stuff with friends that I mentioned. And then going back to computer and one of the machines maybe or something just to have best of both worlds. And then now it's kind of back to like just machines because I feel the new machines are kind of slightly more developed and give me a little more freedom where I was to load samples into the machine drum. It's really fun. It's kind of very vintage legacy. It's kind of like using SB-12. And after a while, you just, you know, you go back to like, I don't know if anybody used to remember this, but I remember like you used to have no sample time. So you'd fly your records or whatever you're sampling at 45 plus eight into your sampler. And then you'd have to like pitch it down. You get all this like crazy alias thing, which is like. the really great gritty sound of like old bomb squad productions or any of that stuff so um that was kind of fun and then after a while you were just kind of like i just want a little bit of memories you know so the um the new machine are good for that and then instead of having like a digital emulation of a synth to have analog components is really kind of sounding good on a PA. You mentioned earlier how your previous live set was based on your last Compact album and the Compact connection has been a relatively recent one in your career. How did that come about? It was a little over two years ago and I finished what was was the Parabolas album and I had the name and everything. Long story short, the plan I had to, what I wanted to do with that wasn't gonna work out. And I really wasn't sure if I wanted to work or who to work with. I had the small idea of Compact in my mind before just because they are one of the few labels that I've worked with other labels and usually there was no interest if it wasn't going to be the same thing, which kind of maybe did okay for them. It's like, well... yeah, there's like ambient things and, you know, and with CompX kind of the opposite. When I turned in the last one, the predicting machine, and there was no ambient piece, they actually were like, oh, it'd be really cool if there, you know, it's like, that's cool because like who would, you know, at least in my experience, I'm not used to that, that somebody would ask for a bigger variety than I felt I already had presented to them. So, I was just kind of like out of ideas and Jimmy Tamburello is a good friend of mine. I worked with him on like James Figurine and all his little projects and he kind of heard it and I was just kind of like trying to figure out the plan with him and he's like, why don't you give it to Compact? And I was like, oh, that's a really good idea. And then I remembered I had actually done a remix for them and the experience was really pleasant so I just kind of hit and I didn't hit up anybody else, and luckily he really liked it. So it's been really cool from that point on, and yeah, so far so good. So since the first Compact album, you've released a few things. Have you approached... those releases differently when you're making them because they're going to be on Compact? No, not at all. And I think the thing that bums me out is the last album, Predicting Machine, the thing that ended up being kind of the tagline was like, oh, he made it with Compact in mind. So I think some people were like, oh, he changed it all up. But what all that meant was I knew somebody was going to do a good job with it, and I didn't have to worry The only thing that I do keep in mind is I can actually sort of express myself a bit freely, like I don't have to do certain things. I mean, I actually might have to do ambient tracks, which is cool with me. But yeah, it's just nice to be able to like... make music and not worry about it so much. Was there any concept or theme behind the predicting machine? That one just kind of like, I wanted it to pick up where Parabolas left off, and where Parabolas actually had a little bit of a concept in mind, even though the image on the cover, I'm aware, is not a Parabolas. but my designer just thought like, he's like, I'm not gonna just put a parabola shape on the cover. So, um... That was all about just kind of noticing that shape occurs in nature, and I was getting really kind of hippy-dippy with that whole thought. But that was fun. So with The Predicting Machine, actually, the title came from my collaborator, Justin Maxwell, and I thank him for that. But it was just kind of like musically, it was to maybe continue where Parabola's left off, but try to, at least for my own... personal view on it like expand slightly even to a larger extent than um perhaps What kind of tablas did you do? Expand what? Just the sort of range of the range of moods and ideas on that and I had experimented with some little studio techniques so I found some things that worked really neat and I wanted to like I think most of the songs are based on a little kind of of nerd out that I was having with my equipment and seeing if I could make that into a proper song. Obviously you released, I think, 10 albums. Is that correct? Kind of. I don't know because there's some I've done on my own. I've done some with Aaron Leviste. And I'm not a gun albums. So you've released a lot of albums. Yeah, I think with all that stuff, maybe it's nearing 20. And you feel like the album is kind of a legitimate form for dance music? I don't know. I guess I'm not the right person to ask. I really have always enjoyed the album format because growing up, it was all about... "Oh, so-and-so's new album was coming out," and you took it home and you stared at the liner notes, or I stared at Neil Peart's drum set for like two hours while I'm playing the new Rush album over and over or something. So just the album format was just kind of magical. and it was nice to be able to be taken away for a while instead of just focus on a peak energetic moment over and over. Of course, there is a magic of the single where some things kind of work magically as a single and they stand on their own. And then when they actually do get incorporated in an album, they sort of stick out like a sore thumb. So that's actually maybe the idea of the single that Compact just released that I did called Somewhere, which is me kind of trying to focus in on that type of feeling, if that's the right word. Just something that can stand on its own and would be maybe slightly out of place on a full length, at least in my view. how that all works. So when you're working on an album, you really sit down and think, okay, this is going to be an album, and you make everything with the knowledge that it's going to release as a full-length? For... For myself, it generally always happens on accident. I'll be in between imaginary projects in my head that I'm supposed to be doing, and I'll get in this mode of, I'm just going to do this for fun now. Mostly it's always for fun, but it really just feels very open. I think when I reach the point where I have four things that I sort of didn't expect... have then I kind of decide that like I'm gonna try to make this elaborate on this and make more tracks and try to keep a theme and expand that to like a full-length idea so are you pretty much just always making music while you're home um it's always there's a lot of music related projects like a lot of kind of music work or mixes or a lot of times a lot of my good friends I work on music with them and it's kind of like our way of hanging out so it's like yeah come by we'll get some food and we'll just fire up some machines so like a lot of songs come out of that and I think for me for it to kind of feel right it kind of has to still especially like my own stuff just kind of has to come out of free time and not like forceful everyday stuff like the forceful stuff is like the kind of I don't know the busy work, paying the bills stuff. And, um, and then there's like other things to take care of too. But, um, that's just always been, uh, my kind of escape and my fun time to like go and be creative and just kind of have that, that going. So if that ever kind of felt like a have to or a businessy thing, then it wouldn't be as fun, I guess. What's your home studio like? It's just kind of a modest little bedroom setup. I've got an iMac at its core. I try to move things back and forth so that I don't have tons of things in front of me, so I kind of change the setup. But at the moment, I've got a Eurorack setup, like four rows of that with a Swayman S1 at the top, which is also a great CV to MIDI utility. I've got a Roland SH-7 that I'm really excited about. like Studio Electronics Code for Voice and Moog Voyager and SubFatty and Minotaur, although my friend's got the Voyager, and the two new Electron boxes. I've got this little synth by a German company called LL Electronics called the Rotzbox. which is pretty exciting and it kind of went out of production immediately after he shipped it because he's sort of, I might have the story wrong, but it just seemed to be too big of a task to keep up all the support and everything and a lot of the units shipped. maybe I shouldn't say that, some shit with little problems. And he just, he couldn't, he was a one-man operation, but it's the first synth that I kind of have ever owned where if I make a cool sound on it, I don't know if this sounds good to anybody else, but it sounds like I sampled it off a record, and that's just like really cool to me. So it has a lot, a lot of character. And then a couple of outboard bits like SSL compressor and focale speakers and something, a couple of eventide effects and that kind of thing. And then I've got the sort of classic Rolands and my 808. And 808 is quite Frankensteined at this point, which is fun. And I've got a Devilfish 303 and 909 and all that stuff. But it's just kind of, they're kind of sleeping in the closet for a while. And sometimes they're fun to pull out. And I've got this, the Interclock. Sync Gen Pro which really keeps things in amazing sync so they're a lot more fun to like plug in again and you know it's going to like sync amazingly to what you're working on which was kind of a problem for the last 10 years I think as computer MIDI just started to get a bit sloppier and especially like MIDI clock. And then to hear everything kind of line up the way it does with like an analog clock is there's a whole different kind of crazy feeling to it the way like things fit into a pocket and and transients almost Flam together and not flam actually the opposite. They just they're right on the on the mark. So Anyway, that's my exciting studio development in the last few months. And you're still living in L.A., correct? Yep. Obviously, the American landscape for dance music is changing pretty rapidly, especially in L.A. and the area around there. Has it affected you at all? How are things different for you working as a DJ in the US now? I don't know. Not that different, to be honest with you. I still kind of seem to work with people that are just kind of more generally interested in kind of what I do. And I don't get picked up too much for-- the more mainstream stuff. I think at one point I did that a little bit and it just was very disappointing for everyone. I thought it was fine, but you know, there's just a certain energy that's kind of expected there and you just kind of want to do what you do and nobody wants to hear that. So yeah, but I think it kind of comes and goes. I think like the expansion of all the all the new the new stuff people are doing is is kind of gaining the attention of a lot of young people and I think once they want to kind of dig a little deeper they'll find like, you know music that's you know, I guess a bit more deeper experimental or or whatever so um i think there's potential to to grow in that respect Thank you. you
