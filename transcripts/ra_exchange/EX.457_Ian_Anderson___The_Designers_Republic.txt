Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor of Resident Advisor. For this week's exchange, we return to the Bleep pop-up store for a conversation with Ian Anderson from the Designer's Republic. The graphic design studio from Sheffield is arguably the most iconic in electronic music, responsible for countless designs for the likes of Aphex Twin, Orteca, and The Orb. But the studio's work extends far beyond that niche. A generation was immersed in their aesthetic, thanks to video games like Wipeout, while they also count corporate clients like Adidas and Coca-Cola in their portfolio. Here, Anderson is interviewed by Trevor Jackson, who's an important designer in his own right. for an extended conversation unpacking the finer points of Anderson's design philosophy and the intent driving some of his finest works. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Ian Anderson from the Designers Republic is up next. Hello, Ian. Hello, Trevor. I'm trying to think, have we ever properly met before and had a chat? Yeah, we did in Dublin. Oh, God. Yeah. I'll tell a story about that later. That was a good one. I got to DJ because you fucked off. I did. Why did I go? I'll tell everyone later. A lot of people here. It's good to see you all. Anyway, so I will start. I've got a bunch of questions. Kind of some for the nerds and kind of some for the people that might be listening that maybe don't know everything about you. But I wanted to start because you've got a book coming out through Unit Editions. And I was looking at the Kickstarter page. And at the top, it said the Designers Republic is the design group that changed design. And I'm just intrigued for someone that didn't have a design background how that feels to read that now. I mean, the real answer is that I'm not, I mean, I'm proud of what we achieved. And it's a really weird thing. I've never been a fan of other things or been in fan clubs. I'm just not predisposed to be a fan or to have favourites. Thank you. So it's weird. And it's also, I mean, as Trevor said, I didn't study design. I had no, there was no plan. And maybe that's part of the success, you know, that there's nothing that I feel that I need to achieve apart from satisfaction on each project and personal satisfaction in a design context. It's really, as you can see, it's really difficult. to answer that because I'm aware of our influence. but it doesn't inform what we do. And one of the great things about being in Sheffield is there's not, I mean, there are other design companies I've heard, but there are other design companies who do some like okay stuff and we do okay stuff, but it's not something, there's no like design community. So you don't get drawn into it. you know so like on a on a Saturday you know kind of watch sheffield wednesday you know and the people that i know going to the football um you know they have different jobs they're not involved in design and you know they'll say oh what kind of week have you had and i'll say i was designing something for such and such and they're like yeah yeah we had a big sale of steel to uh finland you know or something that wasn't the same conversation every week you know but it's that kind of thing and they're So they're kind of interested but not really interested. So it's a nice little thing that I can just occupy my time with during the week between football. Going back to your early memories, I was wondering the first piece of graphic design you saw that had a huge influence on you. Turn that one down a little bit. Yeah, the first piece of design that had a big influence on you and maybe changed the way you actually thought about graphic design. I was talking, I mean, I'm going to answer the question in a roundabout way, typically. But I remember I had a friend who... did a lot of research into the way that we think, the way people think. And they said there's this thing called widescreen memory or widescreen thinking. And the difference is some people, you know, have memories that are based on, they remember facts and times, and then from that memory they kind of, they can build a picture. And there's other people. I think like me, who I kind of absorb the things that I like or that I see as an ongoing thing. So I don't really remember kind of details. So you didn't pick up a requisite and think... There's things that I've liked, but I can't remember anything. I mean, there are things that are, you know, so being the age that I am, you know, there's like, never mind the bollocks was sort of something, but because it stand out, it stood out and I was a teenager and it said bollocks, you know, and it was really bright fluorescent colors. And I guess that if you look a lot of our work, the fluorescent color thing, you know, move forward. It sounds really arrogant, and maybe it is, but I'm more interested in my ideas and I don't really look at other things. And quite often when people say, oh, you know, that looks a bit like something else, it really is a coincidence, you know, because I'm not really interested specifically in other graphic design. It's just, but I obviously, like anybody, I'm influenced in general, but I mean, how you, it's not sort of any sort of fan things. I mean, I remember, I remember I really liked, you were talking about it earlier, the Jurity Column first album with the sandpaper thing, because it, you know, fucked up all the other record covers. So I like that, but I tend to respond. I mean, that's a good point because I tend to respond more to an idea. So the idea of it being a sandpaper cover and what it did and how it was a... It's because of what it was rather than how it looked. But then you went from being a non-designer into designing. There must have... I mean... there must have been a, I assume it wasn't just by default, I assume there was a passion there which was built from something which must have drawn you to do it. Okay, so I mean, the basic story is that I was, so when I was at school, I was in a punk band called the Infrared Helicopters and we were like a resident support band at a punk club in Reading called Bones. And I used to do sort of, write some flyers and things for that and then we released. to a single when we all left and did a real sort of punk thing like going to university and um so i did a cover for that and that was just basically kind of it was i mean it was spinal tap before spinal tap it was just black with some like typewritten stuff but actually cut out of strips because that's all i knew how to do and then i did some posters uh for that band and then i went to university and so went to university so i had a post-punk band and and i used to do the fly eyes. and things for that because nobody else wanted to and I kind of just started enjoying it and then I put various events on and you know DJ and put him and promoted some bands you know and again so this is before if you can imagine a time before laptops you know BC before computers and it was and I just did those because no one else wanted to do it now every DJ he's got a mate who's got a laptop that wants to do the flyers but nobody really wanted to do any flyers in those days you know so I mean I kind of I kind of grew into it and in terms of like art and design Probably the answer that you're looking for, like, at a moment, and I think the moment was that I got interested in art or visual communication was my aunt was a member of a book club. You know, you got sent a book every month, and if you didn't send it back, you had to keep it. And she got sent one about Andy Warhol and didn't send it back in time, and so I got it for Christmas. She thought I might like the bright colours. And I think that was a big, that was probably the moment when I kind of thought I quite like some of this. But because I've been chucked out of art before O-Level, you know, it wasn't something that I thought about doing. But I just kind of, it was just this thing of like, I'm running a club, so I've got to do the flyers. I'm in a band, I've got to do a flyer. They're called leaflets or handouts then. And then I started managing a band that signed to Epic Records called Person to Person. You know, and they said, oh, well, you know, why don't you do the artwork? Because, you know, you've done the artwork for the Flyers. So I kind of did that with the people at the CBS art department. And then some other bands asked me to do some stuff and then other bands. And then the band I was managing got dropped and split up. But more people asked me to do record covers. So it just kind of grew and grew. And I think for like the first three years of Designers Republic, you know, we... We never said that we were designers. The whole name was a joke was that because I didn't study design and my ex-partner sort of dropped out of sculpture at Salt Lane Art College in Sheffield, Nick Phillips. And so none of us, neither of us had any real background in design, except I knew how I liked things to look. And I, you know, had a nice collection of the Thames and Hull. and little black spined art books. I mainly bought those just because they looked nice on the shelf if you had the whole lot. So, I mean, it just kind of grew and grew, you know, and there was never a point where we kind of said, OK, you know, we're designers now. We used to say, well, if somebody asked me what I did, I'd just say, oh, we just do record covers. You look at your work now, which is so far more considered. So for me, it's quite an interesting journey to go from work, which was quite, as I said, not matter of fact, but it was just work. to now be at a stage and to be at a point where some of the work you're doing is so complex and so designed? Was there a point when things shifted? I didn't study design. I did philosophy at the University of Sheffield. And I think that my interest in design has always been everything other than what it looks like, really. If it's good design, it's good because it needs to communicate something. So I'm more interested in the problem solving and the engagement and how you engage an audience, sort of consumerist issues, you know, issues of like, you know, truth and perspective and why do we think what we think and why do we believe what we believe, you know. And so there's lots of things like that. form what what I do as a designer so it's it's not really I mean a lot of it you know because it's detailed there you know you could see it as a surface but for me it's not it's it's the it's the communication of an idea and because I probably think too much then there's a lot of ideas in there And I guess as you get older, as one gets older, of course I never do, but as one gets older, you know, how you think and how you react to your environment and your situation kind of changes, you know. And I guess the work, you know, evolves. It's interesting, I think in some ways, you started out a little bit before me, but our careers have kind of run in parallel. parallel in a way and for me I mean both of our work when it starts off is quite playful and quite cartoony and quite colorful and then it's shifted slightly more minimalistic I'd say and I have my own personal reasons why that happened I suppose I'm just trying to wonder if there was a point where you said no no enough of this I've got to start being serious or I've got to start applying my ideas in a different way I think the reality is is that is that there's never there's never a point in my life there's never a point like that where where significant change happens I kind of I kind of drift you know it's the same thing when people say oh you know what do you see yourself doing in five years and I think if I knew that I do it now I'm not going to hang around for five years waiting for this you know kind of big kind of epiphany so and so to a degree I kind of just drift there's never really been a plan we just react to kind of what's around us and also you were working i mean i was working alone and you had other designers working with you so they must have had obviously an influence on the studio and yeah yeah i think you know it's my my main interest i think has really been designers republic as an idea you know and and what we do and and i guess from being in bands and managing bands then it was always i mean you know when we did our first like photo shoot you know sort of publicity photo shoot for design republic you know we decided nick and i decided that we were gonna you know dress like gilbert and george And so that kind of thing was always more of an influence than looking at other designers. It's like designers, it was like a band or it was a something. you know, not just people designing. It's never really been that. It's, you know, so getting other designers in, you know, there's a, it's getting the right designers, the people that understand what I want out of something and understanding how to connect with the concept of Designers Republic, you know, and finding people that kind of can take that and then add something of their own, not just come in and just do. what you want you know but bring something extra to the table but it's always it's i've always kind of tried to carefully curate what they'll bring because i personally i've never had a a design company such it's pretty much been myself and an assistant because i've always either found it very hard to delegate i found that if i've had people working with me sometimes it doesn't feel like me anymore i want to be personal and also i didn't want to encroach upon someone else's creativity too much that I'm forcing them to do something my vision not their own so I've always struggled heavily with trying to find people to work with but you did it very well I think it's because um again because I didn't study to be a you know or trained to be a graphic designer and I'm I have to say I'm more interested you know in the ideas of what we're doing and why And it's partly an altruistic thing where, you know, giving people space to do what they want as long as they understand the parameters that I want them to work within. So if they don't understand that, then they're not going to last very long. But if they do understand it, then I think, you know, you give someone freedom. It's like if you're art directing a photographer on a shoot, you know, you don't want to be kind of saying, can you just move? to the left of it or to the right, you need to kind of inspire them to do something that you want them to do. Delegation is... difficult in a creative context but i think as i say it was all about the idea of designers republic rather than each specific design you know so i was often quite happy if someone could could do my idea better than i could do it myself then you know why would i bother of course um my personal introduction to your work and two of my favorite things you did that i first saw was actually a person-to-person cover. And I think Picnic at the White House, you did a sleeve for that with all these great little logos on it. And I think it was one of the first sleeves I've ever seen with a spot varnish on it. I think you did a really complicated thing with a spot varnish. And I know both of us have a kind of passion for special colours and pantones. It's something that maybe in a digital age, many new designers don't get the chance to play around For me, there's nothing more exciting than getting out the Pantone book and doing this. And I've worked with designers recently and they really don't understand how print works in that way or trying to replicate a neon on the screen or a metallic. And I'm like, you can't do it. There's a lot of stuff that happened as a result of the fact that we didn't really know what we were doing. We took interns in so that we could learn how to use software and stuff like that. And so everything that we did in the early days was kind of black and white, but it was because we didn't know how to add colour. We didn't know about markup or anything like that, so it was just black and white. And we kind of made that... feature so we started working with a label in Sheffield called Fon Recordings and that was all about being black and white and then and then sort of it got to the point where we did a single cover for Age of Chance and they said oh it needs to be a bit more colourful so We were still designing it. I mean, in fact, I still, you know, design in black and white, really, and then sort of colour in. I mean, sometimes I don't, but I mean, you know, it's a comfortable way for me to work, you know, to think of, like, the form and the reasons for doing it, and then, you know, and then you sort of, like, you know, paint by numbers or whatever. A lot of the things that I saw that I liked, you know, I didn't really know anything about it. So spot varnish was, I saw, I saw something. I'd never seen it before. To be honest, I think that was the first sleep I ever saw that had a spot varnish on it. But the fact was, I just, we just saw something. I thought, that's quite nice. We'll do that. And then we did that. And then, and then with Age of Chance, you Amrik who used to run Fon Records you know so I said why don't we do like four or five different colorways you know it was you know in the 80s when there were loads of formats etc so you know we didn't really know about CMYK or anything but someone had given us a Pantone swatch book you know we thought you know this you know 801, 802, 83, or the fluorescents, they look nice. And if we're going to move away from black and white, let's go really bright color. So we're just like happily, you know, specking things up with like four or five. fluorescence, you know, and without having any idea of any cost implication, it's just, it's just Pantones, you know, so that's what it is, you know, and, and, and basically kind of clients would go like, well, you know, flavor of the month, design of the public, you know, if they say, you know, three pounds, you know, three fluorescents and a metallic, you know, possibly a D boss, then, then that's what we're going to go You know, no, and it wasn't, I think it wasn't until like two years into doing this, you know, that someone said, you know, this is like costing a lot of money. You know, we're like, it's not costing us any money. And I think that, and I think so a lot of things that we did, you know, are kind of a really fortuitous or beautiful accidents because we didn't know. And then also, if you look at some of the other early sort of, you know, the joys of like repro, I'm going to a repro house, you know, and we were doing really, really complex things like the first Nightmares on wax album is just a black and white drawing. And then we've got, you know, with K trace overlay. We're just saying this bit has to be put in the colour values, whatever. And again, we didn't know any other way and we didn't know anything about it, really. And then Warp came back and said, you know, it's just cost us nine grand to do the repro on the album. I'm like, OK. I don't know how much a cheap one is. And I guess that I've continued in that way. if there's certain processes, it's not, I mean, with certain clients, you know, and with smaller labels now, I feel some responsibility to try and help them and understand what they can have and what they can't have for a cost. But, but otherwise it's, you know, the less, you know, the, you know, the more. inclined you are to do whatever you want really. And I think again not studying, I mean when I teach I kind of I try to say to my students it was like a one off unique thing that we got to where we are. You can't say well Ian Anderson didn't study design so i'm just going to like toss it off and not do it you know like what he did there's a lot of things that we that we've done that people saw as like rule breaking you know and doing something different but to us it was just it just came natural we didn't know we were breaking any rules we just thought we were you know coloring in I mean, because for me, the unsung heroes of that time were some of those repro guys I never got to meet, but I'd have the print people turning up with wet proofs. and they'd show you you would literally be i mean i did work sometimes it was on like 10 12 different layers marking it up and you had no i never visited there one i had no idea how it was done even to this day i don't quite know exactly how they did it and the printer would come in with a proof be so angry with you like what we spent like four days doing this and yet i just had no idea and now they look back and go we were so lucky to be involved in that project you know it's it's shoe that whole repro thing but i remember um the way that i learned about typography was i was actually doing the the I started to learn about typography. Of course, we never stopped learning. But, you know, there was that picnic at the White House thing, and I didn't know about marking up for type. Again, they didn't have a laptop or anything. You couldn't just type it in. So everything's typed out on a bit of paper and then marked up, specced up. My original things were sending it to, I think it was a company called Alphabet or something. Anyway, and they did, like, photo setting. And, but my sort of thing is like, you know, I want these letters to be two millimetres high, one millimetre wide, a millimetre and a half between each letter. And they just kind of said, you know, look, if you're going to be using us on a regular basis, can you just come in and we'll teach you how to spec up for type? Because it's going to be spending a day showing you how to do that is a better use of our time than spending like two that you're asking us to do. So, I mean, there's a lot of things, you know, like that, how I learned stuff really, you know, because you had to, you know, and if you're being asked to do, like, record covers and things, then, you know, you need to kind of get your act together, don't you? Totally. I was wondering, do you feel an in-house style is an asset or a hindrance over time? I'm aware that over a period of time there's a certain identifiable look to things that we've done, even if it's a look that's evolved. And quite often I'll deliberately go back and revisit something because I think if everybody else is ripping us off, we might as well rip ourselves off. But it's also, as I get older... I look back and there are certain things and I almost, I can still remember why I did something, but I almost don't, this is like deep, I don't recognize the person that made those decisions. So I started when I was like, what, 25 and now I'm a bit older. But, you know, I don't necessarily kind of think of like a 25-year-old person anymore. So, I mean, I'm aware that there's an in-house style, but it was never something that we kind of said. you know you it has to look a certain way it for me it's always been about attitude and approach and output so that's what has that that's the key thing so that so if you've got a certain mix of people in your studio at a particular time then the way that they um react to that direction you know it's going to have a sort of certain look And I think, I mean, so we're doing the book at last and going back to archive stuff. And I sort of see more now about the in-house aesthetic as was, as is. And I see that more now. At the time, we never really thought about it. It was just kind of what we did. when you're doing a lot of stuff for like dance music or which is kind of fairly anonymous you know which is why we you know both of us kind of got asked to do certain things you do all the champion stuff didn't you know and you know so there isn't any there's no direction coming from the artist or from the label it's just can you do you know a cover so we used to get to the point where The reality is that the in-house aesthetic came from the fact that we were still working through ideas and we hadn't rinsed these ideas out so that one person's record cover or piece of design was maybe like an evolution of somebody else's. Not that we were, you know... sort of trying to fob them off with something we'd already done. But it was very much about what we were doing and ideas we were exploring. So that, you know, if you came to us at a certain time in like, you know, 1989, or it could be any year, I just chose that. It was a kind of a design of republic. thing and one of the things about being in Sheffield and away from everything else and just being kind of isolated was that you know it's always been a playground for us and even now like with bigger more corporate clients you know the ones the project where it works best is where we're given the space to to play and the times it doesn't work is when a client kind of shows us a whole load of work that that they think is good And it's good because we were playing and then they tell it kind of try and dictate how you should do the work You know, I mean, you mentioned like in, you know, on social media, you know, but about the idea of like, can you make the font size different or things like that? You know, it's if you want the best out of creatives who work best playing, then let people play, really. for listening you mentioned being ripped off is imitation the highest form of flattery though especially coming from some I mean yourself I see you coming from the area of sample culture yeah so most of the sleep you did the early ones not ripped off but certainly inspired by things around you so yeah I think that There's a difference between being inspired by something and wanting to take that and make something of your own, or just copying. So for me, the classic example of that pastiche kind of thing was the cover for London Calling by The Clash, which was a direct rip-off of an Elvis Presley cover. But the beauty of that was that it worked much better if you knew that it was that pastiche, you know, that that was the engagement. It's not no one was trying to hide it. So I think that but I think for me, you know, if there's an idea there, you know, in the first place and then to express that idea, you know, the designer chooses to pastiche something else. And it's a knowing, open reference. I think that's fine. That's just how it goes. Which is very different to sort of passing off. I think that the biggest, the thing that pisses me off the most about people just... like just copying, is that as designers, we have an opportunity to kind of, to create stuff or engage with audiences. And we have a lot of freedom to look through our ideas. And so the thing that pisses me off the most is that if you get a designer that has the opportunity and all they do is just copy something else, it's a waste of their time or whatever talent they have. It's just, it's just a waste. And so that's the thing that pisses me off the most. Apart from like, you know, any financial thing where, you know, someone's, you know, getting dollar for RAC, you know, gate crusher. I'm just saying. A lot of your early work was inspired by Japan and you hadn't been to Japan. The country, not the band. So I was wondering, the fact you're inspired by Japan, where were you getting those Japanese influences from pre-internet? And also the fact your work got embraced in Japan must have been quite flattering, no? Yeah, it was interesting. I mean, the Japanese influence is like kind of, is like threefold. And if you look back, you know, if you're old enough to look back. um if not you just have to take my word for it but i mean it's it it the initial influence was blade runner you know and no i always go there no blade runner no designer republic it was you know just big tvs in the street and things like that but so there and so watching blade run it just seemed to be like a kind of parallel universe and then there's another another reason um was the But, you know, for, you know, mid-20s boys, young men in a northern provincial city, you know, it just seemed like all the really cool gadgets and boys' toys came from Japan. And by default, the future, Japanese culture seemed, or modern Japanese culture to us seemed to be an expression of the future. So like ever sort of smaller Walkmans, you know, and all that kind of stuff. So like, you know, Japan just seemed, was a shortcut to expressing visually or in design terms, a shortcut to... expressing the future so it's a shorthand for the future in a lot of ways and the other thing was that I guess one of the things that's always informed what I do and maybe it's you know one of the philosophy books that I might have skimmed when I was at university but it's all about kind of communication and and legibility and this idea of you know how far can you abstract typographic communication before it becomes unintelligible I mean we could have used any we could have used like you know Cyrillic or Hebrew or something but we used Japanese typography you know, to sort of, and quite often what we would do, we would just take like the closest looking kanji or katakana, you know, sort of characters to like English. So a lot of stuff we do with Populite itself is really just like, you know, going through Japanese type books and finding letter forms that looked vaguely like a P or a W, an E and I, you know. And if there weren't any, then we would just, you know. appropriate and adapt it into something that kind of you know looked legible but there's this whole idea that if you look at like brands you know that kind of If you see McDonald's in Japanese or Coca-Cola in Thai or something, you still recognize it. And that was, it was, it was interesting. The first, we did a lot of stuff based on, on modern Japanese culture and typography, you know, sort of future stuff, post-Blade Runner, blah, blah, blah. But the first time I went to Tokyo. It was like, it was really weird because you kind of reckon you could tell what kind of shop you were looking at, even though you couldn't read it. And we had all sorts of interesting adventures, I think. But there's a big store called Marawi, which means Circle One. And then they had a second department store. store nearby so it's circle one circle one marawi marawi and that my pronunciation is probably way off but anyway but you know for this big logo circle and a one a circle and a one so for like the first year or so of going to tokyo quite regularly and i'd always say you know where should we meet and people say where do you know we say okay well we know oi oi And no one understood what oi oi was because we just thought that's what it is. So I like all that kind of, you know, what is true truth is based on perspective and context and typography, you know, amplifies that. So I think that's the real influence of... of Japan. It wasn't even the country really. It was just, I guess it's just sort of a parallel universe. It's those sci-fi films where you wake up and everything's the same but backwards or something. But it's odd to take visual references from, I mean, I think about another example. if you're making UK hip hop, America would always laugh at you. You'd take elements from hip hop, but you'd take it back to them and they'd laugh at you. But you took elements from Japan visually and, and they accepted it. And that's kind of quite unusual. Well, what, I mean, we, so we had a big show at the Ginza graphic gallery, I think 2011, you know, and some of these like really well respected, like, you know, old Japanese designers, you know, sort of, you know, have a little speech at the opening. And I didn't understand any of it, but, you know, just at the back, you know, having a... beer but but apparently what they were saying that the designer republic's influence in japan and for young japanese designers was really significant because in japanese culture they have a very different uh attitude towards copying you know it is uh for them you know it is like flattery and you know so if you get a guitarist and you can play hendrick perfectly no one says you're ripping hendrick off hendrick's off or somebody might but in general they don't I don't know everybody that's there but in general you know it's just well done that's a really good kind of copy so within modern Japanese culture there is a sort of there is a culture of copying and it's seen as a good thing and so they quite often you know young Japanese designers would look to, I suppose, like the West or whatever, Europe or the States, for influence. because that was sort of seen to be a better thing to do. Whereas we were kind of going back, having, you know, appropriated their culture or used Japanese imagery to express something that we wanted to, which these guys were saying, it's great because it's kind of given. young Japanese designers a sort of sense that you know that their culture you know is equal. I'm not doing it word for word you know. In the 90s I remember I took a conscious step back from design because I couldn't think of anything worse than being stuck in a room with a bunch of designers talking about leading and kerning. It was being like with a bunch of train spotters and yet now designers become kind of sexier and in the process become like a lifestyle aesthetic in a way. Through the process, how do you feel about that? See, we never really had that kind of, we never had kerning in Sheffield. I mean, given the context, let's say, the Designers Republic Day was usually kind of based around what music we were playing on the hi-fi and why we were doing stuff and what music we were listening to. And it was a real sort of social event. And anybody that kind of started talking too technically. You know, you just, you know, we just used to have like a siren thing, you know, just like call the design police, you know. So you encourage, you know, I encourage people to do the best design, but just don't talk about it all the time, you know. In the 90s, it was really kind of the Design Republic as a group and we kind of worked, you know, we worked late basically because we'd been arsing around all day. So we had to kind of work late and then we'd all go out for a drink together. And, you know, it was just, you know, I guess the... parallel is if you're in a band you know and you hold and you all hang out together as a gang you know you don't talk about chord progressions you know and things like that and it was the same It was the same for us. So, and I guess it's, it's probably true to say that, that anyone that sets up a company in any way, but especially a creative company that it's unavoidable that you set it up in your own image, no matter how much you try not to, there's going to be a sort of sense where, you know, what. doing boss or some other nonsense yeah no i just again you got into design through necessity but now a lot of people get in design just through a lifestyle choice like they get into the music you know people work in record companies so i think it's cool yeah i just want to go and party people get into design because a lot of people know it's so easy to do you can fit into that framework and that lifestyle it's kind of quite comfortable for people which is very different from what we had when we were younger i think i think it's true that I teach who probably sort of consider themselves, they've decided to be a designer. So they go and do a graphic design course. But in their own mind, they're a designer anyway. Beyond that, now you can go online and buy the outfit all from one shop. They'll tell you the hat to wear, the T-shirt to wear. So, I mean, from that angle, it's completely... Yeah, but I think that's not just design. I think that's... You know, we live in a lifestyle world, man. Listening to Pog. Craft beer. And one thing we share in common is Michael Place. Yeah, yeah. Because he worked for me before he came to you. Did he have any bad habits that when he came to you that you kind of knocked out of him working with me? Do you remember? I don't even... To be honest with you, he says he worked for me. I can't even remember him working for me. This is a thing. It must have been maybe four or five months or something. I don't think he was with you for long. Not really. Good. Not that I can talk about here. No, I mean, there isn't really. I mean, I knew that he'd worked for you on certain things. But, I mean, again, it's... people were coming into Designers Republic, which is kind of almost like a, you know, a really formed gang, you know, and it, and again, it, it wasn't an arrogant, a arrogant thing that kind of, you know, we're better. It's just that kind of, we weren't really interested greatly in what other people were doing. You're quite. competitive though i got the feeling there was a sense of that now i think that it was more playing a game so we weren't really competitive in design terms but it's a little bit like you know again everything i reverted back to my own experience was really being in bands or managing bands and so there's a kind of competitiveness in in bands that that you know it's you make your own music you know i guess and or whatever you want to and i guess if you're putting albums out you want to sell quite a lot and sometimes you know you need to sell to sell quite a lot you need to sell more than somebody else you know success is based on kind of what you own or what you earn or what you make relative to other people not what you terms of your own ambition i guess so so we were but it was much more about you know pushing this whole idea of design republic and and playing the game of you know um you know, the whole work by Consume Dye and all these kind of things. I don't think it was really being competitive with other design groups particularly. It was just about playing the game of getting ourselves, you know, out there. Because that was all I really knew. You know, you're in a band. Free social media, free everything to having to get your message out there. Yes, but it was more the game. game and the idea of it you know in the same way of like you know that the idea of like are we going to dress like gilbert and george it just seemed that kind of it because i didn't have a design background designing stuff wasn't enough we had to be like a group and we had to be visible and we had to be seen and that that's kind of what that's that was kind of the fun bit really your music clients now is it do you do a lot of stuff outside of warp yeah we don't do enough inside warp that's the problem these days But I was just wondering, because there's obviously been such a huge shift in the way the music industry works. For me, when I first started as a teenager, it was exciting. There were personalities like people now that probably wouldn't get jobs anymore, people that would be throwing things out of windows. It was pretty crazy. And you walk into a record label now, it's like walking into a bank. A lot of them. Well, they are banks, aren't they? In a way. But I did a job for a independent last year and there was a contract and in the contract it said we can't guarantee we will put your name on the artwork and this is a fairly big independent and how things have changed is just ridiculous and yeah but how you tell people to fuck hasn't changed has it that's still the same he says that we can't guarantee your name's going on it i can't guarantee i'm going to put the artist's name on it there and when it comes in copyright how's it work with copyright for you because i remember do you retain your copyrights or do you do a buyout on the copyrights on what you do for music stuff now we're into our 33rd year and to be honest it's because the music industry has changed and you know you know the parameters you're working within and you know what the the budgets are smaller in general you know then I mean, I can remember when we did stuff for like major labels, you know, you do an album and three singles was like 30 grand. You know, you tell the kids that these days. But... I've got to the point now where I'm more interested in, you know, people say, what's your favorite job? And then the answer is always going to be the next one because you've got, you know, blank canvas options. And I think as a designer, the things I cherish the most, you know, are options. And as I've got older, I don't really, I do care about intellectual property, of course, but, you know, it used to be kind of someone to say, you know, cover and pay for that and then go and get someone else to take the artwork and make a 12 inch this that and the other and that was that was an issue but in but in general people don't do that now because they just want you to do the whole lot you know, you don't get that whole thing. And I'm not expecting to kind of, to do all the ads because there aren't really going to impress ads because there aren't really going to be any press merchandise now because that's because they're not making money from sales. So if you do an artwork for someone and they do a, you do a buyout, they might only sell 500 records, but they could sell 5,000 t-shirts off of your design. And I think that's where the copyright now, or Yeah, I mean, so the only thing that we sort of say is that if you ask us to design like, you know, vinyl CD, you know, that it is for that only. You only get the rights to use it for the things specified, you know, in the contract. Or even if it's not a contract, the agreement or in an email or whatever. And I think that's... you know important but then again because budgets are so much smaller you know i don't want to go to war with someone over getting like 300 quid for a couple of press ads you know i mean you can just go and do get someone else to do it you know So I think my attitude has changed. The music industry has changed and my attitude has changed in that kind of it's, you know, it's a different kind of thing. I used to think that kind of I never, that nobody could ever do the Designers Republic book apart from the Designers Republic, which is why it never happened because we were always too busy doing something else. And then, you know, but now I kind of think I kind of quite like someone else. to get involved and sort of see what their perspective is. And it's the same, I'm just not so precious. I'm more precious about creating possibilities and potential for doing new projects or for getting new experiences for myself. And if somebody, you know, because there's not really many instances for us where someone's going to you know make a fortune on on the merchandise it it's it is an issue but in real terms it it doesn't sort of seem to be such an issue as it used to be for us you know And to be honest, sometimes I'd just rather get on with something new, rather than having to battle with a client about rights for this and rights for that. I'm just like, yeah, just take it and give us some more work. I was wondering how you survive in an industry full of more and more hungry new designers willing to do work for little or nothing. Well, we do work for little or nothing. Again, you know, as time goes on, the people that we work with kind of evolve and sometimes that evolution takes them away from us naturally to work with younger people. Sometimes, you know, when you've grown up with a client, it's like Ortega, you know, they are older in the same way. I'm older so like a you know a new young designer with lots of new ideas you know isn't necessarily going to satisfy what they want from a project and by the same token I think that it's you know I think it's really important that there are you know young new eager designers and that young new eager bands should work with them you know i mean it's not to say that i don't want the work you know and i couldn't do a good job and it's not just music it's you know it's any kind of clientele you know um so i think there are there are certain things that that i can do better uh because design probably is 33 and so am i yeah but you but you know that But now within a lot of your clients commissioning you will be maybe half your age. Do they care? A lot of people don't, they don't care anymore. To be honest, we're old. To be honest with you, you know, I mean, it's great. We've got people sitting here. But in the greater scheme of things, when it comes to contemporary design, there are a lot of other people people would rather come to than us. Yeah. That's the reality. It doesn't bother me. It's a fact. But I think that's as it should be. But there's enough stuff for us to be doing. You know, so, I mean, we kind of, like, mutate it. And we know we do corporate stuff, you know, with people like Audi and Coca-Cola. And we still it's not like we've suddenly just become like pentagram or something you know um so we've still got the same attitude and we're still kind of you know the wild card in all these things because of personalities involved i mean everybody could do with a bit more work but there's also that thing where, you know, if somebody, if somebody is looking, you know, for the young eager designer, that's going to go and hang out and go on tour with them and, you know, get pissed with them and do all the stuff that we used to do with bands like properly itself and age of chance and all, you know, blah blah blah then you know i don't really want to be that person you know it's not it's not me anymore you know unless it's just sort of like a bottle of craft beer and then home. Do you remember the first time a piece of your work was rejected? You must have had some in some of your work. I was trying to think. No, I don't. I'm aware of the concept of work being rejected. And I'm sure that I've had that experience. Do you ever pitch for things? No. I think a couple of times we pitched. If there was a pitch budget, kids, then we pitched. And we didn't always win them. I can't really remember. I just put it out of my mind. But again, it's when the young designer of Republic, you know, mortally offended. and, you know, wounded by any kind of rejection or, I mean, not even rejection, even a client saying, oh, we really like working with you, but we're not sure that it should be orange. We thought maybe it should be blue, you know, and it's, you know, you just think like, it wasn't even like I feel hurt. I just kind of, I feel hurt for you because you're wrong. You know, and it was that kind of thing because, you know, if... Anyway, and it's not so much about arrogance. Of course, it is about arrogance. But it's not so much about like, it's my way or the highway. It's just like, I've thought about this. Give me the credit for I've thought about this. And there's a reason that we've chosen certain fonts or certain colors. And you've just looked at it and go like, oh, I don't like that. Or we had like, we had one where, you know, there was a client. going to say doesn't remember who it was but so i said oh you know yeah my wife my wife didn't really like it very much and my son wants to be a graphic designer so he's done something you know, he's still at school and you sort of think, okay, well, but I then think if that's, if you're the kind of person who kind of judges things in that way, if that's how you're making your decisions, then I don't really want to be working with you anyway. And sometimes, you know, it's like personal relationships, boyfriends, girlfriends. pets you know it's it's that sort of thing where if it's not working there's no point kind of pursuing it and there are times when there's a big budget involved so that kind of sometimes you know causes a cash flow problem if you you know if you if if you tell them to fuck off and they do um i just think well if it's not working when i don't want to sort of spend my my life you know if you say you're going back this thing about design probably was a lifestyle thing we did it because we wanted to do it and we had fun and if it's not fun there's no point doing it so it's better just to kind of dip out and find someone that you can have fun with when you talk about we now who does it consist of uh right now so there's um There's me, and then there's a guy called Johnny and a girl called Ashley. So we're sort of, you know, designers. But kind of what happened after we went bust in 2009? I mean, that was a hideous time because we got to, I had like 25 staff, you know, and you just think, oh, yeah. I didn't really get into it for this. So basically, I used to look around the office and think, I'm only employing these people to do work for clients that I'm only doing to pay for these people who are there. So that didn't go too well. It eventually went bust. But when I started again, which was the next week to work, after going through the courts and carrying on designing. People used to say, like, well, designers are probably excited, gone bust, what are you going to do now? And it's like, I don't know, I think I'll be a baker. And it's like, what do you think I'm going to do, you know? But anyway, after everything was paid off and, you know, we carried on. I kind of got to the point where I was kind of quite scarred by the fact that kind of I take my eye off the ball and at a studio of 25 people with account execs and account managers and art directors and things and I just thought fuck off you know it's difficult for it to be all about me when there's 25 people And I think the reality is that because of the vision and, you know, turnover of staff, et cetera, et cetera, you know, that I realized that, you know, I couldn't step back really. as much as I wanted to. When it was like, you know, the 90s, when Mike was there and Matt Pike and everything, you know, it was coming down from me and then getting them to sort of work to their best ability doing what they wanted to do along the lines of what, you know, so I kind of get the brief, filter the brief through to them, you know, and then they do their work, their magic on it. But now, so it's more... I don't know, it's because it's smaller. It kind of is more about my creative direction or art direction rather than I don't really want to get a studio full of people going off and doing their own thing. I want them to, you know, flex their creative muscle and juices and all that sort of thing, you know, based on the things that I want us to do. You still do hands-on design yourself? Yeah, all the time. So what would we have seen recently that has been mainly your stuff, your own work? All the Ortega stuff, you know, no one gets to touch Ortega. it's a question of degree so if you think about the t-shirts that we've just done with Bleep that sold out in five minutes thank you ladies and gentlemen but anyway so it's my idea to do that and for the reasons why etc etc scheme of things but hands-on i didn't do that because i've got someone that works with me that can glitch things better so again it's like how much i don't sort of feel that that being hands-on Is that big a deal? Unless you're into the craft of something. But Damien Hirst doesn't paint every spot himself and all those sorts of things. I'm like, same. sort of level but you know you don't i so for me my interest is in the idea and the reason why the problem solving you know and and if somebody can can do that better in the same way that i don't do a photo shoot myself because i know people can take a better photo than me to my direction so so the hands-on thing you know i quite i you know i do enjoy doing it but If there was a situation where I could literally just like, you know, have a group of people sat around and I just kind of went around saying, OK, I can now can you move that? Oh, I'm not sure about that. Can you do this? There's no value per se for me in the hands on thing. I just quite like doing it. I quite like farting about doing fonts. you know and that sort of thing you know so so again right right from the beginning i i do it because i wanted to do it and because i enjoy doing it and because i can't sleep you know so i kind of just sit up late nights doing stuff mainly design but you know With artists like Ortega and Richard, how much involvement do they have in the work in terms of, do they treat you like a collaborator? They let you do your thing? Or are they very specific about references or a direction? I mean, artists you've worked with for a long time. Yeah, I mean, I think the beauty is that every creative relationship is different. Just like, you know, when we're doing stuff with Coca-Cola and people say, what's it like working with Coca-Cola? I mean, I don't know. I know what it's like working with James or with Craig or Rafa. You know, I know... that relationship and i know that they're kind of guided by company things what they need to do but i mean you don't you don't kind of go and stand outside you know coke towers in atlanta and engage you know full frontally with like an organization or something and i think that then the same thing kind of goes down so that nearly every relationship that we have creatively and and and you know especially the ones that have lasted a long time you know they're different and you know so that the relationship with Ortega I would sort of say is that they trust me to do what I think should be done based on, you know, quite a lot of phone conversations and email exchanges. And so the main, the way that I tend to work is that I'm not really influenced by the music. I'm influenced by the reason behind why that music was made. So an all-tech, an all-tech. cover isn't my interpretation of the music on the album. It's based on an interpretation or it's based on creating something, some art in parallel with their art. And I don't really, so quite often we don't even listen to an album. before we design it, because I'm actually more interested in talking to the artist about what they see and why they made it and what their influences were. And then you find some kind of common ground that you can use as a starting point to go in on your own, you know, odyssey. So... You listen to it eventually. Yeah, yeah, usually. Ortega I do, because I like it. But there are some things that I don't need to like it, you know. Seriously, you don't need to like something to work on it? I need to understand it. I don't need to, I don't need to. It's not about, for me, it's not about my response. to the thing it's about me understanding what it is that they're trying to achieve and if i find some common ground in you know the understanding so we did a lot we've done a lot of work in the last 10 years with uh the Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon you know and and we started working with them because we rebranded their music department department It's a classical music department, you know, and I understand. So I understand what it is that they want to achieve. I understand their audience and what their audience, you know, wants from any visual communication. So you understand all the kind of the parameters and, you know, the elements involved. And if you can make something work that connects the client to their audience and enjoy doing it and be happy with what you've done, then that's fine. I don't, I didn't suddenly like... It's very different than music though. It's very different than a... understand doing a not that's a corporate project but a project like that well it's classical music you know which i mean i you know i'd never really kind of paid much attention to or you know an opera but then you understand you understand you start to kind of look into what the audience is and and the and the culture around it and that's what interests me much more than the music you know so the so the idea of ortega is far more of an influence for me than what it sounds like. I mean, I always remember this band, Person to Person, that you invested heavily in as a young... Only because I was a fan of ABC and the drummer from ABC was in the band. Well, there you go. I didn't like the track. I actually bought it for the cover. I don't want to give you a big head, but... But I remember I was the manager and we got like some video treatments in. There was a track called 4am. And I think the opening lines is something like, you know, it's 4am. I smoke another cigarette. And back in those days, but I swung as 4am. I smoke another cigarette, a light goes out in a building on the other side of town or something, and this treatment came in. And they said, right, OK, this singer's going to be sort of sitting by a window. And we pan around and there's a big clock and it's 4am. And he's smoking his cigarette. And then we pan and look out through the window and there's a light goes out in the building on the other side of the street. And he's just like, oh, God, hopefully they didn't get any more work. But, you know, but but, you know, that that very literal thing, you know, and so and again, because I'm. I think for the right reasons, I'm more interested in what I do than what anybody else does. Then I work best with artists where there's a sort of an existing synergy. I'm more interested in what I do than what other people do. But in terms of the client or in terms of other people around you? Any. If someone comes to you, an artist, and so they've got this album, I've put five years on my... life into it um i really want you to do the artwork for it do you not connect with that but you connect with what the person's interested in where they're coming i connect with them i understand them and i'm and i try to understand the audience and and how that five-year project is best communicated but i don't need to listen to that listen to it i work in a totally different way i couldn't work on anything i didn't like i've never been able to i mean each to their own it's not yeah i mean i prefer it if i like it and it tends to be that kind of if you if you have a connection with those people then they're going to be people who are going to make music that you like anyway by default so i mean it's not that kind of thing where you know i think i once said in an interview that the client is always wrong and has just been like right sort of thrown back at me and you know and and but the reality is is that client is is i assume the client is wrong because i need to think what it is that they really want me to do and understand that clients aren't necessarily predisposed to be great visual communicators or understand so it's It's about not being a good soldier that just does, oh, you know, can you design me a brochure? I'm like, why do you want a brochure? Maybe you might be better off with a website or something else. So it's digging down to understand, and I like digging into sort of... people I'm working with, you know, digging down into their ideas and what they're about. Again, in the Kickstarter, I think Adrian probably wrote this. Oh, no, you said this, actually. It said 30 years of work pushing at the cutting edge about you. Do you think a man in his 50s is capable of that anymore? I mean, I question myself. Can you still be at the cutting edge at our age? I think... And is relevance even important anymore? I think you have to keep challenging yourself. And I don't mean that thing where you, I'm going to challenge myself and it's about, you know, kind of, you know, pushing and pushing. I just think that kind of, if there isn't a challenge and there isn't... some intellectual engagement in what I'm doing I might as well not do it you know that that's that's kind of what drives me I don't know what the cutting edge is really it's just sort of one of those things that you say that helps sell a book isn't it really I don't I don't really know what the cutting edge is it's just my my instinct is to do something that that maybe isn't the obvious thing. So when, if you're designing a record cover, then the last thing in my mind is designing a record cover. It's always about coming up with an idea that you can then, that you could put on a record cover, but you could put it on a t-shirt, you put it on a poster, you know, you can make a quilt if you wanted, you know, it's whatever's relevant. So I think that the idea of doing things differently, I mean, it doesn't, I'm not, the important when I say, you know, it's about me, if it's different for me, if it's a new experience for me or a rich experience for me, then I think I can do a better job for somebody. you know and i think that's so in that sense i don't you know my cutting edge might be a million miles away from somebody else's but it's about you know that the idea of drawing a line in the sand wherever you draw it it's it's down to you but i think it's important that you do draw one you know in terms of people saying what kind of clients would you work for you know would you turn down certain work and all those kind of things I would. It's not necessarily, you know, open for discussion. It's the fact that kind of you do draw a line and there are certain things that you do, certain things that you don't, certain things that you want to do. So, I mean, I might do, I mean, there are certain things, I mean, I can't remember specifics, widescreen memory, but there are certain things that I know that I've done that I've thought are, you know, I'm really pleased with that. I've achieved something. I've done more than I thought. And then someone else comes along and says, oh, it just looks like, looks like tomato. It looks like something else, you know, and you think, I'm not really interested because I wasn't trying to. When you talk about the competition, I wasn't trying to be more cutting edge than them. I'm just trying to push me. And the only reason I'm trying to push me is because otherwise I'd just be really low boredom threshold. One last question. Kind of two parts to it. Two things that you love that I hate. Potbelly itself and football. So convince me to like them in a few minutes. Football I don't get. I grew up in a football-loving family. Spurs, maybe it's because they're Tottenham. And I hated it, and I went the opposite direction. Pop will eat itself. For me, at the time, I was doing record sleeves for Eric B and Rakim, American rappers, and the last thing I wanted to hear was a bunch of white guys from, I don't know where they were from, Stourbridge. Couldn't listen to it, still can't. I mean I've given up trying to convince people of whether they should like the problem. I understand why people like it. Yeah. So, I mean, I think for me, again, it was, we had a good relationship. We had a good laugh. You know, we used to have a thing where a typical briefing, they say, oh, we've got a new single coming out. Can you come down to Birmingham? You know, and then like four days later with a really bad hangover, I'd kind of head back to Sheffield. And like we might have talked about, I can only ever remember one bit of direction from them really. And that was, I think like two days into like, you know. as a full-on, you know, bender. It was just like, oh, we quite like it to be red, yellow and green this time. I don't, I do, I like pop really. So I'll tell you what I liked about pop really itself. And I think that kind of, this is where we kind of differ, the purity of American hip hop and that, you know, purity for me is just like the worst. You know, I don't want pure things. I think I want things. Authenticity is different than purity, I think. Well, yeah, but I mean, but then I don't know about authenticity. You know, it's like. you can't get more authentic than pot will eat itself in the context of pot will eat itself. Do you know what I mean? So it's, it's that, so what I like, and I liked, you know, it was, it was the same thing that, you know, with Zig Zig Sputnik that I like them. Yeah. But, but people that I used to, the band, the band that used to manage a lot of musos and they were just guys disgracefully, they're just like dressed up why couldn't you be like that? You know? And, and so, so it's probably, I'd like, I like anything that this kind of, um, that's mashed up. That's a kind of mongrel sort of thing. And sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, you know, but I, I just, you know, it's a silly question. I never even expected you to answer it. So I'm really happy. But, but I get the same, you know, in working with. you know, with, you know, like it's people that are, they only listen to techno or they only listen to sort of minimal house or, you know, I'm just like, just listen to everything. And, you know, just, I like the fact that. everything's kind of mixed up and or should be mixed up you know i mean i'm not making like you know big kind of like political things like you know sort of you know everything's mixed up kind of culturally and racially but i just i just don't get the idea of why you'd want so why why i mean for me why you want something to be pure it just seems a bit dull and i've have i get that what if you mix it with something else and what if you do that and so a lot of it and again I mean, I don't know how much it comes out in the work, really, but I mean, it's... And that's why I like Pop Bleeds itself, just because it was a kind of a fuck-off attitude and, you know, we're going to mix all this, we're going to do this, that and the other. And football is like, I don't, you know... It's the social thing. It's the, it's the, it was the kind of the semi-religious thing of like, so every Saturday we used to have to, we used to go like to the same pub, you know, and then you'd have to have three pints because if you had two or four, that might impact. packed on the result you know and the whole Nick Hornby thing of like you know you get in the pie foil and you had to fold it up and you had to fold it in a certain way and put it in your left pocket you know and if and you know and if Sheffield Wednesday lost which they kind of did quite a lot then at least it wasn't your fault whereas like if you'd have put it in your right backhand pocket it would have been your fault so there was and there was a there's a there was a When Wednesday were playing away, you know, I didn't really know what to do on a Saturday. I mean, now I've got kids, I, you know, I... I know what to do. But then I just didn't really know what to do. You know, so there was a whole thing that I don't know. I honestly don't know if I really like football. Do you love it? I love the whole thing around it. The ritual of it. The ritual of it. You know, I mean, I mean, it was always like good for, you know, nice for a good chat, you know, and going for a few beers. And then, and then, and then forum and then sort of you know and then just drink until you couldn't anymore um but that and but that was like ritual i mean watching football on tv i'm just like you know and especially like with friends of mine who never really go to a match but they'll talk about the tactics and it's like it's a bit like the kerning and leading kind of thing shut up you know i mean it's like i'm not really interested you know but yeah but yeah so so football yeah i do like football but it's but the the reason i sort of talk about it more is is again it's that social connection it's understanding why people do what they do and why they think what they think you know and it's it's so it's a similar thing like the whole consumerist thing where i'm i kind of i'm not saying I've never done this. But, you know, why people spend their spare time going shopping when they're not really looking to buy anything? What are you going to do on Saturday? I think I'll have a look around the shops. What for? Oh, nothing really. I'll just look around the shops. Fucking hell. Bye. Thank you. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ so Thank you.
