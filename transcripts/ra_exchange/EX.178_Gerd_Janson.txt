Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Gerd Janssen is a man of many trades. At various times over the course of his career, he's been a music journalist, a top-flight DJ, and the proprietor of one of dance music's best labels. Whatever hat he's wearing, though, it's always in the service of a deep-seated love for club music. and the culture surrounding it. Even as his profile has risen over the last few years, he continues to bring that passion to Running Back's releases, his DJ sets, and productions with his group Tough City Kids. Based outside of Frankfurt, Jansen swings through Berlin often to play, and on a recent jaunt, we had him by our office to talk about writing, reissues, and the funny name he almost gave Running Back. So you're known as a label owner a music journalist, a DJ, also known as a producer now. I'm curious which one of these came first and why you think that was sort of your way into the music. I think that would have to be a music journalist, like, and which kind of just came from the fact. that I've been going out to clubs and been interested in music from kind of an early age on. And that's why I have to cringe when I hear the term producer, as you would say with an American accent. I'm not really a musical person, I think, so I would never call myself a producer. Those are other people, I think. But I make music sometimes with other people. Yeah, but the music journalist thing came first because of that thing that I thought, you're not really musical, so you can't play an instrument. And that was in the 90s. So there wasn't the laptop kind of, oh, everyone can make music really easy. It was more like you had to at least buy a sampler or some sort of equipment. And I thought, oh, this is too complicated. I'm stupid. But the only thing I ever was kind of half good at it was like writing about things. So I thought this could be interesting. And of course, I thought, oh, yeah, I get all this. Back then it was, I mean, I think the internet was already invented. But it wasn't widely used. So it was also a bit like, oh, yeah, I get records and CDs for free. And I think I have to, I even, I did like a kind of internship at a local newspaper just to, you know, to see how actually a journalist, what the day-to-day thing is that you do as a journalist. But I also kind of applied. to a music magazine that I always read and it's still there, Groove Magazine, and I looked up to those guys working for that. they called me back. So that's how it started. That's how it all got started. You said that you'd been into music from a very early age. When did you get into club music? Was that some of the first music that you were into? No, I've been listening to other stuff before club music. And I can't really tell what kind of... attracted me to it because it was purely from an uh yeah I was a kid I mean I was like 12 or 13 and it was actually on a boy on a boy scout trip to the mountains that like the, I don't know what the English term is, but like the chief boy scout, I mean the head of our group, he was like, I think in his early 20s and he was going out, you know, he was a student and he was going out to clubs in Frankfurt and Mannheim and where else where I'm from. And he had like, I think he had a club night. tape with him and it i think it was yeah it must have been sven fed and there was he was like playing it to us in the vw volkswagen kind of van and i and i thought oh this is really cool but without having ever set up a foot in a in a club yeah i don't know it's just something And I always, I think I've told that before in another interview, but I still remember one of the tracks on the tape and it was total confusion by a homeboy, a hippie and a funky dread and it kind of had everything. I kind of... it's it's trans hip house whatever yeah so when you grew up in frankfurt yeah yeah i grew up on the outskirts sure like my understanding is like at that time dance music was sort of everywhere in frankfurt it was like quite a big style of music then i mean you had sven faith with his club I mean, was it in the air? Did you get a sense of that? I think you could argue that it was in the air in that sense that, I mean, there is this other German big name DJ from the 90s, Westbam, and he always argued like, ah. this whole DJ techno culture thing now it's the end of rock music and the rock star and the pop star but if I think back to those times when I was still going to the gymnasium which is not like something where you work out but which is like the sort of high school in Germany and you were like on the on the schoolyard people were talking about Sven Fede you know like the older pupils they always went to the omen and oh yeah here's this tape they were trading tapes and Sven Fede was already a kind of mysterious figure or name back then you know so it it that's why i i think it was with some djs from a very early stage on there was this pop star quality about it and that's why i think it's fair to say that it was also in the air in that area you know because there were There was literally every night a club where you could go to, like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. And it was not always in Frankfurt, but sometimes you had to go to Heidelberg or to Mannheim. And because I was living kind of in the middle of all of those places and I always had all the friends and they went to... Yeah, you started going out, you know, and you had to sneak in. to certain kind of clubs and yeah so i think it's fair to say that i don't people tend to always paint the past in brighter colors you know but i i think it's fair to say that it was much more um yeah spread i don't know if if like kids my age back then now living there are still looking to those to to Robert Johnson Offenbach I don't think so you know but but back then for us it was like the the big thing and also it was still the like in the early 90s it was still the fade out phase of all those 80s youth culture things you know where you were like really proud to be a mod or a ted or you know, or a skate kid, and you had all those coats, the clothes you wore, the music you listened to, you know. What's funny is that a lot of those kids, you know, they might not be looking to Robert Johnson or something, but a lot of them who are maybe still getting into this from an early stage might still be looking to Sven Veith. He remains extremely influential. Yeah. I'm not sure if he's still that influential in our area, so to speak, because, you know, there is not like the omen. And what made him so influential was that he was there almost any given Friday, you know, and the main man playing there. So you traveled there and from there on, like this huge following grow. Yeah, I think it's at least fair to say that people might look more towards him than to Robert Johnson if they're young. Sure. Do you remember the first time that you actually heard the music in a club or the first few times? Yeah, I remember the first few times. I think the very first time I actually went to a... A so-built techno party. It was in a... What is the English word for Hallenbad? It was like an indoor swimming pool that had like a wave indoor swimming pool kind of thing, you know, where you went to if you wanted to have a taste of... the ocean and it was a friday night thing and i i still remember the djs who were playing there it was dj ufuk who was like in a local kind of guy in in in darmstadt that that kind of indoor swimming pool was near darmstadt and then there was a live act by a group called komakino they had like few minor hits in the early 90s and they came they came from that from another kind of world in Frankfurt from the club Dorian Gray and Tala 2XLC who's like yeah that he always claims to be the one of the inventors of that word techno he used to do a club called techno club which but that stemmed more from that kind of electronic body music thing yeah and that was the first dedicated techno party I went to and I remember it was a Friday because we still had school on Saturday mornings and my mom actually drove me there and picked me up from there and I think it must have been around a time where Speedy J's pull over was really big because I I think and that what was the other one something for your mind because I in my in my mind somehow that stuff was being played there yeah And then I think the very first real club I went to was also on the outskirts between, yeah, near Mannheim. And it was kind of in an industry area. And people used to go there before they went to go to the Omen on a Friday night. So you went to, the club was called Riff. So you went to go there for a few hours and then at four in the morning you made the way to Frankfurt, go to the Omen. And I remember the guy who took us there and I thought, oh, he's really cool. You know, he had this like green Alpine car radio thing. yeah, okay, guys, I can drop you off at the Riff, but I can't take you home because I have to go to the Omen. And I thought, oh, this is crazy. He's making, you know, that trip to the club. Yeah. I mean, you'd been listening to this music since your Boy Scout days or whatever. And there was some gap between when you first heard it and when you heard it in a club. I mean, how did that experience? sort of stack up maybe to the one that was bouncing around in your mind about what it's like to hear this music out yeah i mean i know what you're aiming at um you know like this this being in a kind of isolation hearing the music on the radio or from tapes and then imagine what people do in in a club to it but that gap wasn't too big you know like from From me hearing that in a VW van, you know, to actually going to the first party, that must have been like a few months only, you know. Like I think the first time I was in a club, I was 14 or something like that. And there was another influential thing, which was just a radio show by a guy called Klaus Walter. And he used to play every Monday night from nine till ten. He was a bit like, or he is still a bit, but back then he definitely was a bit like the German John Peel. And he played Buju Banten next to... the pixies and to the new tresor detroit techno soul compilation so i was i took pride in having this wide range of musical taste you know and dance music was just one thing but kind of took over. I just really enjoyed going to the parties. That was just great fun. Also the first raves you went to in like an industry area and if you're young, I mean, this is like really exciting. You said that you are not particularly musical, but you were always very into music and that music journalism or just using your... ability to write seemed like maybe the best way to interact with it. Tell me about some of your early forays into music journalism. I think that goes back to that application thing. That was actually the first time I wrote about music and they wanted... an Arbeitsprobe you know which means like an example of your work and and I was like I don't have any work and then they were like yeah then just take a record you like and write a kind of review about it so I think it was like a guidance records from Chicago they were just appearing back then and I really liked them so I wrote like kind of a really strange what I thought would be a good review of that record and then they kind of it didn't happen straight away that I wrote this review and they were like yeah you're so talented or your writing is so great it must have been pretty but A few weeks later, they asked me or a few months later, they asked me, why don't you try again and write an event review, which became really popular later on with Resident Advisor, right? You do these event reviews. And I think it was kind of a hip hop thing with DJ Spinner and some people from Rawcast. So that was the first thing. bitching about what I liked or what I didn't like about that kind of concert slash party thing and from then you know you got those small little I think the first kind of real interview I did That got me nervous was DJ Spinner again in Cologne. And we did this boombox kind of thing where you play records. I think we even recorded the records onto a tape and played it from that boombox to him. And he shared his knowledge. Did you pick the records out? Yeah, we picked them out. Oh, you picked them out together. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I remember, like, I can't remember now every record. Of course, it was some back then obvious stuff like ABB Records, which is also like a hip hop label from the West Coast in the States, which is kind of the West Coast version of Raucous. records and we picked stuff like that where we thought oh he might know it or he has to say something about it but then we also there was a Maus & Stolle I don't know if you're familiar with Maus & Stolle it was a project on Playhouse and Klang And there was a new record out back then. And we thought, OK, he's also doing kind of house stuff. So we play him this. And I remember that he really liked that record. And we were surprised that he did because it's kind of, you know, you have these cliches. OK, he's a hip hop guy from the US and he sometimes DJs dance music. So he only likes the quote unquote soulful stuff. But he was really attracted. Yeah, somebody who prided himself on having eclectic taste. It must have been nice to see that in an interview subject. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, right. I thought back then already that I have eclectic taste. So yeah. And yeah, that was nice to see that it's not always that kind of. pitch and hold when it comes to to djs and producers yeah and from then on i mean i can't even tell you how many interviews i did or articles i wrote so for Specs and Groove magazine. And yeah. Yeah. You said that Groove had, had been a magazine that you had, you had always been reading. And I would imagine, you know, when, when you're first starting out, you're probably looking to some sort of example where, where there, um, were there music journalists who you really looked up to? Yeah. I mean, there, there, I, I think it's fair to say two guys. I think both of them also did RA exchanges. Actually, the one guy is Hans Nieswand. And he's also a DJ and a producer. He was part of that Whirlpool Productions thing. But he... used to write a column for Specs magazine called Sirius and later on Whirlpool, I think, or the other way around, where he kind of reviewed dance or house 12 inches. So he was the kind of an intellectual house DJ type of guy. But in his, the way he wrote was a bit like... if a German tries to talk really funky, you know, where it's German, but you kind of mix in words like dope or ill, you know, but it was funny to read. And he's a really smart guy, you know, so I think he was the one guy. I liked that he... Said smart things with simple words. And another writer who can be very cryptic is Thorsten Schmitt, who now is like the head of, together with Mania Mary, of Yadastar. And they run the Red Bull Music Academy thing, you know. And he was kind of... his way of writing was a bit more elaborated. And he translates his person into the writing, which I never tried to do. But I think to a certain extent, you always, you are there as the first person narrator, even if it's not the first person that tells the thing. But yeah, I tried to be... Yeah, I was going to ask, you know, if you have a sense of sort of what your voice is as a music journalist, like what you try to go for, what you sort of try to impart. I mean, it's always hard to analyze yourself. I think I would I at one point I thought about it like this, that you have to, of course, people, people who read something, an article or a review, they want an opinion. you know, but I think you should always base that opinion on a certain set of rules, whatever those rules may be, you know, and I always try to not always have my own taste dictate the outcome of the review, you know, I mean, there are... certain records i don't like or i think are shit you know but you have to pay um just for my own taste but i think you have to pay attention to the fact if that record if it's made in a certain way or has an impact in a certain way, might change certain things or touch a lot of people. So you have to take that into account, not necessarily meaning you write, oh, yeah, this is really great. But to have, you know, to kind of. maybe to exemplify it with that ongoing garage or jersey house thing you know you you could easily be the guy oh yeah I was there when that was around the first time and but the records back then were way better but I think you know if you write about that's just how it is it goes in circles Stuff gets recycled and you should kind of just say, is this a good carbon copy or a bad carbon copy of something? Well, it's also, you know, music was something that you were covering. It's sort of this whole world. And there are sometimes things that are interesting about music that aren't whether it's good or not, right? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Yeah. And of course you can... This goes back to, I don't know, to literature also, you know. Is there something the author wants to say or is that even important what the author wants to say or is it just important what the reader or in our case the listener kind of... thinks about it, you know, and even if the author says, this book is not about the Second World War, if I think it's about the Second World War, then fair enough, you know, or if he makes references to this or that, you know, there's... There is another German author and writer and sometimes DJ Thomas Meinecke. I think he works with Move D on radio plays and stuff like that. And I really like him, but I'm sometimes amazed at the fact what he detects in certain records coming from certain places, you know. And I always think, I met these guys. It's not like that. you know but then it's his point of view and his opinion and he's yeah he's very good in in stating it you know so who am I to say that it's not true or even the creator of that record you know like if you if you have a certain interpretation of something and and the interpretation in itself is kind of working then yeah fair enough I wonder if at a certain point you sort of felt a desire to work more closely with the music like instead of just being a um an observer of it you thought man i'd really like to kind of get my hands dirty in this maybe maybe that led to wanting to start the label yeah i mean that's also another cliche right if you're a i mean you're a music journalist so um yourself so that there's this cliche or it's also about like book critics you know that they actually, all they want to do is to write the great American novel themselves, you know? So all they do is kind of talk bad about the people doing it, you know? There's even this idiom thing, like, with teach and do, I can't put it together now. in the American language, those who can do and those who can't teach or something like that. And so I think it's, yeah, this is this cliche that you, if you're a critic of something, you always, you actually think I could do this better, which I don't. as with most things I've been doing, I'm not sure if I made it by design or if I had this dream that had to be fulfilled at one point. It was more about like... in a very romantic do-it-yourself kind of thinking. So, oh, could I do this as well? Would this work? I mean, running a label and being a music journalist is not that far from each other. But in my case, DJing actually came first. I've been just collecting records and writing about them and dancing to them. And then at one point, I just got asked, hey, do you want to come and DJ? And I thought, okay, I might as well try. Of course, I actually, together with my brother, I bought a pair of decks at one point from the money I got from the civil service. If you do the civil service in Germany and you finish it, you get like a gratification payoff. And instead of buying an electric guitar, we... or a mountain bike, we bought like a pair of decks and a mixer. And so I kind of tried to teach myself how to actually do that. So when you finally did start DJing, you had been collecting records for ages. I mean, listening to music for quite a long time. going out dancing for kind of a long time too. So, I mean, was that a lot of, did you feel like a lot of pressure or something? No, not at all. Because I, you know, I was starting to be a student at the University of Heidelberg. So for me, it was not, I didn't pick this up. in a way, oh yeah, now I have to make a living out of it or I really want to, my dream is to play next to Sven Federt at the Omen or whatever. It was just, hey, my brother wants to buy a pair of decks, I would like to have one and just to see if I can manage to actually hold two records together, you know? It was more... kind of a juvenile hey have fun thing and I would have never um but I never really did a promotional tape or anything like that it was just like that I've got asked hey do you want to DJ because it was it it was actually a guy I still DJ with Thomas Hammann who had a record shop in Darmstadt and he just saw that me and like my brother and some close friends who were coming every week, sometimes twice a week when the new records arrived, you know, and yeah, and he liked what we bought at his shop. So that's when he asked that one point. What was it like being suddenly like on the other side of the booth? Like now you're in the booth. when you had spent quite a lot of nights, you know, looking into the booth? Oh, yeah, I was, of course, really nervous. Even if I back then, I remember I started that kind of night at the Kesselhaus in Darmstadt, but I wasn't really able to beat match. So I was more thinking, oh, how could I kind of get away with like, and I played the beginning and kind of a more... Yeah, music, you can not a straight house set or anything like that. More like music. I kind of connected in my head together. But yeah, it was just from then on, it was like kind of a learning experience. The next person asked if you would like to play, you kind of practice some more and you learn or you don't, you know. And I think it was. For me, DJs were, even if I didn't look up to them like pop stars, I looked up to them as I would say you look up to a band. You know, like I remember I had the first records Theo Parrish did and he came to Frankfurt to DJ at the Wild Pitch Club, which was Atta's club before he opened Robert Johnson. And we were like, oh, yeah, the records are great, but can he really DJ? And yeah, back then that night he could. So that's how I picked sometimes the nights to go to that I wanted to hear a certain DJ because he represented a certain club or a certain record label or something like that. So that's how I looked up to it. there wasn't a resident advisor yet or you had like those fan scenes and magazines writing about it. But I think it wasn't a career you decided for yet, you know, back then. So it was more just another thing I did next to the writing and studying. And of course, I also had to work other jobs to make money, you know. So in the absence of that sort of, you know, very specific, like dance music press, you know, something like Resident Advisor, how were you finding out about these DJs that you looked up to? Was it just from records that you bought from nights out? Yeah, I mean, you were, yeah, you were, you were looking at the labels of the record. you bought you know and you were you were reading them like you read the manual like what city is this from and then there is this fax number and what what people I mean I even looked at the shout outs you know what people get a shout out on a Rick Wade Harmony Park record and then you looked for those names in the record band and of course you had like a music press you know but I think it wasn't as quick and as intermediate and as kind of glorified or glorious as it is these days, you know, which is actually, I think it's a good thing, you know, because you, certain little producers, labels, artists can very quickly reach a big audience if they do good stuff. So this is, this is a big advantage to. maybe 15, 20 years ago, where you had to build a body of work to get noticed, you know, unless you had this one time lucky shot. Do you see a kind of connection between being a critic and being a DJ? Is that kind of the selections, like the things that you play? Is it a form of criticism for you in a way? I mean, you could argue it is because in both occupations, if I might want to call it like that, you make a choice or a selection and you or maybe even. Yeah, you try to say something, but I would never, you know, I would never play a record I don't like. Whereas I kind of had to write reviews about records I didn't like. And I never was a big fan of the, it was in German, we call it Autoren DJing, you know, like author DJing, like where you have like, oh, this is my concept for the night. I'm only going to play records made. between 1990 and 1993 in East Orange, New Jersey, or it will be strictly rhythm records only. So I think... Yeah, if you do that, you know, you have something in your head, a concept, and you come and you DJ that concept. And I think as a DJ, at least the DJs, I always thoroughly enjoy it. I mean, I can be a fan as well, you know, if I want to go and see, I don't know, Mike Huckabee doing his Sun Ra tape kind of thing. that's out of the rule you know like that's of course if you go there and it's Mike Huckabee doing Sun Ra from a reel to reel then I'm not complaining that he didn't play his latest record on Tresor you know But when I, I think when I DJ, I just try to see, oh, what club is it and what kind of people are there and what's the music before me and after me maybe. And then you make choices right there on the spot based on that context. Unless someone asks me to specifically do vinyl only DJ set or, you know, like. all those crazy kind of things people have in their heads now but so I think as similar as both things are to each other or can be next to each other I think you should I'm not saying you should be dumb to be a DJ but I think you should leave a lot more thinking out of it than when you write about it. Right. It's a feeling. It's not some kind of, it doesn't have to be some sort of intellectual pursuit. That would be the, I have a hard time talking about feelings, you know, but yeah, that would be, I think the easiest thing to say about it. You should. although it's such a, ah, yeah, I feel it. But yeah, I think it should be a more unintentional kind of way or a more impromptu way of working than writing, you know? You said that the idea to start a label or that the urge to start a label kind of came out of being a DJ. So what was it that kind of planted the seed for running back? um i i think i i said that i that i thought it's not that difficult to uh not that different to being a writer you know like to kind of put something now we have the context again to put something in order and you know like package something um but the actual i remember the the actual like the the the the idea of really starting a label came out of me having half a year off at university and my friend Thorsten Schoi, who used to produce for labels like Klang and Stir 15 as Glance or Zero. And he was making, his love was really like that kind of Jersey house or what the Basement Boys were doing. And that wasn't... Don't know if it was ever really popular in Germany, but it surely wasn't popular back then. And he kind of made this a bit over the top vocal house record. And I thought, yeah, we'll put it out. And the idea that I had back then was. I mean the record got reissued now like 12 years later was there was this Nathaniel X record on Music Station that I really liked and I thought oh this would be great to have that available again you know so it came from a kind of collector's music journalist mind to start. that label and also not only torsten but other friends in my area back then they were making music and i thought so this could be a good idea to have a label that kind of sometimes reissues stuff but also puts out records by friends you know This could be a really stupid question. There are no stupid questions. Well, that's always good to hear. But I've always been curious about the name running back, like how a German guy comes up with a title that for me is an American football reference. Maybe I'm getting this mixed up. No, it's an American football reference. But I mean, I was a student of American studies back then. The name actually comes from, if it would have been for me, I would have called it maybe Penguin Records. And this is not a joke because I like penguins and I thought it would make a great label. But then you have Penguin Books and then, you know, Modern Classics. So that was out of the question. And Thorsten really thought I'm stupid to have a pingo in, you know. on a label would have been a vastly different aesthetic yeah it would have been and and then thomas hammann who you know is maybe like the guy who is unintentionally responsible for everything i did after a certain point um he came up with the name and he used to play american football you know like I think kind of successful as you can, as successful as you can be in like Germany playing American football. But yeah, and I thought, yeah, this is a nice thing. You have this football reference and what the running back does, you know, and then, but it also could be back then I was. like I said, like really, yeah, we reissue stuff as well, you know, so you run back to a certain point in time. And I like the ambiguity of it. So, and I, for the lack of a better name, you know. The label has really over the years managed to bring like a lot of different sounds and a lot of different aesthetics into the fold. I mean, for a lot of people starting a label, it's a way of like teasing out something very, very specific. And this doesn't seem like that kind of label. Was your idea to create something that was sort of as eclectic as your taste was? I don't know if that, like I said, like it started with like just a vocal house record and friends making music. So I didn't have a... a certain concept in a way where I thought, okay, this sound is really missing right now, or I really believe in this kind of sub sub genre and all I want to release and DJ and listen to and play and being associated with is that kind of sound. So there's nothing to say against that. I'm a huge fan of those kind of labels because as a customer or buyer, you always know what you will get. You know, it says what's on the tin most of the time for those labels. And I think I'm not expecting people to like every record or the same people to like every record that I put out, you know. But to me, I think... I mean, of course, like the great examples of those kind of labels with a concept, all those things, the basic channel guys were doing, but they had the sense or the nerve to put a stop hold or put, you know. to pull the stop sign out after a while or when they've, or maybe it's just, I don't know, you know, they don't do interviews that much. Yeah, well, with a label like Running Back, there isn't. as obvious an end date to it. It can kind of go on for a lot longer, maybe given how much work running a label is. Yeah, it can be kind of a lot of work or it just takes up a lot of time. To make it short, if I would be just into dub techno, and I love dub techno, but... But after a while, like, you know, every space echo runs out of tape. Or maybe my space echo runs out of tape and then what, you know. I had a friend who was always to me and I really like him. But when it came to his musical taste. He just liked hip hop. He didn't even, which is unusual for a hip hop guy, he didn't even like the sample sources for his hip hop records. He just liked the hip hop records. And he could go to clubs, but only if drum and bass was being played. And he went to house parties because he wanted to hang out with us. but he never could it was just you know like a guy eating pasta all the time and I love pasta but like all the time you know and I thought oh what and there came there was a point where he didn't like what was going on in hip-hop anymore so he I think he basically stopped listening to music at home at all you know and and I thought this can be this can be really boring and Yeah, so, and as you might can tell from me giving answers, I'm really confused mind. So, and I've... Well, I don't think you're ever going to run into that problem. Yeah, because I always jump on the next bandwagon that comes along. This is the other interpretation of what you could say about something like that, you know, but I hope that there is at least a kind of... a red or maybe pink line that goes through it you know yeah well there's i mean there are definitely some sort of very functional dance floor oriented records that come out on the label There are also, I sense kind of a fondness for hits on the label, for kind of big tunes, you know, like Gin Nation, In the End, I Want You to Cry, even like RJ, you know, by Radio Slave. There's sort of like, these are these anthemic tunes. You know, I wonder if that's something that you listen for. I think the only, no, not at all. I mean, like, of course, it would be like... I... when Matt Edwards alias or aka Radioslave showed me the RJ tune you know I was it wasn't that I thought oh yeah this would be really good to listen to at tea time you know I mean I would I knew this is like this might sound really good in a club but I never except for one time I never expected something to be as big as it became or you know or becoming a quote-unquote hit. The only time I knew this will be something a lot of people will like and buy was when Todd Terje Terje, asked me if I would like to put out Ragish because I had the demo version of this for almost one or two years. And every time I played it somewhere, like, and I knew that only maybe five people had this record, you know, and just friends of his. And you could see how people reacted to it that, yeah, it will go big. that there's not this kind of scanner in my mind where I scan stuff that I listen to and consider it to put it out with like, oh, will people buy this? Well, I didn't mean like necessarily. I guess I was saying like ear candy, you know, like, wow, this is going to be a big tune of the night or something like that. Not like in a sales. Yeah, you know, I didn't want to play the ball back in that way that I'm really underground. I don't want to sell records. Of course I want to sell records. I mean, artists want to sell records, you know. Yeah, I like ear candy. I think that's also with like DJing. Like I think that's true. Yeah. Reissues you mentioned were kind of the spark for the label or the ability to bring records back into circulation. Was there ever anything that you really wanted to release that you were unable to? Yeah, and this is not a plug, but it was Joanne's Garage Shelter. And that was kind of a... a little big record in Frankfurt, which means like DJs like Atta, Roman Flügel, even Ricardo Villalobos, they used to play it, but it wasn't of course like, the big records back then were something like Amad van Helden's Witch Doctor, you know, when I say big is something that gets played and everyone knows, but... That record was big in a way that you went to a certain kind of party with Atta, Roman Flügel, those kind of people. You could hear it there over and over again. And it was only on an Italian night. I think the Italian label was Night Stuff and it was a double pack and it was kind of hard to come by. And years later, I managed to get a copy. And then I always thought, oh, it would be nice to kind of reissue that record. And I think I even made the attempt. uh to contact jovan about it and but i still to this day i don't have a facebook account so i had to write him an email and it seems to me that a lot of u.s american people don't really check their emails anymore but they just do all the communication things via facebook so And that's what he actually told Thomas Wendell or Don Williams from Mojuba, who reissued that record, that, yeah, tell your friend he should get a Facebook account. Because he contacted him via Facebook. But in the end, we... Together with Philipp Lauer, we made a remix as Tough City Kids for it. You were able to get your hands on it. I was able to get my hands. Is that the first step when you're trying to reissue something that was maybe on a little tiny label by some guy who wasn't super well known outside of a very specific circle? Like, is that the first step to kind of try to make contact directly? For me, yeah. I mean, I think there, and this has always been part of, of reissue culture not only in like house or techno but in in i don't know that kind of rare groove scene or whatever you know whatever music you're interested in that stems back to days of yore that you either are this kind of truffle hunter, you know, and you know, okay, this record is really sought after, or you put a compilation together with a certain... theme and you package it or in my case i would say it has to have a personal connection in a way you know like the i think the the other two records i did reissue on on running back was like heaven and earth which is like a project by Luke Solomon and Saki D and Rob Mello and was a prescription underground record, but a weird one for prescription in a way because it had this more like disco loopish kind of thing and it was done by people from the UK, you know, so. um i i always really liked it and i had this promo copy with like the the um what is the copy printer thing what do you call it like the black and white photocopy scan of the label that's how they came back then you know like the artwork was photocopied and you could see okay this will it this is how it will look when it hits the shops and I used that for the cover of it as well, you know, or the other record was Pelo No Stunts, who is a friend of Prosumer. And I thought this is like the one chain reaction thing that, that I, I like all of them, but this is one of them I had like, yeah. Like a personal connection to the sound. A personal connection to the sound. And of course, he was only an arm's length away, you know, so those were the reasons. So I think if you're not a Discogs expert, you know, which is, of course, a great reason to reissue a record if the original copy is really expensive and you want to make it available to a wider public again. But just in my personal case, it has to have a certain personal connection for me, you know. Or it's something I really, really want myself and I just can get my hands on it, like that Japanese sound effect record. And when I ask the creators about it, if they can sell me a copy and they just reply. I know they're out of it, but they know that I do this label. And if I want to, I can put it out again. So that's how I did that one. Earlier, when I mentioned the word producer, you sort of shied away from it. Like you don't necessarily consider yourself a producer. You're kind of a guy who makes music with his friends sometimes. I mean, so tell me a little bit about that. Like, why would you say you're not a producer? Because someone like Morgan Geist or Maurice Fulton or Theo Parrish, who even crosses the line and is an overall artist, you know, those are people to me who have a very distinct sound, you know, and... yeah those are record producers for me like you you recognize them they have a certain style and they apply that to whatever they're doing you know and and i'm not even sure i mean i could maybe do a record in an edit way on my own, but, or a bad one. But, you know, I don't know if I could create something on my own from scratch, you know, that I would think is, I mean, it's of course always for other people to decide, but that I would feel good with, you know, and yeah, and I think. To call yourself a producer, you should either be a very technical person or a very musical person. And I think I'm none of that. So I'm not a producer. Have you found, though, that you're maybe more musical than you originally thought you were? I think I hear if something is out of tune, especially if I'm responsible for it and mix two records together that kind of yell. Back at each other. So, but yeah, so that's what I learned over the years. I know when it's wrong and when I'm wrong, but yeah, I still can't tell you the scales or, although I was. I think when I was 17, I had like music lessons at school where they teach you the basics and theories, but in a very dry way. So I forgot all I ever knew about it. I wanted to ask you about Robert Johnson, because this is a club where you've been playing for years and years. Very, very special place. I mean, is DJing there unlike DJing other places? Yeah, I think, and then we come back to the feeling now again. I think most places, if there are clubs that work on a regular basis, like they're open every weekend, and the architecture and their sound systems, maybe the people who go there, the music policy, all of that dictates a certain kind of atmosphere. And there are places, and Robert Johnson is one of them, where I think certain records, even if they're not made with that place in mind, where it's just, I hear those records and I think of that place. Like, that's where I would play them. That's where they would sound best and that's where they would feel best. Yeah, I think even if you're uninitiated, like when it comes to clubs, you know, like even I know people from who are, of course, who know what a discotheque is or even techno, but they come to Robert Johnson and it's not like they are baptized at first. side but they kind of I think subconsciously it has something that kind of drags you in you know and Plastic People in London is another place who has that kind of feeling you know like smaller intimate places where like big room stadium records just seem out of place you know so you can play all the b-sides in the right atmosphere So you're getting to the point now where you're DJing, you know, occasionally at festivals, bigger stages. Is it nice to get to go back to a room that's small where it can support those kind of intimate records? Does that feel like kind of central to you as a DJ? Yeah, I think it's central to kind of really get to know your records, you know, and to have the time to kind of, there are certain records that you just wouldn't never play in a two hour or one hour or one and a half hour kind of spot, you know, and. Yeah, there's like, for instance, the new Björn Torske record on Small Town Supersound, you know, where do you play that record? You know, like you're not going to hear that on a festival stage, but I really like to hear it loud. So I played in the first hours of Robert Johnson or in the last hour or something like that. And to me, I... I think basically I'm still a nerd and record collector. So that's important, you know, or for my own fun, you know, for the sake of my own fun. That's nice too. Don't try to be difficult for the sake of being difficult. But, you know, for me, and if I can play it there and people react to it in a way it is meant to be, then I'm happy. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you
