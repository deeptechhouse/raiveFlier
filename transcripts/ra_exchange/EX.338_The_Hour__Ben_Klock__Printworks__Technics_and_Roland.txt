You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour! This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. The Hour is RA's monthly blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. On today's show, we're going to be giving you a tour of Printworks, which is a massive new venue in London's Docklands area that's among the most impressive event spaces we've ever seen. Plus, RAE's tech editor Mark Smith will be talking to Peter Kern from Create Digital Music and the artist Dinky about the recent relaunches of classic gear from Roland and Technics. considering how these companies are handling the legacy of the gear that was so vital in the creation of dance music. First, we have a new short feature that we're beginning this month called Behind the Track. We're going to be asking artists to tell us the story behind tracks they made that went on to be classics. Ben Klock's Sub-Zero came out almost exactly eight years ago, and this was at a point in time where the dance music world was buzzing about a Berlin club called Berghein. My clock was a resident DJ. Stories of this wild place was circulating around the globe and Sub-Zero was thought of as a perfect example of the understated, yet incredibly powerful techno sound that was making the club famous. When I think of that track, I always remember that moment when my girlfriend at that time, like she came home and And I played it to her. She kind of looked at things from the outside and gave a really honest response like, hey, this is shit or, yeah, this is something. And when I played that to her, she was like, oh, my God, this is something. I was like, really? Yeah. And that second line that I just talked about, this second melody, I was like, yeah, I think it's cool too, but what do you think about this other melody on top? Is it too cheesy or is it just the right thing? And she was like, no, it has to be. So she helped me making that decision. ♪ ♪ Keys were always important to me because I used to play piano. So I did all the sequencing with playing them first and then looping them. The trick was actually that second line, which is like a third on top. You know, like this bass melody and then the other one which copies it on a parallel line on top. That was kind of the aha moment. That energy boost is actually, I think, also this sound which comes on top, this... Actually, a field recording, which is paper tearing apart a piece of paper, and with some filtering and... so it sounds big, but that thing on top actually makes really the energy after the break. But I do think that the sound system or the dance floor back then definitely had an influence, like the solo architecture and the sound just had an influence on how to produce tracks. You don't need so many elements or so. You know how it will sound there. So you can be quite minimalistic. you know, with the amount of sounds and stuff. I do remember like the first time playing it and realizing, yeah, like as expected, it is something kind of big, but it was... I mean, it's more like a grower. Like, you know, the more years passed, it kind of became bigger and bigger in a way for me because then it was just a track around my album. But then after... As time went by, this is the one that just stands out. Like I said, that's the one I'm always asked for. Maybe now when I play it, it's even much bigger than back then. With some tracks, you only know after some years if it's... what it really is or meant or if it stands for something for an era or something every event there are people um showing me their phone and and um yeah like that's the one word that's always written somewhere the beat uh is just it's kind of the the basis and if if you want to some yeah if you want to make something timeless or kind of uh something recognizable and all that what really lets people fly is is in the end the melody or who said that the beat is kind of the male aspect and then the melody is the female aspect on top and you always need the female aspect like to to fly this is the hour from resident I'm standing outside Printworks, a huge multi-purpose space in Canada Water in London's Stocklands area. It's a part of the city that's ripe for redevelopment, and that's exactly what's happening to the building behind me. A sprawling 16-acre space that was once a newspaper printing facility, churning out copies of the Evening Standard and the Metro. Some of this site is now going to be used to host parties, and these will be overseen by the promoter LWE. which stands for London Warehouse Events. It's good news for a club scene that seems to be entering 2017 with a kind of cautious optimism, with fabric reopening and a nightstar dedicated to stemming the tide of venue closures. I first visited Printworks in late 2016 and back then it was very much a work in progress. The site had recently hosted a secret cinema event for the film 28 Days Later and there was fake blood smeared on some of the walls. It's now January and the LWE crew are getting ready to hold their first party at the start of next month. I'm going to go inside now and speak to the three main people behind LWE, Alice Favre, Paul Jack and Will Harold, to get a tour of Printworks and see what they have planned. My name's Paul. I'm the Marketing Director at LWE and one of three owners, I guess. Between Me, Will and Alice started six, seven years ago. We first spent time sitting in an office above a pub in Chippersbush. Will was the bookings director for MATA before that closed. I was one of the promoters there. We became partners. As the venue closed, Will was looking for someone to play shows. I had access to warehouse spaces. And so between the two of us, we kind of concocted an idea of throwing events. Our first event was oddly a side chance one, Infected Mushroom, which moved from Matter to the Electric in Brixton, what was the fridge. And from that point on we decided we had a stellar career in throwing parties, not particularly well organised. But Alice here was part of the team from day dot really, she kind of helped build it and all the nuts and bolts. After the first event, it was the first event, I think Alice became a three-way partner with us. We launched our first real warehouse parties in a venue called Great Suffolk Street. Now, seven, seven and a half years. ago maybe. The first event we launched with was Eric Pritz. It was the first time really a headline artist like that would be moved into the warehouse kind of type of environment where they'd always usually kind of in a fixed venue space or a Brixton Academy or that kind of location. We just we thought the idea would be to move that across into a stripped back space. and to offer the ability to create a blank canvas for that artist. NLWE really has been a bit more of a kind of a kite mark or a seal of quality rather than totally standing for one genre. We've moved around bookings-wise as our tastes have changed and developed and I think that's something that we'll continue to do. We generally book things that we're finding exciting at the time and are current. We've taken a lot that we've learnt along the years out of those first formative steps at Great Suffolk Street and through to operating a space like Tobacco Dock. We really honed our craft there, I felt. and went from being mid-sized club promoters to being one of London's leaders in terms of electronic music and I think that's why we're sat here today at Printworks is that we've sort of proved ourselves in terms of... of how we operate in these unique spaces, and that's really become our sort of USP in terms of the operational side of things. And it does feel like we've reached this point kind of on a really interesting journey in that there's a lot of kind of chance and circumstance that we are here. And it was a really odd time when we kind of first got the go-ahead. We'd known about it for a while in terms of the project going ahead, but it wasn't public yet. We nearly lost the whole project with, at the time, the closure of Fabric. And that really unsettled a lot of people that were involved in the project. And was this the right thing to be doing? And that kind of thing. And so there's been all kinds of hurdles that we've had to overcome. But it's with a lot of luck and goodwill and stuff that we're here. here and I think it'll be something that's yeah it's exciting. Hello I'm Alice I'm operations director for LWE so I'm the one that's the kind of doer to the three of us I'm the one that actually makes their crazy ideas and turns them into some sort of reality and usually is the kind of pessimist out of all of us and the one saying no sorry that's not possible. So yeah, this is a walk-around tour of the print works in London. And this is to kind of tell you about how we're going to use the space and all the different aspects of what's going to be going on throughout the first series of events in here. What kind of stuff does it take to get a huge multi-purpose space like this up to scratch? There's a lot. A lot of different things to think about, mainly a lot of health and safety. It's definitely a challenge, but in some ways it's less hassle than it would be opening an actual club because you're not putting any permanent infrastructure in and you try to make it. a blank canvas space. It means that so long as you make everything safe and you think about the lighting, the emergency exits, the walkways, how the venue's going to flow, the rest of it doesn't need to be quite as polished as it might be for a permanent venue. There are four massive warehouses that are joined onto the side of the press halls and one of them we'll be using for the entrance for customers to come in. And it's amazing here because we've got the luxury of space. That's another thing about the difference between permanent venues and pop-up venues is that here for a permanent venue you maybe only have a very small smoking area on the street. or a small area to do all your processing for searches, ticketing, guest list, all that sort of stuff. Whereas here, there's an absolutely giant space. I think it's about 20 metres by 50 metres large. In there, we can get the queue inside so nobody's standing out in the rain, ticket scanning, then through to searches, and then you come through. and choose which direction you go through to the main space. I think that one of the things that I've always looked for in a really great club space is that it totally transports you away from reality and it's something that you don't always get and it's something I really felt when I was 18 and crawling back up the stairs out of fabric after a marathon session in there is kind of you forget that the outside world exists and I really get that with this space. From the outside it's quite innocuous and doesn't look like much, but once you're in here it's a totally different world and I think that's something that's going to be exciting for people. Shall we keep going? Once you come off this main space, you can either go upstairs, which will take you through to the main rooms, but right now we're walking towards what will be used as the locker area and the toilet area. We've got the luxury. of actual plumbed-in toilets. That's legit, isn't it? Yeah. That's not bad. We're now sort of slightly striking a hybrid between a permanent venue and an event space where we go in and out, and we're used to things being so transient where we have a build process of a day or two and the show day, and then we have to get out again. everything's done at kind of a in a really short space of time because the longer that you're in that space the the more it costs you so now we've got the the luxury of being in somewhere permanently and kind of create further creating that blank canvas in order to um yeah have more flexibility and a better service for the customers Okay, so nobody quite believed us when we did the Junction 2 promotion. I don't think anyone actually believes that the main stage was under a bridge. And watching people's faces as they came over the brow of the hill. Oh my God! Like fist in mouth. It's the same view as you get looking back over there. Just kind of massive expanse in front of you. Right, let's go back in this way. At the moment this is our workshop, so we've got five or six carpenters working constantly at the moment. Painters and decorators and carpenters getting everything ready. So we're walking into the main space now. Come straight into the area which will mainly be bar and seating but I think this is one of the prettiest parts or the most exciting. These are actually the old printing machines that were in the venue. So the floor that we're stood on right now we've filled in lots of holes with concrete along the floor. And those used to be the ink wells for the actual printing press machines. So there's out of, there must have been, there was eight. So there's what, there's two left here. Yeah, so there was eight machines across the two spaces. There's two left. And these were what they were sat on. I mean, they're really impressive, quite beautiful, and they're quite a nice blue. They look good. I mean, eventually, we'd really love to project onto them, make them look like they're moving again and like they're in action. I think it would be quite an exciting thing to do. So this room will be one massive long bar down one side, and down the other side, plenty of seating. I feel like that's something that also other venues or nightclubs forget is somewhere for people. to sit. I think it's really important if you're in a space for a long time you need to be able to feel comfortable on the dance floor, get a really nice drink but then also be able to sit down and you know have some chill out time as well and not feel like after say four or five hours that you're tired and you just want to go home. You want to make this a space that people can stay in for quite a long time. Can you remember that first time you were sort of taught you went on a was did you think you could actually make something work here we love a challenge we we i mean really first thing came in was like it's fucking big it looks mental it's got no sound limits um great let's do a party uh i don't think we'd even bothered coming up with the idea of what a pnl or forecast is or how much it's going to cost um for us it was just kind of like right this would be great um reality is obviously we have to make everything else work but I think that's been something that's maybe been a part of our evolution along the way. And you touched on it earlier with Tobacco Dock and with Junction 2 as well, is that quite often when we've turned up and seen somewhere, it's more been about, we've just got to do an event here. It's going to be amazing. So, shall we walk over here? This is the actual main room. The dance floor is a total of 100 metres long, which is pretty massive really for dance floors as far as they go in England. But we're not going to be using all of it for the first series. I think we're only going to be using about 60 to 70 metres of it and the width is about 13 metres. So in theory... can get the full capacity stood in front of the DJ and so that everybody you know you'll always have say one sixth of the people that will be wandering around going to the loo getting a drink having a cigarette outside but if at the point when the headliner comes on everybody wants to be able to see him or her then they can all stand on the dance floor and there'll be space. And can you describe whereabouts the DJ booth's going to be? The booth will be about, as I said, 60 to 70 metres down to the end of the room. Like where we're stood now, obviously there isn't much help for those listening, but you can see some red and white tape down there and that's as far as the booth will be. So it's quite impressive. And the great thing about this room as well is that it's completely soundproofed. Having had eight printing press machines in here going full tilt all day, they had to make this soundproof because there are residents around here. And so we got the luxury of being able to go as loud as we want, which is pretty impressive and something you just don't get in London nowadays. So that was the real jewel in the crown. I think when we first did sound testing here about three months ago, we brought the actual L-Acoustic system that we're going to use on show days and tested it to its full whack. And yeah, all of us with earplugs in were virtually deaf. And you couldn't hear anything on the exterior. We had noise consultants that were walking around. And yeah, there was not a peep that escaped outside the building. So that's really exciting. Walking through here now, it definitely sort of has the charm and feel of like an actual newspaper printing facility. How focused were you guys on sort of retaining that kind of original feel and not maybe making too many changes before you opened? It was something that we were very sympathetic to. We wanted to keep as much of the original features in here as possible. The only thing that we've done is really made the venue safe. All of the original features we've left in, there are some really cool digital boxes that we're not really sure what they show, but they look quite cool. So we've left them in. Lots of pipes. work everywhere, but just all the dangerous bits we've made safe, but everything else we've left in as it is. We put a post on Facebook the other day actually, showing the whole length of the main room with one guy stood at the end of it and just wrote, how big? And I noticed in one of the comments below, somebody said, hadn't you better start turning this into a club now? And I was a bit like, well that's... Kind of the point is that this isn't being turned into a club, this is being turned into a multi-purpose space and actually if you fix in a DJ booth or you fix the lights then there's no room for change or creative, you know, coming up with new and fresh ideas. I think that's the beauty of what we do across all of our projects, across Junction 2, across Tobacco Dock. and now Printworks, it means that we were able to change things up and make things exciting. Because, you know, why not? If you've got the space, then why not do it? The first run of events is they're all going to run from midday till 10pm. People can get the tubes home, they disperse at a time where people are coming out of pubs and restaurants and are on their way home anyway. And I think from my side, looking at it musically, I've really enjoyed programming the daytime things and when I was still working at Fabric we quite often talked about the kind of... those sort of special hours at six, seven, eight o'clock in the morning and they are special in a totally different way but I also really like the energy of a daytime party. It's totally different and it's a totally unique vibe and I think that's something that has been conscious in my programming kind of thing that there's a little bit more of a spring and a step and it's not so sort of dark and downbeat. A lot of it's more kind of... and there's a bit more of a party vibe and I think that makes for an amazing atmosphere on the dance floor. So we're just walking into room two. This is just at the back of the main room. It probably holds about three to four hundred people and we'll be inviting some exciting... smaller brands to host this room. Room 2 is a former charge bay. There was lots of kind of automated robots that ran around the print factory kind of delivering either paper or I'm not quite sure what. And you can see the tyre tracks on the floor from where they've kind of driven over the years. And in here, in the ceiling above you, there's... all these little points that stick down and there was an electric charging point and they used to return here at the end of the day to be charged up to drive around the factory again for the next day. So yeah, it's room two or the charge bay. My name is Larry and my role is engineering technical building manager along with my associate Tommy Gabriel who does the same thing. So we do it together, it's a big place. Tell me a bit about what your day-to-day role entails and how that... That's changed since the buildings moved from being a newspaper printing facility to a multi-purpose art space. Well, it hasn't really changed that much in as much as we take care of the building when there's a lot of facilities here. So it's facilities management. So it's really, it is the fabric and the basis of what the building needs to have people in it, you know, safety and so on. There was a big difference from printing newspapers, that's for sure. Yeah, I mean, it's incredible what they're doing. It really is. Tommy and myself, we see it as a... as what it always was really, a lot less noisy and a lot less people because you used to be at 300 plus engineers here. But now the different way of viewing it is something which I find amazing, that they can look at it and see it in a completely different light, whereas I still see the presses. how it used to be. Yeah, but it's transforming, yeah, every day. So we're just walking past some of the printing presses and we thought we'd just stop by this. This is the actual reel of paper, the last reel of paper that would have been used. And I think it was the one that was used for the evening standard print. If you look down this way, this is like to the end of this room, this is only two machines. It's on four floors and there was eight of these things in here and they were printing two and a half million newspapers a day on an average day. Three and a half was quite a busy day and the day that Diana died was six and a half million newspapers they produced in a day. They used to use something like 30,000 tonnes of newspaper a week. I think the idea, it kind of blows my mind slightly, these kind of things must be happening in heavy industry all over the place and it's just amazing to be in here and feel that sort of sense of history in a weird way. When we first arrived it was a bit like the Mary Celeste in some ways and there's notes and stuff stuck on the wall with people's phone numbers and notes for people's car phones and things like that which is just like little anecdotes to the history of it all. It's been quite cool exploring it and just thinking about how we're going to take it on and give it a sort of a new lease of life. We've just walked into what's known as the Quiet Havens. It's a lot quieter than everywhere else, as you can tell. So quite a lot of these doors and windows are soundproofed. We're essentially in six boxes that... hang between the bar area room and the dance floor. These will be used at the moment for artists and guests. But back in the day when this was open as a printing press house, it used to be used for the workers. So obviously eight of these machines going constantly all day. sort of 100 and 608 dB. You wore headphones all day. It must have been quite a lot for your ears and your kind of brain heads to take. So you had these areas called the quiet havens where you could come, just take your headphones off, take 10 minutes to relax before you went out back to the busy floor again. So we're now stood up on top of the print presses right at the top of the room. The ceiling's nearly 17 metres high in here and we're looking out at a... crane that runs along the entire length of the room which is used to bring the sort of vast printing machines into the space there's a big shutter to our left and the shutter lifts up and so the crane literally dropped like it was built as part of the building so so that you can sort of drag these huge machines in and out and um yeah they're currently taking some cladding off to expose some girders in order for us to do some rigging um yeah it's it's It makes my ankles feel a bit funny being up here. So overall, where do you feel that Printworks will slot in to London's clubbing music landscape in 2017? I think when we first started doing bigger events and bigger daytime shows, I think people were a bit nervous, but actually there's a real kind of... It's a bit sort of symbiotic, if you like, that actually I think the night-time events are busier and better for it. And as long as we kind of work with other venues and talk to them about what we're doing and what our dates are and that kind of thing, it kind of tends to... kind of rub along together and work alright and I think that's it ebbs and flows and not everyone's happy all the time but on the whole we've got a really great working relationship and I think that it's a positive thing That was Aaron Coulthate, RA's news editor, being shown around Printworks, London's newest venue. Full listings for what's coming up at Printworks are of course available on RA. Next, I'm going to hand over to Mark Smith, who sat down with Peter Kern. and Dinky to discuss how companies like Technics and Roland have handled the relaunch and the legacy of their iconic products. You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. Whoa. Today we're going to be talking about how music tech companies have been dealing with the legacies surrounding their iconic products. Often these products were misunderstood when they were released or were thought of as entry-level or second-tier items at best in some cases. And I think it's fair to say that sometimes these companies didn't always consider them to be successful products. Yet now they have something of an amazing cultural significance that these companies are now able to capitalize on. And we're seeing the re-release of new versions of these iconic instruments that are tailored to the demands of the 2017 market. But it looks like there's something of a shift in what these products mean and how they've been marketed. And that's what we're going to be talking about today. And I'm joined by Peter Kern, a producer and founder of the music tech website CDM, which is something of an independent voice. in the online discourse surrounding electronic music instruments. Hi there. And we also have Dinky, who played a key role in development of modern house music, I'd say, over the past decade or so. Released six albums over 2012 inches. Just flown in from Mexico to be with us today, so thank you very much. You're welcome. So let's just establish some examples of what we're going to be talking about. And of course, this is a generalized trend in the music tech world. We're just talking about a few specific examples. So I think a good place to start was there was a New York Times article came out earlier this year, which was headlined... A Turntable Reborn turns its back on its hip-hop legacy. And this was about a turntable called the Technics SL-1200, which played a really important role in defining DJ culture in hip-hop and disco house music in the 70s and 80s. And now it's been re-released. But the creative director... has said that DJs are fine too, but as a marketing target, it's problematic. We don't want to sell the 1200 as the best tool for DJing. And they're also going to cost about four times as much as they originally did. So, just to start with you, Dinky, do you think there's something ironic about this that, you know, the people who... made this product so significant in its time would essentially not be able to afford it in its new form? I think it's elitist also to just like divide the people who are really rich or who have the money to afford turntables and then there are a lot of people who can afford $3,000. It's very expensive. But I'm sure the company had its reasons and, you know, there's a lot of things we can say, but we don't know inside what's going on. And I think there might be other reasons we don't really know. I don't like it, of course. But at the same time, it makes the classic 1200 a little bit of a... Yeah, mystery and people keep looking at it online, used, and it's still something fun. But of course I don't like it, but I think Technis had a reason to do it and I guess they have their own reasons and we have to respect that as well. Yeah, because they were discontinued less than a decade ago. due to poor sales and dwindling supply of parts. There you go. So Panasonic is the parent company of Technics and obviously something's changed in their eyes. Do you think, Peter, that this has something to do with vinyl becoming something of a lifestyle product? You know, it's something that you consume in this refined way now. Well, I mean, I would tend not to read too much into it. I think it was kind of clear from when they announced that this thing was coming that they saw it as an audiophile product. So something with a really high sticker. presumably lower volume but higher margin. So it's kind of a 1200 in name only in that it seems to be that they took this brand and this model in a different direction. Vinyl DJing seems to be healthier than ever. If the 1,200 sales were kind of suffering, I think that was probably partly because the turntables were all still out there and working and getting repaired. And it seems that Pioneer has stepped in with the PLX, what was it, PLX1000? PLX1000. And everybody I know who plays those really loves them. people are even loving them more than the techniques. So it's not as if the record players that have techniques on them have turned their back on average DJs. It's not as if DJs have turned their backs on vinyl or DJs don't have options out there and clubs don't have installs. DJs to play. Because needless to say that, you know, the people who pioneered the 1200 in New York back in the 70s and things like this wouldn't have been able to shell out 7000k on a pair of these. But who are these, you know? Who are the people who are consuming this new 1200 now? Who are these audiophiles? The strange breed of the audiophile has always been kind of a mystery. Obviously, you know, there are a lot of people out there with a lot of disposable income. And I mean, I can't really fall to manufacturers. you know, whoever it is. I can't fault them for turning that into a business. And these people like to spend their money on that and they don't care. I mean, and also there's like DJs with a lot of money as well, to be fair. But maybe it's not the majority that's going to spend that money on a turntable. They're probably all playing digital anyway, but they have to spend. It's tax, you know. They'd rather spend money on... high-end gear and audiophile gear, then give it to the tax man sometimes. So there is a market for that, for sure. But I guess it's interesting that these people are kind of... passively, they have a passive relationship with this new turntable whereas the people who were using it in the 70s were pushing it to make it into something that its creators never really intended it to be. It's that kind of... perhaps indicative of the present time that now these products which were, had like, you know. individuals made them revolutionary, but now the people who are buying them are essentially just experiencing them in an offhand way. Maybe that's more a question for you than for me, Niki. I guess what I would be curious about is what you think the current state of... vinyl DJ technique is. I mean, obviously we wouldn't go to whatever excessively rich people buying new Techniques remakes to figure that out. I mean, it seems to me from my rough experience, if you kind of go and see the latest scratch DJs or, you know, hang out with your favorite selectors, there's still people doing interesting things with turntables. The revival of vinyl DJs definitely, you know, making people more aware of the turntables. all this past that comes with it. I kind of watched the initial announcement of the techniques. It seemed to me from the initial announcement like they were going to go on this high-end audiophile sort of direction. I think I said that at the time. I don't remember exactly. Then the actual announcement came out, and I think I honestly kind of tuned it out because it sort of had gone off into this unaffordable territory, probably not. relevant but i don't know i mean is it um it seems like any kind of real world dj is now choosing between something like repaired up-to-date techniques and the pioneers. These pioneers have actually started cropping up in the clubs around Berlin for sure. People seem to like them. I don't even know that this sort of high-end entry is a relevant choice for anyone. Maybe there's some wealthy DJs who are buying them. Yeah, for us and for the industry, the club, I don't think so, for sure, no. I mean, like, you're going to drop a drink on that turntable, why, you know? Why having a €3,000 turntable if someone's going to drop a drink on it or, like, there's going to be smoke in the club? So I think it's definitely... market to a different crowd. I mean, the parallel in the synthesizer world is clearly the Buchla, which is kind of an unhappy story in the distancing of the two companies called Buchla and the passing of the founder in this past year. But I did get to ask one of the Buchla salespeople who was... who was buying these things. These are a full modular system that's running something like 20, 25K. I almost bought one. I mean, that was a different case in that it seemed to break down. He said, you know, some people were people with a lot of disposable income who kind of bought them as a hobby. It's sort of, you know, hard to know what kind of music those people are making. Good music, too. Wealthy lawyers or whoever was buying. those booklets. But yeah, I mean, there was at least a selection of people who were really dedicated musicians who just, you know, this was their big investment because they were passionate about that. It's just hard to imagine that that second group will exist with this particular techniques. It seems just kind of, yeah, like I said, 1,200 in Maine only. You'll be surprised, you know. You'll be surprised how many rich people are in the scene now. I was like in a festival last weekend and there are a lot of very extremely rich people. like millionaires. Oh yeah. There's like a new kind of thing basically of like people that are getting aware of electronic music that are, yeah, they have a different lifestyle than us. They have private jets and all that stuff. I didn't even know. It was my first time to see this actually. And someone was explaining to me this the last few years it's been It's been like, yeah, they're more aware of it. Instead of like pop music, they hear electronic music, the new generation of really rich people from the Middle East and from America as well, from everywhere, basically. And those people, I'm sure, will be a market for hardware, you know, again, to the synthesizer market. I don't doubt that synthesizer manufacturers are selling to some of those folks for sure, which is good because we all have to eat and live. And if we can convince those people to part with some of their money, I think that's probably healthy for us, just speaking selfishly. But, yeah, I mean. It seems like even then you might need some rational reason to buy the techniques, and I just honestly don't know that there is one. But maybe I'm missing something. Maybe there is. The relationship that this hypothetical 60-year-old audiophile in his big leather chair listening to his vinyl reissues of The Beatles or whatever on his 3,000 euro Technics turntable, that relationship to music. is, you know, miles away from people who saw this turntable in the 70s and were like, oh, look, it starts and stops really quickly. The pitch is really accurate. And they use that to revolutionize music. The difference between these two things is quite telling. But is this just a case of businesses are going to be businesses and we can wring our fists at them but there's nothing to be done about it? What's the response to that? Yeah, I think definitely it's like a business thing. It's like a company. Probably, I mean, unfortunately, sitting down and looking for numbers and accountants and saying that sometimes this happens in club life too. Yeah, like making sums and resting and saying, okay, this guy, this is going to bring me more money and that's going to bring us more money per hour's work in this company and that's it. And there's no respect to other things. That's how a lot of things are working now, by numbers, corporate things, parties, events, DJs even. There's just numbers. I think I'll be a little, I'm going to surprise myself and be a little more optimistic and say, you know, I mean, this character of the audiophile has kind of been around with us since the beginning of Home Stereos. So, I mean, maybe the weirdest thing about this story, and I think the New York Times didn't really pick up on that, but the weirdest thing is that just as you would never expect that this turntable would survive as a nameplate and as an icon from the 70s to now, given all of the other changes that have happened, you kind of wouldn't expect the audiophile as a breed to survive from the 70s until now. And yet, somehow, this person who we keep describing as a 60-year-old man or whoever this person is, somehow this breed is still there, or at least... at least the makers of the new 1200 believe that they have someone to sell to. Yeah, there's enough of them out there for them to put their whole marketing campaign in their direction and, you know, have paid zero attention to, you know. the communities of people which made it an iconic product in the first place. I guess it's just that irony is the telling factor, I guess. Access to vinyl and access to turntables now is about as good as it's ever been and isn't in any significant way, I think, a limiting factor. So I think we can move on to a different case, a different reissued iconic product. This one is from Rowland. They have a line called the Boutique Range. And they've... delivered classic instruments like the 909 drum machine and the 303 bass box, I guess you could call it, in a sort of portable, miniaturized, somewhat affordable form. And the key points in the marketing of it is that it's a faithful recreation of the originals, which are literally the sound of house and techno. and it's there for making music whenever and wherever you want. But I guess the interesting thing for me personally is that, again, these machines at the time were essentially failed to live up to their remit. The 303 was supposed to be an accompaniment for... guitarists rehearsing without a bass player or something like this and the drum machines were meant to sound like real drums but they didn't so Peter could you maybe talk a little bit about how these were originally marketed in the 80s because there was a gap of time between when they were released and when they became revolutionary instruments Well, that's right. I mean, the 303 was really intended to sound like a bass guitar, and kind of everything about its architecture is wrong for that purpose. So it's really funny in that it is, just in terms of even, in terms of the kind of electrical design of it, it's almost an assemblage of what Uda's flaws, you know. At first, it doesn't sound anything like an electric guitar. We were just talking about this with a friend of mine. The accent is kind of broken, and as you add the accent, the instrument distorts. It has this weird squelchy filter. But, I mean, I'm also describing all the things that have made it appealing. made it last, are these flaws. I mean it sort of it failed at being one thing and sort of accidentally became something else that no one had seen before, no one had heard before. That sound is what's stayed with us. This kind of happens with all instrument design. If you create something new you really won't know what it is created it and you certainly certainly won't know who it's for. So, you know, if you look at the early marketing for the 303, it's things like Oscar Peterson posing with one. And, you know, you would have no idea. You would have no idea who the market was for this thing that didn't exist previously. It's because it's a new category or what the music would sound like, because that's a new category, too. Now we have the benefit of kind of living with this thing. think what what we've come to appreciate about is that there's something about the sound that's uh really um irresistible and universal somehow tiki i know you used to own a lot of the original versions of these instruments um not anymore actually i got rid of them that's okay i did i did own the 909 the 808 profit five and things like that. But for me, as an artist, it's just personal. I'm not looking to sound like a classic house or a classic techno person. I'm always looking to sound like myself, so I don't really need these instruments for that reason, just for sound sources. So I'm quite detached. I was quite detached with my classics, and at one point I needed to sell. And I sold, and I think these little things are fantastic, to be honest. I mean, for me, as an artist, they're very good for life because they're portable, and as you know now, space is money. So the airlines are charging you for space more and more, and the more equipment you have. On your check-in, the more risk you are going to lose them because it's electronic, so it gets stuck on airports a lot now because they check this equipment and sometimes you don't get them. So it's very good for us to travel with these little things on the hand luggage. and they sound amazing, but personally, I'm not looking for an old school sound, or I don't want to sound like Mr. Fingers, or someone like that, with a classic, you know, because I think that's beautiful, but that's not what I'm looking for. And I honestly think some of them, I mean, I have the JP-808. It doesn't sound like a Jupiter-8. It does sound great, but it doesn't sound like it. And so I think some of them, they're not so faithful to it. And some of them, they don't look so great. But I think they're great also for people, for new people to learn and for young people. I mean, when I was 20 and I started making music. This could be a dream. I would never be able to afford anything like that. It was just crazy. I would never imagine something so small could come out and so cheap. So I think it's a great and really positive thing as a consumer. I mean, I'm a prosumer. Let's say I'm a professional consumer because it's for my profession, but for consumers as well. But you have the JP-08? Yeah. I love it. I mean, of course it has flaws. It's tiny, but I'm a girl, so my fingers are okay. But some of my boy, man friends, they say the knobs are too small, which I understand. That could be something that's very, not a big no, but I like it. And I think it's great for live. Not for live, only for the studio if you want to use hardware. Now making music everywhere, that's a little bit of a marketing thing, I think, because if you want to make music everywhere, you can bring a laptop and you have everything as well. But especially for people that want hardware, it's great. I'm just curious, do you have a different bass synthesizer that doesn't... and take the role of the O3, but does something else? Yeah, I have a Moog, actually. Yeah, a Moog sub. Yeah. There's also a nice example, the Model 5, you know, the new reissue, which is, like, very expensive as well, and just like the original, basically. But it's really faithful. That's the original. I'm going to get in trouble with the Moog people for saying this, but I mean, I think I got a little bored of the Moog, and I just kind of bit bored of the Moog ladder filter. So that's really blasphemy. It's like I'm Catholic, but I'm just bored with communion every single week. But no, I mean, that's kind of interesting, this issue of sort of boredom. And so, I mean, we have three kind of filter designs, right, that are really, really popular. And that's the MS-20, the 303, and the Moog ladder filter. And it's kind of funny how this seems to go in cycles for people. Some people who have their original 303 won't give it up. And also, we're initially resistant to this just because I think they have a kind of personal attachment to the fact. original. Some people who are big, big users of this instrument are totally bored with it and don't want to touch it again. Sometimes you kind of expect it, and maybe I'll come around in the ladder filter again in some sort of cycle, but sometimes you expect to get bored with the sound. Like, how many more acid tracks can I listen to in a row? And then somehow... you hear this thing and it gets under your skin again and you have exactly the same reaction even though that makes kind of no sense, right? Yeah, it makes you feel like home in a way, you know, like when you were young and I'm not so young anymore. So it makes me go 20 years back and feel like I was in a party for the first or second or third time and hearing this is like a chicken. skin how do you say in english like goosebumps goosebumps yeah um yeah like so it brings you back you know these sounds and that's the beauty of it i think but then i i mean i suppose that's the other question for me and you know i i mean i had this conversation with you know chip musicians a lot of people got into chip music who never played nintendo video games So that for me was always kind of the disproof to this is just nostalgia. There seem to be certain instruments, and they all kind of grew up in the, a number of them grew up in the 80s. The chip music being one, the 303 coming from the 80s. Some of these other instruments, I guess we're talking 60s, 70s. But I'm not surprised by people who connect to it because it's a cultural signifier because of nostalgia. I guess I'm most interested, though, in people who didn't come from that history who have the same emotional reaction. Hearing it without that memory. And to me, the 303's ability to do that is somehow, there's something kind of vocal. about it, right? There's something vocal about this filter. Yeah, it's quite human. Yeah. Yeah, you might be right, yeah. So, I mean, I said, you know, I think whatever the engineers at Roland did, it was a little bit like they discovered chocolate for the first time with this thing. And then once you, you know, once you have access to chocolate, you kind of want to... Add it to everything, you know. It's not like something, it's possible to overdose on chocolate, but it's really, really hard, right? Yeah, and when you find the right formula, it's like sometimes you hear a 303 track and it's like, wow. Even if I heard the 303, I'm tired of it. But this track is, wow, amazing. It just makes you cry. It's very emotional. As you said, it's probably the fact that it feels quite human. Do you think it's a different situation for an artist using an instrument where the history has been completely written? It's like a cultural artifact. Yet when this was released, people barely knew how to use it and it was considered like not even a real instrument. So what's the equivalent of that original 303 situation in the present day? Peter, you were talking about them being marketed. and not really knowing what it's for. Mistakes, like... Yeah. Where is that line now? Because, you know, this whole thing that we're talking about is reassuring iconic instruments, yet what made them iconic was kind of their failure to live up to what they were supposed to do. Is that something which is confined to the past? Can that happen again now? I think, I mean, maybe the OP one, I think it's maybe one of the instruments that is like kind of quirky and like, I don't know what it is for, but it works and people love it. And yeah, there is. a few things like even the octatrack could be it's like crazily deep and could create like mistakes they don't even know what they were doing but for some reason it's like wow deep instruments I think there is but in a much deeper way because of the technology of course At that time it was more basic. I think there is a parallel. Yeah, and I mean, there are a lot of new synthesizers. So that question I think is pretty easy to answer. None of the companies, virtually none of the companies doing remakes have stopped making new stuff. So, you know, I think even Roland, people don't talk much about the System 1, which is kind of their new weird. entry in addition to all this circuit modeling of their old instruments. But I really like the system one. I think it sounds kind of different from everything else. Korg is probably an even better example. Korg just this week announced that whatever they're doing, the MS-20 in a new color, they're doing a full-size ARP Odyssey that's going to be hand-built in the USA, but they're still, in parallel to all of those kind of remakes, still making new stuff, and I think the whole Volca line has been really impressive in this, and doesn't sound like stuff that's come before. There's some new ideas in the Volca, in the Minilogue. the monologue and that's just Korg once you get into smaller makers you get all kinds of weird stuff mistakes and strange decisions and you know Eurorack stuff that's that's really really peculiar everything from the sound to the labels to the marketing stuff that you would never imagine to sell and that's selling out. Somebody did a Eurorack module that's actually full of dirt. And that sold out, I think, within an hour or something. You know, there's so much. And I mean physical dirt, right? Topsoil, not dirt sound. I mean... So it's kind of astounding how much stuff is out there. The remakes seem to actually be driving more original stuff, and the original stuff seems to be driving more remakes. Everybody's synthesizer appetite just kind of continues to grow. Well, I think also it's not only in electronic music, because I play guitar, and the guitar world is the same. For example, the Dan Electro guitars were sold in supermarkets for $100 or $50, I don't remember, too long ago. And now they do them again because so many people use them. It became such a familiar sound, very thick, very nice. that now they remake it. They remake them every year, every two years, and now they're $1,000, which is not affordable for beginners. So I think even fashion as well, in a lot of markets, like in cosmetics, there's a remake. it's like a culture in a way. It's common. So it's sort of indicative of the time that we're living in that, you know, we get these refashioned cultural artefacts with an increased price tag. But I guess in the electronic music instrument world... It sounds like things seem to be pretty good, though, even despite this outcry in major publications about companies turning their backs on their legacies or people owning original 303s saying the new 303 isn't authentic and stuff like this. So perhaps it's a case of, you know... making the best of the situation. Well, I mean, the funny thing is I'm not sure Roland ever stopped trying to remake the 303. They just kept doing it wrong. Apologies to Roland. So the joke that's been circulating is that Roland will do a reissue of the MC-303, like this horrible 90s box. You've got to love those things. Oh, yeah, I remember those. There have been literally now decades of Roland announcing that some product was going to kind of receive the legacy of the 808 or the 909 or the 303. What's kind of astounding is that they've finally, I think, kind of gotten it right. I think the Iris series are great. I think the boutique are even a little more focused and will appeal to even more people. And I think the sound is more or less right now, too. I think it's certainly good enough. It's definitely good, yeah. Even with those little plugs, it breaks through the club. You test it on live situations when the studio is different, but on live, yeah, it goes out and it goes out well. So it works. And I really kind of hope... I hope that what it leads to is more people playing live, sort of personally. With hardware. With hardware. Well, I mean, just playing live, period. You know, I think the reality is a lot of people were playing the records who had never gotten the chance to kind of use the instrument, because the original 303 has never been all that plentiful. There are not that many units of hardware out in the world. And the sound, I think, is appealing to people, even whether or not they have kind of a context to have it appeal. You know, it's just something about it is, like, makes you want to play it. There's something about this instrument that seems to kind of take on a life of its own, where it almost sort of starts to play itself. And that's a really kind of cool... feeling, sort of inspiring feeling. I think it's what we strive for in synthesizer design. So I think the accessibility of this thing will lead a lot of people who had traditionally only played records or only played CDJs, you know, they may have gone and tried to play with it live, which I think can only be a kind of positive. Yeah, for sure. We need more live sets. So thank you to Mark and especially thank you to Peter and Dinky who took the time to speak with us last week.
