Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping their electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Since opening in 1999, Fabric has grown into the most significant dance music institution in the UK. It also holds an international reputation reserved only for the venues making an enduring impact on the culture. But most importantly, Fabric enjoys real grassroots support. from ravers and the dance music community at large. This gave them the strength to endure events like the club's controversial closure in 2016 and is key to their ongoing relevance after 20 years in business. To celebrate those two decades, Tom Faber speaks to Fabric's Judy Griffith and Andy Blackett to hear the story of how an old cold storage space became England's most famous club. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Fabric is up next. Hello and welcome to the RA Exchange. First, if you could maybe just introduce yourself very briefly and tell me what your role is at Fabric. My name is Judy Griffith and I'm the Promoter Promotions Manager at Fabric and I've been there for, oh god, about 19 and a half years. Yeah, so, you know, I'm part of the brickwork there. Could you also just give us a flavour of one of your earliest clubbing experiences? as a dancer? Okay, so that would have been within the first six months, I guess. I remember like with Fabric actually because it used to be like massive queues to get in, like really long. You used to always really panic about whether you're going to get in for starters. I think the first one I went to was Tony Humphries, which I think was a second night of opening because the first one was V recordings. I didn't go to that. I don't think I was there at that. I went to Tony Humphrey's. That was my first night there. And it was just, it's really weird because it just really was different. It was just actually from the start, it was actually a really different place to be. And, you know, I was like the clubbing queen at that time as well. So I used to go to every single club in London. Still do, do, do. I still do, I know. Nothing's changed. But yeah, Fabric was like, it was really just a breath of fresh air. It was kind of like what one of us, oh my God, this is what we were waiting for, but we didn't know that we were, you know? So yeah, I think fabric from the start really did sort of like change things. in sort of the landscape of clubbing in London. Sure. Great. And we've got Andy as well. Yeah, I'm Andy Blackett. I've been doing the bookings with Judy 10 years now, which time's gone very, very quickly. Yeah. Early clubbing experience? Well, from Fabric, for me, actually, one of the most things that actually sticks out. and it's probably quite timing wise is actually actually the third birthday tea towel I've still got loads in my home I've obviously been a few times before but if there's a memory that sticks out is me and my mates going back with about 20 of these tea towels with on it and yeah it was the never ending tea towel at home yeah it was a really funny presence actually what did the tea towel what was on the tea towel just had a number 3 it was a nice design number 3 well it actually had because what actually what we I'll just put in there but right we we based it on the like a souvenir tea towel that you would get if you went to the seaside or something So it was like actually Craig, it was actually got Craig Richards, Terry Francis, James Lavelle and potentially Ali B were probably like pictures of them on it, on the actual towel. And it's just like, it's just like a really old school type of thing that John Cook like based it on a souvenir, on a souvenir towel. I mean, I can't believe in it. Sometimes I think. We used to like every year for like the first kind of five years, like have a present for people on the birthday. And we'd be talking like printing about 5,000 things, you know, so that everyone got one each night of the weekend over the birthday. It's like, oh, there's got to be some fortune. But we would just do it and give them away for free. The first one was a mug. Okay. It's just got... I've got it still got it at home that had James Terry and yeah had all the residents James Terry and Craig on it like a commemorative mug do you still have any of these presents I've got all of them yeah I've got all of them so there's the ice there was an ice tray fabric ice cream there was an ice tray as well I've got loads of those in my freezer fabric oven glove which happens to be the worst oven glove known to man it just the heat goes straight through it it does actually yeah but it did dust love it when I go around to my mum's and she still uses things like that you know she's still got our our um oven glove you know and she's got the the fabric ice cube thing why are they all kitchen why are they all kitchen implements I don't know actually because the mug was because you do a commemorative mug you know like Charles and Diana kind of thing that was the mug came from that and then we kind of sort of I guess sort of stayed on that kind of souvenir type theme with the towel The towel actually someone made me one day. I randomly forgot my handbag on the club night and the girl that was doing reception, she actually grabbed a couple of the tea towels that were just sort of left in the box and literally stapled me up a handbag for the night. And it was amazing. I've still got that as well. Like an early tote bag. Yeah, she kind of like stapled it around the sides and made me this bag. Whoa, love your bag, dude. That's great. So, I mean, Judy, if you've been there since the beginning, do you think you could give us sort of a flavour of what the London nightlife landscape was like when Fabric arrived or just before Fabric arrived? The underground was healthy. It was really, really good. But the clubs, the big clubs, it was just like, it was all superstars, superstar everything, you know, superstar DJs, super clubs, you know, just big fees. Like it was just... big, big, big, really. And a lot of the parties and stuff that we were going to, like Plastic People, small clubs, you know, Kenny Hawks and Luke Solomon used to do a night on a Wednesday at Bar Rumba called Space, which again, small venue, DJs from like all over the world, but like really cool underground DJs, you know. And there was Thursdays was ultimate base with the Carl Cox and Jim Masters used to do. And that was a techno night on a Thursday night, a small. club in the West End of London. Plastic People, I should add, was in the West End at that time as well. That's where all the clubbing was. That was the hub, was the sort of West End, wasn't it? And like, you know, East London didn't even get a look in sort of in those days. It was all based around West. But there was sort of any of bloat among the sort of clubs and everything was getting too big. Everything was just getting too big. And like, you know, everybody was getting really fed up with it, you know, like going there. So we used to retreat into all these small clubs, hearing all these amazing DJs. And so I think in a way Fabric sort of, that's what we took from. We took from those clubs. They were our inspiration. But we just gave it a bigger platform, you know, and we gave those people a bigger platform. They were the DJs that we were booking at Fabric, were the sort of DJs that we were hearing in those small clubs or in the back room of the bigger clubs, you know. Like Craig used to play. I first heard Craig Richards play. It was a big club and it was in, used to do it in the YMCA on Tottenham Court Road. And he used to play in the basement. just everything, like play right across the board in the basement. In the YMCA? Yeah, it was like they used to do parties there. Yeah, they used to use like the floors and do parties there. And yeah, it's quite bad. Like it was on Oxford Street. So you perched your first... Malibu, Stacey, I think that's what it was called. And then Rage that used to be like up there as well. There were so many different kind of clubs. Terry, for instance, Terry Francis, he used to play at the Cross. You know, used to do a night there, like at the Cross, which is where Keith, our boss, originally comes from. So that's kind of like, you know, how he was, he was hearing all the, he was booking all these people for the Cross, where his brother owned the Cross at the time, Keith. And Keith used to just do the flyering and do all these other different, different things for Billy, who was the club man. But Keith always like wanted to have his own club and used to, I don't know. How did he decide on the location, do you think? I think just from going, just looking everywhere all of the time. suddenly this came up I think it was something to do with Cameron is how it came up don't know if you know but well I know just in past conversations obviously it's long before my time but it was more the space dictated it rather than the location yeah he found the space and he goes right this works but also it was in Farringdon which is which is which is where the meat market is and so they had pubs that were 24 hours do you see what I mean because they just opened for the meat market So it was a good location as well in the end because we could, we quite easily got our first 24-hour license. Yeah, but back then, it was a bit of a dive around there. Totally, there was nothing there. So, you know, Fabric, I mean, we were talking about gentrification earlier, weren't we? Fabric was probably the first new thing in that area. It was a lot of boarded up old butchers and the restaurants weren't there. You look at it now, Yeah, I mean, we've kind of totally different. I mean, it also provides a very unusual experience. I think my first time ever clubbing was to Fabric. And I really vividly remember coming out at six o'clock in the morning. sorcery and walking through all the meat yeah exactly all these like raw hunks of flesh unloading pigs out of the back of a truck so surreal yeah really surreal you sit in the pub and there's someone next to you with a bag of giblets it's more so on a more so on a Sunday Sunday night they do it more so now yeah yeah you come out and there's a meat market But you'd be like some of the pubs we used to use as kind of afters because there was nowhere to go. So we used to go to some of the pubs because they would be open on a Sunday morning for the meet for the butchers. So in a way, it was a good place because as well, it was just the city. It was the city. So Farringdon was only a nine to five place. Like beyond after five o'clock, it was dead. There was no one around there It's really hard to sort of think that. Yeah, like even like when we were in the offices there, our offices used to be by Malmaison when we first got there. We used to have to walk to the club, you know, and the offices, you'd come out like on all those kind of days, there would literally be no one. We would like Easter, Christmas, all these kind of times where we would be working. It was just nothing. We couldn't even go and get a sandwich. There would just be nothing open. Now it's like literally cafes next door to each other. So a lot of the businesses thrive off of us. And a lot of the news agents and stuff, they used to thrive off the queue at Fabric. You know, the news agents, he never used to open at night. But then because the queue... used to go past his shop all the time he decided to get a license to open up like in the evenings literally to cater for our queue it's a bit like those little fish that like go along the sides of whales and just kind of like eat the Yeah, exactly. So, Andy, you mentioned briefly that the space itself of the club dictated it being appealing. What about the space of the club on the inside do you think is special? I don't think there's anywhere else like it. I mean, you walk down three stories virtually. Yeah, because it's a refrigerator. Yeah, and it's an old cold storage stroke abattoir to serve the meat market. So there's all these brick arches. And you really have a sense of when you're down there, sort of time and you, because there's no daylight whatsoever. So, I mean, there's times when we've, you know, been partying in there and you open the door and it's daylight. You can get lost in there. It's, you know, when everything's open, the two staircases and the different rooms and it's a bit of like a rabbit warren. You can walk around. And I remember my first time going there before I started half the fun was trying to say half the fun was trying to find each other but you would be going up staircase two going is this staircase two i don't know we all know it now really i didn't even really realize there were two staircases when i first arrived i thought there was just one and it looked different as the light really throws people doesn't it yeah Yeah. No, but I think also maybe when you lose your friends, it gives you more of an opportunity to meet new people and to make new connections. That was one of the things people used to say about fabric in the early days as well, is that they just come in there with all their mates and lose them. And then I not really hook up. but I made lots of new friends along the way you know just go home with some different people yeah it was always kind of quite comfortable and sort of safe and friendly I always felt it was like a very like-minded people then wasn't it yeah I think you know the people that went were were just all the same as you same as us you know like we were clubbers putting on our putting on parties you know for clubbers that so That's how it was. We totally were on the same length, same age as our people that were coming. It was always like one big family, really. Has it continued to be like one family in terms of the organisation? Yeah, I mean, it's a little bit different now, but on the whole, yeah, I would say. There's so many people that are still the same. I mean, I've been there for 19 years. Look at the time everyone's there. Now, Judy's been there for 19 odd years. I've been there 10 years. You've been there 10 years. Scott Patterson, who recently, I say recently, left quite a while ago, but he was there for 11 years. Yeah. Kimmy, who's, you know, helps me and Judy out with everything. She's just about to leave us, sadly. which she's been there seven, eight years. Yeah. The boat who I design has been there the same length of time as me, 10 years. Yeah. So the... And Sean Roberts, who did Fabric Live for years. For 18 years. He was there about 18 years. Yeah. So the, what do you call it? The rotation of staff is very low. Yeah. Which is a... And you know, that's a true testament, I think. It is. You know, people that are passionate. no matter what gets thrown at them, we actually care what we're doing and I think that's why everyone's been there as long as they have. Yeah, I think so too. Do you think that, or are there any other reasons why you think Fabric stayed so strong for so long when clubs were rising and falling and opening and closing? I think, for me, it's trying to stay true to what we've done. And in modern times, it might be slightly harder to do this, but it's integrity of, we're booking these DJs because they're good. not because of their names. Yeah, there's no big hype. You know, and Judy's done it probably more so than me. people that were playing, you know, even when I've started for 10 years, I've seen, or we've, I shouldn't say we've taken them, but you've seen them start as a 500 pound DJ in room three to going into room two, to then going into room one, to then headlining. And then, then that's when it becomes difficult because the other venues and bigger festivals then see the rise of this talent. And then you end up, you end up. a different market, which is hard to compete in. But yeah, that's, I think, the big beauty of Fabric. Yeah, I think people trusted us. We never really strayed too far from our ethos and what we wanted to do. And we kind of came along quietly. There was no big hype. No ego. No superstar DJs, no ego, no big noise. It was just... Just gently saying, this is what we do. I hope you like it. And luckily, 2,000 people every night did like it. And it really was like that because we opened at the same time as Home, which had opened a month before. What was Home? That was like a home, a big club, a big super club, I'd say, in Leicester Square. And the press, I think, tried to put us up as rivals, but we weren't really that bothered. We were focused on what we wanted to do. Who was playing there? And home had like, you know, big noise, huge like campaign. It was Openfold. Paul Openfold was there. Big resident. And, you know, it was all just, whoa, whoa, whoa, all singing, all dancing. A very, you know, a product of the time that I talked about earlier. Like, you know, that was a product of that was how it was clubbing then. And, you know, big sort of people would come and worship him almost on the night. But if you talk about location is they probably chose the prime location. And they chose the prime location. But a wrong location because Westminster Council would not In the end, it was... So they kind of... For someone coming into London, they'd think, oh, yeah, where should we open a new club? Bang in Leicester Square. Sorted. But, of course, it probably was the worst thing they could have done because it was, like, right in the middle of the West End and the restrictions were horrendous, you know. So they got shut down eventually. So they were... Yeah, I think they only lasted about a year and a half or something, maybe two years. And then we, on the other hand, the press was saying, oh God, here's this other club coming along really quietly. Just a few teaser flyers, I think we did, saying who was going to be playing and announced the residents. No one knew who that Craig Richards and Terry Francis were. I was like, what is... then they're opening in East London. No one went to East London in those days at all. There was nothing there. And so it was just like, what is going on? these people what are they doing and you know we just sort of quietly opened not didn't care what other people were thinking and just stuck to what we wanted to deliver and like who are all these djs on the lineup no one knows who these people are but you say quietly opened weren't there sort of cues around the block from day one but what i mean is like we weren't like screaming from the rooftops like this is us yes of course it was cues from day one because people connected with that people like I kind of like the sort of that. We did this little teaser campaign with these flyers and it just said, Danny Snaggley or whoever it was, like, at Fab... I think the big difference is the way at the time all the other clubs were look at us we're great shout shout shout when they're selling their lineups I used to work elsewhere and I used to do exactly the same and always what you appreciated with Fabric was even the flyer the flyer the lineup was virtually secondary to the artwork It was like a platform for a bed of artwork and the DJ's line-up would be in the top left-hand corner really small. And the old flyers were collectible and I think that kind of understated... play on it it appealed to a lot of people yeah and it's i think probably quite ahead of the curve as well because now it's obviously very cool to underplay it and to be very muted in your yeah yeah and everyone copied or tried to mimic the artwork i remember trying to copy our flyers fold out flyers and doing everything in different ways yeah because we had fold out flyers before a flyer would be like you know a big thing maybe a girl with fluffy boots on or something like that. It's never like a thought thought through like image. You know, our artwork was just as important as our lineups. You know, we had like an art director in John Cook for 10 years, you know. he completely covered our whole art direction. There was no club back then who had someone solely doing that. That's interesting. The whole department, you see. Pictures of the Headline DJ with their own logo on the top of it. Yeah, it would be something like that. That's what you would see. And also, the other good thing that Fabric did, sorry for putting it in there, was it wasn't about Headline DJs. You would have a headliner in there within it, but it was all the DJ It was equal billing. Sorry, same size, equal billing. None of this, I've got to have my own logo. Yeah, I want my name bigger. Bigger than so and so. It was all like, no, this is how we do it. We put our residence top and everyone else is, I shouldn't say secondary, but everyone else is in order. Yeah, they weren't secondary, they were equal. Yeah, equal. It was just equal billing all the time. And in terms of your art direction, Is there like a sort of an idea behind it or is it just like... Well, it's the dog's tooth. It's the fabric pattern, isn't it? Yeah. It's like, it's what I think... It's called dog's tooth, isn't it? It is like, yeah. But I think it's like, you know, when fabric actually, I think when people get samples of it in the industry, it comes on a bit of a shape like that too. There's something like that as well. Like a swatch. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. But if you Google dog tooth, I mean, that's why Houndstooth came about. Because Houndstooth logo is... It's a basic, I say basic, it's a more simplified version of a houndstooth. Yeah. What do you call it? Absolutely. That's why they called the label houndstooth because it sort of took from the thing. Okay, interesting. Yeah. So Fabric continued very happily, very successfully for almost 20 years. There were a few challenges along the way. Certainly, yeah. But, you know, got through them. And then in 2016, got some pretty bad news. Maybe, Judy, could you tell me about when you found out about that and was it a surprise? Can you tell me from your perspective? Yeah. God, it was a major surprise. You know, we literally just had a night, I think Scuba or somebody the week before, and then literally halfway through the week we were told we're not going to be able to open. And we're like, what? I'm like, yeah, the club's not going to be able to open this weekend. You know, like the police have come and, you know, they're shutting us down. And we were just like, this is just so surreal. It was just like, how could that happen? They're telling us that we don't do our jobs properly. We don't care about our... Our customers and all these things are completely alien, completely opposite to what we do. You know, we've always been forefront of looking after our customers. Customer care has been one of the top things that we do, you know. So what was the stated reason? Well, obviously, we had some incidents before and we beat, I shouldn't say we beat, we won a court case to beat Snip. for dogs and not have ID scanned two years before. Sorry, when you say incidents. Drug deaths. Drug deaths. Yes, drug deaths. There's no denying what happened to us. So we all still find it quite difficult to talk about. But sadly, these two young lads, you know, they came in and they got drugs through the search and they, yeah, they took the drugs and had complications and it was two in... We had two in two weeks, which is alarming. You have to admit it is alarming. But for the 10 years before, we've had nothing. And then suddenly there was this spate and this rise. And I mean, sadly, it was the the police felt it was easier to solve the problem by revoking the license rather than maybe dealing with the social issue. But I don't want to blame and point fingers or anything. And so, yeah, so they revoked the license pending appeal. As a complete surprise, you were given no notice. No, I mean, there's two things before. I mean, if you go back to the original court case, they wanted to amend our licence. So you appeal and you operate on your old licence while the court case happened. It took two years for the court case to happen. We had no incidents for two years. The magistrate then ruled in our favouring, saying, look, I have first-hand experience that ID scan doesn't... really stop drug taking happening and and um fabric search is robust enough that she didn't feel that sniffer dogs was was appropriate so just just to summarize what you were saying was that they had been asking you to put id scanners and sniffer dogs in the security and you were saying that you didn't want that and ultimately after two years of going back and forth they agreed with you no we won in a matter we took us to court we went to a magistrate's court Right, and then so basically, if I'm, I hope I'm not being, what do you call it, inflammatory in what I'm saying. So basically after that. We won the court case. Yeah, after that, I would guess they would, I shouldn't say waiting, but any next incidents, they would. you know they're going to want to say look you know we were right yeah mate you know they probably weren't happy that we won so it's a bit like sort of revenge no no i'm not going to go down no no no no i'm not going to go down there you know okay yeah they're doing their job they're doing their job the law is you know drugs are illegal upholding the law they have a duty to protect the the customer we believe it should have been dealt with differently than them, but we can't start pointing fingers now we're two, three years down the line. But on the second time, when you got two in two weeks, it was like, right, you're not allowed to operate, we have the right to appeal, and that's where we went to review, but it took a good six, seven months to get appeal. And obviously we've got a venue and staff and everything to pay for five months of closure. And you're hemorrhaging money. And we have to let all the staff go. It's basically only me, Judy and Kirsty who did the PR campaign and Kimmy that were in this office. Everyone else. Yeah, we had to say goodbye to everybody. Everyone else. which was absolutely heartbreaking. And so when you heard the news, did you think, oh my God, what are we, you know, what's next? Now it's closed? Or did you think sort of, no, it's not possible. No, we always thought it was going to close. I never, until everything started. But at that point when we were initially told, didn't think I just thought my job was over that the club was we were just in shock we were like well this can't how can this even be happening I guess it was it really was a really low low time it was numbness wasn't it numbness of not knowing it's like both me and Judy I mean different ages all of our lives have been in club land. Yeah, totally. And somebody's pulled this rug out from under you and you kind of fall into this trap door and we're all looking at each other like, what do we do now? Well, especially when you know you've been doing it right and that you could not have done it any better from every level. You know, what we deliver, what the security deliver, what the floor staff, what the... everybody coming together always gives 110%. Everybody in the club is like passionate about what they do and they deliver it with love. So to say that we were not doing that was just so, it was really heartbreaking for me. Like, I don't think I've sort of really felt that kind of grief and loss, like other than sort of losing someone, you know, close to me in my life. That's what it actually felt like. I really did feel the loss terribly. You know, I even got ill, didn't I? I was like, end up in the hospital for over a week, just like triggered by stress and just the worry of it all, you know. And also... You know, when we finally did have that sort of, we had six months of campaigning. And what really tipped it over was, to be honest, certainly for me, was the people coming to the club and kind of almost having this open grief outside the club coming to. almost pay their respects to the club and tell the club what it meant to them. Like, you know, no, you are important. So, you know, you shouldn't be treated like this. And it was like, it was those words from people that really made us think, you know what, God, maybe we need to actually fight this. Like, we can't just let this happen to us. We've got to get out there. We owe it to the next generation who are not going to have the opportunity to come and You know, we owe it to them to at least put up a fight for it. But I mean, having said that, never have known that it would have been so phenomenal. Like, you know, we just like, oh, let's just get a little petition together. I mean, it was staggering. I mean, I like just thinking about it now, I get really quite emotional because it was shocking, like the way that petition just went off. people sharing it people like seeing it every day then the donations it was just like what the fuck you know because we couldn't afford we couldn't afford a court case you know People think clubs are made of money and all this. Trust me, they're not. The overheads of running these businesses are ridiculous. So high. So when you're shut with doing 50 grand a week, you're just chucking it down the sink. So you've got nothing in the bank. So the only reason we survived was the donations. And I've got to be hats off to the customers and a good few artists and even rival venues. We had XOYO Colombo Group. We had Warehouse Project. We had Coda, who's an agency. All over the world. Giving us money. And I think it was a turning point in the way clubs, especially London clubs, started to... deal with each other. We were very much, what do you call it? We didn't really talk to each other. They're competitors. We're doing this, you're doing that. And no one really put their head above the parapet. You know, we're all right. You know what I mean? You'd be like, we're all right. Don't want the police here. You didn't really share information. I mean, it's not like, because I think with Fabric, it's like we were always on our own little paths. I couldn't have told you for at least 10 years what was going on down the road in terms, unless I was at that event. I didn't really look at anybody's lineups. I just, because we just were in our own little bubble. And so one thing that came out. out of the closure was just more of an open dialogue with other clubs and more unity and more like realising actually, you know what, this is a community and we need to be reminded of that, that we're all in it together, you know, and that whatever happens to us could also have an unknock-on effect on any club in London or any club in the UK. I think the main thing was that every other club and promoter and operator knew that could have easily been them. Totally. You know, people take drugs and it could have easily been any single one of us. And if that was happening to us, it was like, okay, that could easily be us. It could be easily them next. Next, yeah. So I think people saw that as a real red flag. And also customers that had been to the club were like, hold on a minute. That's not the experience I ever have when I'm in there. So we need to say this. We need to support this. And it was global, which was just like, I could almost expect the UK. But when it became global, that was just. really heartwarming and very overwhelming, very overwhelming. The traction on it was really quite quick. And, you know, Kirstie did this amazing job just like, because we didn't know what we were doing. We were literally making up every single day of that closure, making up as we went along. Really, we didn't have anyone to base it on. We didn't have anyone to go, oh, that happened to them. Let's see what they did. It literally was just this new thing that was just kind of organically growing into almost a monster, which was quite overwhelming to deal with. You know, it was like, oh, like literally pouring my heart out constantly because it was just like every time I had to talk about it, I ended up going on marches and talking, you know, public speaking. I never do that stuff, you know. wreck like you know just just even for this remember but like you know suddenly I'm in the in the park like talking to all these thousands of people about you know how I felt that was the day I think that was a really hard day because they did have somebody arranged this save our culture march on the back of our campaign and I remember me and you having to stand up on this bench with Normski was with us and a few other people And it was really difficult because that was the day we let our mates go. Yeah. You know, Saul and... We've had to sack. I say sack. We had to let go. Because you couldn't afford to pay them. 150 people. And now I am standing in front of people on the day we've let... Yeah. So I'm still feeling about it now. It really was hard, yeah. Trying to save our culture. So it was a really... Yeah, really difficult moment. As I was saying, I still don't think now, because when we got the license back, it's suddenly like mad panic, go, go, go. You've got to fill a diary and you're opening next weekend. You're like... Jesus Christ. And also without your friends. Because even when we reopened, we couldn't afford to have, we couldn't afford to re-employ everybody again because we were absolutely bankrupt. We weren't allowed to use the money that people kindly raised. You know, the tax man got involved and said, hold on, you're not a charity or something, wasn't it? No, no, it wasn't that at all. We just, no. People donated the money for a specific reason. Because it goes into a third-party trust, like a trust fund. Which was to help your legal... To help the legal battle. There was an out-of-court settlement, so we felt it was, we did a transparency statement. We decided there was a good bit of money left. There was loads there. But we split it through charities. Exactly, yeah. So we gave some to NTIA, we gave some to music. Totally, but we weren't able to use it. Of course we did all that, but we weren't able to use it for the day-to-day running of the business. No, you weren't allowed to So it was kind of like literally in, we were in minus, massive. And we were like, couldn't afford to. So we had to reopen the club. From start to end. With about four or five of us. There was something in the office. And we ran like that through. probably the first year more than that I mean we've only just only really just getting that stuff we've taken a couple more people a few months ago end of last year really a few months ago and that's up to a full compliment Did anyone come back? We were doing two or three people's jobs, weren't we? You know, Uma, the accountant, came back. Roberto, the designer, came back. Christian, who only got his job about three weeks before we got shut down, he came back. He does all of our editorial for us. Obviously, Kirstie actually stayed on with us. Kimmy stayed on with us as well. the ops team, the guys who run the venue, they came back as well. So a lot of people, everyone who lost their job were the first people to get offered their jobs back. Do you know what I mean? You know, a few people decided to go on to other things, you know. It was too long. It was six months, you know. So can you take me through the mechanics a bit of how the reopening actually happened? Why did you reopen? Oh, why did we reopen? You know, what happened in order to reopen? What changed the tide? Well, I think it was the groundswell of support. I think there was two things going on. We had to meet certain criteria and conditions. The council certainly softened to us being there. They never had anything against us, essentially. And if we met these conditions, and I also think... And the timing of the announcement of the night czar made it everyone kind of get around the table. I'm not saying they were responsible, but the position was announced three or four weeks. And I think everything was lined up to the mayor's office going, London is open, London nightlife. and on the other hand, they're about to shut down one of the biggest clubs, I shouldn't say the Jewel in the Crown, but at the time, the global, probably the most recognisable brand globally. Definitely. The country's iconic nightclub as well. So there was a bit of a contradiction. There was a bit of a contradiction. London is open but Fabric is closed. What's going on? This is supposed to be a 24-hour city. So there was a lot of backdoor conversations. But there was a lot of conversations in the background. And once the police were satisfied enough that we could operate robustly under the conditions they've... they let us reopen. Was there a kind of hearing where that decision was made? No, it all happened beforehand. Obviously, there was round table discussion. Yeah, there was not a public hearing. There was a hearing, but not a public hearing. That's what the court case, there would have been a court case on it that if we'd lost, we'd have been shut forever. Yeah. This was the gamble. But if we'd won, if we'd won, we know that if we'd have won, we would No way that if we'd have gone through the actual court case and had a public hearing. You could come out worse. We could have either come out worse, but even if they'd have made the decision we want to reopen, they were going to make us reopen with conditions. No way they're going to just let you open as if nothing had ever happened. So although in the end we didn't actually have a court case, but it was settled out of court, they were still the things that were discussed. And so we ended up but with conditions, which I think is what would have happened if we'd have gone to the public hearing anyway. Yes, yeah. We would have still been, even if we'd been, we'd either been shut down completely or we would have been reopened with conditions. So what are the key conditions? Well, basically now it's ID scan and emptying your pockets on the search and the search is a bit more... thorough than it used to be but certainly not intrusive um and then it's basically i mean we did have massive duty of care anyway but all the staff have more um what do you call it welfare training you know and essentially it's essentially it's essentially that but to be totally honest you the staff were doing that anyway and it's there you got it got written in um oh well we went to over 19 because sadly the two um the two guys that that passed away were 18 year olds yeah most of the drug incidents we have have been younger really kids i mean you can say with alcohol when i first started drinking you make mistakes don't you So who do you think should be responsible for drug use at a club? I think it's personal responsibility. I think we have a duty of care to keep our customers safe. And as long as we make sure there's no way of obtaining drugs on our venue. But if you choose to take drugs, you're doing it on your own responsibility. So if I, for example, if I walked into Selfridges and did some drugs and had a heart attack, Selfridges would never be blamed. No. But if it happens on a licensed premises, even in the pub, the licensed premises is always held responsible for anyone or anything that happens on their premises. So it's a bit of an unfair yardstick to gauge it by. Yeah, because even if someone does something outside of your club, which is the case, say they do the drugs outside of your club, but they come to your club and then they collapse at your club. They happen to collapse at your club. you're still liable. Even though they didn't take them on your premises, you're still liable. None of them passed on our premises. They might have just got ill and we were the first, luckily, in a safe place where we've got paramedics to look after them. And then they've been, you know, taken away in hospital and maybe passed a week or so later. But, you know, still we are seen as the responsible one, even though... We're actually the first port of call, port of help. Can I ask, did you have any communication with those boys' families? What was their position? They... Yeah, I think... Luke has. Luke, who's our venue manager, had to deal with a lot, and some of the families wanted to come down. And it's a very sensitive thing, is that, you know, some people, some parents, I would be the same, want to lay blame somewhere. So some of the parents were very like, shut Fabi down, it's this and that. We actually had, they visited the club and wanted to see what happened and Luke had to show them around, which is a very difficult thing to do for everyone. But you also have to remember the impact this has on our staff when you're fighting for people's lives. But no one, you know, our staff have to turn up to work the next day and they've been doing CPR on somebody. That's unfair on our staff. It's very traumatising. Yeah, it's traumatising. And they're expected just to get on with it. And then you're told you've done something wrong. You've done something wrong. Well, actually, you want to give us help. But then there was other people who joined the campaign. And I think over time... Yeah, well, it happened to them. It happened to their son or daughter or brother or sister. In other clubs or wherever. And they were like, no, it needs to be more openly discussed It's a society problem, not a venue problem. You can't just vilify a bond venue for it. Do you think on-site drug testing is something that could ever be possible? Well, they're doing it in some places. Do you think it's a good idea? To be honest with you, I'm going to be totally, totally honest with you. I like the idea of it choosing, well, not choosing, indicating if bad drugs. But you can still have problems on supposedly pure drugs. And so the danger I think is with that is I go and test my pills, let's say, and they come up, oh, yeah, these are really good pure pills. And then because I think they're clean, I do them, and then I think they're safe. So, but... So that's the danger. But do I think drug testing will save more lives if it happens? I think yes. Because, you know, there's so much we learn from Fiona Meacham, who is a drugs professor that helped us out. She runs the loop, right? Yes, yeah. You know, about hormone cycles of women and when they take drugs, they can be more susceptible to the effects of it. You know, your weight, your heart, and that with your body being able to get rid of heat. You know, all this stuff, it's all individual to each individual person. You know, we could all take the same amount and we'll all have different effects on us. So I would like drug testing, certainly. And it's something I think we're all campaigning for because it would be safer. But I understand why the police resist it, because it's like you're condoning it. And their job is to say drugs are illegal because that's the letter of the law. And if you say, oh, yeah, we do drug testing, it's safe. And then you still have an incident. Whose fault is it then? I think it's a difficult one. So something else that happened when you reopened was that you took your Fabric Life nights, which concentrate on sort of bass music, drum and bass, these strains, down from once a week to... twice a month, correct? Yeah. Was this related to there being more kind of thought about drug incidents at these nights? No, because there wasn't any more on those nights, was there? I don't know whether that's like a bit of a myth. Well, basically, in the original hearing we had, one of the councillors brought up the BPM and does that cause an incident? They said higher BPMs cause... Yeah, cause more. But they were asking the question and it's not true. Truth be known is Fabric Live has always been a cross-section of music. So it's always had drum and bass and drum and bass has been the cornerstone and the mainstay of Fabric Live. That's what's kept it going. But he's gone from Doctors Orders and hip-hop to grime to dubstep to trap to breakbeat and everything has come... All these other genres have that even before closure and insurance final years, you know, we were doing Daniel Avery, we were doing Hessel. A lot of these DJs have grown into Saturday sounding stuff. Saturday, which is more... House and techno. Yeah. And we were finding that it was hard to maintain 52 weeks of the year with drum and bass and the Fabric Live sound. So we decided to take it to 24. We rather have 24, 25 great parties. Really good parties than really stretching it out. Stretching out the talent and having 52 okay parties. Yeah, it was really more about the genres. I was really surprised when people thought it was something to do with the drugs because it's not really a night where those incidents really happen. But I also think... Back in the day is I think Fabric Live used to be where the younger market got into music and they grew up through Fabric Live and then grew into Saturdays. Where I think now is the younger generation, they buy into house and techno from a younger age as well as drum and bass. So I just think it's just catering for a change in market. Yeah, exactly. It was just more sort of just evolving with the way the scenes evolved. That's what it was. It was not, you know, when we want to continue supporting drum and bass, and we still do, 20 years on, we're still really supporting it. And actually... as Andy said, it's probably the only genre within the Friday night bracket that still stayed strong. All the other genres that Fabric Live championed, like breaks and dubstep and, you know, all of these things, they didn't... They came and went quickly. They came and went, you know, and we were at the forefront of them when they were there. But when they kind of died a death, we, you know, we didn't really support anymore. So we continued the drum and bass. So that's still going, sort of, you know. We did a really good night, even last weekend. We did a good night where we mixed it up with... Ronnie Size and Crust in room two and Laurent Garnier in room one. We brought James Lavelle back, he's the original Fabric Live resident. James Lavelle. James Lavelle curates. So we did a lovely uncool for the first name and we did James Laurent Garnier and Ronnie Size and Crust and Mantra. And it was really like an original Fabric Live night and it really worked. It was wonderful to see 20 years on that that kind of night could still work, albeit on And 20 years in, when you're putting on a good night, how often do you nip in and have a dance? even though you're working every week Judy's dancing all the time dancing yeah I can stand at the back of a DJ booth now and stroke my chin yeah occasional fist bump but Judy's always dancing I'm always dancing like that is like my thing I mean you know it's like we're lucky we can book what we book people that we like you're really privileged so privileged position you know And like, so, you know, it's pretty rare. Specifically for the first kind of 10, 15 years, it's like, you know, there's not one person I would have booked that was not, you know, in my own record box. You know what I mean? So it's like, you know, everybody I book I really like or I like them as an artist or I like what they represent. Yeah, it's an easy, it's an easy toddle. I just get a proper dance off every weekend. So you talked about starting to shift the lineup and the programming to stay relevant with changing tastes. So Fabric is now 20 years old. Happy birthday. What are the main things that you've done to sort of stay relevant in all that time, especially recently? I mean, it's constantly been evolving the bookings, but you're trying to bring new people through all the time. So we have taken on five new residents on a Saturday. We've got Imogen, Jay Clark, Bobby, Anna and Voigtman that have joined us to try and lay the foundations musically for the future as well as Terry and Craig. But it's also that all the artists that have played for us, it's identifying them young and keep supporting them. So most people, when you look back on it, I mean, I was just going through this with Ben Cox playing this weekend. And we'll go back when he first played. It's 12 years ago and we're finding a photo of him. But that's the thing. We like journeys with people. We don't like to go, oh, they're hot now. We'll copy someone else. Yeah. So that's why I think it's quite it's not really a sort of thought out thing in terms of evolving, because we've never really been one of those ones that just goes for like a hype DJ, in which case you've also if you get sing that all the time whereas we've always like kind of like given people a bit of a platform given people a bit of space to grow and to sort of shine so I don't yeah I think we evolve with them we were on the same journey kind of evolving and going along with them we don't have to think about what we're going to do in 2000 and 30 when you identify new DJs that come along and you stop You're constantly looking for new artists to put alongside bigger artists. The way you talk about it sounds a bit like sort of a record label rather than a club. The way you sort of recognise talent and develop them and sort of give them a space and foster there. Is it harder to do that sort of thing today than it was before? Yes. Why? Because I actually think today is going back to if you go full circle and St Judy going when Fabric started. big, big, big, big, big, big. And I think it's so like a big show. It's going back there again. The headline culture is back more than what it was. I think the Knights of Fabric really made its name. the nights in between the big guns you know where you just actually just put on six or seven quality DJs and we were lucky because people trusted us already so they knew if they didn't know who the person was that they were still going to get a good night at Fabric whereas now they're more judgmental I don't know no I didn't say judgmental but they're more like if they don't know the name of the DJ yes they're scared to take a risk they won't take that risk I think social media has made it or everyone blinkered into I shouldn't say bigger is better but certain names certain names become more prominent and it's not not rating their DJ ability certain names are more prominent and I think that we were chatting to a few customers and It's expensive. London's expensive. It's expensive to live. It's now got more expensive to go out as well. How much will a fabric ticket set you back? Actually, we do a bigger range than we've ever done. But it's anywhere from 10 to 25. And we do student tickets. We do tier tickets. We do before midnight tickets. We do more of a range. But it's the drinks. It's the taxis. It's everything. The cost of going out in London, as you know. So as a 25-year-old living in London on an average 25-year-old's salary, how much disposable income do you have? Me and Judy were chatting about this the other day. I probably had more disposable income back when I was 20-something than I feel I do now. So when they go out, they say they pick and choose what they perceive to be a guaranteed good night or a safer bet of a good night. So if you've got three names that you know, let's say this weekend, you've got Ben DeCock and Paul Le Temple, and you think, oh, that's going to be a good one, to another weekend where you go, well, I've heard of him, but I've not really seen him before, so I'm not sure if I have a good night or not. So I think there's less... The cost of things in general has made... people the sense of discovery take the safer option yeah to the sense of discovery oh let's go and check that out I think that's you can't really do that so much anymore kind of gone a little bit in the scene in general in one night sometimes you know you just can't really do that now you've kind of got to pick or choose to go to print works or whatever but I'm going to see seven DJs and so I'm going to go to do that and at the same time it's going to be all singing all dancing it's going to be big production I'm going to get my Instagram snap you know all of that that's really important to this generation But it drains, but it also, because the cost of it makes people, I think the experience thing. So where we used to go out weekly, because I don't think we had anything else to do. Yeah, we didn't have as much choice. We didn't have the internet. But do you know what I mean? So our things with our mates was going out, whereas now you can, you know, let's say 20 years ago, you've been UFO and it's like, oh, this wicked DJ. and you hadn't heard him. So next time he was hit in town, we would go and see him together. Where now I go, oh, have you heard this Ben Uefa? I'll go and Google it. Oh, yeah, he's wicked. Oh, I'll pick and choose which great event to go to. And I think that's, it's damaging weekly clubbing. that kind of mentality so do you think now people are going out less often and when they do go out it's bigger i think yeah they're spending more money in one go and maybe they'll do they'll choose one thing every other month or months every three months rather than the weekly cycle we all had. I mean, we were out. Yeah, it's really hard to sustain weekly now. We were out. I mean, Judy still is. But we were out three out of four weekends a month you'd be out. Well, I don't think that happens anymore. I mean, there is a few that do it, but it's just a lot smaller amount of people that do that than you do. Yeah, well, also, I think you don't need to go to a club to food market and like sit around and eat lovely good food with your friends and there's a DJ there in the corner playing till a reasonable time like three in the morning you've still had your night out with your friends that's enough you know my my flatmate she's like she's 21 she's kind of like quite happy to have her friends around have boiler room on YouTube and sit in with a bottle of wine that's that's a that's for me that's a warm-up for my night out an amazing night out with her friends you know night in sort of thing but you've got the DJ there on the screen playing and that's enough for them does that make you feel sad yes I'm like darling I'm like double your age and I'm the one that's going out clubbing I'm the one that's coming in in the middle of the morning and you're like here in the living room what is going on like you know it's quite funny it's really sad It goes back to, I don't know if it does go back to, if it's a change in culture across, because you do hear, as we chat to all the other agents and DJs across Europe, and Clubland, Europe's clubs are struggling as well. I mean, we've just seen that Claire's in Amsterdam has just gone. They've just put their hand up and just gone. We can't keep up with this. So it is dangerous, but I do think, is it the cost of everything? You know, 50%, 60% of your salary goes on rent. You know, by the time you do your food and you pay your bills, how much money do people actually have? I think that's a dangerous thing. I don't know if that's a UK or London thing or if that's a more widespread thing, but it makes me feel sad that people don't want to go out, they'd rather stay in. But then on the other hand, when you closed, there was so much discussion and a thousand articles about club culture being threatened and is this existential threat to London's nightlife? But then if I go on RA at the weekend and look at what's happening in London, there is so much great stuff. I totally agree. Yeah. Yeah. I think we've gone from Save Our Culture to an explosion. But I think I'm not sure if there's the footfall to maybe sustain it all. Even though there's lots of parties, there's not enough people in London to fill them, all those parties. But I mean... Listen, I'm out all the time and I still find enormous, there's always, always going to be parties to go to. They might not be as busy as they were like 10 years ago or three years ago even, but they're still there and they're still thriving. And it's like, you know, the choice now is incredible. Yeah. Like, you know, you go. People doing really exciting things and putting on parties in the most obscure places. Like where? Just for the sake of the party. Like, you know, I'm going to parties on boats. I'm going to parties in the middle of a forest. You know, in Hackney Wick, in places like... How have they even found this little spot? And how is the council... They've got to get away with it as well. Whatever, they're thriving and they're amazing. And then, you know, so... Don't get me wrong, as much as everything's changed and it might not be as easy to run a 52-week club night every year, especially one of our size, there's lots of smaller things going on under the surface, as always, and they're amazing. I would say as well, I think London beat itself up for so long, and I think we're still doing it now as a nation. with Brexit but let's not go there but when you write down on paper October, November, December all the artists playing in this city I think it wipes the floor with anyone else. You know, Berlin's got its own thing going on, do not get me wrong. But when you look at the calibre of artists that us fold XOYO Printworks, Will Howard at LWE, Jorge at Village Underground, you know, the Art of Dark parties, all these parties, it's quality, quality, quality, quality, quality. Actually, we are actually a bit small for choice. But we do have this beat ourselves up. We always seem to think the grass is greener on the other side for some reason. I think I've heard, I would talk to a few club owners who said that something they were thinking about doing is trying to like diversify the kind of events that were happening in their venues to try and like get different revenues. Because if you're only making money from two or three nights a week, could it make, is that something that you've done or thought about doing? Something we've, I think we've definitely looked at because obviously when. we got shut down. You kind of looked at each other and went, right, basically we run a business on a Friday, Saturday and a little Sunday. It's a good Sunday, but it's a little Sunday. You know what I mean? It contributes, but it's not, he's never going to be a big money spinner. And then it's, actually we've got this venue sitting here Monday to Thursday empty. The, the ability to sustain that now just on a Friday, Saturday and a Sunday is, is, is So yeah, we are actively looking to midweek lives and we did Uncle the other week and we've got a few more coming up. We've got British Murder Boys and we're looking at other promoters to help, like Tom Baker of Meet Your Own Ears is potentially going to do a few things with us next year. Definitely, I think venues need to diversify what they do daytime and midweek. What could you be doing in the day? Well, that's the thing about Fabric. It's such a unique space. It's very difficult to be anything other than... It would be an opportunity to change it into being more functional. Go back to an abattoir. Well, they have done... funnily enough we did a kiddie rave in the day didn't we sold out quicker than a Saturday night yeah describe the scene of that kiddie rave basically we had Terry they all had little what do you call it them sound protectors on basically it's all the old ravers from back in the day who've had kids who want to go out my brother's got two because he does them as well down in Brighton So they're all there with their kids on the dance floor. It's only a three-hour in-out thing. Yeah. But, you know, they sold it out in, God, about 24 hours, didn't they? And they were all on the dance floor. You know, they all got the neon stuff on. And these kids are just dancing away to Terry playing, Terry DJing as he would on a Saturday night. Playing the same kind of music. Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Yeah, there was no Pe You know, and we've done a few of our bigger day parties on the Sundays, which we started actually before we closed, which have become a real good success, I think, for us. Yeah, they've been really good. I think the daytime mentality. of customers, I say daytime mentality, I think for a lot of people, they'd need, you can't, you know, go out Saturday night to wait o'clock, you kind of lose your whole weekend if that's not your only thing to do. Whereas if it's a daytime thing, you know, it's four till midnight on a Sunday, you go to bed, you know, you're not. well, you probably will be struggling at work, but at least it's not coming in at eight in the morning, isn't it? Yeah, exactly. I always feel conflicted about daytime raves and stuff because I'm always like, part of me is like, oh, great, I can get up at nine o'clock and go for a run. And then the other... It happens though, doesn't it? No, but there's the idea. Yeah. And then the other part of me is like, oh, it sacrificing some really important part of what club culture is. Yeah, I know what you mean. Because generally, like, best if it's an after-hours situation that you're out in the day. I would say. Do you know what I mean? You're still out from the night before. That's like my type of daytime rooming. I do agree with that. I mean, Saturday nights is all I've done. But I have found a few of the Sundays have a very unique, special feel. to them they're kind of like slow burners you know everyone comes in and they get into it and it by the end of it is really it does have a yeah and but because it's sunday everyone is there for exactly 100% the right reason um and they they do have a slightly different feel that i do i do like them But yeah, I think the Saturday night is what we're about. Yeah. Plus we do, we started to do, not many, but we started to do a few things outside of the club as well. You know, like we did Barcelona and did Exit Festival and things like that. And we're kind of sort of slowly looking for a few things like that, like help the... you know, another stream of revenue because we kind of realised we couldn't really just rely on those four walls, which we'd never ever thought about not just relying on those four walls before everything happened. Now you feel like anything's possible. Sure. You know, and so you kind of got to keep on your toes and like not put everything in one basket, which is what we did before. We just put all of our love, 110% in. into that space, that venue. But now we kind of have to sort of think about spreading it. You never know what's going to happen, do you? So, you know, we need to sort of spread that, spread that love. It is spread that fabric love everywhere. So, you know, we're just hooking up with people that we feel can deliver in the same way that we would, you know, like partners that would do that. So it's kind of like quality over quantity at the moment. Yeah, it's quite nice to sort of step out of the box and do some other stuff. So we totally didn't do it at all. It was anti it virtually, weren't we? We were almost anti it. Like we just didn't want to just go somewhere, stick your banner up and just say that's the fabric party because it was so much more a fabric party. So that's why, as I said, we're only doing it now if people can deliver. a little bit close to what we feel that an actual fabric experience would be. Same values, really, isn't it? And one of the things that's always really defined a fabric experience, I suppose, I mean, there's been one person who's had more of a musical influence on the fabric sound than anything else, right? Your resident Craig. Craig Ridge. can you tell me a little bit about what he's meant to the club and also about what it's meant for him to sort of be moving on a bit well I mean he's been a cornerstone hasn't he from the start and he's a true resident in every sense that you can put Craig with anyone he thinks about it and packs his bag to who he's playing with whereas a lot of others can just turn up and play what they play Yeah, we were, I feel like we were really, really blessed to have someone like Craig at the helm for us for 20 years. I mean, his creative genius, his wisdom, his like record box, like, you know, all of that sort of shaped the club's direction. And certainly, of course, the Saturday nights, you know. You know, he was the focus. He was always the starting point with the programming. You know, we had a really great relationship from the start. And like, you know, it was literally the programming came from his musical taste, his record box. me going out and listening to people and like, you know, collectively what we were listening to, the two of us, is what we would put on at the club, you know, or Keith, whatever Keith was listening to, my boss, you know, we were all music junkies and we all like put into the pot. But Craig was, you know, the number one there. And as I said, like all of the nights were based around him. And then he was a starting point. And then you program around him. That was like why he's named deserve to be at the top. Because it's not like he was any better than anybody else. But it's just that like he was the basis of the night. He knows how to work that floor better than anyone else. And he can play in any room, you know. He is a true resident. Like he's a digger. He's like. He is like everything I think the ultimate sort of DJ should have, those qualities that Craig possesses, you know. You should be able to, if you're as a resident, you should really be able to have a range. You should be able to play in every room. You should be able to play for anybody at any time of the night. The warm-up. the middle or the end. But I think those qualities only come from probably being a resident for 20 years. Absolutely. I shouldn't say a touring DJ, but when you become that superstar and you're playing to 5,000 people, to 1,000 people, to whatever, in a, I shouldn't say an alien room, but in a different room to a different crowd each time, I think you're very much in-out. you know what I mean I used to say at festivals you get the festival sets and like you know with Craig it's like all those abilities have come through being in there weekly from being in there like honing that skill you know that's the beauty of being a resident I think going through the tough times you probably learnt going through the tough times to going through the you know the packed dance floor times you know it's ups and downs that all add into his experience and yeah why you can always deliver really always and terry too terry was also a really good staple at the time you know with the whole tech house scene because you know terry was one of those people who's just so um consistent and reliable and it's just like you did it didn't matter what state he was in you knew he was going to always give you a good set it was like either going to be really good or it's going to be excellent you know it's like never anything less And so from all that time, is there like a personal highlight you can think of being in the club musically or dancing or something? Oh, I'm going to go back. So personally, probably the 15th birthday for me. I mean, I'd been there for five years at the time, but just the whole experience of the 15th birthday, it was, it was, it just, just amazing. Yeah, I think I agree with you. It really was one of the best times. It was a special moment, I mean, but probably. Why was it special? Take me there. Because. Because it was a culmination, I think, of everything we'd done in the 15 years leading up to it as well, musically. And like all the people that were on the lineup were people that we'd supported from, you know, the kind of near the beginning of their careers. And then they'd gone on to be kind of big. Everyone delivered. And it was just perfect. Matthew Johnson did his live when she made his CD. It's probably the... definitely the best Man for Johnson I've ever known but probably one of the best lives I've seen in the club just everything the vibe about it and everything we had Ben and Marcel doing a very German back to back for 12 hours in room 2 where it was one on one off one on one off so rigidly german it was great and the only reason we stopped it was because they had to go to ade on the leg goes and you've got to be the airport in one hour i've got to get yeah i've just got to leave now um armay dixon doing six hours six hours all day during the day they took us through the day and then ben ufo came on i think you've got that set here or we put it out the ben ufo 15th birthday set is phenomenal Everyone really thought about it and everyone really delivered. Everybody just stepped up to the play and then like to end that glorious day, night, 30 hours with Craig and Ricardo Villalobos like back to back for another 10 hours or something. It was just, what? Oh my God, honestly, I get excited just thinking about it because it really was an amazing night. I mean, it was one of the other, one of the other birthdays was. good for me was like I think it was the 10th birthday and um because um my name's Judy of course um there's like a there's a track by um Daniel Bell called Baby Judy and so of course you know people play it play it used to play it at the club all the time you know oh let's play Baby Judy for Judy you know and it is one of my favorite favorite records um anyway on the 10th birthday I think it was we managed to persuade Daniel Bell to to dig out his DPX alias and actually do a live. A live baby DJ. Because before he used to only DJ, come and DJ for us and he hadn't done lives for years. And I was like, oh, he's like, oh my God, he's so many amazing records. Like come and do a live at the club. And he's like, no, no, you know, I don't want to do it. And he's like, we managed to persuade him to do it for the 10th hey Judy you know what I'd really like to sing Baby Judy to you like live on the stage and I was just like I gotta get too emotional I don't think I can I'll be so embarrassed no no no no he's like well listen I'll leave it open it's up to you I will make an intro when I do it and then it's up to you whether you come up or not it doesn't matter I'm just still gonna play it and so I remember he was on and we're all down the front DBX and then like when Baby Judy just literally those first like bars come in you know it's that record and I remember Matt Tolfrey literally pushing me up on the stage like literally giving me a leg up and going no you've got to go up there and I'm like no I don't want to and I literally was stood there like a lemon while he played the record and I was just kind of like standing there and I just started crying because it was just so emotional like hear Daniel Bell actually playing Baby Judy because as well you know that record like obviously everybody played it but from people playing that record it then spawned Lady Judy because Baby Judy wasn't actually about me people used to think it was about me but it actually wasn't about me but then it spawned Lady Judy which was like me getting a record made about me. Dedicated to you. Dedicated to me and about me. And then I also got to feature on the cover of this. And like, you know, for me, it's like being on record is like, it's like an actor getting an Oscar, you know, it's like, this is the ultimate for me is to sort of be committed to vinyl. But you know, I've been a vinyl junkie for years, like since I was a kid. So this is like, oh my God, I've And I've actually got two now because I got Lady Judy and I was like, which Jay Hayes did. Matthew Styles and Jamie Jones remixed it. I mean, incredible. And then I had another record that my friend Heartthrob. Yeah, it's kind of like sounds like the beginning of Baby Judy. Yeah. But yeah, so now I've got two records. I've got another one on Seth Troxler's label as well. Beautiful. That's about me. So check me out. You've both been with the fabric for so long. How long will you stay? Do you think you'll be there forever? I think 20 years already is ever. Yeah. I really don't know. It feels like a decade to me. It doesn't feel like I've been there for 19 and a half years. It doesn't feel like I've been there 10 years, does it? No, it doesn't feel like you've been there for 10 years. It's just like, wow, it's gone really quickly. Yeah. I mean, I love... what I do, you know, I do, I think the stresses and pressures of it are a lot more than they used to. Yeah. So, um, it's always good to do different things, but at the moment we're, we're, we're, we're carrying on with what we do. Yeah. It's so like, yeah, of course. I mean, I do sometimes feel like, Oh, maybe I've probably been here for too long and you know, I should pass the baton. And I, always get these kind of like anxious sort of things like should I really still be doing this but it's just like I bloody love it and it is like it is my life you know I don't have anything else outside of it you don't even have a partner that's probably why it becomes your identity it shouldn't say it like that it shouldn't identify it doesn't it doesn't find who me and you are at all but everything you do is like it is a product of you in that club so when you go in there on a Saturday night when it's maybe you have bad nights you feel it and when you have good nights you embrace it and you enjoy it that I don't think there's another job that you could I do an office job no can you I don't know what else I would do to be honest I feel like if I gave up the job, I would be giving the club up for adoption or something. And so because it does feel like a child that I've nurtured from the beginning and it's just got over the turbulent teenage years and now going to be 20. So this surely is going to be great now. So I need to stick around for that. Right. And like, you know, he's not left. I don't know. And I honestly do feel like it's a child that I didn't have. And I've just like nurtured and loved it all the way through. I've given all of my love skills that I might have given to a child. I've given to the club and to the artists that go through it. You know, I'm like the big, you know, the old black mama, you know, that's what I am. It's like everyone comes through loans. It's just like, I mean, I was doing, I'd been doing stuff for a good seven years and I come and work with Judy and it's just like you learn off each other. And the, the, what do you call it? There's certain ethoses that have been passed down in fabric. But what I do agree with, and I don't mean this in a bad way, is if you ever did leave, you want to know that someone was there. Yeah. And I look behind, and I've been chatting about this with other promoters. There's no young whippersnapper going, when I was there, I wanted to do this and I fought my way up. Yeah, you're just like hungry for it. I don't see that. And I was chatting to other people and they say the same thing. There doesn't seem to be this hungry desire to be a... a 52 week a year promoter because you have to give up so much you sacrifice so much of your personal life yeah to to to to put on these shows for people and it often makes me laugh when people go so what do you do in the week? Yeah. It's just like yeah, cheers. It's like we're making it happen during the week. You just see the result. You know? Great. Amazing. Judy, Andy, thank you so much for coming in and talking to me. Thank you. Thanks for having us. The love that you took from me was always meant to be with me. The love that you took from me was always meant to be with me. Thank you. Thank you.
