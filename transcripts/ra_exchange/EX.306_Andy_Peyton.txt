Thank you. Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Andy Payton is the guest on this week's Exchange and he's one of those people whose job... is both enviable and dizzying. Essentially he's a director at hospitality and events company called the Columbo Group, but his day-to-day includes overseeing the programming and promotions for five London venues, namely XOYO, The Nest, Phonox, The Jazz Cafe and the recently acquired Camden Barfly. The Colombo group and Peyton have become a significant force in the always tumultuous London club scene, so there was loads to talk about when he stopped by our London offices a few weeks back. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Andy Payton is up next. Andy, it's probably best if we start by having you explain the exact nature of your roles these days, because there are obviously many different moving parts to what you do. So I'm one of the directors at the Colombo Group. and my role is I run the promotions team and oversee the nightclubs, which is Phonox, XOYO, The Nest, and then the new venues, which are more live, which is the Jazz Café and the Camden Barfly, which we're going to close and change the name. And then I book the DJs and oversee the team and do the programming for those venues. And similarly, I'm the programmer, along with Noah Ball, for Sunfall Festival. There may be people listening who don't know exactly what the Colombo Group is or does. Could you explain for us? Yeah, so it's a company that was set up by a guy called Steve Ball. I knew him as one shake about 10 years ago. They bought a pub and I bought a few pubs. And then that led to expansion and the first kind of foray into nightclubs was The Nest. which was, I think, five or six years ago now. And that's when I started to become involved. It's kind of curious, to say the least, that you're, well, not only involved in this many nightclubs, but involved in this many nightclubs in London. So I'm kind of interested to learn how exactly you've gotten to this. place in what feels like quite a short space of time so what's the first step for you on this path i guess moving to london i moved to london to go to university which was like 16 years ago And I was working in a bar. I was working in the elbow room in Angel, which was fun. And my degree was quite boring. I wasn't enjoying it. So I became the manager there while I was doing my degree. What were you studying? I was studying banking and finance. I studied economics at A-level and history at A-level and found it really interesting. But finance, it was very mathsy and everybody in the course wanted to work in the city. And I really, really didn't. I spent more and more time at the Barcombe Club and became the manager while I was there. And then it kind of led to me staying on after I graduated, which what seemed like a really exciting job then also seemed a little boring because it was all I was doing. So I asked kind of for no other reason than boredom if I could start putting on some events on the Sundays. These were live music events that were... utterly shambolic. I didn't know what I was doing. We'd have like a beatboxer and then a singer-songwriter and I didn't understand that the artists needed monitoring or we necessarily needed a sound man. But it was kind of promoter school, six months of that and it was the most enjoyable part of my job and I'd just reached the point where I wanted to leave and become a promoter. I really wanted to work for myself. Didn't like my boss and had, I guess, a problem with authority or with working for someone. And so, yeah, I just thought this is something I can do off my own steam. I can sit at home, sit in a cafe and do this and it'll work or not work depending on how I do. So what does that first event that you throw look like? So I was doing some events while I was working there, some at the venue, and then I got into a scene. It was very much a kind of indie. I got into the scene of booking these bands, and it was kind of around the time of the Libertines, and it was quite a close-knit scene in London. And so my first event, I think it was at the Rhythm Factory in Whitechapel. And I'd done a couple of events while I was working as the manager. I'd made like a couple of thousand pounds per show and I really thought, you know, this is a lot easier than working in the bar. And then I lost about, I think, a couple of thousand pounds on the first show. I put on like five bands. And it was a disaster. And so I think two weeks after quitting my job, I went and got a job working in a bar, just as a barman, from having managed, I don't know, 30 staff. So then I just started again. And then I was just like, OK, I need to be able to pay my rent. So I'll just work four or five nights a week. I was working at Cargo Inn. Shoreditch which at the time was a it was quite cool quite credible music venue I got to see a lot of good stuff a lot of a lot of good artists and then I was just putting on events and trying to learn as fast as I guess people would be interested to know especially considering that you do run so many venues with like such a disparate range of music being programmed like What's your kind of personal dance music history? Sort of like what gets you involved in the scene? Like what was really exciting you back in the day? Well, what happened, it was quite a, as I say, it was quite a community of indie bands and they very much centred around a lot of people who liked the Strokes and then kind of followed the Libertines and loads and loads of bands starting with the word there. So we're sort of talking about the early 2000s sort of like. Yeah, exactly. And, you know, everyone in Trilby's, me included. And it was all that. And then there just came a time where that whole scene just very, very quickly became very, very eclectic. And, you know, people now call that New Wave. And at the time it was, that was a thing, but it was a bit broader than that. So there was some acts that the NME called New Rave and the Klaxons came out and test icicles and what have you. But then there was a lot of eclecticism around that. So Uffy came along and the Ed Bangalock came along. You had a lot of indie kids starting to like that and even Hot Chip. There was these great big indie discos that started to play faster music and started to play more beats. And then I was doing a night at the 333 Mother Bar. At the same time, I was doing a night there with three floors and very different music on each floor. And it'd be like, be some MCs. I think I had Professor Green on one with DJ Medi. And then in the other floor, it'd be like Jamie T. or Jack Pignate or whatever and it was all over the shop and at the same time there was another night run by Blaze Belleville who does Boiler Room and Caius called Troubled Minds and theirs was similar and they were killing it they were putting a thousand people in and having a thousand outside same venue trying to get in and they'd have JME one floor and then some indie kids in tight jeans on another. And that really, that period was everybody just trying loads of stuff and liking loads of genres. I got to know Caius, he was an A&R guy at Excel at the time with the Young Turks label and I was managing a guy who he signed. So we got to know each other and decided to do a weekly night at the Scala on Saturdays called Chalk. And that, it only lasted six months, but it was very much the embodiment of that time with the... Sure. From, like, French rappers to, like... Diplo played, MIA played, Ronson, but then loads of bands, Kate Nash. Has that carried forward for you? Are you still kind of excited by the intersection, if you like, between guitar music and dance music and dance music and hip-hop? I think I really was up until getting the clubs more than anything because I think... The dance music that I started to put on was really, really informed by that. So it'd be stuff that came from new disco, like the, you know, the aeroplanes and, you know, Teed or whatever. But then also like Ed Banger stuff, French. And it always seemed to extend from my indie roots. But then, you know, when you're a promoter, you're putting on a night and you... You're running around and you're stressing about the front door and looking after the acts and stuff. But since I started having a club, that would mean me being in XOI or The Nest all night, every Friday and Saturday. Sure. I guess my taste kind of broadened from there and I'm far more deeper into dance music. I'd read that you did some nights at Turnmills for a time. I feel like Turnmills is always a bit of a footnote or something in London, in the sort of, you know, London dance music history, if you like, because I guess they're programmed there. quite a broad range of music which included things like trance and hardhouse so maybe it wasn't like as trendy but like in my mind it's it's a really key venue you know in that story i wonder if you can maybe talk to us about like what you were doing there and sort of like what the club was like to be honest that it's almost like every step of my career is based on a a lucky chance happening but i was never i was never programming the club itself but what happened was When I first started doing bands, somebody took out an advert in the NME and the Classified saying promoters wanted turnmills. I hadn't even heard of turnmills at the time. And it was for midweek events. So I went down there and met a guy who was working on the midweek stuff. And I started to just put on some midweek nights. Only in one room, it was very much... It was not a significant part of the history of the club, these turnmills. But kind of by good fortune, I met Danny Newman, who's the owner, who now runs Lock and Load Events, which is one of the biggest promoters. that also kind of led me into dance music because at the time he was going to start a festival called Get Loaded. It was a Happy Mondays thing, basically, at Clapham Common. And I was helping with the indie stuff. I started off, I was a runner. I was actually, my first day, I was looking after bears for the day for 12 hours. That was my job. I was volunteering. How was that? What did he have for lunch? He asked to borrow money from me. I was like 20 and I was working for free and he was trying to borrow money. He was a very interesting guy, as you can imagine. He performed as a singer in his own band in one of the small tents before the Happy Mondays performed. Right, I see. as good as you'd imagine. But yeah, that led me to kind of working on a consultancy basis with, like, for Danny, kind of helping Danny with the band stuff. But that meant I was spending every day in the office. those guys were working on South O's Four as well. And obviously their knowledge and their skill was in dance music. So I was just soaking it in and spending all day being like, who's this guy? Who's this guy on the fly? What's this guy about? Eventually, South O's Four was so much... It just made perfect sense to not do an indie day on the same day as Reading and Leeds Festival and to make South O's Four two days. And so I kind of... went on for a few years after that, like independently, but helping Danny. I see, okay. So were you kind of predominantly involved in the booking process for the festival? Yeah, yeah. And I don't want to overstate my importance in it. Danny was the booker and I was kind of just a sounding board and tried to give what knowledge I had and tried to help. honest more than anything it was a learning process for me over with else i was very very lucky to to meet him yeah sure so it would be kind of fair to say you cut your teeth in a dance music sense in in that particular environment to a degree but it was there was me seeing these great big DJs who who I don't even book now you know the big kind of trance stuff and the the Pete Tongs but then at the same time I was doing my own nights with with these you know smaller oftentimes French disco acts in East London yeah I'd also read that, I'm not sure if it was around this time, but you were doing kind of consultancy work for brands also. Is that correct? Yeah, yeah. It was kind of fell into it. Somebody at Cargo knew me because I was doing some events there, some bands, and somebody asked me to book some DJs for Ray-Ban at Wireless Festival. And it was, you know, I did that for a couple of years where it was just a thing on the side. Then I kind of got quite lucky and got given the opportunity to book. It was like five festival stages for Bacardi. And I just, it was a really big thing for me because I was very broke and it was a really good way to pay the bills. But it was also, it was a lot of experience of putting on artists at events like that. we had like bicep very very early on and dan avery really early on and i got to know a lot of people who went on to be bjs i mean how was that experience for you i mean without being kind of too mean spirited i'd imagine that it can be quite difficult to be liaising with sort of uh non-music people yeah if you like it was funny it was it was kind of absurd at times you know it was uh somebody would come on the radio and say, please could you tell the DJ to play some more mainstream music? So I'd be like, yep, sure, and run up and go up to like Optimo or someone really serious who knew what they were doing and be like, do you want a drink? They'd be like, yeah, and I'd give the thumbs up and, you know, kind of. Just managing expectations, I guess. Yeah, it's like, yeah, they'll get right on it. Yeah, I think probably all the DJs that are booked would have walked off if it hadn't been me pretending to ask them things that you probably don't want to be asking proper DJs. Do you feel like at this point there are examples of there being like a nice synergy between music and brands? Like does that, you know, do those things happily coexist? Yeah. The people I knew when I was doing that who really knew what they were doing, the agency that I worked for were really good and they would always talk about corporate culture and if the staff who work for a brand are what that brand is. then their musical taste will probably reflect the brand. I mean, Red Bull's the most obvious example, but they do a great job of... of just doing cool stuff and everyone's happy. They don't ask Francois Gay to hold up a can of Red Bull and smile at a camera. You know, it's much more natural than that. So before we go on and kind of talk about your various nightclub endeavours, I was sort of keen to try to understand what it has been. You know, I don't know if there's something in your past or, you know, something more recently, but what it's been that's really driven you. to this job and to this lifestyle. Have you ever like thought on why it is that this, you know, thing appeals to you so much? I definitely think it was not wanting to work for anyone. When I was at the Elbow Room, I didn't get on with my boss. I really like the idea of when you're a promoter, if you fail and you lose some money, then it's on you and you fix it yourself and nobody's telling you. You're doing it yourself. I think that's always been the reason for it. The position I'm in now is partially that and partially a load of chance meetings. I met Steve, Ball and Riz when I was at the elbow room because Riz was doing a student night there at the time and Steve was running fabric at the time. He was running fabric for the first eight or ten years. And meeting him and meeting Danny were purely by chance but obviously had a really big influence and really helped. So it's the nest, isn't it, that comes first in this timeline of yours. And you were involved from right at the beginning or near to the beginning? No, what happened was they started it and it was running for about a year. I was just a promoter. I was doing one night a month, but my night was doing very well. It was selling out. The other nights maybe weren't. It didn't get off to a flyer as a venue, I think it's fair to say. And Steve has always had a lot of faith in me and was kind of asking me for a very long time, will you come and be the promotions manager? And I was always kind of like, I don't want to. I don't want to work for someone you know it was flattered but it's just not what I wanted to do sure and I was happy doing loads of different things having kind of fingers in pies And then he quite cleverly, he just took me for dinner. And I DJed for him at the Queen's Head a couple of weeks before and got really drunk and acted like a bit of an idiot. And I thought he was taking me for dinner to, you know, chastise me. And he said, look, I want you to take, I'm going to give you a share of the nest. you're going to be a shareholder, you don't have to work for us, just use our office for your own stuff and give some advice. And it was an amazingly generous offer and both Riz and Steve put a lot of faith in me, which I'm very, very grateful for. And it started from there. And kind of what happened was once I had that kind of badge, once I had that, like, oh, I'm one of the owners. I'm really, really obsessed with it. I'm really proud of it. And I spent a lot of time in the venue and I've always been really obsessed with lights. I've always been very, very into the effect that lighting has on the crowd and how that affects how the venue feels. And so I started spending a lot of time in there and being a bit of a perfectionist on stuff. But at the same time, I was still doing my own nights. And I was doing a monthly night at XOYO under its whole form. And that kind of, the contrast was really clear to me. And so that's when I kind of said to Steve and Riz, we should buy XOYO. If we buy XOYO, we'll do a really good job, I think. Just before we go on to talk about XOY, I wanted to speak a little bit about the location of the Ness. Because, you know, you could almost consider the stretch that it's on, the kind of Kingsham Road into Stoke Newington Road to be like the main artery for nightlife and young people in East London. Have you kind of dealt with that location? Because I'd imagine from the outside looking in, it would be something of like, you know, a blessing and a curse at the same time because it does have quite so many people going down there. Yeah. And we've over the over the years, we've had it both ways where we've kind of been like. The venue genuinely doesn't fill itself. If we hadn't sold a certain number of tickets before Friday or Saturday, we'll be really quiet and the venue won't, we'll lose money. Surprisingly low number of people just walking up. Absolutely, yeah. The walk-up isn't what you'd expect. And at the same time, obviously, it being such a rowdy street and there is an element of you don't just want. people out to get drunk. You want people who care about the music. And we really want to sell 200 tickets before every Friday and every Saturday. Because if you bought a ticket at home, you know that it's Harry and Dominic playing or whoever. Yeah, sure. There was a period when it was the busiest area. And then Effie's license got stripped really, really tight. And it went down to, I think, midnight. And that immediately took 500 people from there. kind of further down the street towards where Alabine Dance Tunnel are and completely killed the walk up for a period. And I think it was a really good thing for us, to be honest. Yeah, because it's just the filtration almost. Yeah, and it just made us have to work for it. That's a good thing. So with XOYO, I'd seen you in the past describe it as like, you know, kind of a middle of the road space, almost, you know. back in the early days I mean what were you seeing in the club in terms of its like potential you know what what needs to change there like what did what did you see in in the venue I always saw it from day one I saw I saw a load of steps and that needed to be done you know so the very first step is that we a lot of agents would be really reluctant to put artists in there a because their experience wasn't great because of the the lights and sound and stuff weren't necessarily up to scratch and b because it was very hit and miss as to whether or not the venue would be busy and obviously an agent doesn't want to put their artists in somewhere who's going to come back and say oh there was only 50 people there all night it was really bad I always said it's not a nightclub unless we program it ourselves Fridays and Saturdays. If we're not doing that, then are we a club really? We just hire it out. All the clubs that I've always admired do it themselves. And then you can control your own artwork. You can control how the artists are treated from the moment they get off the plane. And you can control the music and the set times and everything else. kind of knew I didn't have it in me to to open this club and from having done one night a month I just thought I can't program Friday Saturdays well at the start like I can't too I was intimidated by it and I so I just said like we'll do the Fridays the Fridays are the harder one we've got some decent promoters on the Saturdays we've had like bugged out and living proof good people So that was the first step. We did the Fridays for a year. We did, you know, the opening announcement. We had Frankie Knuckles, we had Jack Green live, we had some good stuff. And it was full, all our Fridays sold out for the first year, all of them. Then we kind of plucked up the courage to do both. So when I first met you a couple of years ago, you explained to me this new concept that you come up with, whereby you would ask one DJ to play every weekend for 12 weeks across three months. My interest was certainly piqued by it. I thought maybe you were a bit nuts, or it certainly seemed risky. But having now done that for a couple of years? Third year. Third year, yeah. It seems from the outside like it was a gamble that paid off. Is that fair to say? Yeah, very much so. I was telling people about that in, I think, April, and we started it the following January. And everybody said it wouldn't work. We got a lot of negative feedback about it. What was the main thing people were saying? It depends who you're talking to. Because if it was, you know, agents and managers would say, you know, it will be dead after a few weeks because people stop coming to see, you know, the conventional wisdom is don't play any territory too often. while you kind of store up demand, which I didn't really buy. And that was the initial kind of problem with it, that it wasn't going to work. You're going to have to cancel. Six weeks in, you're going to have to look, this isn't going to work, it's petering out, which really wasn't the case. And then the other one was when we announced it. we got quite a bit of negativity from people saying, this isn't a residency. And it was a much older generation of dance music fans who were kind of angry about it, saying like, this isn't what Larry Levant did, or this, you know, this isn't... playing every week for two years, which it never claimed to be. It's just we used the word resident. Some antics, you know. Yeah. But you would assume that what you were going for was kind of combinations, really, because obviously the artist was programming and, you know, there was a collaboration going. And, yeah, you were running these combinations. Yeah, and it was a chance for the artist to tell a story about it. themselves and a lot of the DJs we've had have been quite interesting and had quite interesting stories and for me that's always been the best bit you know Scream took some really big DJs for Scream that he wanted to work with in his in his kind of new direction of house and techno But then we did one where it was a dubstep night and it was just called Scream 2001 to 2005 and it's probably the highest demand we've had for any show ever and it was everybody but we didn't announce anybody, we didn't need to. And telling those stories is always the interesting part for me. Sure. Yeah, I mean, I guess there's been a few people you've had on the residencies who definitely have distinct musical phases in their history that are sort of interesting to explore. Yeah, for sure. How has the feedback been from the DJs? What has the experience been like for them of playing the same venue on 12 consecutive weeks? It's interesting. It very much depends on the DJ. I think some got... tired by the end you know Tiga at the moment he's only four weeks in so hopefully he's not tired yet but he's he's flying from Canada every single every single Saturday wow okay but then some you know the exciting and interesting part for me is when I see a change over those periods so Jack Master when he started At the start of his residency or a few months before, his history was very, very eclectic and we had a night with Slimsy and Loafer, for example. And as time went on, every week went on, you could see that he, you know, he had a guest like Tale of Us and you could see that that was the direction he was going in and that's the direction he really wanted to go in. That's what I enjoy when it changes something within the artist. I see. So there's almost something in like that particular canvas that brings out like latent, yeah, artistic exploration or something. Yeah, I'd say it's more. It's the period in which you catch that particular artist. We missed out on a lot of guests that Bicep wanted because it was the summer and it's harder to programme in the summer with the festivals. You know, we really wanted DJ Harvey and he couldn't do it. And I think Todd Turge. So we had a much more interesting, but ultimately quite like smaller bunch of guests for them. But they put out just, you know, a couple of months before. and everybody was there every week to see Bicep. They were getting bigger and bigger and bigger throughout those three months, and it was a really great time. It was really good for us and for them, I think. So presumably in the time you've been involved or running XOR, you've achieved lots of your personal goals and had a great deal of success. I'm wondering when this opportunity comes up, this is, you know, potentially a new club down in Brixton. Like, what about this appeals to you? What do you want to potentially achieve with this new space? And, you know, how is that different to XOYO? It was a big challenge in my head to be able to open Fridays and Saturdays and to be able to open XOYO at all. But then you start to go, OK, well, we can do that now. And as agents accept that artists want to play there, it becomes easier. I don't want to take time off. I want to be busy. I enjoy being busy. And so we were looking around for two years, to be honest, for another club. I guess I had that thing of anyone who doesn't live south of the river. been a little bit dismissive of it. I never, oh no, I wouldn't go there, it's too far. But then we did a couple of outside events at Brixton Electric. The crowd was great and the area was really, really nice. And I just, I really like how vibrant the place is, the area is. And then somebody said Plan B was potentially for sale. I was so excited, to be honest. I was really like... my chance to not learn on the job as I did with XOI, but my chance to kind of start from a position of better knowledge. Yeah, I see. I mean, what were your first impressions of the space? Well, I'd been in there before, but not too much. And when we knew we could get it, I went down, brought my whole promo team down and we spent a night just kind of sat in there. just observing and there was a lot of things that we thought would be relatively quick there was a lot of things that we thought would change straight away it took me two seconds to decide they were running upstairs and downstairs as two separate clubs And downstairs, I went on this particular night, there was about 10 people in there and an emcee being like, can you hear me, London? And we were like, the stream's got to go. Let's put some seats in and let people come out to dance. And Exwayo and The Nest are both quite claustrophobic venues because we like them quite dark and quite smoky. the shape of them and I thought having somewhere seated would actually be a really a really good thing so it's just a general overspill area almost yeah yeah yeah is it places to step out for a minute and you know the dj booth was as you walked in it was on your right seat you walked past the dj kind of in front of his face on the way to the bar and it or her face and it was it was a bit it seemed odd that it wasn't on the other side so we just moved it and then just a few things like that yeah because it did previously create that just corridor effect didn't it where the front of the dance floor which I guess should be the sweet spot was the bit that people were walking through constantly yeah and there was a few changes like that and you know it was a real treat because I'm really into lighting that I got to kind of design it from from scratch and And, you know, the lighting, anyone who's been to Phonux, it's a really big feature of it. It's a really important part of what it is. So thinking in the sort of broadest terms, what was the sort of concept that you wanted to pursue for Phonux? Well, I spent my time when we announced the residency at XOYO reading a lot of kind of... think pieces by angry old clubbers who were like, this isn't a real residency. A real residency was. And there was some very perfectly valid arguments about if somebody spends all night in the same space every week, they develop this relationship with an audience. And all the things that they were saying was actually right. And I agreed with it. And I thought, I'd really like the opportunity to try and do that. There is the consideration that a venue the size of XOYO, if we just had one DJ, we wouldn't fill it in truth. And I thought this was the right size that we might be able to get away with it. Do you feel like the risk that you took with the three-month residencies at XOYO kind of emboldened you in a way to take this risk again? Exactly, because the risk wasn't that high because I was getting big guests. But actually, I realised, you know, week nine or ten of the first one of Eat Everything's residency, everyone was like, I'm going to go and see Eat Everything tonight. And the guests became secondary. That always changes with who it is to a degree of who it is, you know, whether they're coming to see specifically the resident or the guests. But it definitely made me feel that way. And how did you decide on Jasper James as being the guy? Saw him DJ. I hate it when people suggest DJs to me. Like if an agent says, do you want to put this act on? I don't know, I'm kind of suspicious. I feel like I want to have discovered them and someone else will have an agenda. And we booked Moody Man for Jack Masters' residency. And he's phoned me up and said, we'll get this guy Jasper James down. I said, is that your mate? And he's like, yeah. So I said, oh, God, is that right? So we put him on and he was brilliant, really good. And so I don't know, I took a shine to him. So we put him on again at the Nest a couple of times. And I just made a point of going and watching him. And I just think he's a really, really He's so, so strong-minded in what music is good and what music isn't. He's very opinionated. You can't influence him on that sort of thing at all. it just felt right. I felt like he was the one for this. How has he been handling it on a week-to-week basis? Is there quite a lot of difference between what he's playing week-to-week, speaking to him, how has it been going for him? Yeah, I mean, for one thing, there's very few records he plays more than once. He spends all week digging and it's so broad and for such a long set, every week, it's very, very... He really goes deep and I think every week that passes... He said to me in January, he said, I'm getting better every week and he's realised that he can go really deep and he doesn't have to get the crowd's hands in the air. He doesn't have to... Whilst he is there to entertain, he's really, really his own man. And the crowd are really responding to it. So it's... And I think it'd be interesting to see where he is in six months. Yeah, I guess if he didn't play with such frequency, he wouldn't be able to gradually test the waters in the way that he has been. Exactly. And, you know, the initial kind of criticism or the initial worry with having Jasper James or having a DJ play every Saturday. Firstly, OK, it's going to be empty. No one will go. And then the second thing is, OK, it's going to be full, but you'll get kind of estate agents from Clapham, lowest common denominator, because it's just, oh, it's Saturday night, let's go to the club, as opposed to music fans. And, you know, the things we put in place at the club, like no photography and a few things like that, but mostly Jasper's music. is the reason that the crowd's really good, you know. So Phonics opened less than a year ago. Yeah, September. And you're already on to the next venue. You guys have just taken over Jazz Cafe, which is opening next month. So, yeah, another one for the portfolio. Yeah, yeah, so we got the Jazz Cafe. I have to say that it's Steve Ball, he's always had a soft spot for the venue, being a music fan, and especially, you know, I think it was fair to say it was kind of in its heyday maybe a decade ago or so, and they were having a lot of really high-profile live artists and jazz-influenced live artists. Yeah, when it became available, we were all really keen. I think if we were buying another nightclub, we probably wouldn't do it. We'd probably be like, it's a bit soon. But this is a concert venue. first and foremost we'll put on gigs and it won't I don't think it's going to have any effect on the clubs I'd read a tweet that you'd put out a couple weeks ago you know within the last couple of weeks where you said we're presently putting the DJ booth in at Jazz Cafe if you're the type of person who moans on internet forums about the layout of clubs like come come down and we'll see if we can accommodate you What is your relationship like with the whole internet commenting, RA threads in particular? Because I imagine on the one hand it would be very useful to get direct feedback from customers, but then on the other hand incredibly frustrating. Yeah, I just think everybody has their right to an opinion. And whilst I think sometimes internet forums can be the extreme view of what the main thrust of public opinion might be, it's still good to know. And, you know, sometimes I see things on there that are not true. But I think in general, you just have to be positive about it and have to take it as, well, we'll try better. If you didn't like that, we'll try better. Do you tend to personally get stuck in and sort of respond to people or do you have a policy? I tend to try not to. I don't very often, to be honest. You know, if someone tweets at me something wrong, I mean, if it's a complaint, if something, you had a bad night. That's really, really important. And if anybody tweets at the clubs and they had a problem, you know, we email them and we really try and fix it. I think that's important in this day and age. I say you can't get annoyed if people are moaning. You have to try and fix it and try and do better. So speaking of points of complaint, festivals. you're getting back into the festival game. Yes. What would you say was the, I was going to say gap in the market, but like what was the necessity to get some form out there? Like what were you seeing that was missing? Well, I personally missed working on festivals. I think it's quite exciting. And it was, And obviously London's very, very competitive for festivals, maybe even more so than clubs. But I missed it. I missed the competition. I missed the interesting curation of it. And we'd been trying for a couple of years to do something. And then we got approached in the summer, last summer, by the guys who do Dimensions and Outlook, by Noah and Joe. And they said, you know... we've got this site it's on it's in brixton and um do you fancy doing a festival with us and we said yeah we did so you guys have gone for a single day concept and then you're pairing it with night time exactly club related stuff yeah what happened was the about three or four years ago you know that festival wildlife with disclosure and rudimental I think very early on when that was mooted, somebody who was involved said to me, oh, you know, this might be in London, maybe you can get involved in some way to come up with some good idea because... Otherwise it would be like a big, you know, a national promoter. And I wrote this, I just spent an evening, I wrote this great big long essay about people love being outside and they love going to parks, but music fans hate the sound restrictions and, you know, the short sets and the things that come within an inner city festival. And I said, maybe you could come, maybe you could. combine the two and choose your ticket in advance and say, you know, I'll buy this ticket, which is Bussey Building and the park. I wrote this for East London. I wrote this was like XYO and Village Underground. But I don't know if anyone ever saw that. we didn't get involved, no one asked us to get involved so I don't know if anyone ever saw that and rejected the idea but I just kind of had it in my mind and then when we got approached I kind of just forwarded that idea to the guys and they loved it and you know those guys, they know about sound systems they really care And so it made a lot of sense to us. So in terms of the day portion, are you going to have something resembling the classic, like green space and tents sort of set up? Yeah, very much so. I mean, it's a big, the festival's not very big. The festival's only 10,000 people this year. But it's a quite big site for that size. So I think it'd be quite nice that we can space it out. And then there's four arenas. Have you been assured that the noise factor is not going to be a thing? Because obviously it's such a bone of contention in London, like inner city festivals. I definitely, I have been assured by it. I definitely take every assurance with a pinch of salt from experience. And, you know, nobody's ever going to go to a festival in the centre of London. and hear a sound system that sounds like Berghain, it's just not going to happen. But at the same time, the big thing I've learned from this, whilst production's not really my thing, I'm booking the DJs, the emails I see where it's like, do you want this sound system or this sound system? Do you want to double skin the tents to insulate it? That sort of thing is a lot. pretty much down to what you're willing to invest. We're just, from day one, we sell out to break even. We won't make a penny from it. That's not the point. We want to grow something. Outlook and Dimensions reputation in Croatia is for sound systems, really good sound systems. We want to do the best we possibly can. So we've been talking about these numerous projects that you currently have on the go, but I'm wondering, is there a personal risk to you or maybe thinking more widely about spreading yourself? too thin no I'm sure there will be at some point but I'm nowhere near that I found myself say I'm booking seven or eight months ahead for the DJs for the clubs I found myself last January staring at spreadsheet and being like you know, I want to book November, I've booked October sort of thing. And maybe accepting some bookings that I shouldn't have and maybe wanting to get something done rather than being like, if I wait three weeks, I'll get an answer on somebody I really want. And I think that... I think I took a little back step by not being busy enough and by wanting to complete work, which isn't how it should be. It should be let's do it right. And since we've opened Phonox and started working on Sunfall and Jazz Cafe, I find myself now, right, I really want this DJ to play this date seven months ahead. And the agent's like, we're not going to decide yet. And rather than... getting my second choice I'll just go and work on something else the more hyperactive I am the happier I am to be honest I work in the evenings a lot I like watching tv and sending offers we're nowhere near I certainly could take on more work to be honest I mean what would you say at this point in time is the biggest challenge you face on a day-to-day basis in your professional life I guess it's with each venue, it's finding the balance of I'm not the guy who puts in all the money for these nightclubs, there's investors. my responsibility to them is to give them a return. But at the same time, I wouldn't do it if it was something I wouldn't be proud of. You're faced with a conflicting thing of, on the one hand, you have to sell the tickets, you want it to be really busy. On the other hand, you don't want it to be sell-out, you don't want it to be too mainstream. And I think that's why there's a real premium on certain DJs who can do both. You know, try booking Fortet. It's really hard. And I think getting that balance is the hard pit when you're booking what will be 12 weekend nights a week soon. You know, having the patience to wait rather than accepting. Reining myself in is, I guess, the... the answer to that question yeah because i'd seen you'd uh mentioned in the past the fact that you'd done some like student orientated nights outside of london and um you know you'd had some time to think about it and reach a conclusion that it was something you did more for the money and in your mind you'd maybe cross something of a red line or something i found that really interesting yeah 100 we we got approach We have a student promoter on a Tuesday, XOYO, it's a really good promoter, or a Monday, and they asked us, they said, oh, we can book all these, fill all these venues in regionally, which need you to book the talent and we'll be partners on it. And I think we thought, you know, this will be good money. And I don't think we've ever done anything like that before, to be totally honest. It would be much easier to make more money than we by it being less good, is the truth. You know, it's in a really busy area. We could put on 200-pound DJs playing chart music on a Saturday and... It'd probably be full and we wouldn't have to have a really good sound system. And I think those nights failed. Those nights were really rubbish, the student nights that we did. And I completely walked away being like, I'm glad they failed. And we were like, let's not just do something for money. It sounds a bit cosmic and I'm really not a hippie at all. I'm not that guy, but I think do things for the right reasons. I want to finish up by just talking a bit more generally about London, because the state of nightlife here is kind of an ongoing topic of discussion. We'd had Alan Miller from the NTIA come through as part of a roundtable discussion within the last couple. months he'd said that a a nighttime champion for london was the most vital step that needs to be taken to kind of ensure a healthy future for the industry yeah is that something you would personally subscribe to yeah definitely i think that with the restrictions on licensing that there's all i really think that should happen is that there should be two sides to the argument if somebody who lives 200 meters away says it's too it's too loud the reaction is, OK, turn it down. And sometimes the arguments are much more nuanced than that. I don't think we need to have a free reign. We have enormous and expensive responsibilities with all our venues, which we fulfil. We have stewards shushing people 100 metres away from Exhawayo on a Saturday night. We pay people to do that. There's no reason why those people should shush. They don't have to listen to our guys. But, you know, that's fine. We do that. We spend that money because it's within our responsibility. I really don't have any problem with that. I just have a problem with complete one-sidedness and with quite draconian decision-making. If something goes wrong, it's like, OK. Now he's shut two hours earlier. I think a little bit of balance is all any of us are really asking for. Do you feel like it's a realistic aim for the club community to come together in London in what is such a competitive marketplace? Well, I think it's happening with the NTIA. I think that the goodwill is there. Everybody understands that it's mutually beneficial. And I think more than anything, we've all had our own issues with it. We've all had our own problems with it. And therefore, we all know that it has to be done. It needs to be done. Yeah, I mean, I guess it's fair to say it's in the collective interest. Yeah, for sure. Something to be done. Another point that Alan and Dan raised was that they felt as though nightlife in London and maybe further afield in the UK is kind of culturally undervalued, if you like. Yeah, I wanted to... to ask you if that's something you'd agree with but also what can be done about this I completely agree with it and like annoying as it is the reality is that the NTIA will tell you that it's lobbying in the way that you know I'm really not involved in that stuff because I'm kind of doing day to day running the clubs but you know the lobbying and the things that you hear about with paying somebody to lobby MPs and to, you know, do studies and all that stuff, which is quite laborious and expensive and time-consuming. It's the only way because... you have to shift public opinion. Okay, so with all of the many projects you have on your plate, I'm assuming you're not adding anything else in the foreseeable future? I don't know about necessarily adding anything. I feel like we've got quite a big year ahead for Exhawai'o. After Tiga's residency, we're going to move the quarterly residencies to Fridays. And then from August onwards, we're going to do Saturdays in-house. And it's very much... It's very much going to be our own programming and it's very much going to be the sound that we want XOY to have and it to be our identity and that's something we've been working on for a long time. I'm really kind of excited and looking forward to doing that and it being the music that we want to showcase. Are you able to give any details about what that sound might be like? I won't try to define it. too much but August we start off with DJ Harvey playing he's going to play every Saturday start to finish with no guests and then after that it'll be different guests each week programmed but you know if there was an embodiment of the sound that we like it's probably Harvey Hello.
