Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Christine Kikari and I work for RA Tickets. DJ and producer Giles Smith is invariably linked with Secret Sundays, the party that's been one of the cornerstones of London's Sunday clubbing scene for the past decade. With co-founder and fellow resident James Priestley, Secret Sundays has grown to include regular parties outside of the UK, a record label and most recently the Secret Agency, a boutique bookings roster that represents... the likes of Shea Demeer, Adam Marshall and W. Beezer. As Secret Sundays prepare to mark their 10th anniversary year, I met with Giles to talk about the early days of the party, his production work with Martin Dawson as two armadillos, and some of the reasons behind Giles and James' recent decision to take Secret Sundays back to its roots. I guess when I first started going out in about 1992, it was actually a really big scene, kind of as much as there was in London, because it was more in the countryside and there was still a lot of illegal parties. We used to kind of like go to things like Love of Life, which is like a big sports center. It's about 3,000 people. And they have all the kind of obvious big drum-based DJs like Slipknot and... Randall and I don't know, Bookham and stuff like that. And I was never particularly into that, but it was the whole excitement of going out all night and partying that excited me at the beginning. But really, really quickly, the second room in these raised rooms was more house room and that's what I gravitated towards. But Cambridge is a, yeah, it's a beautiful city. It's obviously got like the river running through it. You can go punting in the summertime. It's really, really facial doubt. And yeah, I mean, it's a place you wouldn't go for a weekend these days, but I wouldn't want to live there anymore. And when you were going to these raves and experiencing house music, at what point did you start buying records? Because I read in an interview that you had a master... something yeah a few thousand records before you even considered DJing yeah absolutely yeah I probably had probably not maybe not a few thousand but probably like at least a thousand records just because you know going to the going to those rows um obviously the mixtapes being passed around like you know I remember I used to have like Danny Ramplings like one to ten and stuff like this And they were just, you know, like, bootleg tape recorded from the parties. But I really wanted to access the individual music. Even though I didn't want to DJ, I wanted the records. And, of course... Why was there that separation between... I mean, I would imagine that being in this environment and hearing the music, that DJing would be the kind of next natural step. Was there something that was stopping you from wanting to do that or was it just all about music for you? No, I think, I don't know, it was just very much, I love the whole scene, the party and the social side of it, but I did really, really just, you know, the music, particularly the house, the stuff that I heard early on when you started recording with me, and there was, you know, back then it was crazy to think that now, you know, we've only got like a handful of cities that really have a number of good record stores, but back then there was a dance music miles from Cambridge. The fact that you could buy a house there, I was just exposed to it and going to the shops, the social side of hanging out and listening to music. and sharing ideas with people was something that I did on a regular basis. I've always liked collecting things, I've been quite nostalgic and I guess collecting records is something that fits in with that. And do you remember any of the early releases that you picked up when you were... Yeah, I just remember like... It was about '92 and I remember quite vividly that the Ministry of Sound's first compilation series, The Sessions, started. And, you know, I mean, despite people say that ministry that, you know, now and stuff like that, they were, you know, obviously doing pretty much what Fabric does. They were very, very cutting edge, if not even more so because they bought it to London for the first time and bought a lot of Jesus like Larry Levan, you know, and kind of people like later kind of the garage thing came from just go like people like Tony Humphries and CJ McIntosh and stuff like that. And the It was made by Tony Humphries. And there were lots of things, like early Express 2 records. You know, like some kind of quite soulful... stuff like Arizona and Seven Grand Housing Authority like Terence Parker stuff like that and yeah I remember just listening to that mix and picking up loads of those on vinyl and that was the start for me maybe there was a few sneaky German bass records first but not very many I kind of quit it And at that stage, were you aware of what was happening with Ministry of Sound in London? Obviously you would have been if you were... Yeah, yeah, I actually... It's weird because, and I don't know why, but I never actually went to ministry when I was really young. I actually used to go because I think maybe it was like... I was going out when I was 15, I was going to London when I was 15. The ministry was like, I think it was like 21 or something like that. I don I went to places like Club UK, which is in Wandsworth, and also the gardening club, Club for Life and Covent Garden. There's quite a lot of soulful, borderline, more cheesy stuff, even like John of the Police. women like Anne McKenzie from D-Rim and stuff like that, people like playing there but I think it was a few years after, especially at university, like when I was 17, 18, I guess, no 18, yeah, that I was going back to basics quite a lot in Leeds and that was like a really influential thing for me, seeing loads of people that I'd kind of maybe seen before but like on a really regular basis, I was living on the doorstep of the club. I don't quite know how I managed to get my degree in the end but I did and you know they'd have everyone from like you know Basement Jacks Express to to I don't know like Lou Vega to there were definitely basics you know were really inspired me definitely in terms of booking tickets on those in terms of they were kind of cutting edge they brought people like Derek Carter and Mark Freen over for the first time, I think pretty much before anyone else in London. And Doc Martin as well, who I still love to this day as a DJ. So going back to basics, I built up a network of people that I knew and I just love the DJs. Maybe from like, I might have seen London senior leads at university maybe like recognise me and this crazy kid kind of like asking what record he was playing and stuff like that, you know? So I've kind of got my face like known in that way. Yeah. Yeah. And at what stage did that transition into being interested in DJing? Funny thing is, is that I was kind of almost like suddenly pushed into DJing by my friends because I kind of amassed all these records and everyone was like "what are you doing with them?" and stuff and I think other people who arguably knew maybe a bit less than what I knew or kind of just jumped onto the DJing thing as it became like a little bit trendy or whatever, be cool, get girls or whatever and I was like... I just wanted to enjoy the music. So my brother and some friends were like, I think my mother bought me one turntable just to listen to music on. So I had one Technics, which I just had at university. I just remember having one for at least one year or so with an amp. speakers and just playing tracks and then like, me and my brother and my friends were all kind of like saying to me like, come on you should start DJing, loads of good records and actually they were kind of saying things to me like, we'd rather hear your records than half the DJs that we hear in clubs and I guess that did kind of, you know. encouraged me that maybe I should start messing around with the decks. I remember like, as funny and silly as it sounds, I remember actually starting to mix and then being frustrated about it at the beginning when I couldn't mix and going, you know, why do I want to mix this record if I don't want to listen to it from the start to the finish? And I still have that kind of... philosophy in mind sometimes today with records that are really special that there are some records that are so special you shouldn't really almost mix them and present them as they are and I think I was using that as an excuse. And I read in an interview that you did that both you and James consider Ibiza to be be a pretty formative influence. Yeah. Which seems to be pretty common within people of a certain age from the UK. Yeah. And not being from the UK. Yeah. Just tell me, what does that mean to you? Well, very, very different to say how Ibiza is now. I mean, sort of, at least they told us about, you know, how it wasn't what it used to be and all of that. But I went to Ibiza as well when I was 15, yeah, 15, 16. So it was, that's like So I kind of saw it, you know, it wasn't 88, but it was, you know, still in its really sort of formative years. It's kind of the tail end. Yeah, and just going to places like Space on Sunday, it wasn't like We Love, it was just Space, it was just Space on Sunday. And it didn't open, it didn't go on for 24 hours, it went on for like about 12 hours. And it started in the morning time. My friends and I used to stay in these apartments very, very close in a quite commercial area because we didn't have much money at the age of 15. Gave up on Sunday morning. some breakfast and then go to space and we'd be there like 10 in the morning. I've always enjoyed, actually, I think it comes to my whole thing about seeing something develop, like even building DJ sets, seeing it slowly develop. I'd like to get to the club really early and see the kind of music they were playing really early on when it was empty and also just see the whole party developing and growing. In terms of how it's influenced Secret Sundays and our kind of philosophy, it was definitely... just the kind of vibrancy and colourfulness of the scene and the people. I mean, really honestly, when I go to a piece and now I still see some of those characters, but there was a lot of the old hippies that were still, there's still quite a fair few of them knocking around, but they were kind of a lot more dominant. parties and I remember being sat at a table in space in a certain state of consciousness with a group of people that were just completely different from some guy wearing a suit like a complete gangster spiv to this fucking full-blown Red Indian guy, I mean, this is not some guy in fancy dresses, this is real McCoy, to me or some other raver. Those kind of experiences and seeing that's like, wow, that's what, so going back, that's what was really inspiring us to Secret Sundays and wanting to have this open, colorful daytime thing. And also the music as well, the music was obviously, the music you hear in the daytime is a lot more groovy and sexy, I guess, than you might hear, you know, in the middle of the night sometimes in a dark club. There was also some residents like Daniel Klein, I remember him playing some great sets. And just his programming. I think that's something that's really, really important to me as a DJ, him really kind of building and steadily, but then there being these kind of gateway records where everything would kind of flip into a different dimension, but very subtly and I guess in a kind of sophisticated way. Being in the position that you are where you're putting on your own parties and having guests, that you'll find yourself in a position where you are warming up or closing out the night. Yeah. So were there any other DJs who, around that time, in Ibiza or in the UK, who had any kind of influence on you in terms of programming your sets? Oh, yeah. I mean, definitely... I'd say Ralph Lawson in Leeds was a really big influence on me and Huggy as well who was living in Leeds, I think he lives in Miami now but they were both great Walmart DJs, you know great, they're great DJs at full stop but they played with all these people I mentioned earlier and they could really set the scene accordingly you know I mean Ralph Lawson was definitely a big influence back then. So when you moved to London, what was your intention initially? I didn't really have any plans, I just wanted to move to a big city. I just moved to a big city, I had my degree, I thought I could get a reasonable job, do the right thing or whatever that was. ended up working in a fashion PR company for about, I don't know, quite a short time actually, about six months. And yeah, obviously going out a lot then and enjoying London and stuff like that. I went to Fabric the very week or so it opened or the week after it opened and also going to the end a lot. What was the opening weekend at Fabric like? I don't think I went to the opening weekend, but I went very quickly, like in a week or two afterwards when Francois O'Kay played there. And actually, we played an incredible set that day. Was it in the main room? It was in the main room, yeah, it was in the main room. And it was, I remember getting there, actually. It's quite a funny story, because it actually was my birthday, and I went with... just with like a couple of friends it wasn't like a lot of us just two or three of us that were kind of a bit more hardcore party I suppose at that time and um I was with Christoph who's one of my best friends and I remember we got there quite late um not late but not at the beginning and there was this huge coup and it was like Christoph was late so I was I was furious with him because like We're actually like we're in the back of the queue and then sure enough like after like half an hour staying in the queue and not moving the bouncer came up with like a megaphone and said like the club is full everybody go get out the queue and I just saw Rocky and Ashley Liddle and Terry Farley and some of the guys from I later went on to play with Faith walking in the club and I kind of shout out to them and managed to get most of myself in with Christa. Did you know them at that stage? Yeah, yeah I did. I knew them from like maybe, I knew Terry Farley from maybe Ibiza when I was like 15, 16. I remember walking in there and you know I've been to big clubs before, I mean Amnesia in Ibiza is obviously bigger but it was, you know being in the main room just the... Just the kind of intensity of the main room and it was very very busy it was in this kind of rule there was such a buzz about the club at then and obviously Fast RK being a legendary DJ and producer it was a really busy night and it was like I can remember literally walking in getting straight on the dance floor and it was like a bit of a way of being a bit actually carry what wasn't able well actually weren't really able to dance that much but it didn't bother me it was kind of fun and but then it was by about four in the morning, you know, all the kind of pretenders or whatever had gone home. Faith seems to hold this like mythical place within London, the House of His Uniters. So tell me a little bit more about it and how you kind of became one of their residents. I kind of just got my face known, I guess, by going to some of the parties around from London to Leeds where Terry and... And also Pete Haller, Chase Farley and Pete Haller were playing and also the Esports2 guys, Ashley Liddle, Rocky and Diesel. And I kind of became friendly with them just through following them and seeing them playing in both London and Leeds. And they used to do a regular boat party once a summer. And I remember actually having a house party back at my house after the boat party. and it ended up that, it wasn't Ashley, it was Ross Allen and Terry Farley and a few others came back to my house and I was just playing records there and actually it was just like after that after party, one of them called me the following week and just said do you want to come play for us? That was pretty cool. I was like, it was crazy because actually like... I'd only played at three or four different venues before, two of them being this really small bar in Fulham. I can't even remember how I got that gig. And then to then go from like playing three or four times, three or four places, probably a handful of times, to then go and play, I think my first Keeps of Faith was at Terminals and I was playing with Ashley Beale, Doug Triton, Doug Martin. So it was like quite a big jump. I was very, very nervous. But yeah, thoroughly rehearsed myself. How much time did you spend preparing? Absolutely loads. Definitely thought about it for days. To be honest, it's my first gig and to go from playing at the bar to where People didn't really care about the music very much and for them to play in turnouts with people like Doug Martin and Doug Shrive and whatever, I did really, really kind of like get my head down and look at my records and, you know, pretty much have... like an order in mind how I was going to play which I pretty much stuck to but it worked for me that night. And were the parties like based at a particular venue or part of London or were they in London? No, they were always in a different, quite often in different venues. I remember a few being in Soho in a few different places which I hadn't been to before and so they used to do a party every year which was fun. on this ridiculously impressive boat. I don't know how the hell they blagged. I think they knew someone who knew someone. I remember being in the queue to get on the boat. We were down by the tent. South Bank on the side where you often go on the Berkshire parties and there'd be this kind of shadow cast on everyone turns around and it's just like this ferry, it was a huge boat and we were just like they're not letting us on that are they? and we couldn't believe it you see like boat passes normally they're quite small this is this extremely like luxury cruiser or something and yeah it was fun this idea of Parties moving around to different locations. It seems to be pretty regular in London. Do you mean for Secret Sundays in particular? No, just in general. Just for venues, yeah. I mean, I think now it's become part of the sort of fabric in them. Despite the fact that there's a lot of clubs in London, there's really a lack of good middle-sized clubs, I would say, in London. Unlike some, maybe Berlin, I would probably argue. In terms of like, you know, there might be a lot of clubs, but there aren't that many good small or medium-sized clubs with good sound systems, a nice aesthetic, you know, not too pretentious or whatever, you know. So I think people have, you know, promoters in London are definitely looking to more warehouse type spaces, which they can, you know. which suit their vision for the party. For Secret Sundays, I mean, kind of, it actually was quite accidental that it became quite peripatetic because we were actually kicked out of the first two venues that we did the party at because of various reasons. The first one was that The music was too loud. I mean, the room that we used was actually a room which doesn't exist anymore, which no one, people talk about the other venue, but they don't know this room. It was a loft room, which was pretty much the reason why it disappeared, because the sound bled out onto this council estate behind the venue, and the sound pollution being on the terrace was that much worse. spread much more and we kind of were basically our sound guys were very very enthusiastic it's guys we work with to this day all our parties and they really rinsed out one day and I got a phone call on a Monday just at the party was really kind of really exploding I think the second was pretty much in the beginning of the second year saying you know, that's it, you can't do anymore, we're going to get closed down if we're not willing to risk our license even though you're bringing all these people to the club on Sunday, a day when there was never people at the club, you know. And then after that we went to a place called The Poet and that was just totally illegal and after one year that got closed down for pretty much the same reason. So my point being that, you know, we were kind of... We're kind of forced on that road of being, of moving around, you know. So it actually causes a lot of stress. I can imagine. Yeah. But let's backtrack a little bit. I know the motivation was basically just to bring all of your friends together. Yeah. It really wasn't that much more than that. Christina was like, just do a party for our friends and play the music we wanted. It wasn't like this. We didn't have this vision for the actual whole Sunday daytime thing. I run it really ironically, despite what I've told you about be through and stuff like that. So I think more than subconsciously, consciously influencing what we do. It was actually quite accidental we did Sunday because when we were actually looking for the club, we were looking for the right venue, we were actually looking everywhere in London, we were looking north, south, east, west and the plan wasn't really to do a Sunday party, it was to do a party in a good venue and it was just simply that it turned out we... We got transfixed on that room in 9350 East, the loft room. And it turned out the only way they'd actually give us that room alone was to do it on a Sunday. First summer, we didn't even have that many guests. It really wasn't a plan. And if he did it was kind of like often like see one of the faith guys that I was kind of friendly with and someone local living in London. It was only actually, you know, I think left a part of the first summer we got like, we got two shorts the first time in London or second time in London ever. I think after the album launch and also like Don Martin played and Joshua played from Is and Is. I was kind of really into it at the time and they were great DJs as well. What was the kind of Sunday day party scene like? Because I read somewhere today, I didn't realise this, that you used to work on the door for Lazy Dog. Yeah, I did, yeah, yeah. Which, for anybody who isn't familiar with it, was quite a legendary Sunday party at Notting Hill Arts Club. That's right, yeah, yeah. Lazy Dog, yeah, Lazy Dog was, you know, obviously like inspiration in a sense that it was on a Sunday and it was a daytime thing. But that was before we started Secret Sundays and it had actually finished. Or it hadn't finished, but it finished quite soon after we started Secret Sundays. In East London there weren't that many clubs, there wasn't really a scene. I can honestly say that there weren't, I don't remember when we started Secret Sundays there being any daytime clubs at all really playing modern dance music. Of course the things that were lazed up were a big influence to me in space and the people on Sundays were a big influence to me. I heard about Falsett, I've got no way in there, but you know, that was a, you know, so, but definitely, you know, ever since we started, it's a completely different story now. Bye. Has it become easier for you because this whole culture of after parties in East London on a Sunday, there's so many of them at the moment. Has it become easier for you just in terms of organisation and bureaucratic stuff that you need to go through? No, no, it's not really become easier at all. It's become, I would say, more difficult in the sense that East London is a shorter share of it. much more liberal like we started 12, 10, 12, 10 years ago. So, um... I think we did some thinking about some things that we did some crazy things you know like we just got we had a friend who had like a lease on a building well he had well he'd never leased on the building he had a lease on one of the floors of a building and and he was like a furniture designer and he he was pretty out there and he he he said he was willing to give us like let us do a party on the roof of this building which he just had a floor and he wasn't even there in the building And, you know, we walked out there and did a party there with like three days planning and thought put into it. And it was an amazing party. And people talk about it to this day. You can't do those kind of things now in Islam. It's not easier. It's harder. And because now there's loads more promoters doing Sunday parties. I mean, I don't just... to kind of, we've never seen tickets as an after party. It's not starting at like, for me an after party would start at six, eight, even ten in the morning. We start at two in the afternoon and most clubs in London finish at six. So, you know, there might be people coming that might have been out all night but actually, you know, particularly back in the day and I'd say throughout most of the history and even now. A lot of people come to see the Sundays really fresh and to enjoy it. Was that a conscious choice on your part? To start at 2? Yeah, to start in the afternoon so it's not kind of bleeding over from the night before necessarily. I don't know, I think quite often we were usually still awake the night before we started the party. I definitely remember rolling on quite a few times. and getting to the venue in a complete state but still enjoying and setting up the party and having loads of friends there, helping out with banners and stuff like that. But no, I don't think it was that conscious because... What were some of the other highlights in terms of venues and parties? Definitely just in sheer fun and excitement and also in terms of the crowd being... bit more like that kind of space in the booth on Sundays that I talked about when I was 15 being with all sorts of different people when we started the party at 93 feet east we'd have like a we still maintain to this day like a you know quite a following from the gay scene but there was definitely some really flamboyant characters you know at 93 feet east and also the poet as well, the second venue I told you about, which is like actually basically a beer garden and a pub, but it was incredible because it had these very, very high walls. It was probably like 12 feet high, and the dance floor was wooden decking, so it was good for the sound, and it had like... there's raised levels, like it was like dance, not platforms, but like at the back, this raised area where you could dance on. So you had this different dynamic and the poet definitely was like a really, really important venue. I mean, I remember, like, trying to persuade people like Ivan Smag and Andy Graff-Lawson, who, you know, was someone I knew, but was quite, you know, just had to see if they could win one a lot at that time to try and come and play at Secret Sambos and persuade them to come down and do it before the hype had really kind of got, you know, outside London. And them just walking in and just going, you know, they'd walk in through the gates 600 people jammed into this terrace garden with this pub and they'd just be like, wow. You could just see them from their faces and it was a really intense experience. There were some one-off parts that we did which really kind of stand ingrained in my memory. There was a thing called the Shoreditch Festival or Shoreditch Carnival, Shoreditch Festival, which doesn't exist anymore and it was actually in aid of national pro-cycling or something like this campaign, but they closed off the streets around Shoreditch and they had like three or four sound systems. There was Blue Bay Gate Sound System, we were just the only house sound system, house and techno sound system. We had this area which is just off Great Eastern Street, parallel to Great Eastern Street, and it's a really long road which ran parallel to a viaduct, a railway line. And we had about 4,000 people on the street on a Sunday. I think we had Ashley Beadle and we had Ewan Pearson one year as well. We did two years in a row. And it was completely off the scale because we actually got the disco ball, which people know us for having. It's not actually ours, it's our friend's. But everyone kind of calls it our disco ball. But we had it overhanging from the Viaduct on this kind of, you know... traction, just overhanging the street from the wall of the viaduct and then the actual stage where the turntables were, where the DJ was, was actually Christoph had somehow managed to track someone down that had a Green Goddess and Green Goddess is like a really old US military truck which kind of the sides open down so soldiers are willing. you can put things up onto the truck but we put the sides down and connected that to a stage which went into like onto the road and people were just climbing up on there and dancing and that was a really memorable party for sure After Canberra's closed down did you have like an entire summer season where you were south of London in the Ministry of Sound? Yeah, we were kind of a bit stuck. We couldn't really find what we wanted. It was an outdoor venue. And actually ministry approached us. called us and said look we've got the car park you know which was never really been used for a party which really appealed to us because we always like to use kind of virgin spaces or spaces that hadn't really been used by another promoter for a party and um and we spoke james and i went down there you know of course we had reactions our minister of sound has got nothing to do on secret sundays and things like that but we were very open-minded about it because I think that we always thought people just would know us, know the music, and know we've got the right, the best intentions here. And we went down and the car park itself, the space is a great space, but I don't know long term whether it really, you know, it was the right thing to do or not. Yeah? Why is that? Do you mean... I think because I think maybe with it being, honestly being... it definitely attracted some people that wouldn't have come otherwise. Right. Do you think that's like a geographical thing because London is so like... separated by regions like people who live in East London won't go West and North and South do you think it's just because it was in the South or do you think ministry as well? No I think yeah I think it's both maybe but the travelling thing is really weird I always find it quite hysterical like when I was young I'd go to clubs like I'd go to Renaissance in Nottingham just from Cambridge and that was like taking two or three hours on the train with a friend and have to worry about how we get home the next day or like when we're you know waiting like at the station for the first train you know and stuff like this so for me I was just always like what's everyone complaining about you know like get your ass moving and get down if it's something you really want to do but ultimately I think not everyone thinks like me and I'm pretty sure they don't actually I'm interested about the dynamic that you have with James. Obviously, like, there's a lot of crossover musically. But there's also definite points of difference. Yeah, yeah. Was it hard for you two to find that balance between you? No, not really, no. I think it's always worked quite well. I mean, James comes from a much more, I'd say, broader musical background. He was actually DJing before me, and he was throwing German bass parties in Nottingham at the Bomb. But then when he came to London... he got more inspired by like the kind of more freestyle scene or people that you know he got influenced by like Broken Beat and stuff like that, Bugs in the Attic, Some House and I don't know all sorts of things you know even like some sort of R&B and some sort of cutting edge stuff you know it was sort of the cutting edge and definitely obviously Disco as well but But I've just, yeah, I mean, in terms of my DJing, I've always been a complete house and techno freak, really. And I've never really kind of tried to play other types of music. I had the desire to in a club environment, at least. At the beginning of the party, i.e., like in, in, in, in, I don't know, 2001, 2002 when we started, It would always be that I'd always play the last set. So it didn't... James actually really worked because James would always play like, you know, so you know, just kind of watch it up. chill out stuff moving you know picking up the tempo playing some funk and disco maybe playing some house before like guests and I'd always finish off which kind of worked you know kind of suited my style I think playing but I think yeah Jack Jack definitely as the party's grown in size and success James kind of did to adapt to the DJ style, to play, or was kind of forced to play in front of big crowds where he couldn't really go around so much. But I mean to this day, I think when we play at places like Robert Johnson and Frankfurt together, That's when he really digs into his collection and starts playing stuff that he can't play to like 2,000 people. I mean, we're not doing parties of 2,000 people now, but we have been for many years. Do you think the Secret Sundays ethos has changed much? Because I remember last year there was an email that was sent out saying basically we're going to change the way we're doing things. Yeah. What prompted that? Yeah, I just think that, well, things I've mentioned to you about the year, I think it was 2008, was it 2009? I think 2008, we started doing ministry a little bit, and I think some people didn't get some of the moves that we made. Yeah, they did have a slight negative impact on the party and we looked around ourselves and we're like, well, you know, didn't connect so well with some of the crowd anymore. So we kind of made that decision to kind of go back a little bit underground and keep it tighter and not... really promote the parties very much. At the time, actually, it's really very competitive Sunday parties now, you know. Okay, Winona's like, well, I don't know, I don't know what you're going to call us. Pervy's London. You know, to start the party, we were one of the first people to start the party Sunday, and obviously it pretty grew to heights that not any other party has reached, I would say, in the last 10 years in London. But now it's a the younger kids that have got into the house thing and the techno thing and they're doing Sunday outdoor parties I think quite inspired by what we've done. But this last year it was just a case of going back a little bit to our roots and also it's also really kind of I think we're now really busy with other things like myself and James but particularly with things like Martin working as a tour de l'oeil and doing music. I'm running an overseeing agency which with 16 artists I quite frankly think either James and I want to be doing a huge party every two weeks anymore. I still absolutely love organizing parties and I don't see me stopping doing them but just in terms of frequency and the size of them yeah it's changing that way I think you know. This year is the 10th anniversary of this year, so we might do some big special parties because I think it warrants that, you know, and I think it'll be fun. But generally, the kind of direction we're heading in, we're not looking to do such big events anymore. Yeah. And do you think that... kind of like conscious decision to scale things back? Has it had an effect? - Yeah, it definitely has. The answer is yes, it did. I really liked the closing party this year. We had like Fred P and I actually missed most of the party because my rep was missing and coming back from somewhere, but like I came in very late. But nevertheless, saw the party really kicking. It was in Hackney Wick, which is really out there in kind of, you know, East London. It's not in East North Shoreditch. It's like a real schlep to get to for people that don't live around that area. But to see the party full of like 500, 600 people and noticing some old faces actually that I hadn't seen for quite a while and people that I just kind of thought... We did fit in with the original ethos of the party in terms of attitude. You said your records went missing. That's happened to you a few times, hasn't it? Yeah, it's happened to me loads of times. I think I'm particularly unlucky, actually. I've actually never actually never been lost they've always been misplaced I've never actually lost a bag of records but honestly I think in 2009 or 8 I went missing about 3 or 4 times and now I'm just really careful with them and try and fly in their lines that I can take them on as hangar I've been using To go off track a little bit, I didn't realise until today, or maybe I did know it and I'd forgotten it, but you were a techno reviewer for DJ Mark. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of all of the genre pages. I mean, it's not that far removed from what you're known for. No, but... How did that come together? there's another after party situation basically I think the then head of the show of DJ Magazine was Leslie and she was back at my house after some party and I was playing records and talking rubbish about music as usual and she just said to me in a very strong, large, mutant accent that I don't know personally, "Jiles, have you ever considered writing about music?" And I obviously thought she was taking the piss and just kind of made some joke back to her. She's like, "No, I'm serious." And she actually just asked me to do some like, what do you call them, trial reviews. And she really liked them. And I became the only, I think they just had a space for a technical viewer. I think, you know, I always have played some techno. Maybe you've seen me playing house quite a lot, but I like quite a lot of classic Detroit techno, the more melodic and groovy stuff. So I did like techno, but yeah, it was at the time, it was a bit weird me doing techno reviews, but the fact is that I just used to review house anyway. So, yeah. that's how I did that she just asked me and I said yes and I did it for about five years, six years. Back to Secret Sundays and the kind of changes within the last couple of years, you've mentioned that you set up your agency. Yeah. Which is kind of like a boutique agency, which is like a combination of people like Delano Smith and... Shade Demir. Shade Demir. Keith Worthy, Petrusco. And then there's like a crew of younger... Yeah. And we've got people like WB's, Ethel and Flory, Brother, Jay Shepard, myself. Yeah, it's a boutique agency and obviously it's... I mean, we will change and I want to develop it, we need to as a business as well, but it's definitely got its vision that we have the priority of the music and there's not one person on the agency that I don't like their music, I like everyone's music very much. We have, but there's a... It's starting to expand out a little bit now. I think there's got to be a balance between them. Definitely the older heads like Shea and Delano, but then we've got people like Warren, WB, Zeran, and Brother, who's in the net and Flory, who are all really talented. They're all kind of early 20s and seem to have really, really mature taste. for people so young and taken on lots of, you know, taken on lots of, lots of, and inspired by some of the older guys we've got. So it's really nice to have that mix. It must be a different kind of interaction that you're having with artists though, going from being a DJ and throwing parties to kind of being on the other side. side of it but how how has that changed that kind of interaction? That's a good question I don't honestly and it's not me being pig-headed here saying that I'm always me but it hasn't changed it that much I mean I have to I like to think that you know people know me as someone who likes to have fun and enjoy myself but In terms of the party and where I've handled booking DJs over the years, I've always been very, very careful and respectful of people and really look after them. And I think that just carries over, that kind of being a host. I think that's how I see it. Making sure people are happy and comfortable. And that's really important to me and obviously I understand it from both sides, being a promoter, doing Secret Sundays with James and then also being a DJ myself and going to clubs. in the world and being looked after and what DJs kind of expect so yeah of course there needs to be a certain level of professionalism in terms of my dreams as an artist and that sort of stuff but I mean I really try and be myself I think the minute you start being someone else you're in trouble Tell me a bit more about two armadillos. Obviously I know you and I know Martin as well, Martin Dawson, because he lives here in Berlin. When did you two guys connect? When did you start working together? We knew of each other, I think, for like a few years. Not particularly well, but we knew each other. I think we'd seen each other out and about. But he actually, you know, I've always been a DJ. I hadn't started making music at all on my own. I never really had the time doing everything that I've done. and basically Martin was working in Fonica and yeah he just I was quite shocked because I didn't really have any skills in making music but He was, he kind of, I was quite humbled because he kind of asked me if I wanted to kind of go work with him and everyone was like, oh he's a really good engineer and blah blah. We had quite different musical backgrounds. So originally I was, I was kind of skeptical a little bit how it might work out. I'm honest, I'm always a little bit, yeah, cautious. And I think there was a time when we spoke about it and I didn't kind of act on it because I wasn't really sure. And then I kind of changed my mind and we got together. And I think it was probably about four or five years ago. And yeah, it was just a case of, I mean, we'd spoke about it, but I hadn't really followed it up. And then just kind of one day I just decided I wasn't going to call him. we hooked up and actually wrote our first EP in like in a few days and came out with Dissue. And as you've kind of progressed further with your with the amount of music that you've been putting out how is that dynamic with Martin's show? It's really good I think we've just I think I haven't really got too bogged down in the technical aspects of stuff so I think that really kills, if I was to do that, that would kill my creativity to a certain extent if working in a partnership where most of the ideas are coming from me. Because it tends to be much more the music that I play than Martin plays. However, to answer your question, it's brought us a lot closer together in the sense that I think Martin's been really inspired by the music, which I guess is why he was asked to work together in the first place. You know, despite the fact that I've learned various things about the production process from Martin, I think it's been good. I think in terms of Martin's a really, really intelligent and sparkly person. He's like, you know, really highly trained. But he definitely, I think I've taught him certain things in music about how to kind of, less is definitely more. in terms of arrangement and not actually being a bit more patient, I think is the word. Because he often, you know, you had a habit of like throwing lots of things in too quickly and I think I've just kind of, you know, helped him to be a bit more restrained with his productions, you know. Yeah, and it is interesting knowing you both personally and as artists, you are quite different in terms of the music that Martin produces on his own and the music that you're known for playing. So I'm just interested to know, do you think that there is one track that really represents the fusion of both of your elements the best? Or the track you're the most proud of? Yeah. We've actually written an album which is not released and we haven't signed to a label yet. We're looking to. I would actually say, not that I'm trying to pitch that album, but I'd say there's some material on this album that I think that Martin Nevaeh... found the most of overlap with our taste in music the most because I think in the initial initial years in the first few years of doing stuff it was always really what I liked you know and although I'm still leading it very kind of quite in terms of what we start with I'm much more kind of Martin's kind of you know piss ideas around much more at least in terms of these days and kind of it's a more mutual I say it's more equal and I definitely think, unlike some of the new material we've done, that's a bit more techno-y, which is unreleased. It's definitely got us doing this kind of soulful side to it. But that definitely crosses over with both our musical backgrounds and influences the most. I think it was you that said that jazz is a big influence. Oh, yeah. How do you think that kind of matter? Well, okay, in terms of like kind of, you know, I think our second EP was called Butterfly Beat and it was on 420 and that's actually one of the records that I'm most proud of and that's just a record that I've never heard played in a club. you There are certain records we've done like Disco Boys remix or Hamelin or Hawthorne's theme which seem played by quite a few DJs but I have to say that some of the ones that I like the most and some of the ones that aren't played the most because they're probably more avant-garde and they're less easy to play on the set. Like Butterfly Bee for example it's got a stand-up bass line which is... made on software, it wasn't made, but it's acoustic, it's acoustic and I kind of, lots of the music, I think you can probably hear in most of the music we make, there's not too many overly synthetic sounds, it's all quite live sounding. So in terms of percussion, the drums, there's quite a lot of hats and shakers which sound quite very live and quite influenced by jazz. And actually, we've sampled very subtly some jazz kind of... records and in a few of our tracks which yeah so I don't know it's just it's just that like live sound I guess yeah I'm not I'm not really into like overtly electronic records there are some electronic records that I really like but it's not really the kind of stuff I play too much yeah even techno that I play it's like the kind of I don't know classic Los Hermanos for example Rolando kind of sound it's very live percussion and stuff like that so that's just something I've always liked. It's that human touch, I just, that's very important to me. Thank you.
