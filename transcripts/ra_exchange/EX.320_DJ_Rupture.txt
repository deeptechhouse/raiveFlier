Thank you. Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith, and I'm the tech editor of Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with DJ Rupture. Jace Clayton has been ahead of the curve as a... genre-defying DJ, producer, and author for over a decade now. His new book, Uproot, weaves together stories from his world travels, helping us to understand how music and culture behave in a digital age. Speaking with Max Pearl from his home in New York, Clayton runs through the stories behind his pioneering DJ mixes and productions, setting the scene for a career that's consistently challenged preconceptions and expanded what's possible in electronic music. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The Exchange with DJ Rupture is up next. I'm here with Jace Clayton aka DJ Rupture. He just put out a book called Uproot which is sort of about how music and culture and technology move around in the 21st century. that would be a pretty good excuse to get you in the studio and ask you about your life story. Great. The first mix you ever put on CD was in 2001, and it was called Gold Teeth Thief. Yes. Can you kind of describe what was going on culturally in that moment? Yeah. In a way, the answer was very little. You know, at the time I was living in Madrid, but I'd sort of come up DJing. Boston, you know, and then I'm like, I'm like, you know, started DJing in 96, I guess, 20 years ago now. But yeah, at the time, you know, if you want to hear house music, you go to the house club. If you want to hear reggae, go to the reggae club, hip hop, hip hop club. So everything was very kind of like, you know, segregated like this, this, this. And not only that, but very, I was finding that the experience was very flat of clubbing. You just go to go like same tempo, same vibe all night long, you know? And so that was the And then also my mixing style, you know, like a bunch of friends and I slowly put together a collective called Tone Burst. And our idea was to just sort of like mix it up, you know, people doing, trying to do live drum and bass experiments, doing experimental electronics, people DJing weird stuff. And we were just like, let's try and create a space for this that doesn't exist yet. And so in many ways, Gold Teeth Thief was just the sort of a result of that kind of like trying to shake things up in Boston and figuring out my own DJ style and trying to fold more and more types of... sounds and dynamics into what I was DJing. Right. I remember getting a copy of that mix when I was in high school. And what was really interesting was it felt like everything was up for grabs. And I had never really heard that kind of highbrow, lowbrow, like, let's bring it all together. Like, was there like an antecedent to this? Like, where did this come from? When did you realize these genre limitations are just meaningless? It's funny, no real antecedent in a way. It's this thing of like, you know, I've been listening to records and CDs and whatever for a long time. I'm like, I feel really close to all these different corners of my record collection. Like, let's see if I can come up with a mixing style that kind of gives homage to that. You know, that's a natural flowing point from that. And when I started DJing in the first place, I was just crazy into Jungle. I was like, this music is so exciting. It's so polyglot, so many ideas. You know, this was kind of like peak era, at least when it was hitting Boston in 96. And so for about, you know, nine months, 12 months, that felt limitless, like endless exploration. But then that sort of, you know, kind of straightened out, standardized. It lost that sort of exuberant glee. It kind of solidified a bit into drum and bass and became more minimalist. And then I was just like, no, at that point I'd realized that I love DJing, but then the music, I was like, okay, the music is no longer exciting me. I need to bring sort of my own voice into it. And then I was like, well, hip hop records, acapellas, dance hall. And then, you know, then the thread goes deeper And there were always flickers, you know, like Muda Masik, Egyptian-Italian woman living in Brooklyn who was mixing. She was the first person I saw to mix drum and bass with dancehall, you know, like the sound lab parties that Beth Coleman, DJ Singe, was putting on. And just kind of like that sort of, it's kind of like ill-being at school, people kind of with a wide-open approach to DJing, you know, cold cut at a mix. called Journeys by DJ Coldcut. Totally studio tracked, but very kind of like open-ended in its way. Tell me about the Tone Burst parties. I remember hearing about one called Junk that was pairing punk bands with jungle DJs. Yeah, yeah. So let's see. Tone Burst, the very first Jake Trussell, a.k.a. DJ C, was... was a very central figure. But there's a whole bunch of us, you know, it was a bunch of students, a bunch of people involved in like community radio around Boston. And so the first parties were just in like weird art spaces, you know, in and around like the Boston area. One called Junk, yeah, which was like Jungle vs. Punk. It was in a, I think like Unitarian church, you know, it was like $5 entry, you know, like free rice and beans. being served. And then we're like, okay, these are kind of comparable energies. Like we're getting in this drum and bass and like crazy electronic music and sort of live, live punk band. So let's have them back to back, like 15, 20 minute sets just throughout the afternoon at this all ages show. So yeah, that's the kind of thing we were up to. At some point we did a party in the children's museum. I was in Europe, so I couldn't attend it, but like we kind of of turned it into this rave once we did a sort of like a warehouse party in Worcester where I lived when I was a kid but it was really funny because we were taking our we're like okay you know like five dollars we were really into like inexpensive door free and like freaky music and inside and nobody can complain, you know, because it's cheap and it's open. And there somehow it just slipped into the sort of like commercial rave network. So all these people are showing up and like, wait, it's only $5? Like, what's going on? And they get inside and it's like, you know, Keith Fortin Whitman doing modular synth stuff in one room. And I'm like DJing like weird, weirdo, hard to dance, dance music in another. People got upset. You So yeah, but most of the parties were kind of great, you know, and going from performers outnumbering audience to, you know, like 600 people, 700 people, like a real kind of moment. What was the sound of Tone Burst around that time? Yeah, so I can play you something I did. I probably produced this 2000, 2001, you know, but in a way it's a... production style that was emerging from my whole engagement with that, you know, so it's, I mean, I'm sure you'll recognize it. Aaliyah R.I.P. Here we go. Thank you. Where'd you go instead? What was in your head? We need a resolution. We need a resolution. We need a resolution. We have so much confusion. Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? Am I supposed to change? Are you supposed to change? Am I? I will. I will. I will. Who was in orbit culturally at that? Was that like Knife Hand Chop and Kid 606? This kind of aggro moment? Yeah, exactly. Totally. And so that was, yeah, that was me like just taking the Iliad acapella and then like producing the drums around it and stuff. But there are a bunch of other people kind of with the same mode. And Kid 606, exactly. He was like, you know, he was one of the... the people I sent Gold Teeth Thief to. I was like, hey, I used like some weird song with cat noises of yours. So here's the mix. And then he loved it. And then he sort of re-released it. And that led to, I don't know, a relationship with his label and touring a lot with Miguel. I think I remember reading in your book that one of your early clubbing experiences was at a place called The Loft down on Stewart Street. Can you set the scene a little It was the only sort of all like after hours party in Boston, pretty much. And so, you know, and so it was fantastic. And two floors. The first floor was a bit more was like house, you know, so DJ Bruno and Armand Van Helden at the time were sort of holding court there. And then the smaller upstairs room, it was like rave music. So faster techno and whatever. And then at some point they started playing hour-long sets of Jungle, and that was what blew my mind. But yeah, I was just kind of going there regularly, and it was the first time I just sort of realized that, you know, like club nights and club spaces can have their own... not just audience, but like own history, almost own customs, you know? I was like, oh yeah, there are people I only knew through like seeing them there and dancing with them. And it wasn't even necessarily a verbal connection I had, but I was like, oh yeah, there's a real kind of. You know, there's something very substantial in that. So, yeah, it was it was fantastic in its way. Yeah. And so when Gold Teeth Thief dropped, there was like a bit of a delay and then it blew up sort of for you. It was unexpected, right? Yes. Yeah. Because it was unexpected because, you know, I'm like, I've been doing this mixing for like two or three years now. And and and it had only reached our sort of little crew of people. tone burst like Boston area maybe one or two shows in New York City but that was it and I only put it online so I was like oh I want because I was writing to the people's records I used me like hey I love your music here the mix I did you can check it out yeah and like I was in Madrid I didn't really have much like I didn't have internet access at home and so it's this weird thing where at some point like a friend calls me up he's like yo wire magazine gave you this great review and unprecedented, you know? And then it just kind of kept coming. And the person who'd put up the MP3s for me, he's like, there's actually an enormous amount of traffic coming as a result of this. So yeah, a very happy surprise. And then when that came out and you started getting booked, it was a bit of a windfall of like international gigs. I imagine, were you playing kind of like informal and community-oriented spaces like the ones you had kind of created in Boston? From the start, it was actually a weird mix, which thankfully I've maintained. The very first international gig was playing one of the former spaces of Club Maria in Berlin. And it's a choreographer who heard the mix and really loved it, but he was really busy that night, so he booked me, but then he passed me off to his friend who was incredibly rude. and I had this horrible experience like being dropped off at McDonald's near the venue and I was like, what is this? But then playing a sort of, you know, really nice club and then having kind of all these people come out. So, but yeah, it's, and partly it was maybe because of the time, like. Sometimes people would understand me like in a hip hop or like straight up kind of like, oh, like Caribbean influence, like club music context. And I'd be in those sort of nights or and sometimes people would kind of be more like, we're going to have this weird squad and this person plays with noise music. So let's invite him. So I was kind of lucky to be able to get booked at all these different spaces. And then after Boston and between New York, you ended up in Barcelona. Yeah. And in your book, you talk about this kind of insane temporary autonomous zone squat. Yes. Can you, what's that called? Yeah, that space was called La Macabra. And there are others. I mean, but yeah, it was amazing. It was the size of like half a city block in the Poblenou district, sort of. industrial kind of warehousey district, which is, of course, going a horrible, horribly violent, like rezoning and rebuilding right now. But it was one of these wonderful examples that you stumble across in Europe from time to time. It's like a thing like, oh, it's a big squat, but they're organized. They had a library, they hired a lawyer, they had childcare set up. And, you know, definitely some people like living very close to the edge there, but then being like very, like very much in that tradition of like Barcelona, Catalan anarchist activism. And so we did it. Like Philistine and I, an American producer who just moved to the city, we did a party that was one euro, kind of during sonar times, we're piggybacking off of that, but like we'd... squatters up on the hills who've made their own homebrew, like selling their beer. And like, even though it was only one euro, there are people outside who are like, man, I'm not going to pay one euro to go to a party in this spot. It was one of those very incredible moments where you're like, okay, autonomous culture can happen and can happen on a serious scale, you know? That's so interesting. I feel like I've heard all these stories about how, you know, in places where there are more like social services for providing government money for music, then you actually get like really radical shit happening in what would be kind of like a rinky dinky community space in the United States, you know? So like, yeah, it's just cool that. the money exists for that. Yeah. And this was, I mean, it was, had nothing to do with the government, you know, an antagonistic relationship with city hall for sure. So then you moved to New York. Yeah. In your book, you wrote about how that hurt your bank account as a DJ. Yes. So true. Yeah. I mean, yeah. What was it? It was like 800 euros in Barcelona for this amazing apartment, like three bedrooms, multiple balconies overlooking the Mediterranean. And then suddenly it's like, oh, one room in a shared loft, like next to the JMZ. Like I opened the window and the train's right there. I mean, I love Spain. I love Madrid and Barcelona. But at the time it was such a, it was so depressing to see a city like refocus itself so hard around like service, economy, tourist industry, and how like sort of the kind of like a Catalan. protectionism made it really difficult, even for people from other parts of Spain, to progressive culture. It was good to move back to New York City, as complicated as that is, as complicated as life in New York City is. Right. Well, I mean, that's when when Dutty Arts began, which I think of as like a quintessential New York mix of influences that could happen nowhere else. Yes. Yeah, definitely. And so in the context for that was like Matt Shadetech and I, you know, like born and raised in New York City, but he'd been living in Berlin for a while. And so we kind of we met in New York City, but we were both in Europe at the same time. So like every time Berlin to do a show or whatever. I'd hang out with Matt. We became good friends. And then so, yeah, around 2006, 2007, I guess we were both back here. And, you know, we just get together and like make beats and it was fun and hang out. And Matt had, you know, had like incredible amounts of music. And so at some point we were just like, I was like, why don't we just have some sort of platform where we can release Matt's music and work on some things together? Yeah. And then he suggested Duddy Arts as a name a Let's do it. And it all kind of emerged from that. That comes from like the patois, Dati? Yeah, I think it's from, it would even be like a Capleton song, Dati Arts. Yeah, I think it's a Capleton song. And so before we get back to Duddy Arts, I want to talk about our man Matt Shadetech. And one of the stories that you tell in Uproot is the story of Brooklyn Anthem, which is kind of an interesting roundabout way that it arrived to being the cultural phenomenon that it is. Can you talk about that? Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, Brooklyn Anthem is, you know, Matt and his production partner, Zach, at the time were team Shadetech. And they made this... I mean, yeah, Matt had made a beat for a mixtape, called it Brooklyn Anthem, and put on a Sizzla acapella or something in this mixtape, and people loved it. And so he decided to turn it into a proper vocal track. And then eventually they got Jodan Blackamoor and Two Sevens Clash, sort of friends of ours in New York City, really great vocalist, Guyanese and Jamaican respectively, to voice it. And then that ended up getting picked for this Madden football video game. And then, because of the video game, somehow it reached the sort of like East Brooklyn Caribbean dance crews, and they loved the song. So they hunted down the instrumental version, and then this crew called Island Superior Sound did a really great sort of, like, you know, youth party in Bed-Stuy. They did an amazing refix of it. Like, they threw on Movado edits and Elephant Man, chopped it up, put in their own branding, and then that thing went viral. And so maybe like a month or two after this had happened, it finally reached Matt that this was going on. Like they didn't even know about it because there's such of a crazy sort of, you know, meme Xerox cut and paste distance between it. But then we're like, what? These looking like hundreds of dance cell phone dance videos going on. Like it was a whole sensation. Super interesting. It's like a wacky grind beat. Yes. And exactly. And it's a wacky grind beat. It totally distorted kick drums, matte shade decks, sort of like trademark kind of jostling hand claps. Yeah. And very, so adrenaline, like sort of knucklehead party music at its finest. Cantankerous. Yes. So obviously Jamaican music. has been like the core almost of a lot of what you do. What drew you to Jamaican music in the first place? Yeah, I mean, it's that, let's see, I guess it was dub stuff in high school. I was probably really getting into dub production. And so that was that first thing you're like, oh, okay, you've been listening to songs your whole life. Then all of a sudden you get these. You get these people who are doing magic by taking away parts, by subtracting. You're like, oh, it doesn't have to be an additive process. You know, you can start with something full, reduce it, and that's your production. So that was just like, you know, mind exploding. Plus the music was so magical. Then I started getting into, of course, like all the dance hall, which is super interesting at the time. You know, in Boston, I would go around to, I'd like. It took me like three buses to get from where I was living to get to Blue Hill Ave in Dorchester. But once I was there, you know, it's like three really great reggae shops where you could just go and ask people to listen to Sevens. And every week there'd be new stuff and a little bit, some roots, but then mostly like contemporary electronic dance hall. And then that was... I mean, the dub, it's kind of like, you know, it's classic easy listening in a sense. But like current dance hall is so interesting because it occupies that sweet spot between there. It's like this is populist music. People are trying to fill dance halls or trying to crush the competition. But it's populist music that loves novelty and that drives all sorts of wacky studio experimentation, lyrical experimentation, like silliness, brilliance, and it's kind of all bound up together. But it's not like trying to be esoteric for the sake of esoteric or wacky for the sake of a gimmick. Yeah, there's always this awareness of a social... context and there's a sort of a greater point to it as loopy and far out as it gets which is often really far out yeah have you been to Jamaica and done sort of the circuit of recording with vocalists visiting historic music sites oh you know there's like the tour that you do as an outsider musician yeah no I haven't done that tour that's funny what have we ended once we ended up at um like Like Lee Perry's brother is around and he's like, yeah, this is where he burned down the studio. You know, it's like a room with a bunch of ash. You're like, okay, but that was the extent of our... I mean, I was there with Staying with the Congos, who are sort of roots reggae icon legends. But I'm not one of those people who's, like, I don't own any Bob Marley records. You know, actually, I feel like moments of musical history are sort of interesting, but then maybe it's not, maybe I'm not so interested in. To get back to Daddy Arts, I was wondering if you could play us something that you think really exemplified, like, the early catalog. Here we go. Absolutely. This song, I think we must have produced it. It's a Matt Shade Tech and I in production. And I think it's 2009. And this is this funny story. You know, it's like, I mean, we would get together. It's actually kind of ridiculous. Matt's a very fast producer. He's like an incredibly fast media builder. You know, it's like 30 seconds, 30 minutes, the song is there. And so we'd hang out and, you know, do a session and have a bunch of sketches. And this was one sketch that we then took and kind of kept alive. And eventually we ended up putting up two vocalists on top of it, Aku and then Jadan Blackamore as well. Baby, you know I used to love you And I still do now And be together And you know it's true That I did all I could to love you Unconditional Baby, you will get nervous Don't give it all up to me You're contagious, you're in my veins Like blood, like the breeze Don't give it all up to me Cause I'll take it, all your love And you know I might just break your heart We used to fit together like a hand in a glove Even after all the drama, I still got lots of love for you Even if I won't be there with kisses and hugs for you Shake the bad memories, they won't do much for you I feel like I need more space to grow I need some time to grow And you know how deep my love goes. But who knows what the future holds. Babe, you know I used to love you. And I still do now. But we just can't be together. And you know it's true. So that was during peak dubstep or just prior to peak dubstep? That was just prior to peak dubstep. Yeah, that whole Jot Down project, we're like, yeah, we're kind of interested in all this dubstep and it hadn't, you know, and it was still kind of vital in a sense. And we're like, let's do vocal dubstep. And so we're probably like, you know, 20 months too soon or something and a bit too disorganized. But yeah. Yeah, that was a great time in music. It's funny to be talking about it in the past tense. It seemed to peak and then go away so quickly. Yeah, gone. One thing I'm interested in talking about is sampling versus collaboration. And I think a lot of what you and Matt contributed was rather than staying behind. the window you are crossing and just going that extra step to be like, maybe we can contact this person. Maybe they're down to work with us, you know? So, I mean, is that a big part of your project? Just making contact? Yeah, absolutely. And so like in our early conversations, Matt and I, we'd always be like, yeah, we're like, we're both after having been sort of away from the cultural richness of New York city. I mean, in Barcelona. working with amazing Moroccan musicians, you know, but suddenly we're like, we're back in New York City. Like, there are all these people around, you know, like we're hugely into like rap and reggae and all this stuff, you know, like meeting up with Gecko Jones, this whole sort of like Latin line opened up. We're like, yeah, like it would be, it's like something about the overcrowded nature of the city. You're always kind of like bumping into someone or rubbing up it's an opportunity to speak up and create a link and spark something. So, yeah. Yeah, I remember there's a part of the book where you're talking about how you begin to feel a little bit uncomfortable with Raga Jungle and how the voice of the Jamaican man in Raga Jungle was playing out this kind of racial fantasy of like aggression and attitude. And I think that made you think about sampling and the exotic in general, you know? Yeah. I think what you said was naive at best, creepily segregationist at worst. Yes. Can you talk a little bit more about that realization? Yeah. Yeah. And it kind of goes from, you know, of course, like listening to all this. this reggae stuff. And then, yeah, and then like mid to late nineties, like there's this really exciting music that at the time, you know, like Raga Jungle, which is reaching back and sort of like recontextualizing all these pizzas. of Jamaican music in a way that felt very organic, you know, and oftentimes it's sort of like London sound systems with like direct relationships with Jamaica and Kingston, even like sort of like legacies, like this person's father ran a sound system. And so that was good and fine. And then, I guess, I'm not sure when it first started happening, but it's almost like a lot of people were excited by Raga Jungle. And so the initial explosion happens in London in a very specific way. And then all of a sudden, you get people all over the world who are just like, oh, yeah. like baritone vocal saying something aggressive and like add it to a distorted amen break and then voila, you know, suddenly you've got a slamming break chord track or something. And so it's almost like sometimes you can just see a cliche in music. You're like, what's that cliche supporting? You know, and that cliche is like Capleton saying murder them or something. You're just like, oh man, this is so, so lame ultimately. Okay, so you've always been interested in working with music from afar and like, you know, a lot of stuff in Jamaica, Argentina, Morocco, and a lot of what you've been involved with could kind of fly under the banner of world music. And I'm wondering what you think about the usefulness of that term in 2016. Yes. Yeah, that's this distinction I make in the book. I'm like, yeah, world music should be any music with global reach. You know, it's like Rihanna's world music, U2's world music, Taylor Swift's world music, national anthems are world music. But, you know, world music as such was like literally a top-down industry term, you know, so like in the wake of Paul Simon's success with Graceland, people and like a bunch of music industry execs in Britain and London sat around and like, we need to market this stuff. People want it. What can we call it? Can we call it hot, tropical? They had all these like sort of names and world music was the one they decided on. And so it's you. useful in that very specific way. Like the language they use, they're like, we need a record store bin that we can put this stuff into. And then world music was that, you know, it's like in sort of an economic category as much as anything else. And then for all this new wave of things going on, sort of more ground up grassroots production, people using inexpensive software to make weird music that references where they're living. You know, I like to call out of. the various terms that people propose for that, I like world music 2.0 because it gets some idea of the sprawl, some idea of this sort of, of the digital layer wrapping around it and confusing the very idea of what a world is. Yeah, I mean, but the thing is, ultimately, it's like one, you know, over time, that's just going to sort of disintegrate, even as a thought. You know, I think there's... I mean, it's interesting how people listen, you know, like the usefulness of the idea of like a locale, you know, or thinking of afar, like what does afar mean? If you're like people as we become more and more accustomed to like, oh yeah, you know, like my Korean pop, it's like not, not too much of a big deal, you know, or this, this, you know, or like, yes. whatever it happens to be. Yeah, it's interesting. So speaking of local music cultures, in your book, you take us to a few different locales, and it's kind of weaves through these first-person anecdotes of your experiences meeting and making music with and interviewing musicians. And one of the places you take us is Monterrey, Mexico, where we meet. some of the people involved with a style of music called tribal. And I was wondering if you could tell us, set the scene for us in Monterrey so we can understand. Yeah. Yeah. That was, that was amazing because, um, I was just there DJing actually a really fun party with like, um, Los Lascanos, damas band from Argentina, like Cumbia Vigera, damas gratis. And so all, but as part of that weekend of DJing, my friend Toy Selecta, shout out to Toy, he's like, hey, you know, he's like, there's this all ages rave going on Sunday. You should like hang around for a couple of days and we should check it out. And I'd heard like heard rumor of like Tribal, Tribal Guarachero before that was just bad. You know, you're like, okay, this is great in theory. In practice, it's like some very repetitive fruity loops or just like European tribal trance or whatever. But then I was like, of course, I could rave, like Ollie just afternoon rave in downtown Monterrey. Like, yes. And so we went and it was wild, you know, out of, it was probably one of the most surprising musical experiences of my life, you know, because like three to four thousand kids partying in this gigantic warehouse space. And the music, it's now what we think of as like the sort of like the, you know, Tribal Monterrey, they've had their album, they've done this, but the music was so far advanced from what had happened online, you know, so like all these amazing triplets, the clip-clopping drum loops, kids integrating this kind of this Aztec imaginary, you know, via like sort of reimagining, reconfiguring sort of like pre-Columbian instrumentation, all these Actually, classic dance hall samples are really popular that day. All of this was. going on like they had a dance crew harry potter bridges it was just overload total full on mexican overload um and also in a very kind of like sweaty healthy environment and then at 8 p.m sharp like a cumbia band starts playing and like everyone just keeps dancing they switch up their dance style but the whole thing just keeps on going even though it's suddenly a 10 person cumbia band doing their thing And so that was just like, wow, you know, and I was like, this is, this is, um, unprecedented and amazing. Yeah. I guess that's a kind of what we're all in search of is these weird open moments where anything goes and it's not locked down or codified. Yep. Sounds like what you were talking about with the, what you were trying to open up in Boston, you know? Yeah. Can we play some tree boss? New León, how do I love you? New León, listen to me. So why did you pick that tune? So that was Eric Rincon. So he was one of the DJs, you know, like 16 years when I first met him there, playing that first time I walked in it. But then so much of the material he and the others were DJing were their own edits. And so that is Los Reyes Vallenatos de Javier Lopez. So that's like in the middle of it, he samples like a Monterrey cumbia band and they're versioning a very popular sort of Mexican cumbia song. But then, of course, they've modified the lyrics, talk about Nuevo León, the state where Monterrey is from. And then it's this whole moment we get to hear in sound how he's kind of negotiating this embrace of like, yes, I like this c all sped up and folded up into these crazy new beat patterns, you know, that Eric and his buddies are developing. So you also have a chapter about autotune, which is a fairly divisive technology. Not everyone loves it. Can you talk about how that brought you to Morocco? Sure. I started... Way back, way back before T-Pain in like 2001, 2002, I'd just be like, you know, call them like bars for drunk Muslims in Barcelona. So like red light districts, sort of like Moroccan bars. And they were playing music with this crazy vocal effect really strongly. And this was before I or most people knew to call it auto-tune. But I was just like, what is, what's going on with this stuff? And I loved it. I mean, I was sort of instantly. liked autotune. It was found just so fascinating. But then I started buying the stuff and I was just like, okay, this is really interesting. And then, you know, two or three years later, it kind of hit sort of like American R&B mainstream, you know, with T-Pain and other people. And then people started talking about it. And it was just always stayed in my mind. I was like, well, all this very odd music I was hearing with Morocco, that was using the same tech and so popular so early on. So in a way, it was just kind of answering this basic question. And although I had a lot of Moroccan musician friends in Barcelona, no one there could really, and they're like, yeah, well, actually, a lot of the stuff you like with a Javiota tune that you like is Berber, you know, and they're like, yeah, I can speak some Berber, but I don't really know what's going on with that scene. And so at some point, So in a way, the chapter, it is, of course, yeah, it's thinking about what is this technology that has its roots in oil extraction code algorithms. People light these, set off explosions in the earth, listen to it with an array of microphones, throw all this math at it to find out where the minerals or where the petrochemicals are. And one of the people who was best at that started up Antares, and then that led directly to Autotune, Dr. Andy Hildebrand. So yeah, so it's thinking about the very unusual spread of this technology, which is far from totalizing. But then specifically, I'm like, well, let's go deep and look at how it ends up in sort of like conservative Berber wedding music, how it ends up there early and then stays there. Yeah, and I remember you were trying to track down a singer that you were a fan of. And then when you finally found her, I think her husband preferred that she didn't do an interview. Yes. Right? Yes. Yeah, this woman, Hafida. And she was totally amazing. She was, you know, the exception to the rule. She was sort of like Arab Moroccan, like non-Berber, but she learned the language and was singing in it and became this kind of star in South Moroccan wedding music. put out a, like, and it's great. It's like kind of just spectacular. And at some point her husband was like, you know, your music career is over. You know, he's like, you're your wife now. Like it must silence, like no more interviews, nothing. So that the sort of double, yeah, multiple tragedies of that. I'd like to talk about your project Nettle. So that was like, I think like a five piece band that had some. kind of like chamber orchestra string instrumentation with you providing software. And you guys put out an album that sort of had a concept. And I was wondering if you could tell us about that. Let's talk about your concept album. Yeah, so Nettle started living in Barcelona. I'm like, okay, it's in... Instead of sampling Arabic music, why don't I start talking and find a really amazing rock and violinist? And that worked, Abdelhakra Hall, and I slowly grew the project. And the last sort of big thing we did was this idea of thinking about the movie The Shining and thinking about Dubai, where I DJed a handful of times. And this was actually Jeff Minogue, a really great architecture writer and thinker. He was like... Like, oh, yeah, you could set The Shining in Dubai, you know, and some caretakers on a, you know, he has to take care of this hotel, but the hotel is empty, you know. And I was like, that's it. I was like, that's what the album is going to be. Like a soundtrack to a remake of The Shining set in a luxury hotel in Dubai, you know, and the air condition is broken and all of this. And so that was kind of thinking about, like, what does it mean to have ghosts, you know, in a city that's only 30 years old? You know, the sort of like null spaces of capital, the null spaces of the desert, the spaces where improbable things can bloom. Like, let's make this kind of like haunted, dislocated music. And it's kind of... really in vibing with a lot of the themes with Nettle Anyhow. I was just like, oh, okay, pulling together all these musicians in Barcelona, we all speak, together we speak Spanish. It's no one's first language. And I'm thinking about ideas of... friction and like let's make a musical space where we're all equally uncomfortable not this thing where like oh everyone's gonna be happy and they're like no like let's have moments of failed translation and sort of systems of meaning breaking down and have that embedded into the music what was it like to establish a working dynamic between electronic instruments and organic instruments like is there usually one in control or Was there some growing time to figure it out? Yeah, lots of growing time. I mean, part of it was me quickly learning the limitations of the software. And my listening default is like, oh, yeah, like a 4-4 rhythm is a sort of straightforward rhythm, you know, like a basic hip-hop beat, 4-4, 90 BPM. And so the very first day I was working with my friend Abdel, this Moroccan violinist, I... played him one of these beats, I'm like, yeah, I'm just going to get some strings on top of this simple beat. And then he was very much used to much more, I guess, rhythmically complex or much more supple. There are many different ways of describing it, but his sort of standard simple beat was very different from what I had in mind. And so he actually found it quite awkward to play on top of what I perceived as something that was very basic. And then he left and I was like, oh, weird. I'm like, he's sort of playing out of time. It's not really clicking, but he's obviously a good musician. I tried cutting it up and I played that to him. He just started laughing, you know, because he was like, I was, you know, like rewriting his cadence. And so from there on, I was like, whoa, you know, this is actually, it's almost beyond the tools. It's this idea of like very Which sort of led you to the Sufi plug-ins. Exactly. How do the Sufi plug-ins work? Yeah, Sufi plug-ins. Doing all this work with Moroccans, I was always like, oh, if only I had a synth or a plug-in that could do that. It would be so much faster than some elaborate workaround. And then at some point... the software Ableton Live opened up Max MSP inside it. So it's like, what's Max for Live? And then I was like, oh, this is an interesting moment because you can, Max MSP is a really flexible coding platform and so you can just do all these things in it that you kind of can't do. So you can write plugins that have very strange functionality. And so once that was in the world, I somehow randomly in my radio show, I met this programmer, coder and percussionist named Bill Bowen. And I was like, hey, would you be able to do like X, Y and Z? And he's like, yeah, no problem. And so like once I knew that those things are possible, I'm like, OK, I want to put together. The first impulse was I'm going to make tools that I can use in Nuttall, you know, so synthes and scales, sort of like interesting drum machines based around ideas of clapping, like all this stuff. And then as the project went on and I realized just how labor intensive it is to like make music software, it occurred to me, I was like, you know, if I make this public facing if I give it a nice skin and an interesting interface I can turn it into something bigger than just a tool for me it can turn into this sort of you know art music software project and so actually I was in Morocco at the time and I went and I got I made this kind of incredible um glossary of electronic music terms you know like a reverb like quantization granular synthesis, translate it into French and then into Berber. And not only in Berber, but this beautiful 2000-year-old script called Neotyphinar that they use, which looks kind of like, I could say it like a sci-fi Korean or something. But anyhow, so then I worked with the designer, this guy Raston Wu, to make really beautiful interfaces. There's no English on them. Everything is clearly labeled, but just in this Berber script. It should make sense if you're used to working with synthesizers to some extent, but very immediately cryptic. I was like, let's turn the tables on software design. It's not going to default to English. And if you hover the mouse over a button or a knob or a fader, a tooltip will pop up. But instead of saying something. sort of literal, you know, like volume or distortion amount. It's a fragment of Sufi poetry, you know, from 13th century Persia on down to today. And there's several Makam synthesizers, clapping machine, a drone machine that can also filter. And at some point I want to take it even further and there's a device called devotion. And so with devotion, you just set where you are on a map of the world, and then you set your belief level, you know, observant, agnostic, fervent, apostate, devout. You know, atheism is not an option. And the idea there is that five times a day, out of respect for the Muslim call to prayer. it'll lower the volume of your computer for about two or three minutes. And the amount that's lowered by depends on your belief level. So I, you know, made a demonstration video, put them online for free. And less than 24 hours later, this guy, Hassan Huajiri, I believe, so a Bahraini composer, sent me this piece. So it's kind of like a synth noise piece. And so it was amazing, though, because he is like a serious music head. So he understood the sort of the scales, the Macomb scales I was using. He chose his favorite one. But then he went to a park, took a photograph of a stray cat, used that photograph to generate MIDI data somehow, like note information, and then pushed that through the synthesizer. So he's got these, he's got like manifestos on post. esoteric Arabic music. Super interesting. So yeah, the very first track was probably, I guess, like you could call it Bahraini Noise. But then, you know, Priest from Anti-Pop was the first person to put it on vinyl. He made a track using the clapping drum machine. So yeah, there's a lot out there. So I'm interested. A lot of what we're talking about here is sort of the intermediaries who filter the distribution of music and culture. And one really interesting case you talked about was Omar Suleiman, who is a Syrian wedding singer who wasn't exactly a superstar in the local context, but then was sort of cherry picked and turned into an indie. star and i was wondering if you could talk about your take on that yeah it's so funny because i knew about that music before he got big i'm like yeah it's debka it's like it's huge in the levant like anywhere you go and it's like a big part of the world like that's the music um but then his popularity is so i guess i see it as a lost opportunity for people to know more about Debka music because there's a lot of really interesting stuff. You know, like there's multiple bands in Brooklyn. play this stuff like it's really easy to go and not hard to find like super interesting like much more interesting than he's doing people who are actually like widely known and influential and like doing progressive things and like all this crazy stuff is going on and yet like having some seen him in Europe I'm like oh it's actually just like he's presented as this sort of like unique individual like zero cultural context even giving all the craziness going on in Syria and And not only that, there's somehow, there's like a very awkward, I was there on his first European tour, actually interviewed him. And it was, I was just like. this is, it just felt really problematic. There's such a huge gulf, there's such a large gulf between the audience and the person on stage. And then ordinarily he just dresses kind of regular, but then he kind of goes into this whole, it's almost, it's less seeing him on stage and seeing people's reaction to it. You know, they're like, oh yes, it's like this weird, I feel like a lot of fantasies were singing around the room. And as a result of that, Yeah. And I think the other one you talked about was Konono No. 1, which is a Congolese band. Yeah. It's a similar story, right? It is a similar story. Although, I mean, the difference is Konono was so intriguing because, what is it, pre-YouTube they were buzzing around. I was like... Like, oh, yes, it's African music, but it sounds like Sonic Youth. It sounds like experimental guitar. And you'd try and find a clip, and it was really difficult. But it's just very funny. They were on an LP of a French Okora, a state-sponsored French ethnographic music label in 87. it sounds the exact same, like nobody really cares, you know, because then the sort of classical world music connoisseur audience was like, what is this stuff? But in a way, the liner notes were very much in tune with now. They're like, look at what they're doing with such busted up equipment. So that it turns into this sort of weird story about like poverty, like the resourcefulness of poverty plus the like libidinal flourish of distortion. And then you get this cool music and it is cool music. But my friends, this band, The X, like the very first person to bring them to Europe was like, oh, you know, he'd heard the recordings and was like, what a great sensibility. Let's put them with someone who kind of, you know, not only is The X moving in this really interesting sort of African direction in their own sort of like rhythmic groove based playing, but they are like, they use distortion in really interesting ways. And so they played a bunch of shows together, you know, like Kona my friend Andy Moore's amp because they would just turn it up all the time. But then I was, when I was thinking about that, I'm like, oh, you kind of do need to talk about like all that's, all that's at play here. But then the thing that really struck me in the end was the fact that the majority of the band had just. slipped away into Europe at the end of the tour. People were like, it's actually, you know, that's where the band goes. Maybe there's 12 or 13 people and at the end there were three. And I was like, so in a way, of course I'm talking about the music and how it travels and the way in which the sort of narratives of meaning wrap around it. And then I was like, but here's a story about Conan which hasn't been told and is actually somehow very, to me, very integrated this sort of decision for invisibility and silence. And then, of course, I, yeah. I often think about that Chow Ranjit Singh, Ten Ragas to a Disco beat in 1983. And it's a great album, but a lot of what's being sold is this backstory and the novelty, you know? So I'm curious, like, as someone who's often an intermediary, who often has a foot in two worlds, like... What do you keep in mind in terms of like trying to go about this in a way that you're taking care of the people who are working with you? Yeah. Ideas like actually trying to get a handle for what's going on while acknowledging your own outsider status is really important. important you know and so with with like the tribal guarechero stuff i'm like here i am like toy and i were the first people to like who aren't kids who are super into it just to like to kind of check out this scene and he'd done his homework and had been emailing and in touch with everyone and knew it was happening but i was like oh here's this opportunity to like and like you know sort of like no media not even serious like mexican media has covered this and i was like well how do i approach respectful and not goofy. And so it's kind of like you sit down, you talk to the musicians about what matters to them, you know, and then, of course, trying to think about it and position it more broadly. But I think so much of the writing on Konono and Omar, it's just, I mean, there's a larger impulse to be like, okay, this is like the pop star feature formula. This is the person who's on the rise. Look at their idiosyncratic brilliance, X, Y, Z. Now they're going to do some big thing. Here we go. You know, search engine optimization for the title and you're good to go. And that's rarely like the right story, you know? So with the Tutti Ball stuff, I'm like, well, we actually need to talk about like. Israeli psychedelic techno and how that was big in Northern Mexico rave scene. And we need to talk about cumbia because that's so present. And we need to talk about YouTube and the software they're using because that has its own warping on the sound and the drug stuff. The narco stuff is sort of in the background, but then also present in terms of social spaces. So it's trying to give, you know, trying to voice the social complexity around anything. and not turn the musician into a sort of cartoon. Yeah, I was going to ask you, do you ever feel like wary of the kind of flavor of the week thing? Because I know we were talking about Tribal and we were talking about Dubstep and all of these things peaked and then had these moments of media hype and then have disappeared. And I wonder if you think there's a way of... trying to make things more sustainable. Yeah, I think about that a lot. And on a very simple level, you could say, oh, cumbia, people say new cumbia, electro cumbia, whatever. That had its peak in 2010 or something. But even from the beginning, I was like, you know what's interesting in cumbia is the cumbia sonideros who just keep on going. You know, so the guy I read about in the book, this will be his 20th year doing cumbia sonidero parties. This is like old school cumbia, not like digitally. No, totally, totally digital. I mean, he plays a wide variety, but yeah, you know, he's laptop DJing. So all sorts from like brand new productions that people give him, like all synthy to classics to whatever. But the whole talk over, the whole culture. and views around it, but it's not at all about newness, you know? And so, so part of that for me as a writer, it involves, and as a DJ, it's like, if you don't like flavor of the week, then like linger with things, you know, then like return to things you love, then find things or even questions, which are basic enough to sort of support that slowness, like slow digestion. And even when writing about like an album, I'm like, You know, like a good media outlet was like, I was on tour, but they're like, yeah, we would love, you know, 800 words on like the new Kanye West video like by 48 hours from now because they need it fast. And I was like, that's kind of not how any of this should work, you know? Yeah, and with music, there's always more. There's always more interesting. I remember you talking about your kind of vexed relationship to Red Bull. On one hand, you're hitting them up for funding. And on the other hand, there was an anecdote about you had something of an altercation on stage. Can you talk about that? Yes. So yeah, this is a chapter in the book. I'm like, you know, for the most part, I'm looking at the musical culture in a way, but like, it would be incomplete without addressing stuff like this, like Red Bull's presence. And so that was actually really fun one to write, because I'm like, oh, how can I sort of give voice to this sort of complicit complexity, you know, so. I talk about, in retrospect, a hilarious moment in Spain. I was playing at a big Spanish festival in Ponte Vedra. And this was kind of, I guess, Red Bull was more, like, less suave with their marketing at the time. So the DJ booth was built into this ridiculous, sort of, like, fascistic, constructivist platform with all these sharp, like, gunmetal edges glowing in the middle of the stage. And I was like, this is awful. They hadn't told me. It wasn't there for soundcheck. And then I walk out and I try to unplug it, but then everything is plugged into it. It's like literally like glowing Red Bull logo. It's like a El Escorial, like sort of fascist monument in outside of Madrid. But that's an aside. So I was like, this is terrible. And I was like, what can I do? And I was like, okay, I can take off my jacket and drape it over this thing because I to play and then this like you know guy in a suit comes over and he like taps you in the shoulder and he's like sorry you're like you really need to take your jacket off that they need to see it and then i had this kind of fight on stage. I was like, no, I'm not going to do it. You know, he's like, well, they're going to pull the plug on you. I was like, we'll do it. Fine. In the end that I kept on playing, my jacket stayed on. Everyone in the audience was like fully aware of what was happening because I wasn't DJing during this time. And it was just, I was like, yeah, it was a very intense experience actually. Yeah. And then so I'm like, well, that, you know, 2002. But then fast forward to much later on where it's a much more well-oiled machine. Everyone, all sorts of people were like, you should try and get Sufi plugins. funding from Red Bull. You know, like I'd try and get some art grants for it that wasn't really working out. And I was like, I want to make free software based on non-Western like ideas about sound. Like, you know, in Cairo and people are like, no one's going to give you money except maybe Red Bull. They might be into it. And of course that didn't work either. But by sort of laying all my cards on the table, talking about playing that, like a funny Telefonica gig in Peru as well, talk about these weird moments when like corporate money touches me, you know, or sidesteps me as the case may be, was like the only way I think I could deal with any, like dealing with any of that, like how money, how advertising, how branded events, the contour musical culture, because it's getting deeper and deeper and deeper as we go on. And I feel like. The days of being like, this is this ethical line I'm not going to cross. It's like totally kind of fantastical at this point. That's exactly what I want to ask you about. I was interviewing someone else and he was saying, you know, 15 years ago, if one of my friends had taken this Red Bull money, I would have been like, dude, what are you doing? That is so uncool. But now the cultural climate has shifted where. I don't, maybe the money doesn't exist elsewhere, but it's become a lot more permissible, you know, and there isn't the antagonism of the selling out, you know, do you think the pendulum has kind of swung too far? Like, do you think we're too permissive of that? Should we be more like, well, it's. I guess the thing I want to see more of, I'm just like, how come more artists aren't, how can I phrase it, like are so quick to metabolize inside those structures? You know, it's like, like you rush to play the museum gig, you rush to sign up for Red Bull Music Academy, you know, which is effectively like you're giving your marketing information to this global company. But like people will sort of like you rush to give away your free mix to such and such website. And so in a How come the emphasis on any type of visibility is so prominent right now? Like, what about more like subterfuge? What about more, you know, it's not just having like weird hashtags in your name or characters that can't, but like, what about having like meaning that exists outside of its documentation? Like, that's just kind of an interesting thing that I'm like, it's in a way. it's a huge open space. So I'm like, how come more people aren't doing interesting things than open space? Like you can do whatever you want with whatever horrible energy drink you want, you know, like I'm kind of, but I'm more curious. I'm like, I kind of want to find those people or want to inspire those people. So I was listening to your interview with Shy Boy on the MoMA podcast. And you asked her if you think that the New York kind of music and nightlife scene has become like sanitized or gentrified and I want to ask you the same question like are you are you pessimistic or what do you feel you know I have this like it's totally I have this like stupid optimism in music like everything else outside of music you know it's like in 20 years we'll be fighting over water it's gonna be horrible but I'm like you know music it's music's gonna do all right you know because like instability like that in a way that leads to better music like stability that also leads to but you kind of can't go wrong you know it's like it's like investing in wall street or something it's like there's you can't beat the machine but um so what that means in new york city is it's kind of actually back to the things i was just saying like there's I don't tell anybody there's like a musical thing that I go to every week like religiously and I just don't tell anybody about it because it's like a very small it's not really a thing but I'm like this is so moving and meaningful like this is my thing and so I'm like this is great this is that's a secret and so much of like maybe maybe it just reverts to house parties and that's that's where it's at, you know, like as the neighborhood drives up, as like the huge venues swoop down, you know, I think that there's always going to be, I guess part of me sits back and I was like, yeah, I would like come down from Boston in like, you know, late 90s and like go to these crazy DJ parties. And it was so wonderful because it wasn't about dancing. It wasn't about that type of... CNBC Invisibility, it was like really people just doing weird stuff with records in a small, like smoke-filled room. Like that was New York back then. And I was like, that feels so far gone. It's like now the sort of like, it's almost like the DJ monoculture is that people should dance, you know? And I was like, wow. And also in the late 90s, partly because of venues like Tonic, I'm like, there's so much more interaction. between DJ culture and like improv, different types of like improv, experimental avant-garde music. And then now you get the stone, which is kind of snobby and like, we have no PA, you know, you're just like, ah. So there are certain moments that are more conducive to things. But also the flip side of that is it doesn't take much to make something happen in New York City. If you're just trying to replicate the same thing, which is already like, there's no space left to get in. But if you just kind of go a few feet in another direction, I think it The book is out? Yeah. I'm doing this crazy project in Philadelphia with 20 musicians in two weeks called Room 21 at the Barnes Foundation. So it's like this really big thing. And because the book was going on, I hadn't been able to actually think about this piece until like four days ago. And I'm like, man, I've got all this work. So I'm working with... incredible self-directed string ensemble from Philly called Prometheus, 15 members. I'm bringing Emily Manzo and Ben Lee, aka Baby Copperhead from New York. bringing up an amazing Ethiopian musician from D.C. because that's your Heptamerium, bringing over a secret guest that we can't announce until this person's around. But it's kind of doing a large-scale composition, evening-length performance in this sort of big atrium space that's in dialogue with a... particular room in this very quirky, highly idiosyncratic kind of museum space called Barnes. And are the DJ sets and traditional dance music taking a backseat to these more big picture conceptual projects? I guess they are taking a back seat. You know, it's funny because it has its own momentum, you know, so like doing a show in Berlin in October. But yeah, I feel like those have its own thing. So in a way, I mean, DJing is wonderful. Like I love DJing, but somehow these... with different performances sidestepping or working with ensembles, whatever they, for me, it raises different questions in a way. So that's kind of, it's a very exciting place to be doing things. Cool. Um, do you want to take us away with a song? Yeah, so, okay, so this is the song to end it off. And this was one of the tracks that actually first got me really interested in asking questions about cumbia, like, you know, 10 years ago or whatever, out in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Los Cumbieros, La Cumbia Limitada. But it's by Sonido Kumballa. And so, like, I've always really enjoyed, like, his music. I was sort of diving into the world of Sonido culture in New York City. And this was his early track. He was giving shout-outs to people in the Bronx. It's like all sorts of... Actually, it's not... It's a branded CD. It's not him on the mic here, but... Sonido is a selector. Exactly. So this is him playing a track with dub Yes, except that this is a CD he sort of put together, but he's not the particular person talking in this song. People just gave him all these beats and somehow, yeah, Los Cumbieros is the group that's doing it. But they're talking over it, sonidero style, for a mixtape that this one particular sonidero that I talk with at length in the book compiled, if that makes sense. Okay, that. That. I just got the most envious group. What is that? What is that? And that is the maximum. What is that? Sergio Hernandez. Well, thank you so much for joining me. Thank you, Max. It's been a pleasure. Yeah, guys, go check out Jace's book. It's called Uproot. It's available via FSG Originals. Out now in all decent bookstores. Uprootbook.com. Thanks a lot. Thank you.
