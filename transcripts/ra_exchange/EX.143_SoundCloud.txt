*music* Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Ropline, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. You'd be remiss to talk about music in 2013 without mentioning SoundCloud. A tool for distributing and discovering sounds, musical or otherwise, it's become ubiquitous over the last few years. TechCrunch reported last December that 180 million people use SoundCloud each month, which represents a staggering 8% of internet users. Snoop Dogg and The Economist might have accounts these days, but it's far smaller fish who have long been at the heart of this community. For producers looking to get their sounds out into the world, SoundCloud has proven invaluable. It's probably no coincidence then that Eric Walforsch, the company's CTO, is an electronic producer himself. But when he and CEO Alexander Jung brought their startup to Berlin, in 2007, the web wasn't an easy place for dance music producers to do much of what they take for granted today. I caught up with Walforsch in Berlin recently to discuss Soundcloud's role in this transformation. And since Soundcloud itself has been growing by leaps and bounds of late, we touched on some of the challenges and innovations on its horizon. So Eric, you're probably best known at this point as SoundCloud's co-founder and chief technology officer, but from the time before you founded the company up through the present, you've been making electronic music. Let's just start out by talking a little bit about your electronic music. Sure. So, I mean, yeah, I think it started out quite a long time ago now. Like, it's almost 25 years ago. So my mother got this... computer, an old Mac and a synthesizer from her church. So she used to, well, she still does actually, she conducts a choir and she plays the organ in the church and they wanted her to sort of start composing. Actually, she had the ambition like, I'm going to start using a computer to compose stuff and so on. You know, I was like eight years at the time or something, and she ended up not using it at all, but I kind of got right into it. So I started using the synth and, you know, the Mac and started sequencing tracks, basically. And then, you know, as I got older, I kind of went through, you know, different generations of whatever synthesizers and computers, PCs, Macs, Ataris. Amiga's tracker programs. I started using Cubase when the first virtual studio thing. you know, came into Cubase and end of the nineties, I ended up having a studio with a lot of hardware actually was a small studio, but, um, had a, had a hardware sampler, but it was only, it was only when sort of Mac laptops started getting good enough. And when the sampler moved into the virtual environment that I really started making sort of like finding my identity as a, as an, as an artist. So. My music is heavily sort of sample and now recently field recording based. And so that's really when I started out. And around the same time, I went to Berlin as well. So I got a record deal in the early 2000 with Sonar Collective. and ended up moving to Berlin in 2001 and stayed there for a year. I actually worked at the software company as well then, but I made music on the side, and then I ended up sort of traveling around in Europe for almost a year and made a record called Soul Hack in 2003, which was all about sort of cut up... samples, you know, somewhere between Prefuse 73 and Fortet and some other artists like that. I'm curious if working on music with computers was sort of an introduction to working with computers in general, because I know that you have some training in engineering. Yeah, I mean, that's really how it started. It started through music. And for the first couple of years, that was most of what I did with computers was actually composing stuff. But like I was a young teenager back then and then sort of the web came around. And even before that, CD-ROMs and stuff, you know, started that. I got into sort of programming through more the visual side and the media side of computers. My father, you know, he was always, you know, he was really excited about computers in general. And he, at one point, he had one of the... the better Mac computers in the sort of mid-90s and, you know, with a color display. I've never seen that before and got into sort of HyperCard and Macromedia Director and sort of those things. But it was only when the web came around, sort of 95, that I started building web pages and really got into programming as well. So yeah, these two things have been running in parallel for a long time. Like I've been making music and making websites basically for a long time. Yeah, I wonder how one informs the other. You're continuing to make electronic music now. as uh you're helping to run an internet company yeah i mean so the end of the 90s actually worked at an animation studio for a while so i ended up doing a couple of small like short movies with uh with a friend of mine um and i got into this technique called compositing which is now you know heavily used in post-production in movies and stuff and a program called After Effects. And I remember sort of the revelation of using that program in that like everything was, you know, it's what you in programming, you would call it like object oriented. So you could really modify everything and everything could fit into everything. It was like a, you know, boxes of boxes and, you know, just anything could be combined with everything. And that's really, that's one of the big revelations of my, you know, in general, sort of my career, I think that that program, and that ended up influencing how I made music in the end. I stopped sort of doing compositing, but I started treating music as compositing. So I started... using the samples in the same way as I would use sort of the fragments to create moving collage you know on the on the visual side and then that somehow informed programming as well and then programming started influencing music creation as well so the album you know was called Soul Hack obviously for a reason because I was hacking at the same time, you know, so it was very much a geeky kind of endeavor. You have a new album out right now, actually, I think it came out pretty recently, called Ecclesia. It's a really cool project. Tell me a little bit about it. Yeah, so... I mean, I ended up having a long break from music. So I've, you know, after the album came out in 2003, I toured for about two years. So I was sort of in various countries actually on the weekend, sort of playing, you know, playing live gigs. And then at the same time I was studying engineering in Stockholm. So I had a really weird lifestyle there for a couple of years. It got really intense. And I have to say, like, it was at some point just too much. And I just lost, somehow lost inspiration. And I ended up, like, not making music for a couple of years after that. But then when I came back to Berlin and, you know, SoundCloud started to really sort of take off. and things were working much better. In summer of 2008 was when I sort of, I got this idea that I have, you know, I still have a lot of ideas with music and I need something to sort of balance work and just do something else. And so I kind of opened up my laptop again. I remember it very clearly. And I started doing this, started doing tracks based on this very simple idea that was, I have this connection with sort of choir music, organ music, and through my mother, you know, specifically, but also through just passion for that kind of music and been listening to it for, you know, for years. And I had all of these references and all of these influences. And I realized, like, I can actually, I basically tried it, you know, is this actually possible to combine that really ancient old music with something new and sort of remix it, essentially. to something that I could really relate to. And I ended up trying it and it didn't really sort of work out in the beginning. And I took a long break, like a half year break or so. And then I picked it up again and then managed to sort of pull it off. I made one track, which was based on a choir recording. And then I got this idea that, hey, I'm just going to go around churches and field record. I'm just going to go and actually get my own material for this. And it's going to be tedious. It's going to take a long time, but I'm going to go and do it. And it took three years. And I worked sort of on and off on it. Sometimes it was just depressing. It was just such a big project and complicated project. And I was kind of on my own without any clear deadlines or anything. So it took a long time. But in the end, sort of things actually came together. I ended up, I think, making something like 50 different tracks. And out of those, eight tracks are on the album. And then there's like a... an intro and an interlude on it as well. I ended up working also with two visual artists here from one from Berlin, one from Vienna on an iPad app. So there's, there's like a visual, there's like a moving 3d visual that's connected to each track that you can, you can download an app and then sort of have an audio visual representation of each track, which is kind of, it's kind of interesting as well. Yeah, you can really see it kind of bringing together a lot of different interests. I wanted to talk about the state of the internet for music when SoundCloud was sort of first kicking off. At that time, which was 2006, 2007, how was the internet working for musicians and how was it not working at all for musicians? Yeah, I mean, that's a really good and relevant question. So like when we started out, you know, I remember my friends were all like, yeah, you have to be on MySpace. It's like the biggest thing. And within a matter of, I don't know, one or two years, MySpace... became this huge thing and it had I think when we started SoundCloud MySpace had around 100 million users and I thought you know we'd never never ever get to that scale there's no way we're gonna be there And we're going to solve this sort of niche thing, which no other service out there really can do, which is just a simple thing of I want to share a piece of music with a friend, you know, and maybe it's not even finished. Maybe I want to do it privately and just get some feedback on it. And that was, you know, that was a big piece, big gaping hole on the web. You know, there were all these sort of files sharing services like, you know, you send it and C you like all of this very cheap and crappy services to be honest uh and my space you know in general was just a really bad experience actually like i went on a thing and i i really couldn't get how people were so excited about it like it was so poorly executed and i i could see that and it was a very frustrating experience i think for both you know me and alex my co-founder And we sort of, you know, we started thinking about how can we fix this? And we ended up building this very, very simple service that was just focused on audio sharing, really, and solving that use case of just publishing something and sharing it. Yeah. You've sort of differentiated now between having a sharing tool and having a publishing tool. And I'm sort of wondering what the difference between the two is. is to you. Yeah, I mean, I think that's a really blurry line. What we saw was that actually there was this huge sort of untapped need that we kind of ran into, you know, like we started in a niche and there was a lot of... electronic music producers sharing stuff and a lot of that was was private um at the start and you know we we were in private beta so you had to have an account and so on and we were in private beta almost for like for over a year um almost one year and a half so but then as we launched in 2008, quickly sort of, we noticed things started shifting around. So first of all, I mean, people were leaving MySpace, right? Then they were basically looking for an alternative because already at that time, Facebook was starting to take over all of the sort of private traffic, right? So that had started happening. Twitter had just sort of started to gain traction. We could sense a big movement. The iPhone came out. There was this trend with just really clean and simple services, really focused web apps. And we fit sort of right into that. And then we became more and more and more of a publishing platform. The private aspect got less and less and less emphasized. We also realized that... Actually, a lot of the private use cases that we were looking at from the start, they weren't actually easily solvable with our solution. So, you know, we just sort of naturally shifted more and more towards public sharing. Not long after you guys founded the company, you moved it from Stockholm to Berlin. Why make that move? Why come to Berlin? Yeah, I mean, I love the place. You know, I love Berlin. Like I came here the first time in 97. I saw, you know, broken, crazy, creative place with lots of, you know, dark clubs and amazing spaces that were just sort of waiting to... be taken over by young people wanting to do cool stuff, right? And I came back in 2000 and in 2001 lived here for a year and it was a really inspiring time for me. You know, ever since then, I mean, I was studying in Stockholm and I went to the Bay Area, you know, down to Silicon Valley for three months or so in 2006 to work on my thesis. You know, through music as well, I'd seen a lot of different cities because I was playing gigs in them. And there was something about... Berlin which was really unique which you couldn't really find anywhere else and you know it's hard to grasp exactly what is that thing right but like we think of it now as it's just this crazy mix of you know it's just arts punk and tech it's just all mashed together and it's an entrepreneurial place you know so for us it just fits perfectly it's it's the vibe of you know soundcloud as a you know microcosm is is reflecting the city it's it's that creative place where you know frankly i just wanna i wanna stay here so it's it's it's great yeah Yeah, readers of our site definitely think when they think of Berlin, they think of it as this sort of techno hub. It's known for its nightclubs. It's known for being a place very friendly to producers. But it's also more and more becoming a tech hub, which is maybe something people aren't as aware of. Can you tell me a little bit about the startup scene here? Yeah, I mean, you know, when we came here in 2007, there wasn't really that much going on. And I think it's only recently that... that this sort of hub, yeah, tech hub, like you say, has really started to emerge and become very tangible. You know, without sort of going on a long limb of trying to explain why, I think... you know, just in general, the infrastructure of the web is there, right? That was the first revolution that that happened, right? And it's mature and it's global. So the infrastructure is everywhere. And I think... Somebody, Chris Dixon, who is a former entrepreneur, he's now a VC in the Bay Area with one of the best VCs in the world. He wrote a blog post around it actually recently. Why is this revolution not more concentrated? And he mentioned that, you know, throughout history, basically, there are these sort of like cycles of innovation where like the infrastructure first gets built out, you know, something like railroads, you know. or any other thing, the automotive industry used to be very concentrated and then it became global. It's the same thing happening now, right? Like all of these cities and interesting places around the world, all of a sudden they can sort of draw on their sources of power and apply that to this amazing infrastructure that's already there. And all of a sudden you have a distributed revolution, right? I think, you know, a couple of hotspots in Europe and Berlin is probably, you know, in the top three right now. So that's really awesome to see and how fast that went as well. You know, Berlin is a great place to live. It has a certain vibe about it. There are certain companies here that builds a great foundation for this to happen. It's kind of natural when you look at it from, you know, in hindsight. Yeah, it seems like Berlin is a really great place to run a small company. And I wonder if it's sort of uniquely suited for the company that you're helping to run. because electronic music is so big here. I wonder if SoundCloud is sort of uniquely suited for electronic music producers, people who are making stuff on their computers in their bedroom, looking to get it out. What do you think about that? I mean, you know, we started out sort of firmly in the electronic scene with basically a small informal network of people who were, you know, producing, DJing and so on. And we've grown organically from there. It's really been very organic growth. from the start and sort of wider and wider circles. In the meantime, you know, we are prominent in pretty much every kind of music scene in the world. So we've broadened out from electronic music then to sort of all kinds of music, then to all kinds of audio. So we're a very broad platform covering lots of different sort of niches and verticals, right? So, I mean, yes, I think, you know, we're still... heavily entrenched like in the electronic world like we're kind of I think maybe one of the most prominent services around and you know in other music niches you know we're still gaining ground so it's definitely you know I think Electronic producers, they're very close to technology and they really like to use the latest tools and they make use of that. And so that's been a really natural place to start for us. SoundCloud has undergone a lot of changes, it seems like, in the last year. I think the user experience is probably quite a bit different now than it was a year ago or maybe even six months ago. A lot has been made of the redesign, but I wanted to start on one thing that I found really interesting, which was that the price of entry into the premium features of the site has gone way down recently. I believe that the... You can have virtually an unlimited membership to SoundCloud now for something like nine euro a month, correct? Yeah. How does such a major price drop change the experience of the site, change the community of the site? Yeah. I mean, so we've been, you know, we did this update recently. We've been listening to a lot of feedback from our users for a long time regarding also our pricing model and, you know, features we could bring into the various tiers of our premium accounts and so on. And we ended up, you know, just simplifying things a lot. And I think, you know, it's a fairly straightforward. update in that you know things just got radically simpler and we have a much cheaper account that's unlimited which you know reflects where we're going which is you know we want people to be able to share all of their audio in a kind of frictionless way and so we're moving towards that and I think you know it's a pretty natural step in that direction i mean what what i should add also which i think is like also really interesting is the fact that we're starting to work with um with uh pro partners as we call them so we have um we have some sort of content partners that we're working with both on the music and audio side and we also have brands that we're starting to bring in on the platform as you know, creators of content. So we've had, you know, Red Bull on the site. We've had, you know, a bunch of radio channels. We had now August Alsina and The Dream, big urban artists in the US joining into this program. And so... We're experimenting with some new features there that allow these creators to express themselves even more over the platform. And we're looking to really work more in this area and take some of those features as well. you know, give them to all, all of our pro users. Seems like advertising has never been part of the, of the SoundCloud experience. And I wonder if this sort of this, this new pro partner plan is sort of a, sort of a way of, of bringing big brands into the website without having them put a banner up or something like that. Yeah, I mean, I think in general, you know, there is a strong trend now of something called native advertising, which means, you know, brands use social media as... as these communication channels, you know, but also to build a community. And they're just, you know, another user on the platform. And we think, you know, if a brand can really express themselves through, you know, either music and audio and visually in combination, that can be, you know, become a really interesting experience for any user on the site, right? So it becomes very relevant to anybody. So, you know, whether you're, you know, commercial entity producing a podcast show, for example, or something else that really works as a native part of the experience. And, you know, we have things like you can promote your profile now so you can buy a spot in our suggested users feature where basically that gets, you know. highlighted and we think you know that's a great way of doing that without basically compromising the user experience at all so the more natively this can become the more sort of you know integrated it can become without getting in the way of users we think it works really really well You mentioned that there are some features in these sort of pro-oriented accounts that are going to be coming down to some of the other accounts soon. What are some of those features? Yeah, so I mean, I can't promise at this stage that they will actually appear in that shape and form. We're continuously always working on this premium plan. there will be upgrades for sure. We have basically, we have two main things that we've been working on now in this pro partner accounts. One is that the profile is cleaner and more visual. So you can, you can put sort of a bigger visual canvas on there. That's one, one thing. The other thing is something called visual sounds. um are actually moving sound is the correct term for it because the the idea is making the sounds more visual turning them into like one audio visual object so like We've always been about visualizing sounds and making them social. And this is just a way of sort of creating even more visual sounds. So you can essentially attach a bunch of big images to your audio. And then it kind of becomes this fluid sort of slideshow thing. And it's a really great experience because audio is the main kind of emotional carrier. let's say but like then you have this visual component which is a kind of ambient addition to that and we think it works really well as a format and it's something we're experimenting with now yeah Yes, you've been very open as well in terms of working with developers who are using SoundCloud. You have an open API. I'm curious about these music hack days that I've heard about that you guys sort of maybe organized to start, but they really took on a life of their own. Yeah, exactly. So that's really a global phenomenon now. So there's a, I don't know, I think there's a bunch of them happening every year. And we have developers going there like on a monthly basis right now. Yeah, it's basically a bunch of hackers coming together to hack on music ideas. You know, so it's all about music and audio creation. and how you can innovate around that in 24 hours or so. And I've seen a bunch of fun stuff come out of that. And yeah, we have an open API, an open platform. It's part of our sort of openness philosophy in general. We've seen a bunch of really interesting stuff come out of that. I mean, there's some really great, you know, music software that's integrated with it now. So you have, you know, apps like Figure and Ableton and, you know, Pro Tools even, and, you know, GarageBand from Apple integrated with. with soundcloud using the api but then you have all of these you know small hacks so you have At one point there was a physical radio where you could physically literally turn the wheel and just tune into any city in the world and it would play a thing that maybe got uploaded like 10 seconds ago to that city. So you have those kinds of hacks as well. And it's just hugely entertaining and a great place to innovate and have fun, I think. I remember watching a video of a talk that you gave. at some point recently. And something that you said in the talk was that SoundCloud would never get into the business of selling music. I'm curious, why not? Yeah, I mean, I think from the start, like even, you know, even around the time, like it was, you know, over five years ago now. To us, it was pretty clear that the cloud was kind of the future. And, you know, access as opposed to transaction-based, you know, music consumption was also the future. And, you know, this is something we still strongly believe in, that, you know, downloading something isn't necessarily the way to consume it. So I think that... That was mainly my point, I think, in that talk as well, which I've made several times the last couple of years, is that if you're running a startup, if you're trying to solve a problem, don't try to do all of these different things at once. established download services out there you know there's iTunes there's Amazon Google all these big players right there is beat port in the electronic music world there's a ton of different services out there and we we don't want to We don't necessarily want to do all of these different things. We try to solve this one problem and we think it's a big part of what the future is going to look like. I've heard you say as well that you sort of see SoundCloud as kind of the YouTube of music. or of sounds rather, it seems like there are going to be challenges always operating on that sort of scale, sort of fitting that niche on the internet. I mean, what are some of the challenges that SoundCloud faces as it grows? Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, global internet population now is something like 2.2. billion people. And I think about half of those or so have some sort of mobile access. Might be less, I actually don't know. But that's a really big number. We just recently announced that we hit 180 million unique people every month so we have a reach effectively which is almost eight percent of the entire internet population so yeah things really are at a large scale and we think you know with soundcloud we want to have a kind of global impact we want to reach you know a lot of people and basically show as well that you know hey it's an open web you know anybody out there can go and share, like whether you're in kind of rural Africa and you want to publish audio, you can do that. It's actually not that hard. And these things are global. And so I think that's part of our message as a company is it's really a basic infrastructure for humanity in a way. That sounds pretty profound, but it's... I think that's really part of what drives us as well as a company. You mentioned the open web, keeping things open. But as you're operating at a larger scale, there are obviously sort of regulations. You can only become so open, really. I would imagine that copyright is a major challenge with a service like SoundCloud. Do you see it that way? I mean, copyright is, you know, one of the central themes in our business. It's something we take very, very seriously, obviously. And we work closely with rights holders, you know, on a day-to-day basis. We have, you know, automatic filtering systems in place. We have people working 24 hours a day. seven to respond to any sort of takedown notices or anything like that so it's something we you know take very seriously obviously and it's part of what we do and we obviously have to respect rights holders you know there's no no question about that and I don't think that's necessary necessarily you know in contrast with with what open means you know if if i am the rights holder if i have the necessary rights i can you know i can publish something onto soundcloud and it's you know it will be up there so you know in that sense we're we're open while still you know respecting the the rules of play you know But do you see that as a sort of attention on the internet with the way things are right now? That on the one hand, there's this sort of this ability to stretch the limits of sort of what holding a copyright means. And then there are still these sort of firm limits in place about what you can do with other people's content. Yeah, I mean, I do think, you know, initiatives like Creative Commons, for example, is really interesting and really relevant. You know, at the end of the day, we're a company, we can only do so much. And, you know, we can only try sort of our best to comply with any regulations that might be. place you know and so you know we believe in the open web and we believe in sort of moving and pushing things forward but it shouldn't be sort of while compromising any laws or anything like that you know absolutely we were talking a little bit before about what the internet looked like for music and for musicians, artists, producers in the past five, six years ago. Let's talk about the present. Where do you think we're at right now? And how is sort of SoundCloud really fit into that? Yeah, I mean, I think obviously one of the big sort of mega trends of the day is really mobile. And the fact that everybody has a mobile device in their pocket and they can go and, you know, listen to music, they can share audio with the world. You know, you can take photos with your phone, you can take videos with your phone, but you can also record audio. It's very, very easy to do. And with our apps, you can literally share from, you know, from the app on the go. And we see more and more people doing that. We see more and more people, you know, listening on mobile as opposed to listening anywhere else. And I think for musicians, this is amazing. You know, you can, you know, you can be anywhere and you can sort of share your business card, if you will, you know. People can literally pull out their phone and start following you, you know, right away. And I see that happen more and more. And it sort of integrates much more naturally in people's lives, which I think is amazing. So that, I think, is a big game changer in general. And I think, you know, another huge benefit is just the fact that the sort of literacy of people in general has increased. When it comes to the web and how they think of it, how they work with it, you know, a billion people on Facebook, people understand these models of, hey, I follow somebody and I... I can sort of stay up to date with what they do. You know, I can reach out to any artist or if I'm, you know, producing a short movie and I need music for it, you know, I can just private message them on SoundCloud. And, you know, in the next hour I have, you know, I have a soundtrack for my movie. It's really that fluidness I think really benefits musicians. Do you get a sense of where this sort of evolution is headed and maybe where you'd like to see it head? I mean, I think, I think, you know, artists today, the ones we see that really are successful in SoundCloud. are the ones that are able to share content, you know, in a kind of continuous stream almost. So they're able to engage with their followership and their fans in a kind of continuous basis. So, you know, whether it is like, you know, a Snoop. dog or 50 cent managed to sort of get their whole i don't know like 3 000 young producers engaged in creating a remix for their latest track so like they just put up something and and they have people remix it on the fly and then they sort of start reposting their content back breaking new artists through their own stream. We had Snoop Dogg, for example, just the other week at South by Southwest. He was there actually premiering a movie that he made, which is kind of essentially a long music video that he made with a Polish singer that he met over SoundCloud, incredibly enough. So they actually ended up making tracks together. And then, you know, he posted some of those tracks in her profile. And now, you know, she's really taking off as a singer as well. All these things kind of happen and it's all facilitated by artists and sound creators. So they can act, you know, they don't only create sort of unique content, but they also curate content in various ways. And they engage with the community. That is really where, you know, for us, where the future is headed. You know, as a band, sort of just releasing an album once a year in one go and, you know, not doing anything. anything else around it and sort of, you know, maybe, maybe go on tour, but sort of don't document anything or show any sort of. progress or communication aside from that sort of one album every other year, that model is getting less relevant for us. Like it works. It works on the platform, but it's not where I think the future is going to be. I'm curious about how you've seen people using SoundCloud. And have there been any... really interesting uses of the service that you've seen that you would have never expected to see when you were starting the site? Well, I mean, to be honest, I would never ever have expected that Snoop Dogg would make a movie with a, you know, totally unknown singer out of a small city in Poland. And then I would end up, you know... know meeting both of them at South by Southwest and we hosting their movie premiere that's just unbelievable to me like that's that's just amazing you know and then you know on top of that Usher came by as well you know just to say hi and and watch the movie premiere which is you know that's unbelievable that that we are able to facilitate that And I think that in itself kind of sums up a lot of what we try to do with SoundCloud, I think. Aside from that, I still really get excited about new... mobile apps for audio creation so there's an app called figure which is a really nice sort of very simple sort of synthesizer plus drum machine type app for for iphone and ipad it shares directly to SoundCloud. And I've seen a bunch of people sharing actually really good tracks on there, which I've ended up listening to, which is really cool because I think that's still an emerging trend. But when that really starts taking off, that basically people can sit on the train and just make a track and share it, that's amazing. And I have... You know, I have a hip hop producer who I know, but I've only met him actually once. And it was like 10 years ago. And after that, we were kind of virtually in contact. And he's kind of producing these little skits, you know, and he's done that for years now. And that kind of usage, I think, is really amazing. I always listen to his skits because it's exact. what I like listening to. You know, I really love, you know, just, you know, JD's productions, like when, you know, it's just these short little clips, which isn't really, you know, music that he's publishing anywhere. You know, it's literally only shared on SoundCloud. And I think, you know, that to make that possible on a mobile device or on a tablet device with the same sort of quality and the same production quality, like we still have to get there. But I think that will happen and that's going to be really amazing as well. Do you ever wish that you could just take a step back, not be one of the people running SoundCloud? and just experience it as a user. Yes, definitely. I often have that feeling, actually. It's really hard to be objective about it and to put myself in the shoes of users around the world. And this is something we really try to do. talk with users a lot and get a lot of feedback and yeah I'd definitely love to be able to do that so Thank you. so you ♪♪ ♪♪ you
