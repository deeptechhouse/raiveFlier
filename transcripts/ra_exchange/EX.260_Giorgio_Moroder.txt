Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resonant Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Stephen Titmuss. and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Giorgio Moroder. Moroder has had a truly exceptional life. He's one of only a handful of artists who can seriously claim to have changed the face of popular music. He pioneered the use of synthesizers in pop, taking electronic music from the avant-garde to the top. of the charts. His work with Donna Summer in the 1970s, most notably "I Feel Love," continues to inspire artists from across the musical spectrum. Merola's career, however, is much more than just disco. He's also one of the world's most celebrated producers and successful movie composers, a line of work he's won three Oscars for. We met with Giorgio at an event organised by Bridges for Music at London's Shoreditch House, ahead of the release of his new album, Deja Vu. The results were an entertaining walk through 40 years of pop and Hollywood history. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. An exchange with Giorgio Moroder is up next. ♪ ♪ So I'm very happy to be here for this great program, Bridges for Music. But I had so much fun talking to Stephen about football. So should we talk about football? Do you know Ancelotti? We can talk about football, yeah. No? No? No? Okay. About Chelsea? No, okay, then let's, maybe we should talk about music. The people have spoken, Giorgio. Okay. Well, we've been talking a little bit about electronic music, and of course... you are one of the electronic music greats. But that's not how you started, was it? How did you first start in music in your hometown of Italy? Actually, as a guitarist, I was never a great one. So I started to be a professional musician and we were bass, piano and guitar. Now, a pianist and a guitar, they never work well together. Because pianist does certain chords. The guitarist a different one. So I finally, they threw me out of the guitar and I had to learn to play. And so I became a bass player. And I played as a musician all over Europe, in Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, England. I had one gig in England at the Savoy Hotel. I won't forget that one. And then in, I think I was 27, I moved to Berlin. where I had an aunt so I could stay there, I could live there. And I stayed there for four years and then finally I moved to Munich. Of course. And during that period, you were the front person and Giorgio was the name you produced and made music under. Did you enjoy being the front person and being the person in the front of the stage? Well, yes and no. When you're young, you want to be a singer, become famous, and me too. But I know that I didn't have a great voice. And especially, I couldn't remember the lyrics of the songs. So I thought to myself, go back behind the scenes. And that's when I became more like a producer than a performer. And a big moment in your career must have been when you first started using a synthesizer. When did you first hear a synthesizer on a record? There was a beautiful album by Walter Carlos, now Wendy Carlos, called Switch It On Back. And I was fascinated. the way he used the synthesizer to recreate all the sounds of the classical orchestra, like oboes and violins, and I thought that I have to have that. new machine actually. And I found a classical composer in Munich who had one. He played me a few notes and I said, that's it. So I rented the synthesizer, the big Moog module, including Tommy, the engineer. And at the time, that machine was a monster. You needed to know every details because... You had to connect all the channels. And so I didn't want to learn it. And the second thing, it was so expensive. So that's how I started. And what did the owner think about you using this machine to make pop music? Because he was making classical music. Was he cool with that? I guess he was in his classical world. I know he was not happy. with the song I did "I Feel Love" because that... He said in an interview that he had it before that I copied, which is not true at all because it's totally different. So of course "I Feel Love" featured Donna Summer. How did you first meet Donna Summer? Was it in Munich that you first met? I was working in Munich with Pete Bellotti, my English co-producer, and one day we needed three backup singers. with no German or whatever accent. So we found Donna, we found two other girls, and she was great. She was beautiful, a great character, and incredible voice. So we decided to do songs with her. So we did two songs. which did okay, nothing with. And then finally, one day I thought, I should do a great sex song. And I loved the one with Jane Birking and what's his name? Who is it? Oh, I don't know him. Who is he? Oh, Gainsbourg. Oh, who is he? Anyway, I loved that. Je t'aime, moi non plus. But I told Donna. if we do it, we have to do it. Really a new sexy song. So one day she came and said, I have a line at the top, lyrics, ooh, love to love the baby, ooh. And by pure coincidence, I had a studio in Munich called Musicland where I had the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, all those guys. But that day the studio was available. So I went down. It was in the cellar. And we did a little demo, a little recording of Love to Love You Baby. Two, three days later we did a recording, a real one. And I must say I was embarrassed. with that song. I thought nobody's going to release it. No way. So I gave it to my publisher and she went to meet them to the music festival. And she called me in the evening and said, oh, God, Giorgio, we have a hit. Everybody loves it. So what was the point when you really realised this is massive? Was it when it went to America and it started getting rotated over there? Yeah, it came out in America, the three-and-a-half version, which did OK, but nothing special. And one evening, Neil Bogart, the owner of Casablanca... called me and said, "Would you want to do a long version?" And I said, "Perfect." Because it would be one side of an album and I had already four or five songs for the B-side and suddenly I have an album. And so we went back to record. I composed about two new sections. And then the day came when Donna had to do the moaning. which I was really waiting for her. And so we started, and it sounded fake, like, you know, a lot of times it's fake. So I guess she was embarrassed because the husband was there, Bellotti was there, myself, the engineer, and friends. So I thought, let's throw everybody out. I dimmed all the lights and she could just see me for inspiration. And she did it in, what, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and it was done. And that long version was the version which really made the song. Then the DJs played it in discotheques. It was a big hit in the gay community, especially in America. Then they asked the radio stations to play it, and it became a hit from that moment on. Fantastic. I find it fascinating around the time he was having this huge hit. You actually released a really, really experimental album. I can't even pronounce it. Eintelganger. Come on, you can do it. Eintelganger. But that was one of the first purely synthesizer-driven albums, right? Perhaps Kraftwerk as well at that time? Yeah, it was a little bit of a weird thing. I used some of the more synthesizer, but I used a lot of... a vocoder special filters in the voice like I would there was one song which was I cut the voice so it sounded different and and I must say it was a big flop it just didn't sell it was I guess a little too early but thinking about it, two years later, you started to make records like I Feel Love, which really took the synthesizer to a whole new level. Can you tell us about the inspiration to make that record? Where did the idea come from to make a record that sounded so futuristic? Okay, the concept... of the album was to create five, six songs with the sounds of the 50s, 60s, 70s and then try to do something, a song which we could call a song for the future. And so I got Tommy and his big computer, this big wall. And usually I compose by having a rhythm in my headphones, microphone and chords. And that's how I sing and compose the songs. I was in front of this gigantic, it looked like a... you know, switchboard of the old telephones. And there I was. Okay, so how do I start? Okay, the only thing, the first thing, let's get the tempo. One, two, three, four, right? So I created a click. I recorded the click. And then I told Tommy, let's start with the bass line. So he gave me C. Very, very difficult. to find a sound and especially to tune it. So it was I didn't even play it. It was all in the computer. And so I recorded eight bars. Stop. Back again. Out of tune. So it took enormous time. because at that time the computers were not quotes driven. So then I got the white noise and the... and then you cut it and it becomes a hi-hat and then a snare and then the kick and then all the sounds. And the way I recorded it, because I didn't have a melody, I did eight bars in, let's say, C major, then four bars here, then eight bars again. So it was all a little bit disjointed because I didn't have a melody. So I had to compose a melody on something which... was not that great, but Donna did a great job. And then the magic came when we mixed it in Los Angeles. The engineer came up with a delay. So instead of playing... It was... And that was... I thought, this is it. It's not the sound of the future, but... I thought this could be a hit. And what did Donna think of the electronic sound when she first heard it? Was she into it? I don't know. I think she cared. She wrote the lyrics and I think she cared about the music. And I must say the very beginning was not that great for the record because Neil Boga, the owner of Casablanca, liked it, but I guess it was a little too advanced for him. So they didn't promote it that well, but it did very well in England and then from England it went back. to America. And this may sound like a really stupid question, but I Feel Love is one of the greatest dance records ever made. Did you make it with the idea this is going to make people dance? Or was that kind of... accident a byproduct whatever i do whatever i did was always based and always with the idea let's have people to dance and especially especially that that sound obviously that disco period was an amazing period for you you know had so many hits you know nights in white saturn from here to eternity the stuff with munich machine it's clear that you were a massive influence on disco producers, but I wondered if any disco producers really influenced you at all during that period. No, I think... I thought there was only Moroder around. No, actually, I loved a lot of great disco songs, like I Will Survive. What a great song, one of the best disco songs, maybe the best one with Gloria Gaynor. Later on, I had the honour to... I did a recording about 15 years ago with Great Lady. That was the song which I really liked as a disco song. Fantastic. And quite soon after I Feel Love, you got your first film work with Alan Parker and Midnight Express. I'm interested, how did that come about? Was that something that was expected? It was all a little bit of a coincidence. Casablanca and Filmworks were the producers of the movie. And I just heard later that Alan Parker wanted a computer or a synthesized sound. And I think he asked Evangelis, but then it didn't work out. And at that time, I Feel Love came out on the market and he loved it. So he called me and said, there is one scene in the movie where the kid, the guy runs away and said, give me something driving, something in the style. when I did The Chase. The rest, he said, just do whatever you feel. It's a dramatic movie, so get me some really... Intensive, intense music. And I did it by myself. I mean, he wasn't there. And we mixed it on a Sunday afternoon. And he was really concerned and only concerned about that piece of that clip. And had you always wanted to work in movies? Or was it just a job? No, you know, living in Los Angeles and being in pop, it's almost impossible because the composers like John Williams, they're all classical trained, they all write music, they play instruments. So I think I was one of the first ones able to get into the movie business coming from pop. And that really couldn't have gone much better. You won an Oscar for it, for the best score on your first go. Yeah, yeah, that was quite nice. I can tell you, I kind of knew that I really thought I would win. No, just people talking. Yeah, people talking. Because I won the Golden Globe, I won several critics. But then when my name came up and I went up there and I know it's terrifying. It's not like here. You're all nice, right? So you stand up there and you know the stomach starts here and then it comes up here and the voice gets a little harder. And then you look down and about 15 feet away there's Jack Nicholson and there's Steven Spielberg and then the stomach comes up here. And then at one point I wasn't able to talk. And then, thank God, it was Dean Martin who started to make some funny jokes and then the beautiful Rachel Welch who gave me the Oscar. And I was so happy it's over. But from then, the film work really started coming. You had American Gigolo soon afterwards and Cat People, which must have been amazing because you got to work with David Bowie. But I heard David Bowie kind of got to you through Brian Eno. He recommended you. Is that right? Well, the first time I really thought this could be a song which could represent the future was when Brian told David. David, I think he said something. I found the sound of the future. But I don't think that was the case because with Cat People, it's a weird movie, very intense, very obscure. So the director, Paul Schrader, I composed the song and then we were thinking who could sing it. And nobody was more ideal than David. You know, David is very mysterious and the movie's mysterious. And so I sent him the tapes and he loved it. He wrote the lyrics. I went to Montreux. There was a studio. He lives next to the city. To make a long, a short story long, we had dinner at the hotel and we were talking about the song. And then he said, okay, so let's start tomorrow. So I thought, something like around 3, 4 o'clock. No, no, because, you know, with the big guys, the rock and those guys, they work at night. So I said, okay, so when do you want to start? So he said, okay, I come down here for breakfast and then we go. So I was absolutely... surprised. So being such a great singer and having written the lyrics and he knew the song, we did it in about three takes, four takes max. And then we told Paul, okay, it's done. He said, no, no, no, no, that's impossible. You cannot have, the song is not done because usually, because in the movies. It takes us at least 10 takes each scene. I said, look, we redo it for you if you want, but David, it's done, right? So he didn't really believe it, and it was done in, I think, three takes. Amazing. But I suppose by the time that cat people come around, the taste in music in the USA especially had really changed. Disco sucks had come in, dance music wasn't a thing anymore. I suppose the film work was the ideal timing in a lot of ways for you to kind of... keep your career going in the right direction. Yeah, I felt a little sorry for Donna because she, first of all, I think she made a mistake. She changed a record company, a new environment. And one of my mistakes was to convince her or have the idea of changing. In fact, we had quite a nice song with Hot Stuff, which was a little bit of rock, and we should have continued more in that style, go a little away. But I was happy because I was now in the movie business, and Donna, you know, the disco was not that great, and so she faded away a little bit. But then she had another big hit song called I Work Hard for the Money. But disco was gone. Although it was gone in America, in the States. I mean, in Europe it was still playing. They called it dance music, but it was still... But in America it was definitely gone. So through the 80s, you pretty much became the biggest soundtrack producer in the world. You had Top Gun, Flashdance, Electric Dreams, all these humongous films, Scarface as well. did it work in each individual film? Did you work with directors or was it mainly on your own in your studio? Well, I was lucky to work with great directors, Adrian Lyne. One of the main influences in me was Jerry Bruckheimer. Jerry was the producer of the movies. He produced Flashdance. Thief of Hearts, Beverly Hills Cop 2 and Top Gun and he has a very good sense for music. So sometimes you work more with the director. In the case of Jerry, it's more Jerry. With Scarface, I had Brian De Palma, of course, who helped me a lot. So it depends. With Scarface, that was one of the first scores which I did by not seeing the movie. I just read the script. Usually I like to see when the movie is done or at least 70-80% and then start working. And your work rate seemed massive during this period. How many soundtracks were you doing a year at your peak? I did too many. Yeah, because for example with Scarface the problem was I had to do the music for the movie, the score, and they wanted me to compose. something like seven, eight songs, which then it's quite difficult because in the movies, contrary to, let's say, pop artists, they have all deadlines. You have to be at the end of the month or at a certain point you have to have them. So whatever you do, you have to deliver. And so some of the songs... didn't really come out like I would have liked. - Did you turn anything down at all? Or did you almost accept everything? - Well, yeah, kind of, yeah. You say, yes, it's just a little project, but then it becomes a big one. And then some big mistakes like Alan Parker, after winning the Oscar and he winning Best Movie, right, with Oliver Stone, he wanted me to do Fame. So I read the script and I just couldn't imagine the story. And so I passed on it. And plus I was really busy with my 200 other things. And that was a big, big, it was such a great movie and I passed on. But of course, through these films and through all of that work in the 80s, you got to work with by far some of the biggest pop stars of the era. You know, we can, you know, Pat Benatar, Blondie, Phil Oakley, Kenny Loggins. That's just a very small number. Did you have a favorite at all that you worked with? Maybe with the exception of one or two, I love everybody. Like children. It's true. It's true. They're all... I mean, singers usually are very nice people. And I go along... I went along with everybody. So did you ever have any problems with any of those stars at all? Well, I had a little bit of problem with one of the best ever. Freddie Mercury. I did a song for a movie, a silent movie, Metropolis, for which I wrote the music. And there was some minor problems. One was, I think, illegal or anything about the title, Love Kills. And he was a very intimidating person. one of the best performers, one of the best composers, singers, lyricists, background singers, divas, ballet. So, you know, to tell a Freddie, you know, that high note, can you do it again? That's not something you do. So that created a lot of friction. I also read that you very nearly worked with Bob Dylan, which sounds like such an interesting concept. Did that nearly happen? Almost, yeah. I did the music and song for, what was it? One of the Rocky films. No, the other one. Not Rocky, the other series. Yeah, that one. And Sylvester wanted a person a big name to sing the ending and so he said could you compose something for Bob Dylan and I said oh great I mean to work with Bob Dylan that would have been my dream so I composed the song I went to his beautiful house in Malibu all made of wood and I played it and he heard it and then he played it again and he heard it and I kind of sensed maybe he doesn't like it and I was just okay I'll call you tomorrow and I'll give you my answer and he said no so then of course my ego was down there but then I thought maybe the song was probably good but the film was very controversial Rambo and the bad Russians And maybe Bob didn't want to get involved with that. So I also read during this time, which I don't know if this is true, but it sounds incredibly cool. You used to test your records by just driving around in your sports car in LA really fast, blasting music really loud. No. No, I had one of those beautiful, I won't mention the name, but it's one of the best British cars. It starts with an R. No, two R's. So that became my private listening room, and I had by then the biggest sound system ever, 900 watt. I changed the whole... The whole back was two big speakers and amplifiers. And it was great because I would be in the studio. I would go out in the parking lot and hear through the radio. And I could get a good feel of the mix. But I didn't have a sport car and I didn't drive around. You were driven. No. Okay. Fantastic. But you did actually design a sports car. Is that right? Oh. Wonderful car. No, I didn't design. I invested some money. I helped the guy. It was a 16-cylinder designed by Marcello Gandini, who did the beautiful Countach of Lamborghini. And we sold actually about eight cars. And then in 19... when the car was ready to come out there was this huge economic crisis and nothing of the exotic cars, nothing sold Bugatti didn't sell Jaguar didn't sell, even Porsche had problems And he actually bared your name right? What was the name of the car again? Cisetta Morodo I had to get my name on. So I wanted to talk about more recent times. Obviously, one collaboration that's really, really pushed you back into the spotlight is, of course, your collaboration with Daft Punk. But I wondered... how did that come around? Did they approach you? Yeah, actually Paul Hahn who is the manager called my manager and said that the boys wanted to have lunch with me and so obviously I was interested but my son Alessandro saw them, saw Daft Punk in Coachella in 2007 and it was phenomenal, the pyramid. And he said, if you don't go and if you don't take me with you, you're not my dad anymore. So I went and nice guys, one, I shouldn't even tell, but maybe you've read it anyway. One guy talks and the other doesn't. So Thomas talks very, sometimes difficult to understand. You know, it's all. It's all up there. And Guimond, silent. Then I tried to speak in French and he was opening a little bit. So it was a nice dinner, but kind of interesting dinner. Lunch, sorry. And so they asked me if I wanted to work with them on a song. And I didn't hear for several months. Then I was in Paris at the time. They invited me to the studio. And I said, oh, great. So I go there and we play piano and we compose a song. And they didn't want that. They said, you just tell us the story of your life. And I was talking for like two hours and they recorded and he asked again. It's more or less like what we do. And then I didn't hear anything for like another almost a year. And I went back to the studio in Paris and this guy, La Gata, that's his name, who did most of the recording of the album, was there and I asked, what is the song? What did they do with my voice? He said, I cannot tell you. Yeah, but at least give me some ideas. He said, the only thing I can tell you is that the song is great. So that was good. So then about three months later, they called me back in Los Angeles, went to the studio, and they played it, and I was... first of all, surprised how well they got, at least I think so, how well they got my voice in that song. And it was emotional too, because you hear yourself talking about your life. So I only heard it two times that day, and I never heard it again. But you also, of course, won a Grammy for that, or was part of the team that did? Well, the album, yeah. So you've also, speaking of electronic music, Daft Punk, you've taken to DJing again recently. I just wondered what inspired you to do that after all this time. Well, I was asked quite a lot in the last years if I wanted to. to DJ, but you know, 10 years ago, the DJ, I thought, no, no, I'm a composer, I'm a producer, I'm not a DJ. But then I did, by pure coincidence, a very small 15 minutes DJ for Louis Vuitton at one of the shows. The Amfa, I did one show in Cannes, and then I did my... first wheel show in Brooklyn, the Outposts, and I think it was a big hit. And that's how I started. And then I got a lot of requests. And what do you enjoy about DJing, specifically? First, I love dance music. Second, as a young guy, I always wanted to be a... a performer. I was never able to do it and I was never really pushing hard to become a performer. And now as a DJ, and especially the DJs of today, they are the stars, right? So now I'm a performer. I'm up there. I did a few performances, a few gigs. one in Chicago, one in France, in front of 30,000 people. And it's great. I was performing actually in Chicago. No, no, it was in France. And it was 2 o'clock at night, and the kids were still dancing. And I feel almost like Michael Jackson. I think that's how he felt. I almost feel like I'm a conductor of an orchestra. Because obviously I play my own songs so I know them in and out. So I conduct one, two, three. And then now down. Now let's go. The left sings. Now the right one. And it's a lot of fun. And are there DJs around today that you admire? you think, hey, I could maybe emulate them somewhat? Oh, they are all great. One, Calvin Harris is probably one of my favorite because he not only is a great DJ, but he is a great composer. And then the big guys like Tiesto. And one of my favorite one is Skrillex. "Oh, this guy is a genius." So those are the guys I really like. - And of course, you're not just playing dance music, you also made a lot of it on your new album, Deja Vu. It's the first in 30 years. Can you explain the concept of the new album? - At the very beginning, the concept was since Daft Punk got the disco sound back. I thought, since I know about disco, I should do a whole album about disco. But then I thought, no, let's do some EDM, some disco. And the concept of the singers was to have a certain amount of known singers. like Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears, then get some new people in. And one of the great singers was Sia, who I loved the Titanium song with David Guetta. Then, of course, Charlie XCX came and had that big hit with I'm So Fancy. And so it's a combination of known, very known people with a lot of experience, but young too. Like I have one girl in Marlene from... from Sweden, very young, very totally unknown. I have Matthew Comer, great musician, not too known and almost beginner. Then, Mickey Echo, great voice. He sang with Rihanna that beautiful song called Stay. So I think I have a good combination of relatively young talents and I just wondered, Sia's kind of a person who's been in both a front person and in the background as well. I assume there must have been a certain amount of mutual appreciation for what you do together, seeing as you're someone who's been in the background as well and in the foreground. Just the fact that she sang the song says that she wanted to do it. But interestingly, I never met her. She is very protected, has a lot of people around her. So what I did, which is quite often now in this new world of kind of recording, I gave her the tracks. It has the line, that was the original. And she did the, they call it the top line. And she wrote the melody. She wrote the lyrics. She sang it. She did the backgrounds. And she gave it to me. So that's how a lot of time happens where you don't even meet. the people and it's all done by internet you send files and you send them back and you change anything then are you happy to work in that way compared to how you did in the studio back in the day with the people yeah it the thing which is really tough is to coordinate because all the singers are also busy so sometime you send a mix or you send some some stuff to the singers and it takes you a week or two or a month so It's a little frustrating from time to time. But all in all, that's how it is now. So you have to adapt. And I wondered if you had any plans to maybe tour the show. A couple of years ago you were talking about perhaps an idea for a Vegas show, A Night With Giorgio. Does that play into this? How you could do something with this new album? Well, I doubt that I would get any of the singles which are on the album to come. and perform maybe one show. Well, actually, I went with Kylie Minogue on her tour in Australia, and that was quite interesting. The first time I performed in a big arena with the main act, and the first two shows in Perth and Adelaide didn't go that well. because people were still coming in and they all came just to see her. But then Melbourne, Sydney was great and then at the end, Brisbane was fantastic. How many people was that for? Those must have been huge gigs. Yeah, basically around 8,000, 10,000 people. And one of the other huge collaborations on this album... is the one with Britney Spears. How did that come around? Because that's a cover of Tom's Diner, right, Suzanne? Yeah, Britney asked the record company if they could ask me if I wanted to produce it. And I think, I guess, that was one of the songs she always wanted to do, but never had the chance. And so I loved the original anyway, so it was great to do that one. Interestingly, I had a mix with her where at the end I added a little bit of a vocoder. And so she heard it and she loved it, so I had to redo. I must say it's a different vocoder. It's not, usually a vocoder, you put it on the voice and then you take the voice away and you only hear the vocoder, the sound. This is like the voice and the three harmonies played by, with the keyboards, more like a background singer who sings the notes. And then I added a bridge and I sang it. That's me. So now I can say I did a duet with Britney. You've been such a huge force in pushing music forward, you know, technologically and stylistically. I just wondered if you had any sense of what the big... next shift in music would be? What's going to be the next big moves in the future of music? First of all, I don't know. And second, if I would know, I wouldn't tell you. Good answer. You know, I was just thinking, sound-wise, there is nothing new. They have millions of sounds. Like Skrillex, I think it's one of the, who pushes the edge. I don't know, maybe, maybe I was thinking the combination of video and song, maybe with a hologram. Like instead of just hearing the music, you press and you see. see the singer, maybe that's the future. So we should talk to the inventors and maybe create because that would be interesting, right? You have a song and you have the singer or the group. Nice. Can anyone saw a hologram for Giorgio? Yeah. In fact, I'm writing a musical with my songs and some new... Probably disco. So we were thinking maybe they have a hologram and I guess a few minutes. And so when I'm not working anymore, they can present the hologram. So we're going to have some time for questions very quickly. So if you could think of some, that would be fantastic. But just one final question for me. You've been doing this for 40 years and you're perhaps more celebrated now than you've ever been. So I just wondered what's next for you? What's in the next couple of years? Okay, I'm finishing the music for a video game for Disney, for the movie Tron. I started with the musical. I'm talking to a director of a movie which it's not a tour. million dollar movie but it's a nice budget movie one of the three networks are talking to me about maybe a music TV show like in the style talent search. And I'm preparing for the second, for the next album. No, no, no, no. I'm waiting to see how this is going and how I'm doing. Did you ever imagine that you'd be so busy in your 70s? No, no. And I must say I was happy not doing anything, but I'm even more happy now that I'm busy. Fantastic. So it'd be great opportunity if anyone had any questions, it would be fantastic to get some from the floor. You used to be a guitarist back in the early days. If you could be a guitarist for any band between then and now, which band would it be? Oh, God. Probably the Rolling Stones. They're not too difficult. But very effective. I must say the riff they have in Satisfaction is probably the best ever, except Hold a Lot of Love. and that is absolute. Hi, at the end you talked about you'd received some TV offers, and I just wondered, did it have anything to do with Simon Cowell and the Ultimate DJ series? No, it's not at all that, but I just read about that he's preparing that. No, they gave me some indications, but it's nothing like, I would tell you, but I don't know. Cool, thank you. - I don't know what it is. - Cheers. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm so excited, so sorry. - Oh. - Thank you for everything. So you started now your career as a DJ. You are a composer before, now you're a DJ. So what do you think now, what do you suggest for the DJs that want to become a producer now? - Well, if you're a DJ, you have... already a lot of, I'm not saying experience, but a lot of feel what's going on. Because if you DJ, you see pretty much if you play a song and people don't react. So a DJ has the advantage of knowing what the public wants. Then, of course, to become a producer would be great, maybe to play an instrument. But a DJ has, generally speaking, quite good chances to become a good producer. I suppose since when you started making electronic sounds that would take you a day to even produce one, now with technology it's much, much easier. Well, now it's much easier, but it's more difficult in the sense that you always have to have something new. The soundtrack, which I'm doing for the game for Disney, we have about... I would say at least 15 different plugins with different sounds. I mean, you have to really to learn or have somebody to do because it's getting more and more difficult. For example, a bass or a kick in EDM, a sound is a kick today is old in six months. So then you have to create something new and it's quite difficult actually. Can you tell more about your experience coming from the old Moog modular to modern day plugins and software music? It's like day and night. The old Moog, I never had one because it was too expensive. But to learn how to use it would take days and days and days. And I always did very, not very, but good demos, but I always had musicians. You need the input of a musician, and in this case, I needed the input of somebody. who is going to get me a great sound. Because it would take me days, and I prefer to have somebody who will help me out and come in with creative ideas. I suppose that's the secret to a lot of... your most successful work you collaborated with great people whether it was Donna Summer or great vocalists or great engineers I suppose and I have great musicians for example Keith Forsey who did most of Donna and not only Donna but other acts who became a famous producer. He produced Billy Idol. Then Harold Faltermeyer, who worked on Keyboard with me, became a movie composer, Beverly Hills Cop 1, 2, 3. The engineer, Coppers, became a relatively famous engineer in Los Angeles. So those great guys who helped me out and finally made them. became famous by themselves. Giorgio, I just read Nile Rodgers' autobiography and he talks about Studio 54. It sounds like the centre of the universe in the book. You're reading it and going, wow. Did you go to those nightclubs? Did you get involved? What were they like? Talk us through it. I cannot answer. Come on. No, no, no, no. I went one time. I knew about it. And I just, Love to Love You just came out. And I thought, I have to take a limo and I go there. So I went with the limo and I see this huge line. And I said, oh God, it's going to be so full and so beautiful. And you know. Probably somebody naked on a horse. But I told the driver, go in, ask if I can get in, because I don't want to be in line. So he got me in to my big disappointment. It was empty. It was only 11 o'clock in the evening. I didn't know that the discourse, the real one, starts at 1 o'clock or later. So I was there for like half an hour and I went home. And it was too late for me to wait. But I heard like you. probably heard that a lot of stuff happened there. I was there at the wrong time. Well, your music was there, of course. The music was there, yeah. I guess we've got time for a couple more. You, sir, with the mic. Thank you very much for the talk. It's really interesting and sharing your music, your new music. And you seem like a very generous man. And I wanted to ask a technical question about creating the album. You talked about having to basically send it digitally to your artists and then they would work on it and you'd wait for it to come back. Most artists see themselves also as producers now and also work with producers. Do you now have to be much more generous in terms of releasing material digitally and then it coming back? And the second part of my question was how much of what we were listening to was played live? or was created digitally? I think I had about three or four songs where I had live drums. I did not use live. strings because in Los Angeles they are so expensive and the digital not produced but digital sound of violins are so great but obviously guitar you have to have a real guitarist drum you can use there are a lot of great sounds But I used a lot of Fender Rhodes live. So about three or four songs were live and the rest was all digital. I mean, it was all samples. And the other question. Was the collaborating, you sent it to a singer, the singer is sort of a producer. Do they then change a little bit the arrangement as well? No. No, I know Mickey Echo sang it. I changed the arrangement. I mean, I did it. I finished it. And he didn't like it that much, so I changed it again. But in general, the singer... my experience is that they liked the way it was and I noticed a lot of singers, first of all they are all so busy right now. If I compare like with Donna and some artists at that time, Sparks. They were busy, but right now they are traveling. And so it's really difficult to get them in a studio at the same time, in the same country, in the same city. And it's a new way to record. And I kind of sense that they love to work in a studio where they feel like being in a family. So a lot of... Most of the singers have obviously their engineer with know exactly how what mic to use what's equalization a lot of those singers have vocal producer who know how to get the best out of a singer well, you know if I would if I would go in and suddenly and tell the singer, no, do it this way, do it that way. I think people are used to do them by themselves, and a lot of singers now have studios at home, so they do it whenever they feel like doing it, and I think it works quite well. Absolutely. I think we've got time for one final question. Hi, Giorgio. I'm really interested in what your views are on the music industry today, particularly how there's a whole generation of kids who think music is free, who watch on YouTube and it's all free. And artists really can only really earn money these days from live performance rather than recorded music. Really interested in your views on the scene today. Let's take Spotify. If they would pay a little more, like right now I think they pay a minimal stuff, that would be great. Because with Spotify and now with Tidal and the new Apple system, you can promote an album quite well, which obviously before you didn't have. The revenues obviously are much, much less. I compute my royalties. They went down with Donna about 5% a year and soon I may have to pay because it's a negative, right? But on the other hand, people are making their performing life. The DJs are making money. It's a little bit balanced, but everybody now has much, much bigger chances. to be successful somehow. I remember when I started, a recording would cost at least $3,000, $4,000 a song. I was lucky that I had a record company who was paying, but I didn't have that money to produce or sing and compose a song. Now, with one computer, a microphone and a little keyboard, you do absolutely perfect recordings if you are talented. And then with a little ingenuity, a little research, you can have a hit through the social media. So it's interesting for the younger people because, like, I was talking to Moby. The big hit he did, what, the album was seven, eight years ago? Yeah, play, I think. Yeah, he did it all in his bedroom, actually, not even in his living room. room. 20 years ago, you could never do that. You needed a studio. And I remember I still had a studio about 10 years ago, the big SSL and all that kind of junk. I still had the big 24-track Sony Digital. Sorry, Sony. Anybody here from Sony? Anyway. This is all gone. So now you need a laptop and that's it. Does that amaze you? Obviously coming from a place where you had to use simpsons as big as a room, now it's all in a box. Is that kind of amazing, really? Oh, I love it. I love it. I have two synthesizers left in my studio. One is the Roland JP-8 and one is a modified Moog, Mini Moog. And I don't even connect them anymore. I have all the sounds I need in the box. Fantastic. I think that's about it. Giorgio, thank you so much for sharing your life with us today. It's been amazing. Thank you. Thanks again. Nearly has me dying, dying underneath From here to eternity, that's where she takes me From here to eternity, that's where she takes me From here to eternity, that's where she leaves me Baby, baby makes me feel good It's where she makes me love me once again. Baby, loving her is easy. Love me once again. From here to eternity, she takes me here to eternity. She does, she does, she does, here to eternity. It's where she leads me to eternity. Bye. you
