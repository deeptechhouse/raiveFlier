you Hello there, and welcome to the exciting world of hip. This is a new departure in language instruction for English-speaking people who want to talk to and be understood by jazz musicians, hipsters, beatniks, juvenile delinquents, and the criminal fringe. Sit back, relax, we'll close you. Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Stephen Titmuss, and I'm a freelance writer at Resident Advisor. Dimitri from Paris is a man whose name is intrinsically linked to Suave Disco sounds. whether it's his respectful re-edits of classic tracks by Chic or his hugely successful Playboy Mansion compilation CDs. But Dimitri can also lay claim to be one of the first Wayne of French DJs to play house music in his native land. We talked to Dimitri about his long history in electronic music, partying at Hugh Hefner's mansion, and how working with big brands does not always mean compromising. You don't see them when they're... Your first steps into DJing were making cassette tapes in the 80s, is that right? Yeah, it is right. I wasn't thinking of becoming a DJ when I was 16, 17, but I remember seeing this rap show. I think it was... It was maybe '82, '83, and you know, Sugarhill Gang, Rapper's Delight was big everywhere, and some people started to dig deeper into where it was from, and they had this show with artists like Afrika Bambaataa, DST, Fab Five Freddy, like the more underground side of rap. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ And there was a concert of it, so I said, oh, I really want to see that. And I had really no idea what to expect other than guys rapping on the mic. But it was much more than this. as it was the whole hip-hop experience with the DJs, the dancers, the graffiti artists. And the DJs were doing this weird thing with records. They were scratching records. And it was like, oh, what the hell is this? I didn't know you could do that with a turntable. And it was like, wow, like a life-changing moment. Oh, maybe I can do that with my parents' turntable. So I went home and started like... you know, scratching vaguely the record. Obviously it was awful, but it was like, maybe I can, you know, I can dig deeper on this and see what happens with it. So I remember I had my own turntable, borrowed the turntable from my parents from the living room, like hooked them up together, like in a weird way, like building some kind of mix of myself. And really it all stemmed from there. Just trying to imitate like that crazy interaction that I didn't think was possible with music and the whole idea of interacting sort of rearranging the music really was the first ever first step in my career and whatever the future held for me because I realized that you couldn't only passively listen to music but you could do something you could input something of your own ideas into it and it was just music you could buy over the counter anywhere so it was accessible And that was before the samplers, that was before recording into a computer. I mean, the only thing he had was a turntable, a record, a pair of speakers, and then would come the mixer and the second turntable. So there was no internet, there was no information. And at the time, DJing, also in England at the time, in France and Europe in general, DJing was not done the way it's done today. Records were not mixed, beat-matched into one another. People would mix them like in a radio way, a lot of times talking in the transitions and stuff. So it was all new to me and it was something that I thought was musically interesting. So I started going to that, making the tapes. And from those tapes and little edits I was making, I figured what if I send them to radio stations, see if I can get a job out of it. and one radio responded and another one and another one and eventually I got myself a show and from the show made myself known and from the notoriety came more work and etc etc so what was the first edit that you ever made? I found this cassette lately there was There was Wham in there. What Wham track? The very first one, I think it was Wham Rap. Yes. Which was actually not so bad. It aged pretty well. And there was also D-Train. D-Train was pretty much the first dance record I was hooked to. And from then, the whole Prelude label and Francois Kevorkian, who was an A&R, Francois K. who was A&R then at Prelude and was doing all of the dance mixes and his dance remixes had something that the others didn't have and he really became my number one source of inspiration. Do you think that was anything to do with the French name? jump out of you? It did of course, it did because I was here in Paris like sort of isolated because I didn't have any friends who would dig that they'd be like what are you doing let's play football you know and I was this early nerd into the music and didn't have a lot of people to share it with and once I saw that this French sounding name I had you know it sounded French but it could have been anything this French sounding name on my favorite label out in New York. I said, oh, I want to be like him. And that was really my first sort of like goal in life. I want to be a remixer. I didn't even know that he was a DJ, that there was the Paradise Garage, that there were all this other whole culture out there. I had no idea. I liked the sound of it and I wanted to be sort of part of it. So that was like the first sort of like, okay. let's try and do this moment in my life. And I was doing more and more edits and obviously he was remixing from masses and stuff. So I couldn't approach the sound that this and other guys was doing. But, you know, I was... learning from the way things were done and eventually it landed myself, my edit landed myself a job in a proper studio and there I had my chance to sort of replicate the work that I was taught by listening to other people's creations. So why were you making the edits? Was it just for yourself or was it for... I think the first influx was to interact with the music. As I said before, it was something that I would listen to passively, but I really loved it. I was really interested and I realized that I was listening to music in a very active way. When I see all those people with their headphones and their iPods walking on the street, it is something that is totally impossible for me. I think I cannot even walk listening to music because if I listen to music, my whole body actually... is totally, you know, just haggled by what's happening. I have to listen to everything and I listen to some details that, you know, maybe the normal guy wouldn't even bother with and so it's a very active way when I listen to music I try to listen to everything at once and see all this little hi-hat there and this little bell there and this and that and sometimes I miss the whole point of the song but that's you know that's the nerd I was and the nerd I am and I you know a lot of people ask me what you listen to and I'm like I never play music unless I can sit down and listen to it which is difficult because I don't drive and the only time I actually listen to music is when I'm in the car with my wife because she drives and I can listen to the music. So, really, it gave me the opportunity to put one foot more into the music-making thing by just re-editing, re-arranging. I started by using all the versions that I loved from one track. Maybe you had a 12-inch with an instrumental and a vocal, and I would put those together. and say, oh, what if I start with the end that I like more than the beginning as they did it? And gradually, I learned to rearrange, restructure. My first edits were just like 17 long minute things like... totally impossible to play as a DJ and then when with the experience of playing out I noticed what was working with the dancers what wasn't and gradually you know my edits became more concise and and more to the point but I think that the first really the first part was to to really be part of the whole music making thing For sure. So was it on reel-to-reel that you were doing these? At the beginning it was on cassette tape because that's all I had and that's all I could afford. I didn't even know there were reel-to-reels. I didn't know you could edit on reel-to-reel. And then someone taught me, you know, those things that are done on reel-to-reel. So how did they do that? Well, they cut the tape and put a little, you know, sellotape thing on it to stitch it and to splice it together. I'm like, oh, how did they do that? He showed me and I had a go at experiencing it at the bigger radio station where they had the equipment. And eventually I bought myself a secondhand reel-to-reel machine. And then it's like my life changed from the moment I dumped my old turntable from a proper Technics turntable. So moving from the cassette to the reel-to-reel was like the same sort of like huge jump. Like suddenly everything sounded like really pro and tight. So was there any other... you know, friends or French DJs doing this at the time in the early 80s? So there was this guy called RLP. He was the very first DJ mixing on radio here, probably back in 93. And he used to live in Canada and his brother in New York. And he had all these tapes from Tony Humphries. He used to mix in Montreal, which was the disco capital of North America, much more than New York. And so he had that culture of mixing the records together, which I also had listening to tapes from other people. But I didn't know how to edit on Reel to Reel, and he taught me how to edit. And we worked a few things together. And he also taught me the basics of remixing from a multitrack. And from then on, I mean, you know, I knew those two bits of information and I made like really a big career out of it because at the time it was only me and him doing it in France and we got most of the remix work that was to be done. So it wasn't the most interesting artist because it was a lot of French pop. you know, French chanson, which is not exactly the music I was digging at the time. But it was interesting because you'd be working in a proper studio with sound engineers and equipment that was totally unaffordable back then. I mean, having a home studio wasn't even something you could dream because it was just like so much expensive equipment. And also like you needed a big home. And I mean, it was just like... and dreamable. So from like the mid-80s to the mid-90s, you couldn't think of doing anything like that at home, which is what pretty much everyone does now. So I'm quite interested as well, you know, these early edits and, you know, this work with labels. Actually, they're to a radio show, isn't it? And he was the first guy in France to play house music. Is that right? On a radio show, I... think so. Laurent Garnier was the other French guy and there was a third one, a bit of an unsung hero named Eric Rugg who's still active mostly in Paris and Laurent we didn't really know well because he was actually living in Manchester so we found out about Laurent when he came back, started to mix in France a lot but We were like the first guy, and also RLP, this French DJ who taught me the basics of editing and remixing. We were the first, like me and RLP were the first that had radio shows on quite big outlets. I mean, he was working for the national radio, Radio 7, that doesn't exist anymore. Like, it was similar to Radio 1, pretty much. And he got me in his show. I was doing an edit every week, so that gave me a little name for myself. And in turn, I got hired in a competitive radio. So we were actually competing every Saturday with our mix shows. The interesting side was those radios had networks and you were able to hear them all over the country, which is something that's a little bit unusual for something that's a niche sort of programming slot. So a lot of people could actually hear our shows. and it gave also more exposure to house music. And eventually, when the first, like, pop house record or house record crossed over to pop, I'm thinking of S-Express and Bomb the Bass, the French radios were ready to embrace this, and they got it really quick. Hold it now. Before, like, trends were really slow to spread from, say, London, which was always the trendsetter in terms of music, to the rest of Europe. So, in the case of House, I think France was, like, really... right next after the UK to follow up on the house thing and it might have been thanks to those shows that we had because the program directors were exposed to the music and if it wasn't for us it wouldn't happen. So how did the program directors react to you playing House? Were they for it, against it? It was very funny because my show, I used to get calls from the head of the station saying, what are you doing? What is this music? Play something else. You don't play things people know. It's horrible. And we had this jingle, the only radio that's here because the boss doesn't listen to it. The only show that's here because the boss doesn't... doesn't listen to it. we used to sign off like you know we'll meet you next week well maybe and we were always fearing that he'd cut us off the air and eventually one day I got a call like put me together like some of the records you play we're gonna play them on air during the day I said what yeah yeah yeah we wanna play house now so suddenly because of the whole like S-Express phenomenon you know they decided they wanted to be like the house radio in France so Yeah, it was a short-lived trend for them, but it was interesting. It was interesting to see things change and... And also you have to look at it, it didn't come as a revolution. For me as a DJ back then, house music was just like a natural progression from disco to boogie, which was disco done with electronic machines. and Boogie spawned electro-funk, which was the early Africa Bambaataa record like Planet Rock, which was a mix of Boogie and funk and rap. And house was just the evolution of that. It was faster than boogie, but pretty much as fast as electro-funk. And instead of being rapped, it was sung as disco was sung. So it was an electronic version of disco. Like Mel Sharon from West End said once, it's disco on a budget. It was exactly how it sounded. It sounded like cheap disco made out of electronic machines. But because it was electronic, it was much more pumping. It had like a... a sound that was getting harder and it was more minimal because of also the budget constraints but it didn't it didn't arrive like there was this sound and then suddenly there was house and it was like all this big change it was just like all these new records out of Chicago New York they're interesting let's play some of them and and then you know the whole thing started with with the British again journalists like in the face and all those 20 magazines like ID and NME, like this new big thing like from the US, it's called house music, this and that, and all those journalists go into... to Chicago interviewing all those ghetto kids making music, you know. And I think the interesting side of house was that you could sort of do it with not a lot of money and you didn't need to be a musician. You were only needing to be a DJ. So it appealed to me as a DJ, oh, now I'm sort of like allowed. to be part of the music making crowd whereas before the DJ was really looked down upon like all you do is play someone else's record even if you rearrange, re-edit, remix we were always looked at as you know like a lower sub kind of music people so with the whole house thing it gave us this kind of pride and this kind of like legitimate recognition from other people. Oh, not only we can make records, but those records are getting played on the radio and they actually do make money. So it was like, oh, wow, you know, people started to give us a different look. And that was probably the biggest revolution, not just house as the music it sounded like, but house as allowing non-music people. to make music and be recognized for it. It's interesting you say for you there was no, it was just a logical progression house, just logical progression disco. But, you know, even a lot of DJs say at the time, you know, especially in England, there was getting a lot of resistance in our house, you know. Did you find any of that resistance or did people just accept it, you know? I know in England, like, a lot of people rejected it because it was, like, all electronic and sounded As I said earlier, the cheapness was what made its charm. But there was already a very strong base of music-loving people and a strong base of DJs playing soul or funk or disco with a huge following. So house music arrived. in this bed that was already taken by a lot of people. Whereas here, there was nothing. So basically, we had only French pop and this new dance music was taking over French pop and it was like, oh, great, you know? Let's get rid of all those old geezers and have something a little bit more exciting. So... There wasn't a lot of rejection. I think most people took this as a passing fad. And in some way it was. Only that, you know, it came in and out from the airwaves, but it did stay in the clubs. And the clubs were not a very big part of the music industry and still aren't. Music was never really an important thing at clubs. It was just tools for DJs to do the trade. And, um... House music actually insinuated itself much more into pop music through, again, England and maybe America to a lesser extent. So for France, there was no fight because people were never very strong about the music taste. Nobody would fight over music in France, unfortunately. We never had a thing like the mods and rockers here. It would never happen, even today. People don't care. It's music. It's like whatever. They can fight for crepes, but not for music. So there was no particular resistance outside of some major labels not wanting to. sign this and that which is you know the traditional fear of risking anything but I guess for French people and me as a French DJ at the time it was a natural progression it gave me more tools it was an additional tool to the arsenal of music that I had and I still see it as such whereas for a lot of DJs they had to sort of like either say bye to their old style and embrace completely the new house style And he was going from one format to the other. Whereas for me, it was just like adding a new style. For sure. And in this period, you were just known as Dimitri. Is that right? So until the mid-90s, I was going by my first name, which is Dimitri. And I didn't think of any particular nickname. It was just called DJ Dimitri. And then there was this band D-Lite that had another DJ, Dimitri, and I was starting to hear about another old school DJ from Amsterdam who was playing at a legendary club called The Roxy, who was also named Dimitri. So there were three of us. And people started attributing things that I've done or that they've done to the wrong Dimitri. And eventually I thought that I should try to differentiate myself from the two other Dimitris. So that's when I added the From Paris tag. That was sort of mid-90s. Was there any one particular point when you thought, hey, this has got to stop? I've been well there was there was this story was I was having a radio show too like for 12 years and uh towards the the the mid 90s I was interviewing like DJs DJs were starting to visit from other countries which was a new thing and I was a big fan of uh uh Death Mix Frankie Knuckles David Morales and and also Masters of Work Louis Vega And I remember having David Morales on the show, interviewing him and just giving him one of the latest records I had remixed. And one of them was a record by Bjork, who wasn't very big at the time. She was just soloing from the Shugie. Cubes, her old band, and they gave me her first single to remix which was Human Behavior and I gave him my remix and never heard back from him. Bye. And so like three months later, I get a call from a record label guy from New York, like, I got your number from this guy and that guy. Could you get me that remix of York you're playing? I'm like, how do you know about it? I mean, you have to remember there was no information, no internet. So all you had was like a phone number of someone in America you could call and ask him for news. And this guy calls me and I'm like, how do you know this? Well Frankie Knuckles is the hottest record in New York. They play like three times every night. I'm like, my record? Three times in New York? I was like, oh my God, that's it, I made it. So I was really excited. So I learned that this was like a cult record in New York and you couldn't share records either. You know, if you didn't have it, you couldn't play it. There was no file sharing. A few days after that, I have Louis Vega in the show and proud of this new information, I give him, you know, a copy of the record saying like, apparently this record is hot in New York and he takes the record like a trophy. Oh my God, I've been looking for this everywhere. How come you He said, well, because I made it. And he's like, no, you didn't. Well, you know, he wasn't believing me. I said, look, look at the credits. It says Dimitri in Paris, France, blah, blah, blah. And he goes, oh, shit. You know, I was talking to Dimitri from D-Lite and I'm telling him, you know, can you get me a record? And he said, yeah, yeah, I'll get you my short-lived fame and that's what made me decide okay something has to be done on the name yeah I suppose it was easier to do back then as well with well yeah I mean you know it was like whatever you heard was from someone else's mouth and you had to to just take it and do something with it. So yeah, the whole Dimitri from Paris came out of the Björk episode. So maybe moving away from your first steps, I want to talk about disco, which is obviously a sound that you're really closely associated with. What was it about that sound that first drew you to it? Well, it's interesting because I used to really hate disco because the disco we would hear on the radio here in France and even in the clubs was mostly Euro disco at the very commercial end of it. I mean, things like Bonnie M or ABBA, which wasn't exactly the sound that I was into. It was just pretty simple and more like pop with a 4-4 kick in there. and it wasn't doing much for me and after house music got a little bit more documented after all those journalists went to Chicago and brought interviews from all the DJs, I realized that they were taking inspiration, the Chicago DJs, from disco, but a disco that I didn't know. So I started digging into those records and there were records from Philadelphia, from South Seoul, from a bunch of labels out in New York and I was like, oh, I really like this. It sounds like house, but in a disco way. which was the case because those guys actually replicated those discos with their cheap synthesizers and drum machines. So that's what really got me into the black side of disco, which was something very unknown here, as opposed to England. England always had the Philly sound on the radio. I mean, things like The Love I Lost are just huge pop hits. And here, no one ever heard about it. Again, there was a huge cultural difference in the way disco was heard and seen and adopted here. A lot of people just hated it because it was not very interesting music, as opposed to people in England who loved it. for what it was, just great black music and evolution of soul. And so I got into disco thanks to house music and that's probably the biggest thing with, you know, making me proud of being a DJ that I can say thanks to house music for, it's like making me discover disco. It's strange that, because in England, you know, there's quite a lot of French acts that we know, you know, like maybe like Voyage or Saron. Were they not really known in France so much? Voyage was, Saron was, but they were in the bag of like cheesy disco. I mean, if you look at, if you hear at Voyage songs, there's only one that I really like. which is like an album track. It's not one of the singles. And Saron is a different thing. I think Saron, if you look back at it, a lot of the music was really good and was well arranged and produced and written. It's not something that was outside of the huge Supernature hit. It wasn't a guy that was... so big in France at the time. He got his recognition later. So I guess Ceron was like the early French Dutchman that was recognized outside of his own country and then his success boomerang back to France. But at the time I remember that Ceron was not someone that you'd hear about much if you were just a kid listening to radio. Another thing that really interested me was your relationship with Dave Lee, which a lot of people know as Joey Negro. He said basically you had to come to an arrangement over eBay. He said it was your own entente cordiale. It was a funny thing because in the early days of eBay, you could see who was beating against you. And I was seeing the same person. either overbidding me or me overbidding him. He was either number one before me or number two just behind me. And I was like, who the hell is this guy? And, you know, I was asking around, oh, this is Joey Negro. I'm like, oh, okay, I know Joey Negro. And I don't know how we got in touch probably we were booked to play together and say no how about you know We figure something out instead of paying more Over trying to overbid each other and it was like it started as a serious thing that ended up being a joke But I remember you know Emailing him. Okay. Are you gonna go for this one or? You went for the other one leave that one to me, you know that kind of thing and eventually, you know We left a few records to one another but I remember some like he wouldn't let go and I wouldn't let go either so there were some ugly fights. Was there one that you thought this just has to stop? No, we never went that bad about it. And eventually eBay got bigger and a lot of records started to pop out. But I remember for a while I stopped going on eBay because it was just too much of a nightmare trying to get everyone, "Okay, are you going to do this or that?" I'm like, "Okay, forget it. I'm going to go in a record store." So where do you look for records now then? I don't dig as much as I used to. Mainly because there aren't so many record stores around, that's the one thing. The other thing is there's so much stuff I got that I didn't even get to listen from the day I bought. So, you know, I should concentrate on what I already have and sort out what's really good rather than buying more and more. So occasionally if I stumble upon a record store, you know, I go and check it out. But I don't have that urge of like, you know, going to going record shopping, you know, like a as I used to, like finishing my gig at 5 and waking up at 6 to go to a record fair, stupid stuff like that. I guess I got older and also my collection got a bit bigger, so that's the one thing. The other thing is that there's no such thing as something that's not available, unfortunately. I mean, you know, if you like music, you don't have to buy expensive records. They're all like ripped by some guy. On some blog, if you search hard enough, you'll find them. So you don't have the excitement of holding to something you can play that no one else can play. So it takes a lot of the drive also away from just digging deeper because I'm not the fetishist of the actual object. Having a record that I can have as a good audio file. doesn't excite me as something that has never been ripped by anyone and has never really been played that yes I will go and get and play but you know playing something that's readily available and just buying it for silly money to have a piece of plastic is not something that excites me much Do you think that's a good thing? You know, that more blogs are doing this kind of thing, or a bad thing? It's got its good sides and bad sides. I believe in democracy. I think culture should be available to the most people possible. So, in that respect, it's good. The other side is it makes it much more... Actually, not much more, but much less exciting. for people to find something because they don't feel like they're finding something that's their own find. It's something that's been there and, you know, it's already been overplayed maybe. So it's difficult to come up with something old that hasn't been overplayed. So the bad thing is that. And again, the good thing is it leaves it down to people who make the selection. Okay, everything is available to everyone, but you have to make a selection. You cannot play everything. you're becoming the one person that can make a better selection than the other or that can select and program those records. in a way that's going to make them more exciting than someone else. So we're becoming more and more like chefs and cooks in the sense that everyone has the same ingredients available, bar a couple of extremely regional, hard to find things that are very minor and a detail in the actual way the food's going to taste. So with having the same ingredients at hand, you have to come up with something that's going to make it sound more interesting than the other guy so it's all down to your own sensitivity and and and way of selecting things and that's actually a good thing because it allows you to be recognized for your creative input into the music as opposed to just buying an expensive record that no one else has is not going to make you a better DJ anymore maybe talking about modern disco are there any particular producers that you know you're really drawn to now There are, I mean, you know, it's interesting that a lot of the people who are into minimal house move to sounds that are, you know, more maximal, like disco, and it spawned a whole Balearic, Cosmic, New Disco, whatever you may call it, scene, which I'm happy with because it's more musical. I mean, I've always been... fanatic of richly arranged music and never been drawn to acid house or things that were too minimal like minimal house or whatever i like things to be rich lush and and full of arrangements and those guys are doing that and I think that the person that impressed me the most out of this whole scene is Ten Snake. I'm like his biggest fan. I haven't been a fan of someone for years and it was kind of depressing not finding anyone that I could look up to and be impressed. And he's the guy that makes me feel younger. again because i'm kind of in awe of his productions and you know we have an age difference and i'm happy to be following a young guy than just admiring dead people you know so it's great to have someone that you think is the future of a style that i really like and for me ten snake is definitely it and there are a bunch of other people i like the italians i like yellow whom i'm working with uh he goes by different names dj rocca super lovers and who else do I like from the new disco guys I like another Italian button from from Venice I'm a big fan of aeroplane who's from Belgium but happens to be Italian - I guess Italians really do it better and I've always loved the Italian disco sound. Not Italo disco from the 80s but actually the disco sound that we're producing. The most known act by everyone is Change with Luther Vandross that was actually an Italian disco production. So they're very flamboyant. it's something that I've always loved in music so if I if I go back to disco my favorite producer is Vince Montana and he's also from Italian descent and he's got that flamboyance and the glamour that that came from Europe and mixed with the raw black of the Philly ghetto guys and together it forms what I like the best like a hard rhythm section with very glamorous arrangements on top and I think no one got that better than then the Philly Sound and today like the the inheritors of that are the new disco guys and I think one of the most prolific and most talented one is Ten Snake absolutely. It's interesting you met Vince Montana there you know you worked with him on the way you love me wasn't it? Yes. What was that like to work with him you said he was your favorite disco producer? I've always been a fan of Vince Montana he was one of the arrangers working on a lot of the Philadelphia disco records and also he created the Salsa Orchestra out of musicians from MFSB which was the other backing band from Philadelphia and he had this way of arranging things doing disco with a very glamorous feel to it and I always loved this because it had this strong backing band with you know great drummers bass players percussion players and then all those like lush strings and horn arrangements that were more like sort of classical music on top on top of Disco it could get cheesy at times but it was always like very well balanced between the groove and the cheesy part and and I've always dreamed of working with him and you know, it never happened and when I was asked to remix that song "The Way You Love Me" by Ron Hall, that song to me had the essence of a Philly Disco record but it was just a two-bar loop over which Ron Hall was singing and I was really trying to make a new arrangement for it and I asked the effect that can we get the budget to record live strings and they said alright was it gonna take and this and that and after much negotiations I mean all my feet went into like the producing because I really wanted this to happen I said well can we try and get Vince Montana and they got really excited and we we managed to track him down and he was very proud to be asked to do things again and he was urging 80 at the time so I got to meet him. He was a very interesting character. And he did it. I mean, it sounds exactly like a Vince Montana string arrangement. And I was really happy that he kept things the way they used to be. Because a lot of times when you approach people that used to do something like 20 years ago, they want to be more into the trend and to start doing things that are totally different from what they were. doing and they don't want to look back they want to be like now and sometimes it's actually disappointing but he wasn't he was doing it exactly the way he was doing it 20 30 years before and it's one of the remixes i'm the most proud actually and i remember i gave it to tom moulton who is the father of the 12-inch and a very famous remixer from the 70s, actually one of the creators of the remix. And he said, well, this sounds like the first Philly record I heard in 20 years. So for me, it was like the seal of approval of Tom Moulton was like, okay, if he says it sounds like Philly, I'm done, I did it. I'm loving you, baby. Tom Morton was the guy that did actually do the first 12 inch. Yeah, he was the guy that did actually decided to cut from a 7 inch 45 single into a wider platter and 12-inch record and he invented pretty much the 12-inch. It was a mistake but he didn't invent the 12-inch like you invent the wheel and he was one of the very first guys to extend songs and make actually remix versions for DJs. Before him, it was just like short 30, you know, three minute versions that you get as a DJ. So every DJ listening to this owes him a serious debt of gratitude. We owe like a serious awful lot to Tom Moulton. Absolutely. Sure. So, you know, that was a remix, but I'm quite interested in your edits. You know, some of the more recent work you've done, you know, you've just re-edited Sheik's back catalog. Is that right for Atlantic? How did that come about? Well, I mean, I got called to remix a few songs from Schick, probably thanks to the work I had done on the Philly disco record. I did this compilation called Get Down with the Philly Sound in 2010, where I remixed five songs from the Philadelphia International catalog. and I did those from the original master tapes and I approach remixes very respectfully in the sense that I love a disco record so if I remix it I'm not gonna turn into a house record I'm gonna keep it disco but probably rearrange it in a way that first of all I can play as a DJ and also I would probably pick and choose a record that didn't benefit from a remix at the time so If something has been remixed in the 70s as a disco record, I'm usually happy with it. I don't want to change it. But if it stayed as an album track, maybe like a short version, I'm very frustrated that I couldn't hear a longer version of it. And I'm going to aim at that. and because the way I did those remixes was very respectful, I didn't add any new production, it was just the original sound as it was recorded in the 70s, just rearranged, restructured. I got a call from the Sheik camp who wanted their songs to be... you know, sort of like updated but not totally or radically changed into modern sounding electronic pieces. So luckily they called me and I did the same kind of work. I used what was recorded, didn't change anything from the sonic aspect of things. It sounds ideally like a Schick record would sound, it's just a different structure. and a different arrangement that is maybe a little bit more club or DJ friendly. Did you get any feedback from any of the artists? Well, Niall Rogers is the founder and sole member of the band now. And yeah, he was very, very happy because he was afraid that we'd slaughter. his production. A lot of the current remixers take something and actually slam their own sound on it, which fair enough, you know, you can do that at times, but sometimes if you want to keep the essence of the original, if that's the main goal, you know, just destroy whatever the original was to make a new piece. So there's not much left in that case of the original song and I go the other way. It's hard to find where I am if you don't know the record inside out, but it sounds different if you play them side to side. So that's the way I approach remixing. If there's something good that I like in the original, there's no way I'm going to just take that out. Maybe talking about your most recent work, you've just done some more work with Playboy, a new compilation. How did that originally come about? Well, the original Playboy compilation came up with a meeting that was in 1999, I think. At the time, I was a regular at the Winter Music Conference in Miami, and we had this party with Respectus Burning, a group of French promoters. And it turned out the club we had the party at, it was Groovejet, called us and said, do you have any problems with Playboy being part of the party because they're sponsoring the week with us? And we're like, no, sure. I mean, you know, we love Playboy. Can we get t-shirts? You know, that was like the only condition. Can we get t-shirts with the rabbit head? Because we love the logo. And we ended up meeting with the Playboy people and they were like, oh, you guys do parties? We're actually thinking of doing more parties at the Playboy Mansion. We're like, oh, what is the Playboy Mansion? Is it the actual house of Hugh Geffner? Yeah, yeah, and this and that. And it was like, we didn't really know much about the whole thing, but it sounded like exciting. And they were like, you know, let us know if you have any album project coming up you do it at the Playboy Mansion, you know, for us it'll be good promotion and for you also. So we were like, well, there's nothing coming up, but what if we make something specific for it? So, oh yeah, good idea. Let's do it. So that's how it came up. It was like really easy going and it was probably one of the most successful. releases in my career when it was just a compilation but it really helped the kind of sound I was playing spread out worldwide and it gave me like a quite a large notoriety because it had the Playboy name and something that a lot of people were familiar with and it helped them you know accept the music and someone that didn't know i.e. myself. And that sort of spawned a series. And the only other guy who did something on those series was Bob Sinclair about a few, three, four years ago, I think. And it was with Defected, whom I work closely with. And I thought it also did one with Defected. And I thought it'd be fun to do one together. And the idea sprung to mind because we were in, we were doing this interview, me and Bob for a lifestyle magazine. And they were asking us, you know, How did we evolve from the first time we met? Because a lot of people didn't know that actually Bob Sinclair had a label called Yellow and he signed my first Sacre Bleu album. So we actually go way back. Obviously, we have a different career. He's very much the commercial DJ playing in huge clubs and stadiums, and I'm more into my disco sounds. And I was like, it's funny, we're quite different, but at the same time we've got this similar love for music, why don't we do something together? And I was thinking of this old TV show called The Persuaders, 70s show, where you had Roger Moore and Tony Curtis, and Roger Moore was the lord out of Oxford, and Tony Curtis the rogue out of Brooklyn, and they were solving crime cases together, always fighting, and he reminded me of us too. So I figured, you know, why don't we do that? You know, play against, play our differences and do something together. So it was a fun thing to do. And I think it came out quite nice. Funnily enough, Bob Sinclair's side is more disco and mine is more house, which is something that, you know, slightly taking the piss. You know, people would expect me to be disco and him to be house. And it's fun. to do it the other way around. And I'm more like what happens after disco and he's what happens before house. So in that way, it's quite interesting. So maybe going back to the first Playboy part you did at the mansion, what was that like? Well, it was something we didn't know what to expect. So, you know, all we knew was that it was Hugh Geffner's house. Again, the Pleymouth Mansion was not something that was hugely known in France. So we were not expecting much. And it was interesting because it was like going back in time. I mean, this thing is an old English manor transplanted in Beverly Hills, California. So that's already strange. And then it looks like an Austin Powers shack house. It's got all those like crazy gadgets from the 70s that have been totally well preserved. And really like you're stepping back into a James Bond or Austin Powers movie. And everything looks like old. And then you have all of Hugh Geffner's friends coming in. And it's people like Farrah Fawcett or people from the cast of these old TV shows. You forgot their names, but you know their faces. Like people from Happy Days or other shows. And you're like, God, it's like I'm in the 70s totally now. And then you got the crazy girls with the bunny ears all together. So it was a weird mix. I mean, we had people like Daft Punk or Kylie Minogue who were coming from our side and the old actors from Hugh Geffner's side, some old porn actors, some playmates from the 70s, you know, a crazy mixture. And it was pretty funny. It was nothing overly sexual as a lot of people would like to think so. But it was great. It was like a great experience. Serge Gaffer himself was a really nice guy. Just nice, friendly, quiet, very well-behaved gentleman, which I was quite impressed with because I thought he'd be this brash, you know, sort of loud tycoon. Not at all. And it was great memories. I mean, it was super elegant, super classy, and I was very, very happy to have been there. Were you thinking of all this when you were putting together the first Playboy compilation? You mentioned the 70s, which obviously fits well with disco and elegance and these kind of things. These themes, were you trying to transplant that? Well, when I thought of the Playboy mansion, that's what I thought of. I remember at the time there was this movie called Boogie Nights, which was a movie about the sexual liberation in the 70s, about the early porn industry and things like that. And the soundtrack obviously was disco. And it reminded me of that period and of that movie. And when I got into the Playboy Mansion, it was exactly that. So I was happy that the music I chose to soundtrack my idea of what the Playboy Mansion was at the time actually matched quite well when I got there. It was like, yeah, it all made sense. Yeah, so you mentioned, just mentioned the persuaders and you mentioned there was a theme there. Do you always put... you know, this much. attention to detail into your themes for your compilations and albums? Yeah, I'm very much a detail person. Fortunately for some, unfortunately for others, because sometimes I can easily get lost into the details and miss the main point. But yeah, I love details. That's why I'm also a big fan of Japan, because they understand the value of details. But yeah, every time I do something for me, it has to make sense. It has to make sense for me as a person. I have to be able to back it up 100%. It's not some random concept that somebody throw into the table. and that they have to stick to. It's something that makes sense to me from my whole artistic universe, whether it's graphic or music or even art or architecture, the things that I like, style. For me, it's important that I'm able to concentrate a lot of the things that are me and that I like and share those with the people. I mean, this is... one of the things that made me become a DJ. I like that particular style of music and I'm collecting it, I'm buying all those records but I would like to share them with other people. So by doing radio shows and DJing I'm able to get this music across to other people and maybe have them like it in turn and become whatever they want to become. But I think it's important to share your knowledge and your idea of nice things. Is that tough? the digital age, where things are becoming more throwaways, you know, even music doesn't always include artwork and things like that. Yeah, I mean, anything that has some kind of an artistic input and that is artistically driven is stuff, because art and money don't really go well together. So unless you subsidize art, it would just die. And what makes art expensive is not necessarily the art, but it's just the hype. And the hype is created by money. So it is difficult and always been difficult to try to push something for what it is. which is like good music or good art or good graphics or whatever, without having a concept that people can more easily understand. So you always have to use something to carry the other thing. Like for instance, using Playboy to carry across the music worked and it taught me that having something that's a little bit more mainstream can help you carry across something that's a little less mainstream. So, in what I've been doing in my life, I've been trying to use some part of the system, which is basically making money and selling products, and trying to get something that's interesting, even though it's a product, trying to make this product interesting. And for that, you have to pay attention to a lot of details, the commercial end of things, the marketing end of things. and the artistic kind of things. And being underground and making great music that you and your mates can enjoy is great, but it's not going to change much. It's just going to stay where it is. and the dangers of today's culture where everything is spread out on the internet is that you might think there's a great scene from your music but this scene is actually three people in japan five in england two in paris another two in new york uh one in jakarta like another one they could be anywhere together there's maybe a scene of 3 000 people they're scattered around the globe And they cannot sustain the economy of the music you do because, first of all, even if they wanted to buy, they don't always have access to buy your music. A lot of them cannot even afford it. They don't pay for it. They can enjoy it, which is great. It's great also for you that people enjoy your music, but you cannot live from it. So if you don't live from your music, you have to live from something else. If you live from something else, it takes you time to do your music, off your music. And it's like a vicious circle. It used to be within the finer arts like theater, classical music, which are all subsidized now. Otherwise, they would have died a long time ago. And now with music that is not straight up commercial and top 40, what is going to happen with it is a big question mark. Because even if you do music that spread out 3,000 people across the globe, even 10,000 people across the globe, if you want to perform somewhere and get people to buy tickets, I mean, what are the chances how many people from your scene are going to be in this given town? They're not going to fly away. over from Japan, Jakarta, and wherever, they're going to be in the town you play in. Maybe there's only 10, 15 of them, which means that you're only going to interest 15 people. In a town you want to perform and that's not enough to get a venue, that's not enough to fly you over. So basically you stay home. And that again is a stop to creativity. So I wouldn't be surprised that some form of subsidizing touches the deeper side of music in general, whether it's dance music or any kinds of music, because it's just getting lost. in the no profit and no profit means in the end no creation do you think there'll ever be that slightly caused compromises you know where things become subsidized well that's the other thing i mean you know when the money doesn't come when you're not free to do what you want there's always some form of compromise and it's down to the people who pay you and the people who take the money to do his art to figure out the proper arrangement, there is music that is... that is uncompromised and there is art subsidized that is compromised and also uncompromised. I mean, there's a lot of theater plays that are, you know, showed around the world that are not exactly compromised and they're subsidized. So I think there's a balance to be found and maybe in 50 years time from now. you know, we'll start to see, you know, subsidized dance music and see what comes out of it. I mean, the main idea is to preserve creation. But if creation doesn't have any, if you don't have money to actually feed the artist, just put food in his mouth, not in his bank account, you know, how is the artist going to survive? So you have to find ways. You have to find, like I say, I'm trying to... use the system for what it is, making it commercial enough and interesting enough so that, you know, people can find, both people can happy that people actually invest money on you are going to get the money back. So they're happy. And the people who are going to... invest their own money to enjoy your CD or remix or whatever it is, are going to like what you're doing because you cannot fool any of them. You cannot fool the guy who's giving you money because it's the last time he's going to give it to you. And you cannot fool your crowd because what they like from you is what you have to give to them. If you don't, then they'll stop following you. So you lose on both ways. And you cannot favor the one unfavoring the other because eventually you're going to dry out. of resources to feed your crowd. So it's always this delicate balance. It sort of always was like that, but it's getting more tense as times goes on because, you know, the way the music is distributed, the way the market is, is changing and lightening fast. And it's changing more quickly than we can find solutions and adapt to it. And everyone agrees to say it's a big mess. And right now, it's the people with the most money that survive. And because they want to keep on surviving, they take less and less risk. risks every day and the less risk that takes the more interesting music is dying because you know it's too risky so you know right now everyone is doing music out of their home distributing it out of their own computer It's good that they can do it, but at the same time, there doesn't seem to be a very bright future because out of all those people doing interesting music, how many actually are going to be able to cross over? And the moment they cross over, how big is the compromise they're going to have to do to stay on the other side? And would that kill their art as it started? Or would it not? It's the big question again. It's very interesting that you mention all that because throughout your career, you've kind of, you know, worked with brands quite often. You know, you even worked with Disney on the Aristocats thing. And yeah, also fashion houses and things like that. You know, how have you found the balance as you've gone along? Well, every time I'm approached with a bigger entity that wants to buy something off me. or that wants to sponsor what I'm doing, it's extremely important we agree on the terms of the artistic control. Because, I mean, selling my soul to someone who gives me a pile of money is not very profitable. I mean, maybe in the short term, yeah, I'm going to get money in the bank account, but in the long run, it's going to take me away from... the people who enjoy what I'm doing. So it's not viable for me to sell my soul to a big company and do whatever the big company was. If a big company needs me, it's because I'm doing, I guess, something right for them. So they have to accept what I'm doing. So we always have these kind of talks before partnering. And so far, I've managed to keep the creating hand. And I think it's extremely important. And like I said, you have to be understanding of what they want. But if they're not understanding of what you are, then there's no point partnering because... you know, he's just going to kill each other. So every time I worked with Playboy or with Disney, it was very clear from the start that, you know, they could say no to certain things, like say Playboy doesn't want anything to be like offending to women and things like that. Fair enough. I can live with that. You know, same with Disney. They've got certain rules that you cannot bypass. which I think are very workable. Now, if they come back to me telling me it has to sound like Lady Gaga, I say, well, just go to Lady Gaga. Don't ask me, you know? So you have to teach people exactly what you are in a friendly way because you don't want to put them off and, you know, try to convince them that what you do is good for them and that they're happy to. to invest time and money in your creation, it's workable. It's workable to a certain extent. I mean, obviously, the bigger the money is, the more guarantees people would want. And that's where you get into that circle of having to compromise your art to get the people the guarantees they want. But I haven't been to a circle that high, this much high, to start compromising on the actual music that I'm doing. So, aside from your Playboy project, is there anything else on the horizon for you at the moment? There is a three-track EP coming out on German label GOMA, which is actually one of my favorite labels. I think they've been doing really interesting things. And it's my first collaboration ever with an Italian producer, DJ Rocca. We briefly mentioned him on the new disco trend. And we have this act called Aerodiscotique. and basically it builds on the influences we both had as DJs starting our careers around the same time in the mid 80s so it's kind of 80s 90s flavored dance music some of it is a little housey but not really we would say proto house or pre house and there's even like a track in the style of a lost trend that was the freestyle trend or latin hip-hop people might remember things by shannon or man tronics and i was a big fan of this so and we have a an italian singer from the real uh italo 80s era called fred ventura on vocals so I'm really excited about it because first of all I don't get to do a lot of my own productions as at least in the dance field and secondly it's my first collaboration and it's on the label I'm really happy to be on so. Why do you think you don't do that many dance productions? It's more kind of you know you've done a lot of lounge stuff and Sacre Bleu. True. I always thought I wasn't very good at doing dance productions. I don't know. Usually I'm not happy with the way they sound. I'm not happy to play them. I'm quite content playing other people's productions. Currently, Tent Snake fills all my prescriptions in terms of... of what I want to play. But I think it's great that I find inspiring producers like him or Aeroplane because they want me to get out of my cave and start producing stuff again because I'm like, oh, actually, there's room for that. I always think that no one's interested. So the Arrow discotheque thing is probably not the most dancefloor friendly in terms of trend record I've ever made but it's nice stuff to listen to and I don't like being stuck with the dancefloor format in mind so usually when I produce something I'm not thinking, okay, well, I have to get rid of this because it's too long. I have to get rid of that because it's too complicated. I'm just doing it. And that's why I don't do it too much because I would feel that maybe it's totally pointless. So it might be pointless dance floor-wise, but I'm sure you can enjoy it if you listen to it. I'm thinking deep inside my soul. I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
