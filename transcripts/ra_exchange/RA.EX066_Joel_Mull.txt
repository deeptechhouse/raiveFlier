Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Joel Mule is one of a number of Swedish producers that helped make a name for the Stockholm scene in the mid-90s. Through his distinctive productions and pounding DJ sets, Mule was instrumental in making the Swedish capital one of the most important outposts of four-to-the-floor music outside of the usual suspects like Detroit, Chicago, London, and Berlin. As I found out last month in Berlin, Mule's belief in the power of electronic music to transport hasn't been dulled a bit since his early days in the scene. In fact, it might even be stronger in 2011 than ever before. ♪♪♪ I was interested to read in one of your biographies that you, before electronic music, you were in some bands. You were doing some sorts of rock music. For me, music has always been... something that has been something I need to do to express myself for in the beginning I mean I didn't know why I was doing it but I just started very early to you know play the piano and recording sounds on my tape recorder and making mixtapes and you know always processing something with sounds and playing around with it and i didn't start start playing a band until i was uh maybe eight nine ninth grade in in normal school you call grade school i think and uh we were kids uh just trying to do something it wasn't any You know, we didn't have any goals or anything. We're just trying to copy the stuff that we like to listen to, like The Doors or Jimi Hendrix or... It could be all kind of things, but basically... Were you mostly doing covers? Yeah, covers, exactly. Like everyone starts with trying... trying to play the guitar, play that a little bit for a while, and then I was on the drums, and I was singing, and I was playing the piano, I was trying all kinds of stuff. That kind of changed when I started in high school and discovered the whole electronic scene on a trip to England with a friend of mine during the summer. I mean, we went there to kind of try and get into the hacienda and trying to go to places where they were playing like indie rock, acid house kind of... Just see what it was to... You just heard that they were cool places to go. Yeah, exactly. With music that you sort of knew, but you were just like, that's a place. Yeah. We didn't get in. We found ourselves ending up in a club somewhere with... It had strobe lights and it was all black. and the DJ was just mixing everything up with Happy Mondays or... in the style of rock and then all of a sudden it was a techno track and everyone went crazy and I was like what is this? I was very blown away by the hysteric techno sounds So you came back? Sweden and then you were trying to figure out where to get this stuff exactly I came back that summer and I was like just trying to find records that sounded the same like that guy was playing in that club and eventually found found out parties and flyers at the record shops where you know you could it was always a party going on somewhere There was a flyer, an info line, telephone number. There was no address or anything, so you had to call that number and see, okay, take that bus and you're going to end up at the party. So it was always a big adventure every time. Were there other people around the same age? You said you went with a friend. Yeah. Were there a couple of other people that you were hanging out with? This guy, Eric, was my friend. We played in the same band. jamming together we were very close friends and he was more into rock than i was i was more blown away by the electronic stuff so we we started to go to parties together and then he dropped off and i i totally stuck in there. I was like, I need to discover how can you make these sounds? How do you, you know, what equipment do you use? What kind of... synthesizers and i was totally wanted to discover the technology side and try to learn how it's made um i assume right around the time that um eric dropped off yeah met adam exactly and we we started that high school together and i met adam he wasn't in high school yet he was still in grade school but he had friends that went to high school and we met at the party friends place I think mutual friend and yeah the interest in that this whole adventure that became going to raves connected us, me and Adam. He was already DJing and had records and everything. I hadn't really collected that many records yet, but... He was already more knowledgeable than you, even though he was still in grade school. Exactly. He must have been like, who is this kid? Yeah, I mean, he had such a record collection already and he had amazing skills. He built his own DJ booth at home by himself. I think he made that one when he went to eighth grade or ninth grade. Well, the kids were in shop class making these things. Exactly. He was making very practical. And he made himself a DJ booth. It was perfectly for his height as well. He was very tall already. And we were the same height. And I remember he was always playing very loud in his speakers at home. You said in another interview that you were very lucky that his mom was more than... happy to let you guys play that loud. Exactly. I know they had problems with the neighbors for sure because at some point he had to turn down the volume but we were always hurrying back from school trying to... play as loud as possible till maybe six seven o'clock when people came home for work but Yeah, she was very open-minded and led us to what we wanted in that room of his. You said earlier that one of the things about electronic music, aside from even just trying to find the records, was trying to find out. how they were made, what music instruments. And I also read that you once figured out what one of those instruments was and sort of took it home and had a jam session with Adam where he was doing the beats and you were sort of... doing the synths, the melodies. Exactly, yeah, yeah. That story, that's a fun one. We decided to make our own party. We found a place, a club in the city, and we were only, what, 17? Not even 18. through this party and we're thinking okay Adam of course is going to DJ but we have to come up with a sort of live show or something that makes it a little bit more special so I borrowed an old Roland synthesizer it's a crappy one actually it's an E20 it's called so it doesn't let you like edit any sounds or whatever it's all presets wow i found some really cool stabby cordy sounds and Adam found these Beats records where he would mix the records in Beats, just like a hip-hop DJ does. And I was playing on top the chords and the melodies and stuff. And we made a little performance of that. That was our first tryout to even... mix something and record something on tape and I don't know maybe it was a 10-15 minute session or something but then after a while we okay we discovered the sampler and the sampler and the the UNO 106 the Roland synthesizer which was one of the first synthesizers that Adam bought, I bought the EPS and Sonic sampler, which allowed you to sample one minute in stereo or something. And you did everything. that machine arranged the track and everything was this stuff easily available in stockholm well i remember we had a couple of synthesizer stores actually quite a few music stores around the area where we were going to school i think we had four music shops And nowadays, I don't think it's even one around. Well, what we would do, I remember on lunch breaks, I went down to one of these synthesizer stores and just was sitting in front of one of these synthesizers in headphones, just trying sounds. blown away by what stuff you could do on these monster instruments. And obviously, I mean, money was really short. So we had to save up money to get our equipment. It took us a long time until we had the... You had to have the cables, you had to have a mixer, you had to have a sequencer like a computer, etc., effect processors. Everything costs so much money. The best way was that everyone would... collect equipment and then we ended up at Adam's place connecting everything in his room you mentioned that you bought a different type of sampler yeah Adam and I was thinking to myself I wonder that's you purposely bought a different one so that you could now have you know yeah at your disposal it was borrowing and sharing exactly it was something like that Exactly. One of the most famous venues, I think, and it may be jumping ahead chronologically, is the Docklands. Yeah, Docklands. Yeah, that's the one everyone remembers as the biggest club in Stockholm. What was it like? It was almost like a... The promoters, they were really trying to create something different than a regular Stockholm. going out discotheque so they were putting down effort in you know the the backdrops and the lights and Everything was very organized and proper set up. So when you entered it was like every weekend there was a new theme going on. This was an old shipyard. I think it was an old shipyard of some sort. factory type venue and ceiling was maybe 30 meters up or something so it was a massive hole and the DJ booth was in one of these cranes that you could send up to the like up to the ceiling and I remember the acoustics was very big hall and it was a massive feeling to enter that venue because it was such a big space. I think you get that same, not that I would know, the Docklands. I always think one of the most powerful things about Berghain is when you come up the stairs. Exactly the same kind of feeling. Okay. Yeah. Here we are. Exactly. It has this monumental... kind of feeling yeah it's it's i think uh it it's either that some of the best clubs in the world for me have either that where you sort of come up and you're sort of you know greeted by this amazing thing or you go down yeah into the darkness exactly type of thing yeah Yeah, you're right. With Docklands, I had so much police trouble, it seems like, at a certain point. And I'm wondering if that was something that... you felt like was just to that place or was that on the rave scene in general in Sweden at a certain moment? Yeah, well, Sweden is a very conservative country and when this... special division of the police formed a group called the Rave Commission. It's actually people following other, you know, people that was going to rave parties. They also did, they actually came down to Berlin to film people. on the train station going home from Berlin to document what kind of characters and people would go to certain parties. It went to a very extreme place. That's crazy. Yes. And what, in my sense, in my opinion... it felt almost like a cultural police in a way. Because with this party scene, with the drugs coming in and the blinking noise, the lights and the noise. crazy sounds and everything it scares a lot of people I think when you're not you know you don't know what it is and I think that is what happened with the government in Sweden at that point it went to such a it was such a big media thing and techno and rave became a very dirty word. and it was awful for many years it killed the scene it actually scared off people to go to parties I'm not saying that everyone is taking drugs but it definitely happens but I don't think At that moment, it felt really us against them, kind of. This is sort of the mid and late 90s. This is like 90... Could it be 96, 97, 98? Around then. And the scene kind of died off for a couple of years. I think England experienced some same kind of... thing with this uh did the cross just to spill criminal justice bill yeah that came a little bit later in in sweden that kind of you know i have to have a permission to dance You have to seek dance permission every time you throw a party. If you have a bar, you're not allowed to dance in the bar. You have to have the permission, if you play music, to have a dance permission after 12 o'clock. So it got more and more regulated. So in the beginning of the 90s, when just... Throwing illegal parties in a venue, that doesn't really work anymore. It stopped. That whole freedom feeling, the kind of adventure, slowly disappeared. You started DJing before this, obviously. Yeah. You started out maybe not that... known to some people in ambient rooms. Yeah. Yeah, but you know, for me, when I discovered electronic music in this... At that moment, in the beginning of the 90s, there was such a big experimental scene where you would have the combination with rock and electronic sounds and... And I was very... just in that time I was just trying to experiment and trying to find my way how to make music. And I was very absorbed by the sounds that came from England at the time and ambient music. And obviously I wasn't that good in beat mixing and matching at that point. It was a little bit easier to DJ. It was a little bit easier to mix the ambient stuff. And experiment. So I got the chance to take care of the ambient rooms. Setting up a small arsenal of all kinds of stuff like effect boxes and CD players, vinyl players and mixer. And sometimes I would have a synthesizer. And you just go and... create atmospheres and chill out. When did you get good at beat mixing? I think it was, I think around, could it be 93, where I played my first dance floor. And before that it was... Ambient rooms or private parties. So 93, it took off. And you were making music at the same time. Yeah, exactly. Adam said that when I interviewed him last year that... In terms of DJing style, sort of heroes, Jeff Mills, just seeing the way that he was able to do it so quickly and so adeptly had a huge impact on him. He one of the guys for you also or were there other people that you really looked up to and saw them DJ and said okay here's someone that's I really want to figure out how to do that. Yeah for me it was a very for me that guy is Sven Sven Veth. because I'm half German, and during the years 94, 95, 96, I think, yeah, period into 97, I... At one point I felt school was just not for me. And I had met some friends and they asked me if I wanted to come to Germany and play in their club. So I said yes, that would be amazing. And I did and I came back and I... thought okay why don't i move to germany i you know i speak german i just leave sweden for a while and see what i could do so i moved down to a place called Husum, which is the north part of Germany, a couple of hours outside Hamburg. I began to play in a club up in Kiel, which is really far. No, Flensburg it was. That's almost by the Danish border. And I got the opportunity. I got my first residency there in 94. And what I did, I took my record players, my records, and moved down to Germany. and just set up and started living off this residency. And it was a club in Hamburg. These two guys who came to the club that I played at. And they were looking for a new resident DJ at their club. And the club was called Unit Club in Hamburg, which was one of the first bigger techno clubs in Hamburg. And I was 20 or 21 at the time. Because Hamburg had quite a big house scene. Exactly. Big, big house scene. But the techno scene was actually not that big. But this club was a venue for 1,200 people. So it was a big venue. Started to play there and at one night Sven came in and played. And it was not the first time I had seen him play, but I remember he played for 12 hours or something. There was no one. I've heard about that, played that long before. No one else's. All the DJs I've heard before had played two hours, three hours maximum. But the whole way he presented the night and the way he was interacting with people. he made a big influence on me the way he hypnotized people. He's also this, he has his performance. He is charisma. He has his shamanic, theatrical way of persuading people into going crazy. And I like that. this performance aspect in the music. So for me, the way he... But you're not hugely... Performance-based DJ, I would say. No, I'm not, maybe. But it is inspiring. The way he played, he was mixing very... I mean, he's not a Jeff Mills. He doesn't play three records. But the way he was presenting the whole night with different... layers and taking you to different points. For me, Jeff is more hip-hop style or would you say a little bit more from the fast cut and I don't think he would be able to play 12. hours. So for me that was more the long kind of hypnosis that was the thing that blew me away. But Jeff was also inspiring in the way he was presenting the technique. And then Richie came and added the effects and the 909. And Jeff did the 909 as well. And everyone started to add more stuff. And it became a little bit too much of a, I don't know. How long did you spend in Germany overall then? Three, four years? No, I was actually, I stayed there for a year. Then I moved back home and during this year I hardly did any music. I was only focusing on the DJ aspect and learning a lot. It's like a sponge. I was the way... I would warm up the place for the DJ, the main act, the way to end nights. the way to play longer sets, 10-hour sets. That was the school for me. It was the best school a DJ could have. So when I came home to Stockholm, I was back in the studio thinking again and started to... work more and more in the studio. We built the studio together, a friend of mine and me. And then I was more focusing on actually producing music again. But the German time, that year was very, very helpful. But I... I continued to work as a resident DJ there for another two years. So I was a resident DJ there for three years. And then they closed the club and then they built a new club. And then I moved along to the new club, but it didn't really take off. and then it stopped. My Berlin residency was, no, Hamburg residency stopped around '97. So I would say like the years between 94 and 97 was three years. You said you went back and started to finally focus a little bit on production. And a lot of people say that Sweden had a sound around this time. Did you get that sense that there was something that was very distinctive to what you guys were all doing, that it had a certain difference? I was aware of it. I think we were all inspiring each other. What we would do, we work in the studio all week. On Fridays, for example, we would have a sit-down, everyone together in the studio of Adam or Carrie's studio. or somewhere else and just listen to the tracks together. Like, oh, this is the stuff that I made. Had sessions, you know? And I think everyone inspired each other very much. And I think why we got that particular Swedish... pumping sound was because everything went through and channeled through Cary's studio. He was doing all the mastering and he was doing all the compressing and EQing, equalizing and everything. So he mastered most of the tracks back then. And I think that has to do a lot of things, a lot of why we sounded the way we did. You said pumping. Pumping, yeah. That was the defining word? I think that's the defining word. I mean, the compressed... the compressed techno pumping. It was very compact and always very loud, big kick. That was the important thing. Was there a certain moment at which, or a certain record of yours that you feel like... I seem to always ask this of people, but I think it's a good question. Was there a certain record of yours that you feel like, okay, now I have my own voice. Like this is, I'm finally gotten to a place where I'm, this is Jomuel. Yeah. It took. took so long time but i think around 97 with after a couple of years really focused on on on only being in the studio every day. And also at the time we were working in a record shop, Planet Rhythm. I mean, I was presented with so much music every day. And after... after we finished work in the record shop, we went downstairs and Cary had his studio downstairs beneath the record shop. So it was constantly listening to the new records that came in and listening to the productions that we were doing. Slowly I found my kind of soul. I think with the production I did for a sub-label for Svek that was called Lesk. I think I... At that point I... I think I found the way I wanted to. present my sound and 97 was a very productive year and I think that that was the year that I sort of came through and the record started to sell. Was this also around the time that you started getting more international? Yeah, yeah. Obviously the German residency helped, I'm sure. Yes, that helped a lot. But I think through the production around that year was the time when I was starting to get bookings abroad. But it was, it's hard to say for me when I start with a track in the studio, I never have like the end result as like, I can't see where it's going to end. I always start somewhere. It's always a blank paper. And in the end, it just comes out. Some people have a very bright vision and they see exactly what they're going to do. But it's always a constant process with me. I can't really pinpoint where I'm going to end. So at some points it can be very hard to even start working on tracks or get tracks finished. Because you start on something and then you get bored. I have difficulties to actually say, okay, that's enough. wrap it up and just finish the track. You also said last year in an interview that you're still insecure about your music. Yeah, very much. Which I find, you've been at this for how many years? It never ends. It never ends, I think. It's a very... weird feeling you would think that you have you know you're mastered you know you have the the complete knowledge but for me it's still a learning experience a new patch and you and and also it's important to to me that it's interesting and the process the process exactly so I'm always constantly trying different technologies and it should be fun in the studio it shouldn't be like okay I have to do this it shouldn't be like I have to finish a track because I need to, you know, it should be a fun process. That's, I want to have the same feeling that I had when I was a kid with a tape recorder recording some sounds and mixing it together. What do your parents make of your music? My mom was the one that discovered that I had some sort of musical ear. She mentioned when I was four years old or something like that, there was a Donna Summer track played on the radio or something. I was completely blown away by the sounds and dancing in front of the speaker. I don't remember this, but she noticed that I was reacting to music. So she said, okay. She was thinking, Joel should go to music school or he should sing. And she noticed also that I had a voice. So I went to a boys' choir for many, many years. And the whole music school made me secure with the performance part, like being on stage and performing with other people. It was very strict. You had your voice in the choir and it was not so experimental. I was supposed to continue to go to another music school but I felt like... it was too organized, like too much of you have to do this, you have to learn the theory and you have to follow the theory. And for me, it was more fun to try and break that theory and come up with a new one. I always had support from my mom and from my father because they were all blown away by the experimental music that I was listening to. They were like, okay, so you're listening to this? No one else is listening to this, you know? She went and saw you in Germany once, right? Yeah, yeah, you're right. There was a party in Hamburg. But not at UNIT. No, not at UNIT. The guys from UNIT Club, they had come together with one of the local church. in Hamburg. I don't remember the name of the... I think it was like St. Katharine Kirche or something like that. Anyways, they'd come up with a project. that they wanted to make a club in the church together with the priest. And the whole concept was called the crusade. And very fun. And there was a performance by one of the guys from Tangerine Dreams. Cosmic Baby was doing a... some sort of performance with the ballet. And Sven Veth was DJing, and I was closing the night. And the DJ booth was up on the organ altar. And then they made a dance floor over the seatings and hang the whole sound system. I think it was, they had bars. You weren't allowed to smoke. You had to walk outside. But the church was completely full. It was completely sold out. I think it was like 1,200, 1,300 people or even more. And that was the first time my mom came to see me play. And she was dancing all night. You were playing the final set? I was playing the final set. And in the end, I played an outro string ambient song. And the priest was up at the altar singing in the end. Singing a hymn. Oh, come on. Yeah. It was all very orchestrated and directed from the beginning to the end. With the whole ambient intro with Tangent Dreams playing on these cymbals, using the whole acoustics in the church. It was a very, very... It seems like a very open-minded church. Very amazing. And very open-minded. Very typical for Hamburg. Hamburg, in a way, has that little bit more of open-minded thinking. This was in the mid-90s. This was 1996. Yeah, 1996. And the point of the whole thing was to go on a tour around cross Germany. But for many reasons that didn't happen. Because all other cities... It was planned to do a show in Berlin, in Frankfurt, in Munich. But it started and ended in Hamburg. Have you ever done anything like that since? No. I'm very, very happy to have had that experience to be part of something like that. Do you wish that you had more experiences or that club culture was a little bit more adaptable, I suppose, to those types of things? Well, for me, dance music... and the way of expression, the way I express myself with music, it doesn't necessarily have to have anything to do with politics or religion or whatever. For me, the important thing is to try and create moments where you can feel that you... actually hypnotize everyone in the room and you have that exact moment where everyone is on the same level. And when I can achieve a moment like that and make people close their eyes and forget what actually goes on outside these walls, that's the whole reason and the whole triggering thing that still drives me. That experience can happen in a small club for 200 people or 50 people. It doesn't have to be a huge venue. But when those moments appear, it's just like you just want to stay in that moment. And it's, I guess, it has something magical and holy that you can't describe. One of the things that... I got the sense in doing some research, reading some interviews by you and talking with you now is that you're very connected to club land. The idea of clubbing is something that's very, you love it. Yeah. And not that other DJs don't, but the way that you talk about it is just very, you believe in the power. Yeah. There is a power in this. I think everyone needs the Morpheus, the things that happens during the night when people let themselves go and disconnect and use their imagination. That has something really magic. It's the same with people like vampires and zombies and action movies. I like to be in club land where I can see this metamorphosis happening. People changing characters and, you know, theatrical. What is the name? It's theatrical. theatrical yeah exactly and my father used to work in in theater he was a makeup artist and and also he made wigs and wigs for for the performers So I grew up being backstage in theaters all around Sweden, meeting people with different characters. people becoming different exactly which i think is kind of powerful like watching that process yes fascinating it's very fascinating because they come in they're normal and then my father would put put up the makeup and you would see people getting in their role starting to act with himself with the mirror and you know getting into character and all of a sudden, you know, he was on stage. And I was watching the... I remember standing backstage watching everything. For me, Clubland is very similar because you meet those characters out there. on the dance floor and some DJs has that appearance as well. I always hate, not hate, but I'm always kind of surprised whenever I see someone that I associate with the club in the real world. Like getting, I was at a restaurant once. I saw the door person at a club and I was just like, oh, I don't want to see you in any other context. Yeah, exactly. Just want to see you in the club. This is where you belong. Yeah, right. Yeah, it was fun. How, you know, we talked a lot about history and some conceptual stuff here. Yeah. From 2000 or so. to now, how have things changed for you? Has your sound changed quite a bit in your mind? Definitely, my sound has changed a lot. I would say I'm more secure with my music now the last year that I've ever been, because I feel... Well, the biggest difference is the power and how fast the music is played nowadays. the BPM has gone down. I think around 2003 I was still playing 135-137 BPM. And then the whole wave of new sounds well, the BPM went down at some point because it went more shuffley and with shuffle you don't really have to... play that fast it still has a lot of intensity and so the BPM went down a little bit and everyone was doing shuffle minimal shuffle tracks and it wasn't really it wasn't anymore focused on the raw power the energy thing anymore as much as it was before so all of us sort of changed a little bit I talked to Steve Rachman earlier this week, and he said that he doesn't play above 127 now, and he's just shocked. It is shocking. It is. But I sometimes play 130. 131, 132. It depends on the club. That's also what he said. Certain places, of course. Exactly, exactly. But usually, yeah, 128. Between 128 to 130, yeah, that's where I am. And then I actually like that because it allows you to blend over on different... feelings it's not only house and it's not only techno it's not only certain styles it's all come together a little bit more so it allows you to experiment again I guess in a way Not in the same sense of what I would say like experiment with ambient or electronica or sound experiment but also crossing over from different styles and I like that. Tonight, and this will go up much much later, but tonight you're playing at Berghain, Drum Code, 15 year tour. It's pretty amazing. It's been 15 years, especially that label. And when I interviewed Adam last year, he made the really interesting point that what he's done, and he didn't say it in an arrogant way, but what he's done has been really tough to kind of push. a sound that hasn't been that trendy necessarily. It's always kind of been able to evolve a little bit with the times to keep it, to use an overused word, relevant. What do you make of drum code right now and over the years, I suppose? I think drum code has always been like a little brother to me, you know, because I saw the birth of drum code back in the days and I've seen the way Adam has put so much... energy in making it not as everyone else. He wanted to, you know, that it was his way. And the sound that came out on drum code was always the way he would present his DJing. So it's amazing that after 15 years, still doing the same thing that we love and that we live for, and being able to present the way, the sounds that he likes, and to be able to... I'm not saying educate the people, but present something that is not very average or maybe not for everyone, but it definitely has a little bit of a... It is one of the most popular nights, though, at this club. Yeah, but I think that's because it shines through that we have the whole energy and passion that we have, everyone, playing together. Those nights... sort of evolved. We had, there was another place that we were playing in south of Germany, a place called Universal Dog in Laar, which is... middle of nowhere a little town and people travel from Switzerland from France and Germany and and there's people from three different countries coming there for that night we had that night every November for seven years. And that night was just magic because it was all of us, friends from Stockholm and then maybe some other friends, DJs and producers coming. And to celebrate the night together as a team or a band or whatever, it just creates this energy on stage and that shines through a little bit, I think. And people notice that, especially the drum code nights. Because everyone is always out by themselves touring and playing alone. So I think that's maybe one of the reasons why the Drum Code Nights has that successfulness. And also the sound being a little bit more, you know, has a little bit more power. Now it's also the fifth year we're doing it in Berghain and every year we've been pushing the time limit. You mentioned to me in an email you said that you're going to promise to try to break. Was it midnight? Yes, last night we ended midnight. And so there's definitely a little thing that we have to go beyond midnight this time. 12.01. Exactly. I think actually we stopped 12.02 or 3 or something. And we're saying, okay, Adam and me, we have a promise. It's like unspoken promise, but we have to leave the club together. And we have done that for every year. And what we do is we have a dinner together after that. And that's sort of a little routine we have. I think you probably deserve the cheapest German street food after all that hard work. It's such a tasty thing. The döner in Berlin is one of a kind. It's definitely amazing. We don't have döners like that in Stockholm. you
