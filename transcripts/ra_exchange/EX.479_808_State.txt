you ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hello and welcome. Welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. 808 State come from an era when having a go was encouraged. Hits of the late 80s and early 90s like In Your Face, Cubic, Flowcomber and the chill-out classic Pacific State reflect a period in British culture where working-class kids could make alien instrumentals and have them go right to the top of the charts. The duo of Graham Massey and Andrew Barker are back with Transmission Suite, their first album in 17 years. Here they talk to Gabriel Zattin about rejecting cheap nostalgia. instead paying tribute to their hometown of Manchester by helping to keep its progressive edge sharp. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with 808 State is up next. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ So welcome to another of the Resident Advisor Exchange, this time with, as you just heard, 808 State. I appreciate you guys have come down from Manchester today and have probably spent an afternoon answering fairly serious questions about your new work. So I'm going to start with a curveball to maybe break the ice. The oceans are burning and humanity is being evacuated and there's only space to save either the Apex remix of Flocoma. or the bicep remix in your face? Which one do you go for to repopulate? The Apex mix of like, I think. Can I have one on one side of a 12 and one on the other? I did think you were going to say that, but no, I'm afraid there's not enough room in the spaceship. Oh, no. I quite like the bicep remix, but I do like the Apex twin remix. I can't decide. I'll just do an edit. I'll do a mash-up and take it with me on a memory stick. Very astute answer. When did the Apex Twin remix come out? Was it about 2002 or something like that? A while ago. Yeah, I mean, it still really stands up today, considering it's that old, 17 years old. Yeah, that would fit into my DJ set more than the Bicep one. Though I really appreciate the way that Bicep put it into their world in their way. I always saw In Your Face as being this huge, dramatic thing, and they kind of turned it into a different kind of vibe. So I guess I was puzzled by that when I first got it back. Yeah, I agree. it to come back as a massive banger and I was completely shocked by it. It was just like, what's going on here? But then when you listen to Bicep, you go, I get it. Yeah, in context it perfectly works. So yeah, that's the thing with remixes all the time is like, I remember we used to get all these, when we were on Tommy Boy Records in the States. They always used to get our stuff remixed for the club scene in New York. And then we got taken there by our A&R guy. and saw what that scene was, which was basically the gay scene in New York. And, you know, of course our stuff wouldn't work there unless it got remixed specifically for that thing. And, you know, so we've got a whole set of those remixes from the Tommy Boy era that is very genre specific. Until going there, we didn't understand. Yeah, we didn't have a clue about that. It was like confusion. every time a new remix would be handed to us. It's like, what are they doing here? Yeah. Until we actually got over there and you go, ah, it makes sense now. It's the funny relationship remix. It's, you know, you kind of have to give over to it. You know, you have to. shut your normal perceptions down so often you can be wrong you know the reason i asked about that first because you've both already touched on things that will get into the relationship that you have with your own music over time and also i guess that period where you're on Tommy Boy and you're kind of like firing on all cylinders with peak of your popularity. But the reason I mentioned Bicep and Apex at the start was that that Bicep remix probably brought you back into the periphery of a lot of people my age and younger a few years ago who might know you to reference point, but might not be aware of exactly what your sound was. And they, I don't think... overplayed their hand. I thought the remix was very well done. It kind of merged parts of what you were doing with what they do and has become a staple and has millions of streams. And I think that to me seemed to be when it wasn't just people paying tribute to you, but bringing you back into the fold and alone as someone else who has done the same thing. And I think you took out on tour with you last year. So I want to know before we talk about the new record. When you started noticing people of a generation below interacting with your work in the last few years and whether that spurred the new era of the project, did you realise there was a flame brewing that other people were kind of reigniting and it was time to come back and take hold of that situation yourselves? Well, I think, I mean, we've both got sons who are both DJs and both of them say, you know, their age group was listening to lots of our old stuff. So, you know, there's quite a lot of young people who switched on to what's happened in the past. People seem to know the music nowadays, so it's all accessible because of the internet. But that... probably spurred us on a little bit to say, you know. Yeah, there's definitely a dialogue with our second generation, you know, when you live in the house with the boom, boom, boom going up in the attic all the time. You know, I was trying to see if Shazam worked down the chimney the other day, actually. It doesn't. But, you know, that dialogue that goes on in the house about, you know, they'll be playing certain things. It's like, oh, I remember this one kind of thing. And then you can, you know, perhaps suggest some other. things and they're constantly we share a spotify actually so that's another way we just we share a space and share music that way and then and and that bicep remix definitely came through his playlist kind of thing it came came to me that uh that way of hearing hearing what they were doing and this was maybe five years ago or something probably longer than that Yeah, so that dialogue is somewhat, in the context of the new album, an energising factor in putting you back in a space where you know somewhat what's going on. on the street level in Manchester particularly. This is what struck me, I guess, in the press release for the new record, which people listening now, I think it will have just been out. It's called Transmission Suite, in case you haven't clocked onto it. But yeah, you said, you know, it's inspired by the current state of the Manchester music scene and you make... References to Swinting, which was an interesting one to me, as well as Eyes Down. Eyes Down, a club that would bring people like Pepe Braddock and Moody Man, which seems more in your wheelhouse, but Swinting are very much at the... new cutting edge of the kind of mixed up British and African and Jamaican Caribbean diaspora they're playing music constantly seemingly like it's a Spotify playlist but tying the strands together and I can hear that in the record but I never would have thought that your dialogue with Springting existed in the first place. So maybe you could break that down a little bit. Well, only in the fact that it is a club that I've visited from time to time over quite a few years now. I'm not sure how long it's been running, but certainly about five years. You know, that mix of sounds that you've just mentioned, the African strands and the thing that I identify with is you can go along a timeline of what essentially is Afro-Caribbean flavour in a city like Manchester that has this huge legacy of... representing that music from the Moss Side Carnivals that were going on in the sort of from the 70s through the 80s and the club scene that we grew up alongside which included places like the Reno Club in Moss Side. I wouldn't say I was, I'm not trying to make out I was there all the time, but it was a presence in your city that you knew about. and occasionally visited and seeps into your environment in terms of a dialogue the whole time. Sound system culture in Manchester has always been around and bumping up against all the other alternative cultures in Manchester. Manchester truly is a multicultural city and in this dialogue of the modern day where It's an important thing to embrace, a city like Manchester. London is totally multicultural in a way that certain things hang together in their own space. The Venn diagram doesn't cross quite as much as it does in a smaller city where the nightclub scene is more joined up. Manchester has got this fluidity to its culture where odd things happen, odd collaborations. We were talking earlier about the days of the Hume Crescents and the odd collaborations that used to happen between sort of... like heavy metal bands and hip hop. For instance, a guy called Gerald and Edward Barton, who was an eccentric songwriter who were more in the indie field, used to live next door to each other. And they made some brilliant Acid House records, one called Born in the North. which you couldn't come up with on paper. It just happened by symbiosis kind of thing. And that's just typically Manchester kind of bumping up against each other ideas, you know. Yeah, you seem to... It's quite often you can walk down the road in Manchester and you bump into someone from another band. It's that close. and everybody kind of knows each other. So it's quite easy to collaborate with other people from different genres of music. We all met in a record shop, didn't we? Yeah, yeah. That's when we first got together. It was loosely based around the fact that anyone who was messing around with drum machines could... Join the club. Join the club. And I think we were chasing some money, though. You know, we were chasing some government grants at the time so we could make a record, because making records back then was a lengthy process involving a fair amount of finance and studio time. You know, the bedroom thing hadn't been established at that point. Yeah, it was almost impossible, wasn't it, unless you had funding to do it. Yeah. So our beginnings were very much about playing live as kind of like a set of technology and rappers. There was a lot of rappers around. And then the Acid House thing used to come at the end of the hip hop nights as an aside and was met. quite, you know, it wasn't welcome, was it? No, not particularly. I mean, in that hip-hop crowd. Yeah, in the hip-hop crowd, you'd probably lose a bit of the crowd, but there was always a few that would hang around to see what... is this strange music you make it so sorry how exactly were they doing that were they going mantronics into more of the kind of electro tinged sort of stuff and then into the karma things or they trying to accelerate the energy at the end of a night how was that being played in a hip-hop night i'm not really just simply because we were tuning into uh there was a radio show in manchester called beat dis and they play an hour of how and an hour of hip-hop and an hour of street soul. And, you know, it almost became a format, didn't it, of like these different sub-genres of music using the same technology. You know, so there'd be an 808 in the hip-hop, there'd be an 808 in the house, there'd be a 303 in the hip-hop and 303 in, you know, the equipment was there. And all you needed to do, you know, it filled. you just rode the equipment out into Acid House which could go on for the side of a cassette or something. Yeah, yeah. So you could go out to a night and it'd start off as street soul going to hip hop. And then at the end of the night, it'd be Acid House. And, you know, people wouldn't blink an eye at it, you know, even though it was completely different cultures. It just seemed to work at the time. Was that cross-pollination period what you were trying to reach to on the album? Because song to song, it's very diverse. I'm surprised at some of it. it's 160 BPM one minute and then there's vocals one minute and not the next and there's some percussive parts on I think I think the Uchala, if I pronounced that correctly, which I thought I'd accidentally skipped into a different record. It's a pretty arresting list to me. We think this album is quite consistent compared to some of our other albums that really do take a trip around the globe, don't they? Yeah, yeah. We kind of got this idea that this is kind of on the level and it all connects. It's not jazzy, you know, it's electronic. It's not quite fourth worldy. It's not maybe as like globally travelling, but it's certainly not homogenous. Right, okay. Well, that's an interesting point of view. Because... It's fun to feedback. It feels like I've just shot your dog. No, it's good to get feedback. I thought we'd really been contained. Yeah, well, considering what we've done in the past, that was containment. You see, this album in its entirety would be something like six hours long or something. You know, when you have a studio and you're racking up... the tracks and and you go like could this fit there and could that fit there you know it took a process of uh elimination to get it down to uh a single album oh it's a double album you know i had that you know the idea of reducing it further was just impossible you know so um it's 13 tracks now yeah and just over an hour yeah and i've thought you know sonic it's kind of yeah we like diversity we like to visit lots of different flavours in our records and that's an A2A state trope really that we move around and play things that are insanely optimistic and then do some really dark stuff and You know, it's always been an album mentality that we approach making the music over. You know, we've come from like an era where the album was king, you know. Still really find it hard to stop thinking in terms of side A and side B, you know. It's so ingrained. And in the modern context, it's all about one track, isn't it? Yeah, pick and choose. one track where with us it's like oh well that would be side A and here's side B and you try and make it a continuation but nowadays it's I just have one track if I like it won't bother with the rest Right I mean now I mean, I'm really in love with B-side culture as well, which is a thing that's probably not a viable thing anymore. I mean, these tracks that don't have to be quite so important all the time. There's explorations within music that require... require that things just don't have to hit all points at once. Back when we were making things that ended up in the pop charts, we never approached a single and go... well, what would be the perfect single? We arrived at things that just had a vibe that when the culture was soft and inviting new things in, they just managed to live there through their own sense of personality. We had some pretty odd singles in the charts. Yeah, just show the loop. Yeah, like In Your Face being one, the original version which... you know people um probably don't know as well as the remix now you know uh was um you know almost like a piece of classical music or something. And it was edited in a funny way as well. I remember going on holiday and the record company put it out before I'd finished the edit. So it kind of just tails off at the end. It's just sort of like, he goes, hmm. Yeah, that's a bit of an odd one. Amongst what was going on in the charts at that time, it was like... People Power spoke then, you know, because they was buying the record and that's what charts were based on back then. So, you know, it was an odd thing, but, you know, we've never played straight for the, you know, that genre or that genre. We've always played around with different genres. I mean, if you look solely at your, let's say your chart period for the three, four, five years where you're getting songs consistently in the top 20 or top 10, they don't sound alike because one's crunchy and acidic and one's very like the smoothed out, buttery side of like, check that rate. And it doesn't feel like you were shooting for the hit by kind of. conforming to a trope that you've made up it's just like oh this is working for people let's just keep doing what we're doing no matter if it's crunchy or soft yeah well I suppose there's no box you could put us in kind of thing so You know, one we might have a hit with a raging banger and then we'll sit there in the studio and we're like, we're not going to do another one and we'll do something else. You know, twist the corner. Yeah, well, what is that though? What is that belligerent attitude that pervaded everything that we did back then? Well, back then there was no rules or boundaries, was there? Was it a dynamic within the band where it was like, oh, well, you've had do something yeah because there was a lot of people in the band at that point where so a lot of opinions so in order to get something like a single like lift across yeah it required um a certain amount of other records to go out you know yeah people often talk about you know what got released as beatles singles and people had to wait their turn for, and some classic things got buried on B-sides and all that. I think when you have a band of four quite strong-minded individuals, sensible conversations don't necessarily result in sensible decisions. There was a lot of chaos to what we did. But the chaos, the energy of chaos is a beautiful thing sometimes, I think. There's a lot of... ridiculous decisions in that music that has kept it alive over many years you know if you know there's no formula it's deliberate anti-formula yeah I mean there are also and as you say about maybe some heads being buttered in that era there were also fallouts that happened through it I believe I'm hoping I'm on steady ground here that your relationship with a guy called Gerald has been patched up since but that ran out as A bit of scurrilous gossip in the music press at the time. There was beef and there was court cases and everything, which to me is, as a modern day dance music fan, is odd. You don't often see internal warfare bleed out that heavily, possibly because that can be a death knell for your career if you seem to be fighting with a member of your DJ collective, your group. And that spills out onto social media. That can often dominate the narrative to the point no one cares about the music anymore. They just want to see like a bun fight. I'm so glad there wasn't the social media thing back then because like, you know, there's so many sides to that opinion kind of thing. And you've got to remember that at that point we were just about to sign a record deal with ZTT. and that was in jeopardy over this fracas and that he was with CBS at that time. So it becomes CBS Law Department versus Warner Brothers Law Department. It's not a lot to do with... you two in the studio. Do you know what I mean? It becomes this sort of ballooned thing, you know. It becomes a lawyer's game, doesn't it? And there was a lot of, there was, you know, from our personal point of view, there was a lot at stake here. You know, we'd spent a lot of time, you know, approaching this moment, you know, with a whole lot of music. You know, ZTT originally came up to see us over. a snub TV appearance with MC Tunes. They were really interested in him as a star and indeed they gave him a separate contract. So it wasn't this case of like, oh, they've got a hit because they didn't know about that when we negotiated this deal. They came up and went... these guys have got a record store, these guys have got a studio, these guys have got a radio show, you know, they've got a whole village industry of things. We were quite attractive, you know. We were quite attractive to a lot of record companies at that point. Yeah, it was getting more and more. just a band, weren't they, when they were getting up? They got two artists out of one, basically. And that whole thing of being like, you know, we were a pretty volatile bunch back then. We were all really young and Martin was always a controversial figure. He'd say outrageous stuff all the time. You could go back through his quotes in the music press. And he just deliberately said outrageous stuff all the time. His personality was edgy, wasn't he? He was an edgy character. And, you know, things often fell into conflict in easy ways. Looking back on that... whole period of things, things could have been easily sorted out in a quite simple, you know, back then, you know, and then it all becomes legend and people have their bits to it and it's like, it was amazing talking to some guy who was around when we were making the those records and I forgot that the studio was often full of about 14 people or something all crammed in just hanging about yeah yeah yeah instead like recording was an event yeah especially if you're recording on like a Saturday morning or something like that the whole people had just turned up it's just you know the people from the record shop be like hey they're recording kind of thing and everyone would turn up and they'd be like you know there's plenty of witnesses to all that scenario down there you know that As I say, it was chaotic and trying to make musical decisions in that environment was on a budget and studio time was really expensive. You had to go in, write a tune, mix it and finish it. It was crazy fast. It's amazing that we got anything done when I think about it. You couldn't think in there. And people, yeah, if you get people like smoking and, you know, it's like, it wasn't this lab-like sort of clean electric. environment we were working in. It was like a sweat box of mayhem. More like making a tune in a party, you know. People were like having it. And also in there was other bands making records at that time, weren't they? Everyone was queuing up to make an Acid House record at that point. almost there was a band who um also used that studio uh candy flip you might know remember candy flip who had a hit with strawberry fields forever or something and they were about 17 or something but complete um you know party animals at the same time it's like You had to be careful which cup of tea you picked. You know, you two are really grinning about this era of chaos and friction because obviously a lot of great stuff came out of it. And you mentioned like a sanitized lab-like way of making music. And I'm guessing that is the condition in which the new record got made where there's no... physical ram head-butting drama but it's an album that kind of fizzes with with youthful energy and lots of different explorations but presumably this one was made in a more standardized long gestating anti-dramatic way where you sat down and you wrote and recorded and there wasn't bun fights Or maybe they're worse. It wasn't done in isolation. You know, this place where we were recording, which is the old... Granada TV Studios in Manchester. It's a place that had been abandoned by the TV station because they moved to Salford in the early 2000s. So it was a building awaiting a reuse situation whereby artists and creatives naturally drawn in to cheap rents. in order to regenerate an area kind of thing. They do it all the time now, don't they, in London and in any city in the world. I mean, East London, the whole place is completely different. That model is playing out everywhere. So we're aware that we have that role in a way. So there was a bunch of, a lot of people. creatives in that building and there's a radio reformer in there and so the place is full of DJs and various other recording studios in there so people were lending equipment off each other. I was actually originally sort of subletting that room we had from Mr Scruff. And Dennis Jones was in there next door. He was, you know, there was people coming in all the time. You know, it wasn't like shut the door and get on with it. Sometimes, yeah. But there was a sense of community in the building. And therefore, when you were making stuff, everyone had a place to sit. opinion and you know again it was like quite a social yeah vibe people are just popping wouldn't they calling just for a chat and then you go whoa listen to this what we're doing at the moment well again that's you know quite uh quite a manchester thing that's always gone on you know and um i can't think of any album that didn't have that kind of um sense of openness to what we're doing so the answer to that question is was it is is is it things slowed up in terms of the process yeah they've slowed up uh but it just means you're working on multiple ideas at the same time you know i think that's a different energy yeah well it's not like a pressure cooker yeah you have the the the ability to sprawl out if you need to yeah and you it's a little bit more considered and well what you have to learn in that Chinese menu world of every possibility at your fingertips is a return to economy and i think that the the record has a return to economy for a band like us you can go back to our last album you know 17 years ago but transmission, outpost transmission, we've got too many transmissions. But that is much more ornate, oriental sounding. Somebody described it as a sort of like a punch up in a, you know, some sort of like a oriental wok restaurant or something. Which I kind of got. Yeah, it had, you know, an exotic feel to it. But it was much more less about dance music than, you know, our arc of making music had travelled out from dance music to some outpost somewhere, you know. So now we sense that in this record to be more about the physical act of throwing yourself about. You know, you brought up something I was going to, which is the double transmission factor. And that to me strikes me as very deliberate because even 17 years is a long time. Like a kid that was born in 2002 is basically going out raving now. it feels like you're not trying to attempt a clean break so much as a soft reset by using the same word twice i don't know if that was intentional but it struck me as quite a nice like picking up the thread where you left it even if musically it's different there's a certain amount of synchronicity in it as well because like you know literally the door where you let yourself in in the morning had transmission suite as a one of those plastic signs on the door, you know, so it was there anyway, you know, and it just kept hitting you every day when you went in there. It's like this huge room about the size of a football pitch, but it's sided all round with glass. And then it has 80 TV screens. So it has a sense of Mission Control Houston about it. And it has these huge arced desks with TV mixing equipment that is useless. But it looks good. It's got lots of knobs. So you put all your knobs on top of those knobs kind of thing. It's a lot of knobs. It's a lot of knobs. And all this racking and wiring everywhere. So you pull up the floor and there's layers of wires from the 1950s. There's layers of wires from every decade because they replaced it all the time. There's some dead rats in there as well, which stink a bit sometimes, followed by a cloud of blue bottles. So, you know, it's like, you know, it has the trappings of cutting edge technology with these ghosts, this feeling of ghostliness. It had a lot of history in that room, didn't it? Yeah. Underneath this room is the studio's... where the Beatles first recorded their TV appearances, you know, the one with the Pentax cameras behind them. And there was like Jerry Lee Lewis and all kinds of early rock and rollers were accepted into this building, whereas they wouldn't be at the BBC quite so easily. The Sex Pistols did their first TV appearance in that studio. Again, the BBC, no chance. And then Joy Division did their first TV appearance. And we did our first TV appearance, which was a... version of Pacific State on Tony Wilson's program The Other Side of Midnight and he invited us in after seeing us playing in a pub in Bolton he declared us the new Sex Pistols and invited us on the TV and we didn't we just done a mix of Pacific at that point and we went and played that because the saxophone wasn't on it. The saxophone was on it so it was less knobby. You know, so we did that and recently seen a clip of that and he says at the end it's like that's the theme from 828 State because it hadn't got the name at that point. It hadn't been out on a white label. You used to play it on a cassette, didn't you? Yeah, yeah. I used to play it on a cassette in a club in Manchester. I used to play it as the last tune. And over the space of a three-week sort of weekly residency, you could sense that, you know, it was doing something, this. And that was, you know, that was probably around about the same time when it was on TV, wasn't it? So it became like, whoa, did you see that? They was on TV. Yeah, that was the beginning of the journey of that tune. And it maybe took a while longer before it started getting played on Radio 1 because Gary Davis, the Radio 1 daytime DJ, had been out raving in Ibiza. it back and started playing it off an essentially an album track we never put it out as a single it was an EP and he started playing it daytime radio and that really bumped things up but it was it was established in the clubs around that time as well Hacienda were playing it I remember the first time Hacienda played it and just being that air-punching moment of like, ah, finally, you know, getting that in. But we were talking before about how you could actually, you know, back then we'd make a cassette and take it down the house, and we could make a cassette that evening. jump in a cab, get it played on a cassette by John De Silva on Hot Night, which is like the sweatiest atmospheric night without question. You know, he didn't go, I need to hear it first, guys. And that became that. That single that was like a New Order remix called Blue Monday, So Hot, because it was for the hot night. That's Gerald singing on that record. yeah that was the spontaneity of being able to do that and then go back in the studio and tweak it a bit and yeah it's an incredible loop of um you know i didn't want to overly focus on pacific state because i know you guys have spoken about it probably into your teeth hurt um but it does strike me as incredible if you'll indulge me for a minute that there are The 707, 202, 808, 98, 909, the 909, Mellow Birds, Mega Edit, Brit Mix, used by Dot Scott, the KLF, Nookie, Sochi, Tarada, Kicks Like a Mule, Groove Riders, Tom Pritchard, Justin South, Luke Viber, and even on the day-to-day. So it's kind of filled part of the air of British dance music since its inception, though I've both heard you variously say... that you didn't think that was going to be your calling card. And yet somehow it's just in the DNA and it's in the bloodstream of British music of the last 30 years, which must be quite an interesting thing to carry around with you, no? And there was a hundred Italian bootlegs out of it as well at the same time. It was coming in every week. Everything you did became an Italian bootleg a week after, didn't it? Yeah. That was peculiar. They were so fast. I think they must have been smuggling it on boats in Cornwall or something because it was just overpowering. But yeah, I mean, some tracks have a life of their own, definitely. And it's like a lot of those ones you mentioned, I've not heard of. Yeah, those are mean samples and people throwing it through the mix casually, but you hear that riff and you know what it is. One of the first times we heard it sampled was the KLF Chill Out album. And it's the like, oh, they've sampled it kind of thing. And it's like, you know, it wasn't like you just had to go like. well that's you know it seemed fitting you know and it seemed you know the sampling thing was really free at the beginning you know it was like no one thought about the kind of morality of sampling particularly back then well you know there was a sort of karmic law of it was a nod there was a nod yeah there was a nod between they'd nod to us we'd nod to them Oh, with the KLF thing. Yeah, that was the first time somebody broke a bit off and made it into a different context and then it kept going. And then there must be hundreds on SoundCloud of people having a go at it and almost making it look like it's an official version, but they're not official versions. I don't know how you would sort of organize all that output of that tune, you know. It just goes on and on and on. I think by this point you have to be magnanimous enough to let it go and just continue that life that's on. Yeah, sure, yeah. And particularly, you know, you see it like the great pottery throwdown. We'll be playing a brass band version of it. Or like there was another Jeremy Deller version of it with doing the steel band version of it in the Bahamas for some Olympic thing. And it just carries on in its own way, you know. But there's several, you know, quite a lot of the other tunes doing that in their own sweet way as well, you know. The amount of versions of Army of Me that are knocking about, which is like another tune. that one of the tunes I did with Bjork kind of thing. There's incredible amounts of... of that tune in a heavy metal context. In a heavy metal context? Yeah, loads of heavy metal bands do that tune. It's like an angry anthem for a generation of Americans. Wow, that's not something I'm aware of. That's very cool. Have a check out on the internet because there was also... a charity record where we had to sift through a hundred versions of submitted versions to go on a whole album of versions of Army of Me which was part of the Tsunami relief. I want to talk a bit about nostalgia as a concept. I pulled up a quote from Dave Haslam, who, for those that don't know, is a Mancunian journalist, been around for a while, you know, he's got his stripes. He said, in 2007, I'm into being part of a Manchester music scene that celebrates its past without living in the past. I admit it's a difficult balance. But I think that what's sometimes forgotten is that every generation has a new battle to fight. It's not great if Manchester ends up something like a Manchester theme park. It's embarrassing. And he said that 12 years ago. And then he brought that back up when there was the release of the Fact 51 gin that was coming out recently. Your new record puts a pin in the idea that you're literally just living in a past because you're not. and it's fresh and it's exciting but also to continue circulating around people's consciousness you have to pay homage to where you came from and you obviously are part of the the city and the country's dance music lineage so i wonder how you juggle that balance of nostalgia and futurism without getting caught in a trap on either side and if it's a difficult tightrope to walk it is and we have at times I mean I personally at times have felt trapped in that nostalgia thing because like some of you know in recent years we get asked to play alongside you know things like Happy Mondays gigs and you know but out there in the gig world, you know, when we're trying to do gigs that work, you know, when we go out, there's like five or six people, you know, this costs money, you know. in order to go and do that, make any kind of money, it's put in the pot. There's those awkward moments where you go like, you want to do a Hasse and the Classical gig again, where it goes, and then there's no money in the bank, so you do it, you know. And yet... If you're there representing with the music that you believe in and you're playing to 10,000 people and you could, you know, there has to be a point where your music has to work in any situation. And we found ourselves in some odd situations. But if the music works, it works anywhere. You could play it in a kindergarten. then it would work, you know. You've got to have that confidence with the music, you know, that when we first set out doing gigs in America, rave was not established at all. It was non-existent. Yeah, and yet... There were some people pioneering it in terms of trying to put on big parties. One was Long Beach in 1989, was it? 90. 90, yeah. And they'd seen a European version of what raves could be. there was people going very interested in seeing if this could work. And we played some interesting ones in Texas, which was like, often gets not mentioned that Texas was this big rave centre. Dallas was a big rave thing. Yeah. It was like huge. We've pulled in 10,000 in like Dallas in 1990. And it was like the first, we wasn't promoting 808 State, we was promoting dance music. And we went from coast to coast, probably seen more of America than most Americans have seen. Yeah. Stopping at big cities and then doing a few small ones in between. And those little seeds you put down in the places between the big cities, they're still giving back now, aren't they? Yeah, yeah. It was, yeah, you felt like you were taking Coles to Newcastle in some ways. And when we first went back to, we first went to Detroit, where we expected to find in a context where everyone knew what that music was about. It was such a tiny scene, wasn't it? Yeah, it was shocking for me because we were like, oh, we're going to Detroit. Great. Brilliant. We got there and it was like, you know, you're lucky to get 300 people in a nightclub. playing electronic dance music. It was like, well, hang on. I mean, they're probably, you know, we were there slightly at a point in time when it had maybe played out its own thing. And their nights that established that scene were probably huge. But I don't know. We had expectations about Detroit. and every one of our heroes was almost in the audience you know yeah and they were very welcoming and you know there was a sense of connection because they knew that Manchester was loving you know giving love back to that scene you know a lot of their records being you know established in Britain through the nightclubs in Manchester so yeah it was an interesting point where we realised it's like oh right the perspective of of how unentrenched the dance music that we saw as a blueprint was you know how fragile it was and how unsupported in its own culture it was you know it's taken many years for that thing to expand into music history in a way and we were you know that was early it was like 1990s yeah so 30 years on now america He's got EDM and it's huge. And we'd like to say we helped start that. I know. I'm not a fan of EDM, but respect to whoever's doing it. What I'm hearing is this guides your lack of cynicism about the same cynicism people might have about being too hot in one era. Because as you say, music is fragility and you can't just put something in a canon and claim it's a classic and leave it untouched for 40 years and it still has the same reverence. You have to keep... adding to it and taking to it and nurturing that relationship, that two-way street. Yeah, it's gardening, isn't it? You know, you have to kind of nurture it. What's interesting to me about where you left off in terms of your last record 17 years ago is that looking back seems to be like a low ebb. in British dance music or the dance music infrastructure that a lot of like European trance music was massive, but you guys had already kind of flown the nest of brave music. You have people like Guy Garvey on the record who, it seems anachronistic to me that you could have Guy Garvey on electronic. record back then obviously things were different elbow weren't quite like the massive cultural great but it looks odd looking back but that must have been a point where it was the low ebb cream would collapse there were lots of signs that dance music had kind of run its course or imploded but now do you think it's in better health ruder health or maybe you're not quite as tied to boom and bust as I am Yeah, because all along that timeline, you felt uncertain about what the next move is in Clubland. It always felt like a crumbling edge from the word go. We were talking about nostalgia, and there was nostalgia for 1988 in 1989. And it falls back on itself constantly, that nostalgia for, like, the summer you had at great clubbing, you know, or the way one tune intersects with your life and certain memories and things, you know. Yeah, there's this sense that the baton has been passed to different generations, you know, as people become more family orientated as things go on. You know, you have to navigate, you know, clubbing doesn't become as important. Then you get the second wave of clubbing once your kids have left, you know. I think nowadays, I think it's a different climate, isn't it, altogether? You've still got them super clubs knocking around, but they've now turned into festivals. And where we last left off, it was... pretty miserable time in the life of dance music. Probably could have ended, but obviously, you know, these people on the underground are still pushing for it, which it still is nowadays, you know. That's why it keeps going. It's 30 years on. I think the big difference as well is that that's when the internet was first getting, you know, getting really established. We had an internet site in 19... 93, was it? 94, maybe? I think it was 94. No, we were one of, there was very few bands with an internet site when we first got ours. There was a guy that we bumped into and said the internet was the future and you're the perfect band to represent the internet or whatever. The future. And so we started one with one of those modems that took half an hour to download one minute of music and we were like, yeah, we're going to put our music on the internet. internet and people are going to download it and it's like yeah the technology wasn't up to it was it no so we we did a cd it was called state to state and you joined our mailing list and we sent it uh you know it was pretty clunky sort of version of the internet but uh forums on the internet we saw that the development of that and the fact that fans had an input back into what you were doing. And we've had the same webmasters for many years. Marcus Arnold from... Amsterdam and Nick King have become archivists in a way. You know, they would sort of like collect all the data from what gigs you were doing, flyers, every version of every record that was ever available. And these are very valuable kind of input of data into the timeline. That's all on 828state.com. For instance, all the radio shows from the early days. of Manchester Raving that Darren and Andrew used to do on Sunset Radio. They're all archived on that site as well. There's all the interview clippings, which I tried desperately not to read because I was just going to quote things back to you the whole time. But it's all there. You've got your entire history of press there, which is... Not that common. A lot of things are quite transient in social media. They make a big splash and they go the next day. Yeah, because data has become so peripheral now. It's everywhere, yeah. Yeah, it's too much. It doesn't have a value to keep it anymore. Whereas actually looking back on... um this timeline of your journey through music it's that data is really kind of um tells a story of like how sometimes you think oh that was a really intense period and you look at it it's like god we barely did anything that year you know and it's like it's it's it's not complete data it says it happened though isn't it I mean, when you're reading it, it's as it was happening at the time. It's not somebody who's gone back in history. But it informs, like, you know, looking at journalism throughout the dance music thing. It was very hard to start up. serious music journalism about dance music for many years. Like the NME and Melody Maker traditional music journalism came to it really quite late. And when they came to it, it was in the form of things like Mixmag, which were very skewed, as skewed as the Daily Mail in some ways, because it was like they had a vested interest in pushing their DJs. That's why you would get certain characters on the front cover of that publication. over and over again and they shaped dance music and DJ history in that way. You know what I mean? It wasn't an open book and it wasn't... Yeah, it's interesting to look back on the flow of journalism towards dance music. Yeah, the press very strongly controlled the narrative in the early 90s. This is obviously a little bit before my time because this is when I was born effectively but I remember seeing covers of... Someone like the KLF smashing a guitar in 91 and then being like, rock music is dead. I think that was LFO. And then next year having Suede smashing a synthesizer being like, dance music is dead. And in nine months, the two main pillars of culture apart from hip hop had both been living and then killed and then living again. And it just seemed ridiculous to me that you could make such a bold claim. No one was there on the internet to challenge you, so you kind of put it out and let it sit and it would shake people's understanding of it. Yeah. Maybe a bit more damaging than helpful at that time. You had a lot of power at that time, you know. It was, it's kind of that Oasis Blair thing, you know. It was completely made up by the press, but it was them selling newspapers. I mean, our introduction into the record industry, we signed to ZTT, but we were effectively handled by Warner Brothers, which is when you go back and watch Spinal Tap films and they have that guy, Artie Fufkin. who looks after them kind of thing. It was that era of promotion, you know. You'd meet some guy in Holland with a Dire Straits tour jacket on and your heart just sank going like, well, this ain't going to work. It's just not going to work, you know. And he turned up in a Harley Davidson. Yeah. That change, you were impatient for change, but sometimes you had to. be you know just where you were trying to keep you up with what you'd achieve which was accidental weirdo pop records you know that keep you up thing got really hard you know you started to second guess things where there was moments along the way where you'd made really some bad decisions on what records you put out various points and then there was points where you rallied back in going that oh mediterranean state and then points where you just came running back at it with a vengeance and and one record being don solaris remember sweating blood over that record yeah as and it still i think holds up as a really um powerful piece of work and it's at a point when dance music, it was so far out from dance music and clubbing, but in a really successful way. As an album, I'm really proud of that record, but it has nothing to do with whatever clubbing was at that point in time. It becomes very much almost like a prog album. It was more rebellious to what was going on at the time because we was bored of what was actually happening at the time, weren't we, really? Yeah. I think my main kind of emotion back then was like, you know, just to do something that you could be proud of, you know. and that's an odd set of things to set out to do. Yeah, so much work. When I listen to it, it actually hurts a little bit, because the amount of effort that went into it, there's a sort of feeling in your body. But I think it's a beautiful record. It felt like the beginning of when people were viewing you not as like instrumental club act. in the pop charts but when those influences that you've had along like you just mentioned prog like you're into gong and you were into martin denny and exotica and tangerine dream and kind of fourth world explanations that kind of get smudged out when you're at the height of britain's rave mania but then that can all come back in and just like i'm ahead i've got a record collection i know a lot about stuff and i can show that off I think you mentioned during a DJ Mag retrospective that you compare yourself to top shelf whiskey, which I thought was quite a nice way of describing the way you are now. You've matured on the shelves and you've got a lot of character and flavour that is maybe misquoted. I probably thought I was mature 20 years ago, but now I'm... I've really been showing it. People might not have been looking at Top of the Pops and looking at a Midi sack and unplugged equipment and be like, oh, I bet these guys know Ferris Sanders records front to back. I don't think you can really get that on the TV, but then you slowly had to see that back into real life. Yeah, because, you know, musically, that's the stuff that you can lean back on and it's eternal, some of this music. And ultimately, if you're doing music, you want to be eternal, you know, you want, that's what it's about, you know, it's kind of like, you know, a different kind of communication that can talk to anyone on the planet and after you've gone, you know, and, you know, I think it's... I think there's certainly... some of the eight-weight state music that has been proven that way, you know, with, like you were saying about the way it seeps into all these, has its own life, you know. So, yeah, ultimately, if you're musical heroes, you're trying to climb up on that pedestal with your musical heroes, yeah, absolutely, you know. And also at times playing with 808 State to absolutely get lost in the music, you know, love playing live in terms of an electronic band. It's something that can get really sweaty and transcendent, you know, at times where a tune like Pacific you can improvise the hell out of, you know, it's not. People probably wonder what it is when they hear it. Talk about, I mean, I'm not comparing myself to Pharaoh Sanders, but my head is in that space. Yeah, my head is. is definitely aspiring to that kind of level of leaving the planet. You kind of want to make every tune timeless, don't you? You want it to be able to look back at your catalogue and go, put that on, play it against anything nowadays. And does it stand up? Most of it does. I saw a really interesting post by a very, very highly respected, like, current designer called David Rudnick, who does artists like One Trick's Point Never and Clouds and has a very, like, futuristic style of design where he was talking about growing up alongside. AFX and Future Sound of London yourselves and that when he was young it created a vocabulary for transcendence and a world outside and not just not just sonically but technically the words of like jungle and time stretching and the kind of sunrises and pacific states and exotic paradises or being evoked musically and in the phrasing that was being used. And for a lot of people, it's maybe lost now with the current generation, but that was a way to really escape your physical self and enter a mode of something else that you could climb into when you grew up. With the data overload and the information age we spoke about, maybe the importance of that, of artists being able to shape a world beyond, has diminished, do you think? Whether dreaming has been kind of smudged out by access to knowledge and that kind of role of electronic music to paint something beyond doesn't hold quite as much emphasis with people because they actually can research that beyond and understand it and make it tangible and a specific... state sunrise isn't some far-imagined ideal but something you could just google now yeah and then like most people nowadays give three to five seconds of a new track and then go don't like it skip it so you you kind of you kind of are losing that thing where you you can send yourself off to another planet even though you sat in your bedroom or whatever you know i think in a way that transcendence through music is as old as the hills you know it goes way back to you know bc you know it goes way back to when music started you know it's Having grown up through the 60s and into the 70s and witnessing alternative culture in England, there's this dread. You know, we're talking about Gong, and that's the world I kind of grew up in. We used to get on a bus with this band called Here and Now. There's a documentary that just went up last week about this band, Here and Now. They were like the ultimate free festival band, and they became the backing band for David Allen when he left Gong. And there was this whole idea that music should be free and you should go round and just ask for what people think it's worth. And that's where my musical journey began, on this converted ambulance going around the country doing this mad music, you know, where you were angry back then. You know, there was a sort of punk element to what you were doing and it was just like shouting and screaming and making a noise. But you witnessed how British subcultures were so weak back then. then that they gathered together you there'd be festivals back then where it was full of punks hippies you know, all the West Indian music, you know, all the reggae stuff. You know, there's a festival in Rochdale called Deeply Veil Festival and they had everything from jazz rock fusion to the fall to hawk wind and this kind of thing. And you got a sense early on that everyone that wants a kind of different alternative view what society should be. You know, music is this tool to bash that through. You know, and years later in the rave thing, it actually became very visceral. It became, actually, this is working. This is changing social divisions. This is changing class divisions in clubs. You know, it may well have been the drugs. But, you know, it actually, as people gathered in big numbers and, you know, became breaking down all these social norms and social barriers, that the music that tracked that had a lot of roots in the music of the people who aspired to that. 10 years earlier, 15 years earlier, you know, and people started using this summer of love analogy for the rave thing. And we were really irritated by that at the time because it felt new. It felt, but actually looking back on it now, this thread that followed all the way through it was just simply about railing against the... terrible governmental system that we lived through in the 80s which was Thatcherism you know and this sense of like people in you know a whole generation that was left hanging they didn't have a hope in hell of achieving self-empowerment and then the rave thing was totally about self-empowerment in a way because it wasn't just about music it was the energy it brought to our city in terms of commerce and new business and people having a crack at something and some of it being criminal, probably. But, I mean, there was a whole economy based around that energy that still lives in the city now, you know, and it's almost been hijacked at various points by more... Corporate. Corporate forces. You know, but, yeah, that thing you're talking about where... as city becomes its sort of faces of like, you know, that beatilization of Manchester, we've really been fearful of like. We never stood a chance of that because we were a faceless techno band, you know what I mean? We're never going to get included, and so many times we're not included in the story of Manchester music. But who changed music in that era were the people dabbling with this technology. All the great British export bands of that era were a pretty oddball bunch. KLF, Orb, Orbital. Chemical Brothers, all these things, you couldn't put them in, none of them fitted together. You know, it was just this energy that came out in all these different ways. And again, that's in the tradition of British subcultural music. And back to this album where it was saying about the way you can look at a time thread of British... um underground music and kind of refracted through it yeah yeah and and go anywhere on that timeline that's what i'm hearing in clubs now you people know their stuff then they're interested in that timeline you know to the internet has enabled that kind of selection process where things are rediscovered and recontextualized and you know I remember hearing things like a goth record like Bella Lugosi's Dead by Barhouse being played next to drum and bass and thinking, that'll never work. And it works perfectly, you know, because there's so many of those stories into weed. You just revealed something really interesting. that I was going to kind of, to put my own referral in the record and from what we've spoken about in the last hour, the fact that you picked Granada Studios is because it has a cultural heritage, it has a historical heritage that the city you're from. what you've just spoken about, about rave not just being escapism and a wicked new sound in the charts, but restoring some kind of dignity to labour and to communities after a decade of them being kneecapped constantly. It seems to me that the visual tropes of the record that we've seen so far, as well as where it's made... And the way the new logo is based out of TV screens seems to hark back to putting a bit of regeneration in that area and into the city. And I wonder if that was a conscious move to try and spotlight a building that brought a lot of joy culturally to the city and whether you guys trying to revive that spark was deliberate, was something, a wider aim in making it there. having it hooked around the theme of television Granada studios, or is that just circumstantial? It's a sense of the fact that that building was going to leave us, you know, and it was a building that used to, when you travelled into Manchester on the train, you used to see this huge aerial and this huge glowing neon sign that put your city in a world context almost. You know, TV was a massive deal when we were growing up. You know, you had three channels. One of them was Granada, you know. You know, the BBC view of the world, even as a child, you knew that it was a bit stuffy. And then Granada was this rebel-y kind of thing, you know, where it had some utter rubbish on it, you know, I mean, but they had great documentaries like World in Action and Man Alive. They did great journalism. They also presented music that was... that fired you up. The whole punk thing came into Manchester through on a six o'clock broadcast, tea time, you know, not late at night, hidden away. It was like coming through tea time while you're eating your fish fingers, you know. And alongside that, you would have like pop programs that gave proggy things on pop programs. It was like Bay City Rollers next to PFM, which was like an Italian prog band. David Bowie doing Style Man for the first time wasn't that famous Top of the Pops footage. It was on Liftoff with Aisha, which is a tea time fish finger broadcast from Granada. To me, it's this very special place that was going to leave us. And, you know, to do something on that spot, surrounded by history, you have this sense of getting off the tram and going to that building every day. You're surrounded by history. You get off at a Roman fort that overlooks this. Civil War bridge where the Roundheads and the Cavaliers battled over it because there's this building called Campfield Market and that's where they kept all the cannons and the horses and the building of Granada is built on a plague pit. And all these things are there. All this history, the Peterloo thing that everyone's been, it's been celebrated recently, which is the battle. for the right for cheap food in 18... Well, it's left me now. Early 1800s. And they'd sent the cavalry in and just killed a load of people. These things are monumented around this area. You have a living history there. And music's music. They're not these weighty... things but nobody was documenting their place was it at the time we both sat there talking about saying somebody should be in here filming this uh the building yeah yeah because it's gonna go so that's why we got it was more like let's get the building involved with this album we made you know it was somebody had to document it so it looks like we're the ones who've done it. Well, I think also you just have energy comes up from the city sometimes. You get it in a place like London, you know, there's sort of like so much has gone on in certain places in London that... You know, you only have to sort of feel it through coming up through your feet, you know, and that's going to change the way any artist works. You know, it infuses what you do. It was a very inspiring place to make a record, you know. It's next to Castlefield Arena where we've done many big outdoor concerts in Manchester. It feels like our little home. spot there and it's next to the first railway station on earth all these kind of crazy little moments of invention literally like 200 yards away from our studio is the world's first computer in the science and industry museum you go in there and just have a look at all these early computers for ante made these computers in Manchester that were for missile systems but they were the first ones that worked properly and you know and then we're in this building it's like you feel connected in industrial history and some of this stuff is because like you know our fathers were always involved in industry, always involved in engineers. They were all engineers in some kind of way. They did things, they made things. And as they came home from work and talked about all these places, of these industrial places that made things, our generation felt like, how do I... continue that in some ways and sometimes I think that you know musical engineering and technology to make music is some kind of way of grasping the baton from these previous generations that made this you know the working class environment of Manchester that we both grew up in, you know. The place you grew up in was Ancoats, which was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, wasn't it? It's a crazy place full of like these chimneys and mills. It looks like a Lowry. but now it's baristas and yeah it's a super cool place to be you can get craft bakery and special IPAs and you know it's just nuts isn't it the way we grew up to what Manchester's become there's a sense of a city just becoming another city and you know so there is a sense of nostalgia and a point of just drawing attention to this moment of change Because it's also unusual that we did this futurist music, look into the future, always look into the future when trying to make music, you know, to just be involved with synthesizers and the craft work model kind of thing. of what futurist music would be, you know. It almost feels like we've reached that moment. You were supposed to be there in the year 2000, but now it really is turning to skyscrapers. a different version of the city. It's almost like we're signing off or something. Yeah, I hear Detroit artists say a similar thing. And the way you've just described Granada Studios, it's like how Juan Atkins speaks about the electrifying mojo, that kind of ultra-diversity that birthed a generation of open-eared, impressionable, explorative musicians and creatives. But they say the same thing about the... the regeneration that's happened since when Bat grew up a few years ago and how there's a dual feeling of both, I guess, acceptance and a bit of relief that maybe ambulance services will reach part of the cities and their kids might have a better life, but also this wisdom. peacefulness that what they grew up in and what made it so special and so tight-knit community and what you just described but when you went there that you saw these people together the bonds that hold those people together are fraying as Detroit becomes a hip area that maybe resembles like Brooklyn 2.0 and they had this this this struggle between accepting that things change not wanting to keep it super rough but also not want to become too shiny and you have to have that balance yeah because like uh that that all plays out in our city as well because it is actually um you know the homelessness issue in manchester and the drug problems in manchester um you trip over on a every every day, every few hundred yards. I mean, I've just spent the weekend in Berlin and you don't get any sense of that there. You know, there's probably areas of Berlin where it goes on, but, you know, when City's kind of working on an efficient... level like that you know suddenly your paranoia goes down you know but Manchester's a very pretty paranoid place really you know and I forget that until you go somewhere else you know there's that there's like you know a joke you know ongoing joke of just of just like, you can't leave your, you know, I never leave my computer. I've always got my computer attached to my arm the whole time. And people are just like, just leave it. It's like, oh, Manchester conditioning, I can't leave anything, you know. It's a paranoid place, I think, you know, but a very friendly paranoid place. And a very expanding place. Yeah, now it's becoming very much like every other city on earth. You know, a lot of the, it's about who can afford to live in the city. And the people that once lived quite close to the centre, like where you grew up, was the centre of the city. It's a pretty working class sort of community. And you could walk into town all the time. Your town was your playground, wasn't it? Yeah, that was your hangout was middle of town. Yeah, and that was, you know, all the pubs had that culture that was the opposite of aspirational pubs. It was like... But, you know, for instance, we'd, what was that? You know, each pub would have like a football team, wouldn't they? Yeah. Like we sponsored one of the teams from your pub. Yeah, local, yeah, yeah. And, you know, you just get the sense of community is becoming homogenized, you know, and only certain people will be able to afford to live in your city at various points. People are being pushed out. That's going to affect culture. It's going to affect the music that gets made in your city. It affects what... Yeah, it's going to change the way the city exists. And it's going to change all the music as well. So you're looking for things in your city where interesting, edgy stuff happens. and it's kind of moving north in our city. I don't know how it works in other cities, but, you know, if things are moving into north of the city, there's a lot of vape shops. Just follow the vape shops. In one direction, there's Kraft Bakery's. In the other direction, it's vape shops. And that's where the music's going to be. I think you've presented a really interesting look at why not only just you know you're selling a new record but also why there's a wider importance in kind of paying respect to the past while also pushing forward to the future I want to selfishly wrap up on just one thing that strikes me as a big question in Your lineage that I really can't make sense of is that at one point you used pulsar radio signals in recordings, had Patrick Moore on a xylophone and hanged around a dream video in a telescope. And that's something I've always wanted to know. What? How? What happened? It's just a regular day at 808. Well, it was one of my teenage friends from way back. became Terry Wogan's PA and then she got a job being Brian Cox's media manager. And at that point, Brian Cox was only just coming out of the University of Manchester in terms of astrophysics or whatever he does. And I was finishing off with D Ream and it was their last video and they managed to black Jodrell Bank. the radio telescope dish for a video and my friend knew that it would be the most exciting thing in the world for me to go up in the dish so this was arranged and from that I got recruited for a six form drive for UMIS the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology to recruit six formers into signing up. So this musical event involved somebody from Tomorrow's World, Patrick Moore, Brian Cox, and it was a musical event where I had to make... piece of music from Pulsar Signals from Jodrell Bank and Patrick Moore was on his xylophone so just a typical night out Graham, Andrew thank you very much for the time and everyone listening if you've made it to the very end of our winding chat you should go and buy the new record A2H State thank you very much Thank you you
