Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. There's not much to say about Pete Tong that hasn't been said, to be honest. And that's exactly why we chose to talk to him for RA's Exchange. That and his wonderful radio voice works exceptionally well for the format. As he gears up to celebrate 20 years on BBC's Radio 1, we caught up with the massively influential DJ to talk about how he got his start in radio and how, in the digital world, his job has radically changed over the past few years. you It's funny to think back just then like it was only early 90s that mix albums first existed. Yeah. It was mixtapes before that and bootlaces. Were you doing quite a few mixtapes back then? Yeah, I mean, I mean, I've always been on the radio, so I've always had that outlet. So I mean, literally from. I mean, I grew up in a time when the only way to be famous as a DJ or to get on as a DJ was to get on the radio. There was only two ways. It was either get on the radio or run a club. and then I hoped that one of them would kind of further my career because DJs back then just didn't make music. Or if they did, it was like in a very traditional sense of, you know, when I went to New York for the first time, I saw like Shep Pettibone and Larry Levan and all these people. This is in like the 80s? It's like late 80s, yeah. Well, early 80s even. They had to get into proper studios. Proper studios on kind of down time, the edge of time. So making music wasn't a given back then. So radio was my thing and it took off quite quickly because when I was a journalist I got invited to go up to Radio 1 to kind of bring records up there. Peter Powell show, who was like the nighttime show at the time, and talk about music. And then off the back of that, I thought, oh, this is going to be plain sailing now. I was like 19 years old or whatever. I thought I was going to get on Radio 1. But they said, no, no, no, you're too young. Go and get some experience. So... And then off the back of going radio on, I lived in Kent and the last commercial franchise for a radio station was Invicta, which was in... Ironically, I was on a pirate called Invicta as well. But anyway, I got onto the... I became the Saturday Night Dance show on Invicta from... That was about 83 to... 86, 87, until I was kicked off because it was, they got a big Budweiser sponsorship and they wanted their dance show to be sponsored by Budweiser and I was really excited that made sense. And then they pulled me to one side and it's a brilliant story of racial profiling. They said, the only problem is you're not black. And they want a black guy. So I was in Kent. I was the man of Kent. I was like the superstar DJ of Kent. And I was being kicked off. So they said, we're not going to fire you, obviously. We're going to move your show to Sunday nights. And they made me, it was a twin, it was a twin town radio station. So I lived in Gravesend. And their studios are in Maidstone, so that was only like 20 minutes drive. But they told me on a Sunday night I should have to go to fucking Canterbury, which was like an hour and a half. So Sunday night started for an hour and then my head was out of there. It's like, I've got to get out of here. So I ended up getting on to Night FM on Radio London with Dave Pearce, who was the kind of producer. And then I took over the Saturday morning show for a minute. And anyway, I got onto Capitol pretty quickly then. the big big London station so that was 87 to 91 so going a long answer to your question but I didn't I did do mixtapes I did I did circulate you know because things you know the way you did them then was like very... He did mix CDs and send them out. Even that was like, yeah, it was early days of CDs. But I was always on the radio, so I always had the outlet of the radio. You said you also ran a club. That was your other, like, your gamble that you could... Yeah, no, going way, way back. So, literally out of school, I was... I was in Kent, so, and I was 16, 17. I was too young to really go up to London. I always looked a bit older than I was. So the people I hang around with used to go up to London to places like... But living in Grey's End, it just happened to be lucky that it was a catchment area for an awful lot of progressive-headed clubbers. And they would drive up to London and go and see... Global Village, which was like the one of the top kind of early underground inner London clubs of the day which was the site that eventually became heaven and they were like the kind of first wave of really underground kind of DJs and they would go up there and then they would bring me back they would find out what music was playing and they would bring me back these records or tip me off on these records this was the beginning of like discovering about American imports you know because again you know everybody's view of the world in terms of the underground was determined by what you were what records came from America. It was all came, you know, 90, 95% of it came from America. And it was only as, as I got more experienced at it and then kind of was around a little bit longer, you kind of realized that actually your whole view, it's even worse than that. Your whole view of the world is limited. by what the export company would send you. Yeah, yeah. So it was like, it was the guy like you sitting in New Jersey or something, you know. Deciding what you should listen to. Yeah, just whatever was available or let's, you know, be a cynic and say what they wanted to get rid of, you know. So it was like, then. But then obviously people started travelling to New York and going to Paradise Garage and those early kind of clubs and obviously forming more of a bond. I mean, the big journalist at the time was a guy called James Hamilton, who kind of almost single-handedly introduced the... of BPMing records into this country. So there was dialogue starting to go back and forth in America. So anyway, guys would bring me these records and I got into playing these records and I was working in a pub at the time, which was quite a cool pub. but then I started running clubs. So the only way to kind of, the only way to get noticed aside from being on the radio was to run a club, but not just to run a club. The reason to run a club was to book the big name DJs to come and see you. Greg Ebb was like I mentioned, George Power, Chris Hill was like out in Essex. And these were the Soul Mafia DJs, who were the kind of underground DJs of the day in the late 70s, early 80s. And those are the ones I booked. Started running my own clubs out in... two kind of most famous ones. One was called the Hilltop, the other one was called the King's Lodge. They were both on Monday nights, they were both by Browns Hatch racetrack. And they used to attract, we used to get about 500 people on a Monday, and it became kind of cult status. And people used to travel from like Peterborough and Southampton, Portsmouth, coming in buses and cars and vans. And it became, for a few years, it was hot. And there was in I mean obviously our world was the south east of England what was going on around northern Seoul and pre-Hacienda days was going on up north so your world was actually you know regional and then the story built from there and then when I started dancers were hotter than the DJs so like to be the star dancer was a much bigger thing than to be the biggest DJ. So the real faces on the scene were the dancers and the dancers were involved in running clubs as well and stuff like that. But then obviously some of the kids were up and coming DJs themselves and that's where I eventually met Nikki Holloway was kind of through that world. And Nikki ended up... I became very established with the Soul Mafia DJs and he was from London and he was kind of a little bit too young and Paul Oakenfold was just on, I think he was a year or two younger than me and he was just on the edges of that as well and Trevor Fung, so all these early kind of house crowd. Danny Rampling was Nicky Holloway's best mate. He was like his record carrier. So he had all these characters kind of looming around and then it was one day Nicky just came up to me in a gig I was doing at Southgate. which was one of the, where the royalty was, which was one of the big clubs of the day. And he kind of leant over the edge of the stage with his big nose. Oi, Tommy, you fucking wanker, you're wanging out with all these old bastards, you know, come and work with me. So, that's how, the way he talked. And then he, then I started working with him in, And he had a series of pubs in and around Bermondsey, which was the Swan and Sugarloaf, the Royal Oak. And then my Monday night kind of thing, I kind of let go of that. I was kind of starting to work more and more in London and I started working with him. So kind of, this was the kind of early days of rap. Well, after Sugarhill Gang and Grandmaster Flashby, like Sleeping Bag, Def Jam. that time and we were playing a kind of mixture of rap and then like rare groove and stuff like that and then garage like peach boys all that stuff from west end all the stuff that larry devan was playing all those mixes like shit petty band all that stuff all the Prelude stuff. And then, and it was just all that, it was just, yeah, just before house music. So mid-eighties I was working with Nicky really. So I kind of stopped running my own nights, I was more kind of his partner. Thank you. It was pre kind of the rave thing and warehouse parties but Nicky was quite progressive as um because he went out and got sites like London Zoo so we did you know we did many parties at London Zoo, Regents Park which was quite unheard of at the time and he did that History Museum. He was the first person I think ever did a rave in there with a big dinosaur and a whole great hall. Even calling it a rave. Then he did Weekenders and I came, you know, I did a, you know, the soul era was all about the Weekenders and the All Dayers and Nicky kind of did the first alternative kind of version of that. He did a place called Rockley Sands. It was when Boyzone started as a fanzine and I met Terry Farley and Andy Weatherall and all that. So it was all kind of, this pack was... kind of germinating in and around London in the mid 80s just as house music kind of kicked in so I gained a long answer to a short story so I used to run when I was really running clubs it was more like end of the 70s early 80s it was club nights it was me hiring a restaurant or a venue or a hall taking it over putting on a party And I did that a lot all over Kent, but I didn't really... I never did it in London. When I finally started getting gigs in London, I was hired. I was hired at the same time as the Falklands War was on, which was like 81, 82, 83, whatever year it was. I became resident at the Barracuda Club in Baker Street. That was my first experience of a London residency. With going to New York, was that a pretty eye-opening experience when you went there? Yeah, amazing. Why did you go there originally? Originally, I was just, it was me and... mine and it was 19 I can tell you exactly it was 1979 and it was Freddie Laker was this um he was like the Richard Branson of the late 70s and he bought a plane and he did the first charter airline so you could for the start 1979 you could fly to New York for $99 so me and my mate we got we got on the plane plane we went to New York and then we got um you just can't imagine like well I was 18 and getting to New York for the first time like in the 70s like it's just like so foreign compared to like you know going you know what later became my second home. And then it was like kids in a candy store. Everything was just a novelty, from the beer cans to the fucking currency. Everything was just so foreign and so much fun, because everything you'd seen in every film suddenly was in front of you. We even tried, I mean, I knew what Studio 54 was and we obviously tried to get in, couldn't get in, but went and stood outside. Eventually got a train down to Washington and went around and saw White House and all things and then ended up in Georgetown one night trying to see The Shining, I remember that movie, Jack Nicholson. ended up in this black area that we didn't realize. They were more frightened of us than we were then because they couldn't believe these two white guys had wandered into what has now become a very yappy upscale area, but in 79 was a ghetto. And then ended up getting trained all the way down to the Carolinas and ended up all down in Florida. It was a fantastic trip in about a month. And that was my first... discovery of America. It wasn't till... and then I went back the year after with a girlfriend and like this was after I'd left school and I was self-employed at that point or I was working for the magazine then maybe. It was really 83 when I really kicked into the kind of music world over there and started going. I mean Studio 54 had closed by then. I caught the end of the garage and I went to the Palladium a lot which was after Steve Rubell got locked up or whatever it was. Him and Schrager opened Palladium which is on 14th Street which is an incredible club as well. It's very much kind of Boy George, Marilyn era. And so I went there quite a bit. And Dance Theory I went to. Mark Kamers was resident. And that's when Madonna was kind of discovered. And then from 83, then on, I was going... started going sometimes monthly, paid for by the record company. Were there any clubs of that ilk in London around the same time that had the same sort of quality? Well in the mid 80s London it was kind of split. You had the kind of You had the remnants of what was left over from the soul jazz funk era. So you had what I would call proper clubs playing with a kind of obsessive... Their roots were in soul and jazz and the rare groove scene and it started to get into hip-hop. But you also had the trendy... clubs so you had the kind of fashion clubs that were kind of more being written about the face magazine and stuff like that and the velvet rope scene and that so you had the wag club um and you had um the beat route which is where the kind of new romantics kind of sprung out of like um where spandau ballet used to go and um steve i don't remember his name but the resident dj was a real kind of face steve lewis was the resident dj there um so you had yeah you had the kind of trendy kind of face associated kind of clubs that were still you know that were playing kind of more kind of I suppose you'd call it a Balearic mix of New York records, but they play the kind of Blondie and Rapture and stuff like that, as well as white boy funk records. So you were Capital FM for about four years? Four years, yeah, just under. And that was a massive thing for me because it was an amazing time to arrive on a very big radio station. I mean, Capital... back in the late 80s was a massive market share in London smashed radio on in terms of listenership and they'd had a I followed a guy called Greg Edwards who had created a legacy anyway of kind of Saturday night being you know dance music programming so I was kind of inheriting a very great a great position it was a time when Richard Park just took over the station who was a real massive influence on me in terms of my radio career a real kind of hands-on producer come you know head of the head of the station in terms of so i learned an awful lot about broadcasting from him. Like what? Just presentation skills and sequencing of music. I think I was a natural, but he got the best out of me. He's quite a famous guy here behind the scenes in the UK in terms of radio. He was never a BBC person, but in terms of the independent... He's still running it now. He went off and did other things. He ended up doing reality TV shows as a judge, a bit of an X Factor-ish as well. But he was a mentor of mine, definitely in terms of radio. And he really encouraged... It was like, Pete, you're at the cutting edge of my... Whilst I want a good breakfast show. and I want good daytime programming, I'm going to make what you do a really important part of the station as well. Because he recognised it was the beginning of the kind of the rave era. So he taught me that, you know, yeah, I could go on and just play music that was very, very trendy and appeal to a minority. but if I did it in the right way and I programmed it in the right way I could break records and I could own this area between the underground and the overground of bringing Cold Cut with Lisa Stansfield which was actually an underground record and actually making it a number one pop single. He really taught me that and I suppose that's the legacy of what my show stands for today which has always been It was never to end up with a show that was revered. 100,000 only. It was a show that was listened to by millions of people, which sometimes means that those 100,000 moan at you a bit, because they're the absolute purists that can't stand anything but the one thing all the time. And that's what he taught me, so that's what I really got from that time. That's kind of what I brought on to Radio 1. You mentioned the presentation of how to break a record into the charts. I wonder if you could expand on how that process worked back then or even today in a way. It's changed a lot today but up until the whole changes of the record business which has probably been the fundamental changes after Napster and everything like that has happened in the past. 8 or 9 years. The model for the 20 years before that was, you know, what maneuver, you know, build yourself into a position of influence. by being consistent and actually people caring about what you did and actually obviously people liking what you did and actually building up an audience and then you know well breaking a record is just getting behind the record and championing it for weeks months sticking with it maybe following the story as the act evolves or you know as the you know playing different mixes and stuff like that but really obviously just identifying records that I think could you know, exist in the underground. I mean, the perfect record is always the one that starts its life in the underground and then eventually becomes a number one single. That's the perfect record. And in terms of delivering, you know, because it delivers on every level. It's like, you know, people go crazy when they first hear it. They don't tend to tire of it after three or four. five months and they can almost be celebratory about it and not too po-faced when it becomes a huge hit you know yeah um so that's that was that's you know it's always been you know Obviously that thing happens to one in a thousand, one in ten thousand. But it's being there for those records and all the different stages in between. It's not that complicated. But what has changed is the way record companies deal with it. Back then, people would give me something months before release and then plan. I'd be the spearhead of their campaign and then it would probably tend to get played on me first. Then it would go out to all the club DJs, then it would build up and you'd get an awareness. they'd like to think they'd get to a point of inevitability amongst the industry where Radio 1 or all the radio stations would feel that they have to playlist it and then they playlist it and then it goes on the daytime radio for four weeks and then eventually it comes out. Well, how things have changed because now, no better exemplified than by Deadmau5 last week. He calls me up on Wednesday. He says, I've got a tune for you. I was like, I actually said, my thing to him was, you know, what context is it in, Joel? You know, me being an idiot, asking stupid questions, like, you know, is this part of an album? Is this for a tour? I think I said, will it be exclusive for Friday? Because I've got caught out lately, because everybody thinks they've heard something everywhere else all the time. and what he did is he made it Wednesday afternoon he called me up to give it to me he called up Beatport it was on sale by Wednesday night so I don't think it's ever happened before in the history of music but that's what's happening now it's well documented by what the major labels are doing they're giving it to Radio 1 like Lady Gaga born this way the day it goes to radio it's up on iTunes so the games change you but that doesn't mean you still can't make for entertaining radio and I think what's long been the case particularly in in, I would say, resident advisor world of the kind of music that your website champions is that probably that way of thinking has been in existence by accident or by just the way things have naturally evolved. For underground house music now and techno, you know, that... maybe Luciano's got it a few weeks before Ricciardo or something. But the thing is, tend to get it out and get discovered. And records can evolve in a very natural way. Butch record you know when it eventually blew up well it had actually been available for six months and that's what happens now and I think there's a great joy in that and that takes me right back to well that's the beginnings of when I first started DJing in the 70s came out in America it went to some guy at a shipping house he shipped it to England we discovered it but actually it's been out it's you know it's just obviously a lot slower process because you got there's only 10 copies in the world and you've got to find them and that's kind of what we're you know so I think the to make your job harder It's just changed in so many ways. The job's easier now in terms of the way you get music and the flow of music. I like the fact that it actually, whilst there might have been a time in the 90s where it probably would have come from someone like Reza. that they would have said, ah, Pete Tong, not that good because he just gets sent everything. He doesn't have to do anything. While there was an element of that. exclusivity and like it was all about what you had and what nobody else had I think this this this this kind of democracy now for the way it is is that is a real leveler because actually at the end of day still got be quite good at what you do you still got find the right tunes and what happens now I think in for as long as I can remember in just the age of the internet and connectivity through the DJ's biggest tool probably, less so in the last couple of years, but for the five years before that, it was like iChat and instant messenger. It was like all the DJs were on to everybody and you had this kind of milky way of music kind of moving around all the time. Now obviously it's Twitter and everything like that. But basically music comes at you every which way. Yeah, there'll always be that level that will be the record business level, which is, you know, the record companies sign it and their promotions people give it to you or the A&R people give it to me or the act give it to me. And there'll be that kind of proper cycle of... you know, we're working on this as part of a bigger campaign and you're part of the story. And then there's the... And then there's just DJs making music, sending them to me every day. I'll finish this track, send it to me, and then they'll start looking for a deal for it. And then there's that, what I kind of call the Berlin level, not that it's just Berlin, but it's, you've got that level of like, say, things like that Stablo 1998 record, or the Italo Johnson, only comes out on vinyl. You've got to go and buy it, then you've got to burn it in. So you've got that kind of still the old school kind of techno thing going around. Are you still going out and buying these mine only type things? Yeah, yeah, I do. I've tracked that down. Whatever it's called, Stablo 1998. Italo Johnson, I finally tracked him down. And the third one, and he sent me the first two as files. So it's fun, you know, it's just good. You know, there was that period with time where... Desolate and people like that were releasing They will send me the files and then when the vinyl would come out the best cut would only be on the vinyl So you get all that going, you know the game And then suddenly you find out you're playing the wrong track or you haven't got the track that everyone else has got. You can't take your eye off it. People are always doing entertaining stuff. Do you feel like there were moments in your career where you took your eye off of it for a minute and came back a minute later and were like, wait, what happened? It doesn't feel like it. I think at different times you're doing different things you know um I think obviously having the radio show continually helps keep the eye on the Yeah, I mean, the focus of the job changes, I would say. And depending on what else the radio station's doing, what I'm doing, what the world's doing, and what, without sounding too pretentious, is what the world needs. I think, you know, when I started on Radio 1... I was the only specialist show. Maybe there was one other. I think there was a soul show still on when I first started. But when you think 1991, I was the only outlet for anything that anybody called dance music. And now, 20 years later, I'm one of maybe 20 outlets and one extra. So I don't need to be... Then that whole thing of just... Jack of all trades in 1991 was... People were used to that. And even on a DJing level. You know, when I think back to what I played, you know, after the rave era, Nicky Holloway, we did three years of Saturday nights. Like when Jun was running and when Spectrum was running at Heaven with Paul Oakenfold, me and Nicky were doing Trip Made on Earth and Sin. We changed the name of it each year for three years, every Saturday at the Historia. And that took you through the kind of rave era, the new beat era, or whatever you want to call it. And then by '91 he bought a club called the Milk Bar Offset and then me and Dave Durrell were resident there for two years on a Saturday night, a year and a half. And still then, even after the Rave Era, we would play Depeche Mode, we would play reggae, we would play Ninja Man and Florigan, and we would play house music. minds were like it was still a lot that whole balleric thing of playing a mix of music was really open and that was very it was a very proper and accepted way to do things and we've gone through a journey in the last 20 years where there's been times when it's been incredibly niche, you know, you can only play trance music or you can only play this, you know. And I've always fought that a little bit on the radio and tried to make an entertaining radio show. But that's where people might have said you took your eye off the ball because you can't be all things to all men. And as more shows come on the radio, like obviously one of my only essential mix and then, you know, with Westwood a lot of rap all the way through the 90s I would always touch on if there was a rap record that came along that really touched everybody as there were so many then I felt in my job I came from that world so I would want to play early Jay-Z or, you know, Public Enemy or, you know, and drum and bass even, you know, I've got Annie before me, you know, I'll touch on the real headline game-changing ones if I can, but there's so much drum and bass on Radio 1 and dubstep as well, it's like, dubstep I'm finding now, I mean, if I hear Magnetic Man and I like it, I want to play it at least once on the show, maybe twice. But funny enough, he does get the haters out. Dubstep's the one thing I get. I get the tweets start, you know, start the fucking dubstep again. It's funny. You can be very polarised as a DJ. Karl Cox found it very hard in the rave era. He suddenly got associated with the Scottish raves and the White Glove Brigade and the breakbeat. Because he became so big with the hardcore scene. That's actually... It wasn't... What do you call it? Articulated like that at the time. One of the reasons he became so big in Europe was because no one would... him in the south of England. He just started playing in Germany and France and Spain and all that and became untouchable in those countries and still is. That's one of the reasons he's so solid with Europe is because he's a legend over there because he put so much work in. But actually, although he enjoyed it, it wasn't by design at the beginning. You know and obviously, you know so many DJs, you know, that's Sasha, you know Paul worked with for many years and John obviously got stuck with that proggy thing you know, Oki with the trance thing, you know, so, so yeah, I never seem to, I never got, I never became the champion of any one thing, you know. Is that a good thing? Or a bad thing? Or is it just a thing? Just a thing, I suppose. Some ways it gets, I find, you know, maybe people don't. take you seriously as a DJ, a club DJ or something like that. You know, as generations go by, I've always had to reinvent myself, I suppose. That's one of the reasons I'm always just trying to do things a little bit not exactly what people expect me to do. Because you've got to reinvent yourself and obviously I'm getting older and the average club audience... stays the same age and so you know people people grow up with me on the radio and then naturally think you're a radio DJ not a club DJ so yeah I imagine it's quite hard for people to you know they think you're gonna get your radio show or something well if you've been if you've done that nine or ten and you know and you listen to me in the back of your dad's car because he was a raver or something like that and then suddenly you get to 17, 18 and start going to clubs and you go and see Pete Tonga. Actually, Pete was quite kind. Now, 10 years ago, it might have been you're that radio guy. Actually, I would say more in the last 10 years, it's been you're a legend or you're this or you're that. And it's actually got better again. So it's... Actually, I'm saying all that. It's not really a problem now. Do you enjoy going to clubs still? Yeah, yeah. Obviously, you have the residency. No, I mean, to me, call me old-fashioned. The only reason I do the radio is because I'm a club DJ. That's the way my head I don't know what I'd talk about. So, for me it's always been about playing out first and foremost. And that's where I get my creative inspiration from. You could do... a certain amount just from... Well, I don't know if you could. I don't think you could do it genuinely. I'd like to think, yeah, I could still do radio shows of a type. I wouldn't have to be in clubs all my life. But from what I'm doing right now still, I still think it's really, really important. ♪
