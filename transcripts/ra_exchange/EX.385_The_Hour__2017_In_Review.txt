You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour! This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to the year-end edition of The Hour. I'm Ryan Keeling, RA's editor. We're trying something slightly different with our year-end rap podcast this time around. This is partly because we just couldn't manage to get everybody in the same place for a couple of hours, and partly because we wanted to bring you more music and more opinions than we have done in past years. So, over the next hour, you're going to hear from some small groups of RA's staff and contributors talking about their favourite music. artists from this year and we'll also have some individual contributors pitching in with their thoughts. The questions everyone answered were incredibly simple. What was your favorite track, album and performance of 2017? We're going to start off in London with myself, Martha, the hour's producer, and Aaron, RA's news editor. So Aaron, you asked me to ask you where you first heard this first track, so I'm assuming this is an incredible story. I'm actually gonna have to let you down because it's a fairly unremarkable story, but I first heard this song at Brilliant Corners, which is a listening bar, I guess, in East London where we do a monthly series of live stream events. And I found that we've been doing that all year and each time there's always one or two tracks that stand out. And on this occasion it was Zaltan from Antinode playing. And the song was called I Can't Connect by Celine Jillian. And, you know, when you sort of hear a song and you go rushing up to the DJ booth and you have to know what it is, I guess that was... the case here although I being a listening bar more sort of tiptoed up to the booth and whispered very quietly and asked what it was but the thing I like about this is that the track itself and the label kind of exists outside my network of you know PR and social media and labels and artists that I know I know very little about Celine and the label out on, Lexi Discs, other than that they're both based in Brussels. And the label releases arty little 7 inches. I guess if I was going to describe the track itself, it's a striking song, very sort of sparse arrangement with, I presume, Cillian's vocals. And a thing that I quite like about it, and it's on the Lexi Dix site, that they explain it's about women searching for their own ways in the boys' club of music, which I think makes it very timely. reflection of one of 2017's more important and welcome trends. Thank you. I can't connect. Martha, you've selected Zua and Ayesha Devi's Body of Light, which comes from Zua's album, right? Yeah, Zua's album came out this year on Planet Mew and Objects Limited. And it's called You Feel Anything. And this is just a track. that I keep on coming back to for my sets and just to listen to, which is kind of unusual because I find that go through music quite quickly and throw a lot of the stuff to the side. But this I kept on coming back to and it just is like really nice. Two friends making a song together. It's really beautiful. Aisha Devi is a Swiss artist and Zia lives in Berlin. And yeah, she came to visit me at Radar to like do a listening party for the album. And she's just telling me all this stuff about it as like a body of work and how. Like there's all these kind of secret messages like woven into like the fabric of the music that you wouldn't even know were there. Like she's recorded her own vocals and they're just like secretly in there. And there's stuff in loads of different languages that you might not pick up on. Yeah, it's all three. I can I can safely say that I listen. to it when I'm walking around town. I play it on the radio and I've played it in the club as well, which is really cool. I'm in the reflective club moment. Oh yeah. Yeah. But Zio's had like an amazing year and it's just really nice to see her just growing in strength and making great music. She's like signed with Disc Woman this year, which is a huge step. And she's played like... all around the world and then the album was just like topped it off yeah yeah agreed incredible album Hey, so. gone for PTU's A Broken Clock Is Right Twice a Day. This came out near the Kravis' Trip label towards the beginning of the year. I straight up think this was the best track from an incredible label, a label that had another incredible year. It's sort of no secret that I sort of consider 140 BPM techno to be quite slow. and this one came in at a very satisfactory 146. But obviously it's not just all about the tempo, I guess it's just really like an assembly line of sort of strange and surprising sounds. I really like the fact that lots of the elements in this track only appear once. You know, I could imagine sort of... a lesser or maybe more conservative producer like building an entire track around some of these single elements but everything's just popping in and out of the mix it gets seemingly at random another aspect that I really liked about this track was it was less than four minutes long I would encourage more people to make techno that's under four minutes. Just kind of get in, say what you need to say and get out of there. And I think overall, the thing that struck me about this one is it's kind of what I'm looking for from techno tracks these days. You know, we're talking about a style that, you know, comes with its kind of hang ups and it comes with this. and its arrangements and its formulas that have been in place for a long time, but music that can kind of still retain the utility, the dance floor utility of techno, but really go for it with the arrangements and the sound design and things of that nature is really impressive to me, and that's something that I'm looking for. So Aaron, you've selected Pauline Anna Strom's Trans Millennium Music as your album, which has just come out or is about to come out? Yeah, it's out now. Actually, it's sold out from most, if not all, UK outlets, I guess. But yeah, it was another really great year for the Revenge label and I think this was the sort of jewel in their crown, I guess, alongside the Visible Cloaks stuff. And it's a collection of music from Pauline that she released previously in the 1980s. I guess it sort of fits into the existing canon of like Bay Area experimental synth music, I guess, Suzanne Chiani. is another good example. Pauline herself was more influenced by Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze and artists like that. And you can really hear that in her music. She was born permanently blind. In her music, there's a really rich illustrative feel to the sound she creates. And that really kind of comes to sort of bear in the track titles, like the songs like Gossamer Silk, Rain on Ancient Keys. They're very evocative and she can make her synths sound like trickling water, for example. It's really beautiful. Thank you. Martha, I'm going to lead into your album selection by asking if you've been wearing your J-House bucket hat much? Yeah, and it's in my room so I can see it every day from every angle. So you've picked J-House. I've picked J-House. Am I allowed this one? Yeah, of course you're allowed this one. I've listened to something from Common Sense every day since it came out in May. I love it so much. In my Spotify wrapped, did you do that thing? No. You can go on your Spotify, it will tell you what you've been listening to the most and how much. you've been listening to it and four out of five of my tracks were J Hus songs from Common Sense and my number one artist was J Hus so I feel like I'm definitely up there with like the biggest fans I was really lucky and I got to hear some a few bits of the album before it came out and I was just like oh my god this is like really really something that I'm gonna love and I was so excited for it to come out and it came out Didn't disappoint, like love all the tracks on there, feel like all of them could be singles. Yeah, there's like a garage song on there, there's Afrobeat stuff, pop songs on there and more of like the rap stuff that shows the other side to him as well. And he's just been such an important character for 2017, in my opinion. because he's set so many trends, bringing words from his slang into the wider culture and vocabulary in the UK. Things that you hear on the album, you're like, oh my God, and then it sort of becomes a word. You've actually heard that development over the course of this year. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. And also because Form 696 was lifted, which was in the news and everything recently, and that meant that he could play in London for the first time. And yeah, that was a really special moment as well. So weird that he'd become such a big artist without ever playing his hometown, because he wasn't really allowed. So 2017 belongs to J-Hus, in my opinion. me up all the minivan you never see the way i came looking like a fisherman obviously man fire for hell man you see me up away i came looking like a fisherman she come playing all the fish is one of all the mission you know me you can look but don't touch it please because i'm the jealous type and that bothers me come on i smoked a fried egg i'm never slow fisherman slash Real fisherman makes doosh, got roll with a pinga, wanna Fisherman please don't get brother Okay, so I've gone for Arca's self-titled record on XL this year, and I would probably go as far as to say that this was the most bold and ambitious electronic music album, not just from this year, but probably from the past several years. I really think, for me, everything about this record, from the music, obviously, to the visual direction. to the videos, to the live show, really felt deeply, deeply inspired. And it felt like the result of a very, very clear and considered artistic direction. I think it's doubly impressive when you consider... Arca's journey as an artist up until this point, starting out six or seven years ago, making music that was kind of hip-hop inspired seemingly, but very distinctive and very wonky, moving into dense, very futuristic sound design, making records for Bukalela and Bjork and contributing to the Kanye West record. But then arriving near the beginning of this year with this, just with such a bold statement and to kind of debut the album or to give the first taste of the album through P.L., which was the opening track and to be introduced to this whole new direction where his most operatic vocal delivery is driving the record. paired with kind of a reimagining of his former self, his former artistic sonic signature. And I was just so impressed with the way these two things were able to harmonize, really. I think it was... incredibly brave to step out in the way that he did um you know both in creating this character that he did that sort of accompanied everything that was really like a core part of the record um but then to deliver deliver the vocals in the way that he did and do it so convincingly um yeah i mean i've used the word bold a couple of times already but yeah I really, really think that this was something special. Well, I guess Arca's live show is every bit as remarkable as his album. I mean, where does that rank for you in terms of what you've seen in 2017? it was probably admittedly my favourite live performance from this year but I'm not going to pick Arca in two categories obviously just to recap on the live show very quickly incredible very visually orientated Jesse Kander is a long term collaborator as very, very much a part of the show with his kind of strange and grotesque and sometimes borderline offensive visual direction, but Arca's embodiment of this kind of wounded Matador character and the stilts from the video and everything about it, he just embodies that character. the point where it feels just like an exaggeration or an extension of you know something that's been brewing inside him for a long time but anyway i didn't i didn't pick arca i've gone for uh donato dozzi's closing set from terraforma uh which is a small festival near Milan in Italy. This was, yeah, it was really the end of a fantastic weekend. I think one of the standout features from this festival is although there's multiple stages, there's one of them open at any given time. So the whole festival kind of sticks together. And this closing set was a surprise or maybe like an open secret that he was going to do this. But I think the thing that kind of floored me about the set was the fact that he. just through i don't know it felt at the time like a massive curveball maybe maybe he has played this style of music before but he kept pulling back a little bit so there's some quieter moments and then he would build things back up again he definitely played a gaba record and then closed it out on i think it was something on samurai i think it was a homemade weapons record What was the crowd's reaction to that set? I'm interested. Everybody was going absolutely nuts. And I think it's sort of testament to how well the festival is programmed that, you know... hearing drum and bass right at the end in no way stood out because we'd already experienced everything from like solo cello performances through to dubstep and techno and you know lots of other things that aren't connected to dance music so it's very much in the spirit of the festival i would say um tell me about your pick while you've got the microphone so My standout performance this year was a live show by Autumn Alpha at this year's Nyege Nyege Festival in Ginger, which is a couple of hours drive from Kampala. And they played on the main stage of the festival. And I guess to paint a bit of a picture, the festival takes place amid thick jungle in a resort that was built but never actually opened. the source of the river Nile. So that in itself is pretty mind blowing. And Autumn Alpha and his producer Leo Playing are pioneers of a sound that's called electro-acholi, which is, I guess, electronic update on traditional acholi music from northern Uganda. So Autumn took the stage in a really dazzling suit and started off by playing the Odoongoo harp. And then he and Leo kind of burst into their sort of fast-paced electro trolley music with Autumn singing and Leo handling the electronics. And I guess it's really quick, fun, joyous music, often in the sort of 160 plus BPM category. agree kind of your your sort of pace there ryan um and i i guess it was one of the of many standout um performances from from that festival and yeah i think the the nyongay nyongay crew are doing some pretty inspiring things yeah i was amazed at unsound uh just how quickly people took to a sound that they had probably literally never heard before I mean, was your connection to it just immediate and was the crowd's connection to it immediate? Absolutely. And yeah, it's kind of shows how rapid Autumn's Rise has been in that he, you know, the album Gulu City Anthems came out in February 2017. And by October, he was playing at Unsound. And that was the first time him and Leo had actually left Uganda. So it was really, you know, one of the year's really lovely success stories. Thank you. Martha, I actually hadn't heard of the DJ you've selected for your standouts. You see, that's a victory. But this was at Sonar Festival. Yeah, I'm really happy because I actually have seen loads of amazing DJ sets this year, which is really encouraging. And it was actually really hard to pick one to talk about because I saw Bjork DJ at the Corsica. Hyperdub night this year. That was banging. There's a lot of people that are envious of it. Yeah, and I also saw the other day Kalella at Heaven, and there's not been a Kalella show where I haven't shed a tear. So that's always great. It's like therapy for me. But the one I've actually gone for is a South Korean DJ. called Min and I saw her play at Senar in Barcelona which is probably my favourite festival anyway. Min, she plays really often at Cake Shop and she's supported people like Jesse Lanza and Kablam and Bok Bok at Cake Shop but yeah it was really cool to see her playing like an international set at Sonar for me it was just like exactly what I wanted from the festival just like embodied in a set and it was like this blend of like sounds that I'd never heard mixed up with something that's like maybe more abrasive stuff balanced out with like a pop vocal that you might recognize to make sure you're still okay just like still hanging in there and she was playing some footwork and also some UK stuff as well so it was just like a really nice rounded thing and it was just nice to see someone who's like a resident DJ building up from nothing to being able to play at a festival in Europe I thought that was really cool do you think that balance is quite tricky to get right at times I guess I'm asking just because you're someone who personally can play, you know, quite strange and abrasive and out there music. But is that a tricky balance? Yeah. You know, is that something you're looking for in DJs? Yeah, 100%. That's like, yeah, that's like something I think about so much. Like I want to be challenged from a DJ set, but I also want to have fun. and I want someone to take me somewhere that's part of my brain that I haven't been to before, but also I want to be okay. I want to hear Rihanna every now and again just so that I know that I'm still good. So yeah, I thought she navigated that really well. It was really inspiring to see. Also nice to see someone that's not necessarily a producer as well just doing really well just from their DJing. I think that's been kind of a theme for this year. seen more people just concentrating on the art of DJing I guess. We are here in Resident Advisors Los Angeles office. It's Andrew Rice, RA's North American. American editor and myself, Matthew McDermott. I'm a staff writer for Resident Advisor and one of the highlights of this year was having Andrew relocate to Los Angeles. It's been very nice having you here in the office. I moved from Canada to the US. Now I'm here. It is warm. It's December and we're excited to do this year-end wrap-up. So let's just launch into things here. For your track, you picked a Canadian artist. As I do. Can you tell us a little bit about CL's Elevate, the go-off mix? CL's a kind of like rising Toronto artist in my eyes. She's been a pretty notable DJ in Toronto for the last two years. three years she plays a lot of electro and progressive house center sets often a lot of old stuff too which kind of sets her apart less so now as more people get onto that sound but for a while especially in Canada that really made her stand apart And she started producing this here for the first time. First, just for fun, a few tracks on SoundCloud. And then she booked Shanti Celeste for her party in Toronto called Work in Progress. And Shanti heard the tracks and immediately signed them. And so this is from her first release on Shanti's little peach discs. I love Elevate because I feel like it really encapsulates a bunch of the different trends in dance music in 2017. There's a bit of electro. There's some... great beat, there's some proggy melodies, and it's all done in this really nice, warm, sprightly style, really catchy, very memorable. Yeah, it was just an instantly likable track, and it stuck with me from the minute she put it on her SoundCloud. So I waited about six months for it to come out, and it's totally worth it. And you also enjoyed the debut. released from shanti herself correct yeah that was another highlight this year um kind of like crazy drum programming that almost sounds like breakbeats but isn't really good sense uh your pick was an old track from 1983 how do you say the artist's name i guess it's pronounced larry chernikov but i haven't heard of him prior to this year when the miracle steps compilation came out that was compiled by J.D. Twitch, as well as Fergus Clark, an extremely young record digger and DJ from Glasgow who runs the 12th Aisle label. I thought the compilation was great in general, but this one was a revelation to me. It kind of struck a balance between spiritual jazz, kind of like kraut rock, Americana combo of an artist named Henry Flint. and also John Hassel's Fourth World Theory, which was what the compilation was based around. And, you know, that theory kind of posits that combining indigenous musical traditions with modern technology can form like a placeless music for imaginary worlds. But in the context of the The context of this compilation, Larry Chernikoff is sort of from this like GeoCities, CD only, kind of like deeply uncool end of American New Age and world music. But it sort of spelled out the promise of a compilation like this and record digging in general. Like if record collectors are purveyors of... secret histories they had the power to recontextualize tracks and um you know this has been something that i've returned to time and time again this year because it really doesn't sound like anything else why do you think fourth world resonated so much this year it was definitely a big year for fourth world music yeah there have been various theories about why ambient music writ large has resonated so much this year. But I think it's sort of the combination of world music and ambient music. both sort of enjoying kind of peak popularity at this point. I think that it's a natural, a natural step. People, people want to hear, um, you know, music from an early homemade electronic era, uh, that integrates like odd sort of microtonal different tuning bizarre influences that still manages to sound futuristic and there happen to be a lot of those records I don't think that we're anywhere near the bottom of the well as far as that goes Thank you. Moving on to albums, you picked an album from Northern Electronics' mainstay, Varg. Its mouthful of a title is... Nordic Flora series part three, Gore-Tex City. Varg on his own is just an incredible talent. He can produce remarkably fast. He makes techno that sounds very rich and melodic and lush with an iPad. I think the standout thing about his music right away is that it doesn't just sound like typical dark, droney, tunneling techno. It always has personality to it. And I think that this album... which is the third in a series of three of his best releases, really let his personality come out. He's a very boisterous person on social media, has a very funny and sometimes controversial feed. The personality on the album really solves the techno album conundrum where you have an album full of techno tracks all in a row and no one wants to listen to that. It doesn't really make a good album. Varg incorporates slam poetry from Chloe Wise, some singing and rapping from artists like Young Lean, and all this kind of pop and spoken word interpolations in the music, and yet it never leaves his kind of post-punk-y techno. palette and I think the album flows really well some parts that are kind of ridiculous but still work there are references to like champagne and money and all the things that Vark likes but it's still in this very mournful lonely sound palette which is influenced by his traveling lots of field recordings of trains and airplanes and such and I just like I kept putting back to it throughout the whole year which is rare for a techno album just because it has so much imagination and personality in it for me a lot more serene and quiet, but from one of my favorite artists, the French artist Colleen, called A Flame, My Love, A Frequency. Yeah, this was interesting. I had heard friends that are more into post-rock and that sort of stuff really praise Colleen's music in the past, but... I wasn't extremely familiar, but this one, when it got sent over from Thrill Jockey, I just immediately became obsessed with it. I listened to it almost every morning for a month. For a while, it was almost my default record that I listened to. Trying to figure out why that occurred is a little more difficult. It was her first electronic record. She literally made it with miniature instruments, specifically the critter and guitar, a pocket piano, as well as a septa box and a couple of Moog pedals. In that sense, the songs feel a bit like taking a peek at a complex... diorama whereas Mark Smith says the connections between nature time and the mind are blurred they're almost interchangeable but what what I think is really interesting about the record is this is like extremely technical music when I saw Colleen perform live she had these large sheets printed out and she dialed in the settings on her pedals as well as the critter and guitar ease painstakingly before every song, but she's working through extremely profound feelings in these very sort of light, miniaturistic songs as well. That was an odd balance, and I found the record to be incredibly complex and rewarding for that reason. It's also a new sound for her. I think you reviewed her last one, and that was sort of her interpretation of kind of sunny dub sounds, and she's rated Parisian music libraries for samples in the past. She's taken a long break from music. This is an artist who has a distinctive voice no matter what approach or what equipment they're using. Have you forgotten that I, the red fox, Now let's talk about live performances. I heard you raving about the Sophie performance that happened at the Terragram Ballroom here in LA as part of Red Bull Music Academy's festival. I wasn't sure what to expect. The room was black at first, very quiet, nothing was happening. And then the minute the music started, it was just a blinding strobe light in like a stadium-sized LED screen in a theater. And the effect was immediately overwhelming, almost surreal. I never realized how sub-heavy Stovey's music was. Obviously, it works in a club, but seeing the strobe light synchronized with the kick drum, it was such an intense, rapid experience. And it really like brought home to me what an amazing producer Sophie was because there were all these new songs like Ponyboy which just came out as a single last week and a few other new ones that are gonna be on the album Where you have these incredibly kitschy high-pitched saccharine melodies paired with this brutal almost industrial low-end the performance had peaks and valleys through these kind of industrial workouts to ballads with like a ballads and duets with beautiful ocean visuals and then back to the pure black and white strobe light and it was just like an immersive almost like performance art piece more so than a concert and It wasn't clear that, except for the vocals, anything was live at all. The equipment didn't look plugged in. It was all very choreographed, but again, it was like performance art, and it was one of the most inventive and impressive electronic music performances. as I've probably ever seen. It was amazing how you can make electronic music that's recorded and produced already feel so live and theatrical without even doing that much to it. Just with the visuals, choreography, I mean, invented music to begin with, it was an experience for sure. You made a tweet earlier this month where you said, I pity anyone who still doesn't realize that Sophie is one of the most visionary producers of our time. This isn't the first year that Sophie has been a hyped artist that's been discussed in year-end roundups. this year different? Well, it was partly that performance which made me realize that she is so much more than just the PC music thing and the kind of consumerist like Dada parody that PC music engages in it's it's much more her own thing with crazy contrast and sound and vocals and melodies and there is some commercialism commentary there but it's also like more personal more sexual and i just the sounds that she makes and the sound she puts together are unreal and hearing like 10 to 12 of them in one show like who is this person what's in her mind what's how does she make this music i was just blown away and everything else she's been involved in this year like the Charlie XCX tracks, some other stuff I found out that she's been involved in recently. I'm always shocked by her and impressed by her every time. Laurel Halo is an artist who's been touring live a lot the past two years, including with percussionist Eli Kessler lately, but you picked one of her DJ sets as your favorite performance this year. Yeah. I think that in most roundups this year, you'll hear about Laurel Halo's critically acclaimed and excellent album, Dust, or her live show, which was also fairly next level and featured her in... a moderately improvised collaboration with Eli Kessler. But what I think might go overlooked is that I feel like Laurel Halo really came into her. as a DJ this year. I believe both of us were in attendance at an actress show that happened in the Globe basement. Indeed, I was there. The venue was cool, kind of novel, but subpar sound made for an actress set that was maybe even more inscrutable than Mr. Cunningham would have liked it to be. But then Laurel kind of wandered in wearing a trench coat and braids and just completely dismantled the place. I'd say that her sound is like kind of a mix of the sort of livid-y sound, Hesel, Axis, mixed with Hyperdub, mixed with this sort of... insouciant attitude towards genre that the Experimental Club kids have mixed with her upbringing near Detroit, mixed with her Berlin community radio show. And it just all really came together this year. Very little 4-4. She's playing tracks that you might know. that sound different in her hands, a lot of energy. And I think it's also really on display in her Disc Woman mix. So I... I found her approach thrilling and I know that she's been sort of working towards having the DJ career as well as the live and solo production career sort of become separate things. And I think that really snapped into focus this year and she's just had an impressive year in general. you know, to come along so far as a DJ as well as a live performer is incredibly impressive. Yeah, I mean, I remember that show and, you know, I wouldn't think of Laurel Halo as a DJ first and foremost, but it was really impressive. And it was really impressive how she blended so many different genres and went from point A to point B so naturally as well. There was no clashing. It wasn't surprising. It was also smooth. And I was really impressed with that set as well. Hi, this is Sybil. I'm part of the editorial team here at Resident Advisor. My track of the year is Every Single Fish in the Pond by Jass. This is the first track of her album Weightless. Okay, there's something quite cinematic about this track. It's quite an amazing album opener with great use of space and tension. It builds up for the first few minutes of the track and then about two-thirds of the way through it changes completely. As soon as I heard it I could immediately hear her influences in it as I got to see her DJ at the waiting room in London, I think it was in March and it was really rainy that night and not many people came, it must have been about 10 people but her set was one of the most bold and daring DJ sets I've seen this year and she played a track that night by Waytowsend, quite raw noisy dub. And I hadn't really heard anything like that until I heard this track on Jass's album and the rest of the album. I think she's definitely an artist to watch and I was very impressed with her production. Thank you. Okay, so my album of the year I actually didn't hear until quite recently and it passed me by the first time around when it came out and it's the Mono Non Aware Comp by Pan. Lots of different artists on that. This year I found myself particularly drawn to ambient music in general. Perhaps it's been the generally chaotic state of the world and just a fatigue with casual listening to club music, but I've been looking for alternative sounds and listening to quite a lot of ambient music. And for this comp, Pan gathered an array of artists associated with the label and who are usually known for their cutting-edge, sort of deconstructed club music, but for this comp brought together all of their different ambient creations. And yeah, I was in the car with my friend and we were driving around London and it was raining at night and he put this comp on and I guess maybe it was the settings but I really it really touched me and I've since kept returning to listening to it standout tracks for me were actually Sky H1's Hewitt and the track by Havad and Pan Daijin called Zao Hua check it out the whole thing's great you My performance of the year was seeing Pharmacon play live at the Mimelavn Main at Norberg Festival in the summer. I was trying to think of performances and this one was an absolute standout. Maybe it was the combination of the setting and the very visceral performance. but I hadn't really seen anything like that before. And noise music isn't something I'd normally find myself listening to, but her performance was extremely physical. She had the mic and she was running around this abandoned mine, which is extremely tall, and you look up... and there's just stairwells crawling around the inside of this tower and there was lots of smoke and red light and she's running around up and down the stairs going in and out of the crowd. She's got a table covered in electronics which she's quite aggressively grabbing at and yeah, it was very amazing. Well, thanks for coming, guys. I'm Will Lynch, the Associate Editor of Resident Advisor, and I'm here with Carlos Hawthorne. Hi. Angus Finlayson. Hello. And Emma Robertson. Hi. All right, so we're going to talk about some of our favorite records and performances from 2017. I guess I'll get the ball rolling. and talk about DJ Sprinkles at Unsound, which was one of the definitive performances of the year for me. It was a DJ set. Long story short, I'd seen Sprinkles before and always really liked her DJ sets, but in the past, there was always a feeling of... the situation kind of calling for something a little more clubby, or at least the way it seemed to me anyway, is maybe other people in the room were wishing it was a bit more, had a bit more oomph. But this was, I guess, on the second or the last night of Unsound at Hotel Forum. which that context is a little bit more people are willing to allow for a slightly more artistic performance. And the atmosphere completely worked for it. It was a kind of DJ set where it could have been all her material, kind of wispy, ghostly sounding house with the occasional dramatic spoken word bit. And everyone was just kind of like lightly grooving to it. Everyone was completely on the level with this sort of mellower vibe. I guess seeing her in that situation of like, you know, Unsound has very intentional programming and putting in this headlining slot at the main bit kind of made me reflect on how DJ Sprinkles is really definitive artist of our time. Kind of got everyone thinking about the idea of being a trans DJ, trans artist a few years before that actually became. such a relevant topic more broadly. And of course, the sound of her music, this sort of club music, but with a level of kind of depth and emotional content that is generally kind of unusual. That too felt kind of prescient to me. Carlos, what do you got? I went for Night Moves at Nat Digital. Night Moves is Jane Fitz and Jade Seattle, two London-based DJs. And yeah, I kind of caught the last two hours as a three-hour set. I'd been watching Jeff Mills over at the main stage, and when I wandered into the second tent, the kind of place was bubbling nicely. It wasn't packed, but it was kind of going pretty well. But I spoke to some friends, and they told me that... After the previous set, which was Job, Yobsy and Wilhelm, which was kind of big on hits, they played Madonna's music, among other things. When Night Moves came on, the place totally... emptied out so they kind of had to spend the first hour kind of building things up I don't know you know we talk a lot about sets at the moment and we champion variety and people that move between genres and tempos and all this but it was really nice just to kind of have just to see two DJs doing the kind of house and techno things so so well and this kind of restrained euphoria that they do which is just a beautiful just combination of amazingly kind of supple agile bass lines and really nice drums and rhythms and then these really nice melodies that you can just catch on to. Red Bull recorded the set and they put it live for a kind of really cruelly short amount of time and it's now not available anymore. But yeah, it was just a really kind of memorable and enjoyable time. My pick was or is DJ Bus Replacement Service at Free Rotation. So yeah, obviously from the name you can already tell. You're kind of in for a certain kind of ride there. It felt a bit like my world colliding, seeing this set, because she is an artist who has performed at Bangface, which is, along with Free Rotation, the other festival that I go to pretty much every year. There, what she does, or the idea of humour and silliness in music, I guess, is a bit more... established there's silliness involved in free rotation but the music itself tends to be relatively sort of straight faced i would say she's sort of like a sort of rare groove digger selector but for like reddit jokes or something like that um her sets see sort of collages of like youtube parodies of famous songs kitschy, sort of easy listening, snippets of stand-up comedy and stuff like that. And she played kind of early on the Saturday evening, free rotation, and people started off, I think, quite puzzled, but willing to kind of see where it would go. And then by the end, there was a sort of climax moment with a Gabba and then a Trap remix of Hava Nagila. And I think by that point, people were going pretty wild. She also performed in this... like genuinely sinister Kim Jong-un costume, complete with this like rubber head that would sort of bob around. as she got more into it, which definitely added something. I think pissing yourself laughing on the dance floor is not an experience that comes around every weekend and I would highly recommend it. So my pick was Suzanne Ciani live at Terraforma. Terraforma is an experimental music festival in Milan, just outside of Milan, in the forest. And I was going to pick a more dance floor orientated set, but I think that these kind of ambient experimental sets or performances move me or speak to me a little bit more than just a regular DJ set dance floor vibes. But so we were kind of waiting for her to come on all day and she played in the forest at sunset. And I think, I mean, there's nothing really more special than seeing an artist that you love so much. playing in such a kind of magical time and space. And she's amazing. I mean, she's older. She's like one of the oldest performers at the festival. She's in her late 70s now. she just has so much grace with her instruments. I mean, she's had so much experience working with a bukla. And so seeing that live is really something special. She gets so into it too. Her movements are really deep and she's dancing and we're all kind of crowded around her sitting in the field. Yeah, she just, it's like a thunderstorm, her music. It's so... deep and so intense. And at the end, she actually blew the power at the festival. So it kind of got cut off really quickly. But everybody was just super into it. And yeah, it was great. Shall we do albums? I picked John Mouse's Screen Memories, the LP he put out this year. Something I like about him in general is that he's quite confusing or he's quite strange. There's a weird tension between drama of his delivery and the seeming meaninglessness of his lyrics. And then there's also the weird effect that somehow it's very easy to enjoy as just normal, catchy music. I did an interview with him that for... practical reasons just didn't work out. We ended up having very little time and there wasn't really any way to use it. But something he said that really struck me was that he considers there to be zero element of comedy in his music at all. And definitely no irony. He considers each of these songs to be really about something. For instance, with the song Touchdown, which... It's the one that had a video come out and it basically just says go for the touchdown. Oh, yeah the touchdown And that's basically it. I asked him like so is that song about football and he said no But it's about something and he sort of thought about it He was like it's kind of just about how sometimes you just got to go for it, you know For each of his songs, he has some sort of explanation like that. But I think that sort of explains the strange energy to his music. I mean, it sounds like someone doing karaoke to a Joy Division song. It doesn't sound serious. But then at the same time, you can tell something about it is he's not kidding around, or this is sincere music, oddly enough. And just the context of the album is so weird. They spent nearly five years making it alone in a house in rural Minnesota and learned how to build synths in order to create a more interesting sound and then admitted that the result was not any different from his previous albums. The whole thing was kind of a wasted exercise. But I hadn't heard anything quite like that in a long time. Outro Music Carlos? I went for DJ Sports' debut album, Modern Species, which came out on a firecracker. Sports is Milan Zaks, his brother is Natal Zaks, who some people might have known as DJ Central, and together they kind of... head up this crew of very talented producers from Aarhus in Denmark. They're associated with the label Regalbau and then I think Central and Sports Run help recordings. This is probably the most high-profile record to come from the stable so far. And yeah, it's just a really beautiful, atmospheric record. I'd draw parallels. with the SW album that came out on Sood at the end of last year. Kind of humid sounds, this kind of rainforest atmospheres and this kind of very fluid approach to genre. There's ambient, techno, house, jungle in there. And you kind of get this kind of very 90s feel. They do a very strong job of replicating the vibe of those tunes. And yeah, something that Angus said actually in his review was that something about the songs feel quite aimless. They have this kind of balmy summer feel that I really like. They don't feel at all formulaic. They kind of are always shifting in this kind of really special way. And just for whatever reason, I found myself just kind of returning to it again and again just to kind of get introspective. The idea of an introspective Carlos Hawthorne is extremely tantalising. My pick is an album called Assemblage by Visible Cloaks. who are an American duo. I guess these days it's quite hard to pinpoint records that come out which really sound modern in the sense that they really couldn't have existed before. But I sort of feel like this album is one of those this year. I mean, it does have very clear influences. which are kind of rooted in the past, so particularly the Japanese ambient scene around like Yellow Magic Orchestra and related artists in the 80s and the 90s. That whole world has had its own kind of resurgence recently. One of the artists from that world, Miyako Kuda, features on this album as well as a singer. But the way Visible Cloaks have kind of approached this sound, they've really updated it with modern tools and a modern sensibility. Particularly they use these kind of super lifelike... software emulations of acoustic instruments that until recently computers didn't really have the processing power to sort of do these. quite this level of polish and they give the album a really kind of uncanny valley sound. They also use like sound to midi transformation techniques of some kind and they say they use like chance operations as well so there's some element of sort of randomness in the way that they arrange the songs. But I think also another thing that's modern about it is just the way that it relates to It's subject matter, so we've had lots of discussions in the last couple of years about this idea of cultural appropriation and when it is or is not respectful to borrow from or take influence from different cultures. And their response to this is, so it's a reassemblage, it's not an attempt to better the thing that they're taking influence from. or to exoticize it or to mimic it but in some way to sort of make a companion piece to it that's coming from a very different place and I think that they're quite successful in that attempt Noboru mitsu Karada wo meguru Umi kara Karada no naka no mizu wa umi So my pick was Laurel Halo Dust, which came out on Hyperdub earlier this year. I interviewed Laurel and what struck me about her kind of story of this album was that she said that she knows she's doing something right in the studio when it makes her laugh, when she has a kind of sound that's really weird or something really strange that makes her laugh or makes her smile. And I think you can really see that on this album or hear that on this album. I love how weird this record is. I think that the kind of the sounds that she creates and the vocals, everything is a bit kind of off kilter. There's bits where the... vocals are kind of out of key or out of harmony with each other. And it's just a really strange sounding album that I just keep coming back to. And I think that Laurel Halos just had a really great year in general. I mean, she played this album live at Loop earlier this year, I guess in November. And her drummer, Eli Kessler, who featured on this album quite a bit, I think is fantastic as well. And yeah, this is just a record that I keep coming back to. I love all the tracks. I think the vocals are kind of soulful without being too poppy. Generally, I just think it's a really great piece of music. For my track I chose July 5th by the Welsh producer now based in London named Leif Knowles or simply Leif. Pretty much as long as I've known about Leif I think he's been getting better and better as a producer and a DJ. He just keeps going further into this. very particular sound that I think of as, I guess it's kind of psychedelic, but not in like a druggy way. It's just like really rich and kind of shimmering and kind of surreal. The textures are really inspired and so are the grooves. And this track, July 5th, it was on the first release on his new 10-inch series. But for me, July 5th. kind of embodies a lot of the things that I look for in music these days where kind of groovy and easy get into you could definitely play it at a party but it has this kind of lurching half time rhythm that very much stands out from everything else and just these sort of down the rabbit hole feeling of everything's kind of weird and upside down and coming out at strange angles but somehow the effect is that it's nice like it's not disorienting or trippy even per se it's just sort of like has this kind of exquisite otherness to it that I really like. I think it's his best track he's done that I've heard. The only possible exception being his next record that's about to come out. I went for a track called Who Me by Laps. Laps, their full name is Ladies As Pimps. They're a duo from Glasgow. Lady Two Collars, who's in Golden Teacher, and Suzuki, who's part of another duo called Organs Of Love. And they met at Green Door Studios, which is this kind of famous... music studio in Glasgow. It's a golden teacher who record their music there. And they met on a kind of, on one of their courses that they run for unemployed 16 to 25 year olds. This was back in 2012. They did an EP in 2014. And this is their follow-up to that. Just full disclosure, I know Suzuki from back in the day. She's a friend of an ex-girlfriend. And she's always been into, yeah, just really interesting music and doing things in a very DIY way, kind of big into analog gear and has this kind of anarchic vibe about her. And this really comes through in this LAPS record. You have... Lady Two Collars has this really kind of powerful voice. And then this track in particular just, I mean, the whole EP is great. There's five tracks on there. But this track in particular just strikes that really kind of, for me, like wonderful sweet spot between like weird and poppy and kind of, yeah, pop and post-punk and dubby and this kind of... I don't know, it just kind of brings all these elements together. There's a lot of humour in there, there's these kind of very catchy French lyrics, a little bit pompous. I don't know, it's just got a really kind of fun vibe. I mean, I mostly was listening to it kind of on my own, and then I know that Ben Ufo had been supporting it. They'd done, I think they featured on one of his Hesel Audio shows, and he played a track on Radio 1 But I was still surprised to hear him play it in a set. It was a band, your phone, Blaouan, again at NAC Digital. And, you know, it was a lot of very linear house and techno tunes. And then suddenly there was this kind of really kind of quite extravagant, whatever you call it, pop dub post-punk thing. And it just really, you know, galvanized the main stage and brought everyone together. And it was a really nice moment. My pick is Stand Up by Pangea. Pangea is obviously a really well-respected British producer. He's made lots of big tunes over the years, but I don't think he's ever really had... sort of a crossover hit in the way that for instance his fellow Hessel Audio founder Pearson Sound has every now and then made a track that you really hear absolutely everywhere I think that sort of suits Pangea's musical personality somehow that he tends to do things that are just a little bit more spiky or like unwelcoming and take a little bit more work to sort of get in under the surface of them but this track is his sort of big crossover moment I've heard it absolutely everywhere this year and often popping up in quite unexpected kind of sets and contexts. It's a remix of a, built around a Lolita Holloway acapella, so Stand Up is the name that this acapella got, I think when it was then sampled in or used in 90s House, but it's originally from a track from 1976 called Dreamin' and yeah. This vocal is sort of part of the repertoire of dance music samples. But Panjshir does something quite fresh with it. He sort of like slices it and stutters it and zeroes in on like certain bits of it that have a certain flair or a certain sort of quality and then sticks this like banging. breakbeat underneath. And yeah, it just really reminded me of a lot of Hessel Audio's best moments in that it's very unusual and very clever, but also really simple and direct. And yeah, it gave me sort of pleasant flashbacks to hearing a lot of the things that they were doing five or more years ago. So my pick is do decor or D'Oro D'Core by Jan Jelenik, which came out on his album Loop Finding Jazz Records, which is a reissue that originally came out on Scape in 2001 and has now been re-released on Jan Jelenik's label, Faitish. Yeah, I love this whole record. I mean, I can listen to it doing anything, writing, reading, cooking. Just being around the house, I think it's such a perfect record for just kind of not exactly background music, but something to listen to while you're doing something else. I think that the repress of this just sounds so incredible. I mean, just in terms of all the different sounds that come out, and I think the grit and kind of raw honesty of this music comes out a lot in this repress especially. I think there's something really simple. about this track in particular but it's always the one when I'm listening to this record that I always kind of unconsciously kind of bob along to or start dancing to a little bit I think it has enough of like an interesting rhythm despite being a kind of more ambient atmospheric track. I think this whole album is like quite mellow and chilled but still so interesting to me. It reminds me a bit of like Akufen, My Way, that kind of first micro sampling album which I also really love. Every time you listen to it you kind of hear a new layer of something that comes out in this record. You're listening to RA's year-end edition of The Hour. Our tech editor Mark Smith got into a cupboard and recorded his thoughts from Sydney, Australia. So this might seem like a little bit of a cop-out, but my... release track live set were all by the same person this year. It's a German artist based out of Hamburg called Christoph de Bae. He is probably best known for releasing music on Alec Empire's label back in the 90s and it typically gets called things like breakcore dark ambient, things like that. He's had a long career, but he released an EP on a label called Viz, V-I-S, a Hamburg label run by Nina and Good News, who have been running a party out of Golden Poodle for a long time. Great DJs in their own right. But Grim Zenith... Basically, it seems like a lot of people who you'd think would have known about Babylon's early work kind of didn't and this record seems to have introduced a lot of people to him which is great because it's just a fantastic record even though he sounds like he has things to do with breakcore the record is almost more drum and bass but it's not slick in the way that a lot of modern drum and bass is It's break heavy and has the similar sorts of sub bass to drum and bass, but it's coming at it from a much more DIY approach without playing into the aesthetic of low fineness or anything like that. You know, in the whole year you get passed through so much different stuff and this just kind of obviously felt a step of everything to me. Both the tracks on the A side could be contended for sure. And I saw him play at Sameheads in Berlin in, I think it was June. And it was maybe almost two hours long. All his own music, I assume it sounded like it. But he's just this guy where if he had a platform, like a media platform and was playing trendy festivals, he would be... the toast of the town, but he's just been kind of quietly doing his thing for ages. And hopefully he gets a bit of momentum out of this release and having, you know, attention from some younger audiences and hope that translates to things for him next year. Hi, this is Holly, staff writer speaking to you from my home in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. I am very proud of my adopted city, so I've selected a track from a singer-songwriter from Rotterdam who's had a breakout year in 2017. She's called Sevda Liza, originally from Tehran. She moved to Rotterdam at an early age, but has only been involved in music for the last few years. Before that, she was a professional basketball player. I've picked a track off her debut album, Ice On, which was released in August. The whole thing has been produced by Mucky from Rotterdam grime crew Noiseboys, who recently teamed up with Wiley. The track is called Human, a smouldering ballad which, to me, is about looking past the external labels we give ourselves and the ones others give to us, because at the core we are all flesh. bone, skin, soul, human. thousands of people around the world, I was gearing up for one party and one party only this year, and that was Thunderdome. Admittedly, the thought of raving with 40,000 people was intimidating to say the least, but once I got in there and shaved my head, I felt immediately at home. I was there till the bitter end. I was the last person to leave. I saw many great sets that night, but the one that impressed me the most for the sheer amount of prep that went into it was DJ Promo's 25 years of hardcore set on the main stage at 2am. As that implies, he chronologically steamrolled his way through 25 years of hardcore music in just under an hour. There were stone-cold classics, Thunderdome anthems, sing-alongs and furious tempo changes. It all came with a stellar pyrotechnic show featuring fire, lasers, video and a troupe in chemical suits and masks, bearing flares and blasting the crowd with fire extinguishers. Promo ended the set bang up to date with a track from the outside agency called Locker Room Talk sampling Trump's now notorious pussy grabber speech. East London rapper and poet Kojay Radical has made my album of 2017. It's called In God's Body, released in September as a follow-up to last year's outstanding 23 Winters, which was written around a conversation with Kojay's father. In God's Body delivers powerful polemics on race, identity and social politics. but it is also a record about everyday life, friendship, love. The productions vary in style from Aggie trap to blissful sing-alongs. There's also a strong rock element. He actually performed with a full band at a festival downtown in Rotterdam over the summer, and it made as much sense as when I saw him again with his DJ at Progress Bar in Amsterdam. His album is thoughtful, provocative and deeply engaging, featuring collaborators like grime MC Getz, R&B singer Shola Rama, plus a spoken word contribution from British actress Michaela Cole, best known for her BAFTA award winning comedy Chewing Gum. I can't wait to hear more from Kojay in the years to come. Either way, I'm here forever in God's body. I'm him, baptized in brown liquor and wrapped in draped in my new rags. Speak the fiction. Please keep your hands in the resistance. If you are prepared for the heat, then leave the kitchen Too many chefs on the stove don't suit the picture Gorillas fall from the trees like I am Caesar Blood, sweat and tears in my eyes for non-believers I can't keep it down, so fear in my demeanor Every day I pray for the snakes and glory lasers I learned how on my own, now I'm the teacher I run circles around Come follow me, come follow me, come Cage wears those, sing song freedom You were the last to know where I'm from I've been left alone on my ones I came back 3-5-0-3 I smell blood, no I can't run Man down, man down, run, pump, pump Like man down, man down
