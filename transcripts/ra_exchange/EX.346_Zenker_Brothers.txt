Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor of Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with the Zenker Brothers. The duo from Munich are probably best known for their signature combination of breakbeats and booming techno. There are consistently influential presence on the scene, and their label Illion Tape in particular enjoys a strong following, thanks to much-loved releases from the likes of Steny, Andrea and Ski Mask. Those producers joined the Zenker brothers at Berghain last month to help celebrate 10 years of Alien Tape, and the brothers Marco and Dario came to speak with Matt Unicombe the following day about their unlikely rise to the top of the techno pile. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with the Zenker brothers is up next. So how was last night? Yeah, it was great. We arrived around 1 to the club. We landed in Berlin at 11 from Brussels because we played in... in a small Belgian city. Yeah, and it was cool. It was crowded already, not super packed, and it started to fill during the day. I think it was pretty normal at Berghain. So when we started to play, it was pretty full, actually. And it was nice, super nice vibe, fresh people. It was great. We had a great time. But we were super tired, so we left at 11 or something. So how is DJ life for you guys now? You're playing so much. Well, we just had a month off. We both took January off. I went to Bali with my mom and Marco went to Mexico with his girl. So yeah, we just started playing again. But yeah, we played a lot last year and it's great. We love playing. The travel is struggling sometimes and pretty exhausting, but the playing itself is just... We don't consider that as work. The work part is the travel, not sleeping thing. But I think the one-month break was really needed because at the end of the year I felt a little bit worn out and now with the break I felt really excited to play again. find new music and to try new music and that I think sometimes you need a break and then you have much more energy to do it again. So it actually helps it's not like you get back in the first gig as though you haven't stopped it's actually like exciting to get back. Yeah absolutely I was really excited I was looking for a lot of new music to play and I was a little bit nervous because I wasn't used to it for more than a month. I think that's a great feeling and a motivation. So you're on the beach in Mexico checking Discogs on your iPhone? No, in Mexico I didn't do anything. I checked my emails and when something really important I had to answer, I answered. But I didn't listen to new music or was looking for music. I just really relaxed with my girlfriend and tried to... not focus on any music or party or anything related to what I always do normally. Is music the only thing that you guys have done, more or less, since school? No, no, no. I mean, we both had jobs. Marco went a little bit longer to school than me. I quit school pretty early, actually, and started working because school never was really my thing. I always had troubles with teachers. authorities and I always I always knew from very very young age that I never could work below someone you know I always that I have to run my own business someday so I started to work with like 16 I started DJing with 15 and started to have jobs with 16 like kitchen jobs building stages on exhibitions or for concerts and stuff yeah and i did job and made music and i dj'd and started to play in bars and clubs with around 16 17 starting to do side trends parties then yeah then starting to make music with 18 but Until I could live out of it, I always was jobbing. I always had other jobs. So when did you start doing music full time? I was working in a record store for three years, but not really to make money because I left all the money in the store at Optima Records in Munich. But basically, we are both living out of it. around four years? Yeah, I mean, you worked in the store not for the money part. I needed a job at the beginning and at one point it was running better and better and better and at one point you have to decide do I really need the money of the job or not and yeah, it's hard to say when was that exact moment when we could live from the music only. You're in the middle of this 10-year tour. It just started. It just started on... Friday, the tour. So how are you feeling? Already tired? What did we sign up for? No, we played three gigs this weekend and it was a lot of fun and we were very excited to play as we had a month off, as we just said. Yeah, we were really looking forward to the whole tour. This is the busiest you've ever been, DJ-wise. Do you ever wish that things were simpler? Were you happy playing three gigs a week? And we're still deciding that. I mean, we also could say no to playing three gigs a week. But as I said before, we love to play and it's great fun. And that's all we want to do, basically, you know. And with this tour, I mean, we really try to promote also the other artists on the label. You know, we always wanted to bring at least one other artist. I think that for that reason it's really good to do as many shows as we can for this tour, to present the label, to present other artists from the label who are doing all really amazing work. And therefore I think it's worth it to have a little less sleep on one weekend and be a bit tired. And I guess it's good that you guys get to travel together. This is what most DJs don't have, a traveling buddy. That's what a lot of people get tour managers for, a lot of techno DJs, because, I mean... what a techno DJ needs a tour manager for, you know. Basically, it's more about company and not traveling alone all over the world. So who's the manager in you? Who's the boss out of you guys? Who's saying, wake up, man. I'm always a little bit late, but I wouldn't say he's the boss, you know. I would say so. No, it's great fun, you know. If you're not... If you're not alone waiting at airports, it's much better than being alone. And you can give each other energy when one is down. And in general, I think we both really appreciate that. And you're always playing back to back? Yes. Is that the way you've always done it? When we started to play together, we played as a sound system, which means Marco was playing live and I was DJing, but in one time slot because Marco wasn't DJing back then. tired of playing live all the time playing his own music all the time so he started to dj and we started to play back to back and it's great fun it's always surprising and it's really exciting because you never know what he's gonna play next and you always have to react to that and Sometimes it's difficult and sometimes you mess it up maybe a little bit and sometimes something really special gets created through that and it's always exciting, I think. So what can be difficult about playing with someone? Keeping the flow going when they play something you don't expect? Yeah, keeping the flow going. or like if you're in another mood, like keeping the vibe of the other guy. I mean, we're brothers, you know, we have a very strong connection. So I think it's more easy for us to play together than maybe for a normal back-to-back pair, you know. But still, I mean, we are both also human and we both have different moods. And sometimes one of us is more into the relaxed mood and the other one wants to bang it. But we always find a way to manage it somehow. And it's good because it's always challenging. It's not like the safe thing, you know, we don't play like prepared sets. It's always improvised and it's always like going somewhere. And I think it can also be really interesting if we have different moods, if one is more banging and the other one is more breaky. And that can be really exciting too, because I think it's really nice if a set goes in waves, you know, it has different... ups and downs and you don't always have to keep a constant energy in my opinion. I think it's really exciting. if you go to different spaces. Do you talk while you're playing? If Dario plays something too mellow, you're like, come on, man. This is too deep for this situation. But we barely talk. We don't really talk. Sometimes we say like, wow, this is a huge bang. I really love this track. But we not talk about where we want to go or what we are doing. We know what we're doing. I think it's more about feeling than talking in these moments. And do you chat afterwards about how the set was? Yeah, like the night was, like the crowd was, the reactions. It's always like we're always reacting to the crowd, you know? We never go to a party and say, okay, we play our prepared set now. we also react so sometimes we play very breaky sets sometimes very straight sets sometimes more housey sets like it's very diverse you know because each night is different so after the sets we mostly or all the time we speak about it and analyze what what happened at night how we liked it because we also play bad gigs you know it's not like that every gig is amazing so We always, like, afterwards we reflect on the night and on our set and everything. Yeah, it's funny. But sometimes you also play a gig where you're not so happy with the gig all around, but you're really happy with the set. Because even sometimes when a gig goes pretty bad, you kind of, for me at least, it's like that. You stop being nervous at all because you feel like, okay, there's nothing to lose, really. So you can really play freely and experiment. It can be exciting too sometimes. So as you get deeper into DJing, the great gigs become more rare? Probably the expectations get higher, but when we started out playing, we played a lot of pretty bad gigs too. Because on the other hand, recently when we played more, it happened more often that you see a person with an Alien Tape t-shirt on the dance floor. And that's really amazing, I think. And you see that people are there and they know what we are doing. And that's really cool. And that wasn't there five or six years ago. It's also always what you make out of it. I mean, when I said like a bad gig, a bad gig is still much better than a lot of other things, you know. Sitting in an office. Yeah, no, not sitting in an office, but I mean, for us it's fun to play. Even if the sound is bad, the crowd is not good, it's still like an amazing job to get paid for playing the records you love, you know. So it's a pretty thin line to say. I It shouldn't sound that dramatic, you know, but even, I mean, I try to get out something positive out of every gig, even if the night wasn't amazing or the crowd didn't react so well. I always try to see something positive out of it, you know, because... Yeah, exactly. Even if it's not a good crowd in general or it's not a good vibe, but there's one or two... in the front who are really into the music with closed eyes you can just focus on them and and that's worth it i think so you're getting booked at parties where most people already know who you are and what you're kind of going to play not always no not always no no quite often nobody knows who we are And they expect techno or it's just, I don't know, do they know what kind of music they're going to hear? We're getting booked like on bigger raves also and like very techno focused nights. And they're the people, the crowd mostly expects techno. And it's not always easy to keep the vibe there. We tried, but you can clearly see like... if you get breakier or like weirder that people leave you know or they just don't get it i mean it's important to to to stay on that sound and to try to show something else to a crowd that is used to just straight stuff but also we have to keep an eye on the dance floor i think you know it's not like we don't we don't go to a party to play and think we have to educate the crowd now only but we wanna it's a mixture it's a mixture of both yeah Yeah, I just saw you posted this Cab Driver's track on Facebook. Cabinet Classics. Yeah, I didn't realize you're still playing this housey stuff sometimes. Yeah, we do. We do. Yeah, lately even more. I love it. I actually buy way more house music on vinyl than techno because I think it's way more interesting right now. There's a lot of more stuff happening and it's way more wide and diverse, I think. no kind of for me getting a little bit stuck the last years you know it reminds me when I in 2006 when I did my first records in this minimal techno high time era there was a was a time it was really fresh and a lot of things happened kind of but it got stuck and i think techno is in the same state right now i believe because it's all kind of sounding the same and a lot of djs all playing the same like this kind of techno and the crowd expects it you know so but for me these old this cabinet classics compilation for example it's techno for me too maybe it's housey in a way But for me, techno doesn't have to be dark and modern, industrialized sound. It can be super groovy and melodic, too. So for me, it's a really wide-term techno. It doesn't have to be this one sound. A lot of people consider techno nowadays. Are you buying new house records? All kinds of stuff, like really relaxed stuff, warm-up stuff. pumping stuff. I think we both are interested in music in general. It's not about only what we play on a peak time set or whatever. It's all kinds of records, ambient and house. Yeah, everything that we like. So you might make some loopy house again? I think we did this minimal kind of thing, like minimal techno, this darker stuff, and maybe some tech-housey stuff too. But we've always been music collectors and really open for everything. I mean, I play records that I own since 10, 15 years. I still play them. For me, it always was about music. I always was really into music. I was consuming it from a very young age on. and I never was like just on one sound you know the stuff I listen or I buy is so wide and that's what keeps it exciting too that's actually the most fun sets we play is when we have a lot of time and we can really switch between styles and stuff it's not always easy because if you play a two hour slot there's not so much room for that you know but yeah it's in general it's very exciting times for music the last years because there's a lot of great stuff getting released and it's super interesting that's good to hear because lots of people say the opposite i don't think so since i'm djing the most like the most exciting times the last years because it's so much stuff coming out because so many people doing stuff because it's so easy to access and to produce music nowadays back then you have to had a big studio and this was like a handful of people who had the money and the the chance to work on that machines and to make music so only for that reason it's obvious that it's much more good stuff coming do you think that there's has also had like a negative effect like there are so many labels there are so many people pointing out this yeah definitely it's there's no risk involved and you don't have to put much effort into it i mean Everyone is a DJ nowadays and a producer and what you have to do to call yourself that, you don't have to have any skill or you don't even have to invest money into it because you can rip everything, you can do it all digital. So through that, it's pretty easy to make that step and decide you're going to be a DJ or a producer. That also means that a lot of people do it who are not really doing it for the right reasons or doing it in a good way. So there's a lot of crap out there too. You used to be, you had to be very dedicated years ago when you wanted to do that. You have to invest money and you have to buy records and you really have to spend time with it. And that makes, I think if you spend time with something and really work on it, it gets better. At least you don't see so many laptops anymore. Yeah, I never had really problems with laptops when something great came out of it. It was more like, I mean, we played a few gigs where the DJ just fucked up the channel while we were playing, plugging his tractor and stuff. That was, yeah, but this is something that, what Marco just said, if you play with tractor, you should know your shit, and you should know how to plug it. And don't destroy the other DJ sets playing before you. But still, I heard really amazing sets with Ableton. DJ sets with Ableton only. Once I heard Sturgeon playing at Berghain with Ableton and he blew me away. That was outstanding because he knows... what he's doing, you know, so... Yeah, I'm not so much about the technical aspect. I think if you feel something in that moment and if something is well done, then it's well done, no matter how you did it or how complicated it is or how simple. If it's well done, it's well done, I think. So when you're in the studio, how long are you there for? It always depends. Sometimes all day, sometimes just a few hours. It always depends if we have to do some other stuff. And it also depends on how much we smoke. Sometimes we just hang. Just get into the zone. Just loop a kick drum. Exactly, just jamming around. That happens too, but we both really love to hang out in the studio. It's really like kind of a spiritual thing too. We just hang out there, we light some incense. But I think it's also important to have times there where you're not so creative and just experiment. That brings you forward too. Well, it's cool that you've made it like a fun place to hang out, not this place like, oh, I'm going to work now. I have to complete this stuff. Making music has nothing to do with work for us. It's the same like DJing. It's not working. It's pleasure. It's having fun. So that's what I said before. It should be as comfortable as possible. Sometimes it's struggle too, but it's always driven from passion and not from money or working. I think that's the difference. Sometimes, especially when I'm alone in the studio, I struggle and I feel not so good about it. But that's important too, to go through that and be not happy with your music and question everything. both really into sound and really passionate about it and so it could never be called work. So even when you're when you receive lots of positive feedback about your tracks you're obviously successful there are still moments where you're like what is this? What am I doing? Sure and that's very important. that's what drives us forward and to move on I mean we're both not really full of ourselves and we both not think our music is amazing you know we just I mean it just happens it's coming out of us and it's that's what we do you know and that's what really reflects us But yeah, we still have times where we're not creative at all because just nothing happens. And every artist has that. You can't be creative all the time. Sometimes you need periods where you are. really depressed and going through dark eras to make something good again at the end. Sometimes it needs some weeks where you're really depressed about how shitty and bad your music is to get back on track, basically. That happens all the time. I think it's like a constant evolution, you know, and sometimes you're at the state and you're happy with the record you just finished and one week later you think like, oh man. Could have done it so much better or I'm not really happy with it. And you will never be 100% happy with something, I think. And that's the beautiful thing about it because you can never reach the end level, I think. You can always aim for more and try to get better at it. So what kind of things would you look back in a track? and not like like certain sounds like oh the clap is too loud or or more philosophical things like yeah certain sounds or grooves or like breakdowns or everything you know there's always stuff you don't like about older tracks but there's also stuff you like about them you know and it's always like it's funny to look back especially older tracks We always get a picture through a track, you know, like you hear a track and you remember something and how you were when you made the track, what happened. what girlfriend you had or whatever. It's always like stations in life kind of that show up again when you listen to old music. So yeah, I mean, I think every artist has that. I mean, it's not normal that an artist loves his whole discography. I don't think that's existing, to be honest. But maybe it is, but I'm not sure about it. So is there a time where you started to realize that lots of people were really into what you were doing? We started doing vinyl in 2007. Yeah, I know about the first little period. The first period. We did like four records and then was the big vinyl crashdown. It was 2007, I think, 2008, where the sales broke in like from one day to the other. We were another distribution back then and we owed them money because we had a P&D deal and we were young. We just pressed, like we started with a thousand and, you know, we pressed 5,000 covers. We just didn't really think about it. We just went for it. Then we started the digital series to get back the money that we owed to the distribution, you know. But we always built a platform. with email addresses and send out promos. And we always had good feedback from the beginning, also with the digital-only stuff. Of course, not as much as now. I believe it became bigger and bigger over all the years. It just grew. It just grew. Like more contacts. We met more people. The feedback got more. And we started to do vinyl again. And then I think it became more serious again and grew like even more. Was there one record that seemed to be like a hit? I don't know. From the sellings, I would say there wasn't one record that stood out and was like suddenly a lot more. I think it slowly grew. We sold a lot less four years ago and then it slowly, or five years ago or six years ago, and then it slowly grew. This is probably the best way to do it, this organic growth, rather than putting out some smash. We never had in mind to do something to get popular, like really popular in terms of doing the label or as artists. We always wanted to do something that we really... could look back to and always always stand for it you know and that's simply not us and we always also thought about if we want to build a career we want to build it in the most long-term way possible Because it should last and we love that. We don't want to play for a few years now and that's it. We just wanted to really build something. And I'd rather release a personal track than a perfect sounding track. I think that was always important for us, that there's something in the music we can really relate to. then just a perfect production that sounds good on a big system and that's functional, I think that's rather easy to do. Like a functional, good sounding track that works. But that's not... I think something's missing if it's just that. If you're putting so much feeling in a track, When it's two of you working together, you obviously have different emotions at different times. It's always really inspiring because there's always... I mean, if you're alone in the studio, you have a blank canvas and sometimes it's a little bit too much because you don't know where to start. If you're together, you just start and then ideas come from both sides and you can... just pick them up and develop something quicker, I think. And it's also exciting because if you listen to something that you have not done, you have a different relationship to it than when you're doing it in the moment. I think it's really exciting to work together in the studio. Are you ever disagreeing much? Not really. I mean, there's obviously stuff one of us doesn't like and then we say, I don't like this or I don't like that and we just skip it. We never discuss about it. If one of us doesn't like a sound, it's just not, it won't stay in the track. The other one's not fighting like, come on, man. No, no, no, no. We both have to feel it and like it. And we are both very, very honest about it too. So that's the only way to make music together, I think, you know. And I think it's no problem if one says, I don't like this, just throw it out and keep on doing it. I have this concept that I want to do. It's much more intuitive and like in the moment. And if someone says like, hey, I don't like this. Okay, put it away. And is the same with putting out records on the label? Like when Andrea, for example, sends you 10 tracks, are you both equally into the ones that get onto the record? Most of the times we have the same. opinions about the tracks but sometimes one of us doesn't feel that track really and then we just give it a little bit more time and play it out in the clubs and test it and hear it in the studio and most of the time it's pretty clear we have a very different similar taste in terms of what we want to put out on the label In the early days were you reaching out to artists for tracks? And now it's mostly from contacts you have already. Yeah, we have a strong group of artists that work a lot. I mean, they all spend a lot of work in it and they're very productive. But we get really good demos too. We don't have time to check them. The rum record, we ask him for a record because we got in contact, for example. If we're really into something, we reach out for an artist too. The thing is, we are not into signing an artist that is upcoming, that's releasing on several labels, because we believe it's important for an artist to relate to something and not to release on ten labels in his first year, as I did, for example, when I was young. I did my first four or five records on five labels, and it was cool back then. I didn't know what to do about it. That's what I learned out of it, that it's not really the best thing to do. It's great for an artist if you work with a label that really is trying to work out something with you together, to build a relationship. How much music are you getting sent from the lads, from the guys, from Stenny, Andrea? Well, Stenny's working on an album right now, so not that much from him, but Ski Mask is sending us like... He's crazy. So yeah, he's super productive. He's a machine. He's doing nothing than making music, which is great, you know. How did you actually get in touch with him? He's also from Munich, right? He has another project and we both like the record. And somehow I realized that he lives in Munich, apparently. But I never met him. So I wrote him on SoundCloud and said like, "Hey, we really like this record. I don't know if you know our label, but if you have something, maybe do something." And he was like, "Yeah, sounds interesting. Can we meet?" And we met and he was totally not what I expected. Like I expected like a really older person and a really self-confident guy. But he was, I mean, he's self-confident, but... He was just so young, I was really surprised that he does this music. And he brought a stick with like 30 tracks, and he was like, you can have all of them. And that's how we got in touch, and now we hung out. a lot more and became friends. And some of those 30 tracks came out? No, the first ITX was even different tracks. The first tracks he gave us, we didn't release them. I also gave him a lot of records from our label and through that I think he developed the idea of making this Ski Mask project. I think he was kind of influenced from the label and wanted to do... Because we told him, like, we don't want to sign you with this old name you have because then it seems like, how about a new project? Let's make a fresh start and do something different. And he was really up for that. How does he play? Crazy. Super diverse, but, like, he's one of the best DJs I know because he's, like... he's managing to play like electro house techno drum and bass at berghain he played like this grime hits like what was the name like a really crazy to not like a trap track with rap vocals combined with craft work on 180b p.m. afterwards and then a drum and bass tune and he's a crazy DJ that's like he takes risks and he likes to present music that he loves and that's what I really respect about him when you started getting into records with nice breaks mostly UK stuff Yeah, it's a lot of UK stuff. It seems like it came back lately. Yeah, it's hard to tell. It's hard to say, actually. I mean, I kind of had the impression too, but I think it always was there, kind of. It just wasn't. I mean, in general, I think there's a way bigger acceptance for music in general. As you see, the scene worldwide is growing. there's more raves than ever right now everywhere like all over the world so of course there's like a lot of people into different kind of sounds the the audience for for breaky stuff and the acceptance for break is just growing as more people are into it but it always was there like the breakier stuff i mean we play a lot of old stuff from the 90s or early 2000s exactly that breaky techno vibe. Yeah, it's not like it's a brand new thing. No, no. It's just a different approach. I mean, it's just slower now. It's maybe more melodic than back then. But I think it's just because the movement in general is growing. So there's just more people into it. So what trends have you seen come and go? I got really into dance music when every club night was minimal mainly. And then it became like really disco and deep house and like super slow. And then somehow I think it got more and more parallel hypes. I don't know. Then, of course, through Bearkind and then this techno sound became massive. But now, then it was like coexisting. That's what I was just saying before. When I started DJing, like in techno parties, like minimal techno parties, or when I put out my first records like 10 years ago, actually 11 years ago. Maybe it was just not on my radar, but it was like the MySpace time and it wasn't that social media explosion. And I just had MySpace and I didn't know much more about the internet, actually. There were some chat rooms where people were discussing about stuff. This minimal techno thing was the only thing back then. I mean, I bought house music and techno and stuff and everything, but I had nothing on my radar besides the minimal thing. And in Munich, any party... was going to happen was a minimal techno party you know and after that I think even after that right after the minimal techno thing was the huge tech house wave like the Frankfurt This Mannheim, like, Oslo style. Yeah, Oslo, this style. And then it became really disco, like, the Soul Club, Wolf and Lamp thing got really big. And still is. It's still, like Marco said, it's really parallel nowadays. I had the feeling that back then it was either one or another. It was minimal techno, and then it was tech house, and then it was disco, which was interesting for the majority of the clubs and the crowds. And nowadays it's super. parallel you know there's a scene for every every every sound has its place and its crowd goes back to what you were saying about more people being into this thing maybe that there's room for all these different yeah yeah because so much people into dance music nowadays that every scene has its or every sound has its crowd which is great which is amazing So do you still chat to any of your pals from the minimal days? Yeah, we do. Like Franco Cinelli once in a while, like JC with Casper who runs Esperanza Records. Do you still play many records from back then? Out of this era, not really. I mean, there's some records I really enjoy still, but there's also a lot of psytrance records I love, you know, still. You know, I mean, sometimes I get lost for hours on YouTube watching Psytrance music. And sometimes when my friends hang out at my place or Marco, I really get on the nerves of the guys playing old records for hours. But I love that, you know. So how fast is Psytrance? It depends. There's really different. There's a lot of different. styles of psytrance but I think like 140 145 148 so what are the different styles is there deeper stuff that's really deep stuff that's for example like minilogue they used to have a project I don't know if they still have it called songkite it's like Danish or Swedish Swedish progressive psytrance which is really cool stuff actually and there was a lot of stuff from Sweden back then from a label called the boga records for example they did a lot of progressive stuff which is basically techno with a very psychedelic spiritual approach like really organic sounds but it has nothing to do with trance just was considered that style because it just fits in an environment like an open air party with people on acid and smoking weed and nature and wind and rain and stuff you know it's just natural sounds i think in very psychedelic music and even nowadays i think stuff we put out or we do ourselves is very psychedelic It seems like, I don't know if it was like that in the UK. Obviously, I can't really speak about it, but it seems pretty common in German music that it's in German, Hausen Techno, that there's this hypnotic element. And I wonder where it came from. Drugs, maybe? I don't know. Yeah, but drugs have been everywhere. I think it's a fascination to also work with not so many elements and make them a loop and just keep it fresh, like produce it in a way that you can listen to it for hours. I mean, I think that's a very challenging and really nice approach. Yeah, because that's the interesting thing about your stuff. It's not so loopy and stripped down, but it still has this trippy... Well, I think this just happens, actually. I mean, we don't sit in a studio and say, okay, let's make a hypnotic loop. This is just what comes out. All right, Marco, concentrate, man. Close your eyes, believe. Think on the last Chisora gig. You have to focus now. It's not like that. It's very... It just happens, actually. And maybe that's kind of also from our roots. I mean, Marco wasn't in this Psytrance thing, but still he was raised with it because next to his room was my room and I was playing that. music all the time and he was a kid and he got it he got the dose every day pretty loud so i think that influenced him even if he hates it nowadays maybe he hates it because of that i have a trauma but i think that influenced him also and maybe that's what comes through you know and i mean i don't i not feel ashamed about to talk about that and to speak about it how much i love it and i still do and i think it's very you can clearly hear it in our music When I grew up, I was also really into, in my teenage years, I was really into dub and reggae. And it's also quite loopy, but also pretty spaced out. It's like old King Tubby records. They're like really loopy, but also these effects and these heavy delays, they're really... Quite psychedelic too. Were you into lots of German techno also? Like this basic channel and... Yeah, totally. Rhythm and sound, basic, general. Like Kanzleramt back then, like outstanding. Alexander Kowalski, Heiko Lauck stuff is like a milestone in techno music in general, not only German techno, but globally. There was a lot of really good stuff from Germany. Still is, but back then, especially the 90s and early 2000s. Was it easy to get in Munich? When you started buying records, could you buy this old 90s stuff also? Yeah, there's a really good record store in Munich. I used to work at Optima Records. It's there for 35 years almost. They always had everything. They always had the Detroit stuff, the Berlin techno stuff. Very good selected store. When did you guys first start coming to Berlin and traveling around Germany for gigs? I started in around 2007, 2008. And then I played a couple of Vacant nights at Watergate when I released music on Vacant. We also played together once at Watergate. Do you have lots of, like, standout memories? Or, I don't know, does it all blur into one? There are standout moments, but the more you play and the older you get, of course, they get, like, forgotten easy. But there always were, like, standout moments. But I have to admit that back then we partied way more. So we did way more after hours and stuff. That's what I was thinking. I wonder, when do you get to the point where you have to think like, oh, I'm signing to DJ a lot now. I shouldn't go to after parties if I want to be healthy during the week. It depends. Yeah, exactly. It depends what you want to do during the week. And we run a label. We want to make music. And then it's obvious that you can't do it. You can't tour every weekend and go to an afterparty and be super high and then you are fucked for the week. You cannot do what you want to do. And that's frustrating. So do you remember the first afterparty you said no to? No. This is when it all changed. No, man. So how did you get tracks for the compilation? Or how did you get the Shed track, for starters? We just asked him. Nice. We've been fans for... It's one of our biggest inspirations. We've been fans forever from Shed, and he's a great guy. We just wrote him and asked him, and he agreed. And we're super happy about it. The other tracks, we all... I mean, we started to plan this compilation like summer of 2016, like last year. We just wrote all the artists about it. We specifically ask each artist to do a track for this compilation. I see. It's not like you selected from 10. Yeah, we got different suggestions, but they all had in mind that it's for this project. And then we kind of chose what we thought was the right way to present it. Did you give them more information than just like, oh, it's a 10-year compilation? We said you can do whatever you want. If you want to go wild, go wild. If you want to go banging, go banging. And then we tried to kind of... Yeah, put it all together. And it was a pretty natural process, but we had a vision what we want to do. And I'm really happy about it, how it turned out, that it's like, I think every track sounds really different and represents something different in a way. It all fits together. And all the artists are happy with it. They're all happy with their tracks and with the result. It's not like that we choose a track from an artist that would like to have another track on the compilation, you know That was really important for us too, that everybody feels really happy about it and comfortable. Do you find yourself, like, do you have to be sensitive when dealing with the producers on your label? Or are you all pretty honest with each other? And you can give negative feedback? We are pretty honest. We are sensitive too, but we are honest. I mean, we suggest things. I mean, there's a limit, you know, there's how far you can go. We wouldn't say, hey, put out the hi-hat at minute three, put another bass line in, try another whatever, try a Juno or something like that. We never would do that. But we do suggestions like, hey, maybe this sound is killing the atmosphere for us at least, or maybe this bass sound is a little bit too loud, but that's about it, which is cool. That's a constructive critic, I think. Is it common when you're only... on other labels for label owners to ask for these specific changes that you mentioned? Yeah, this happened to me many times. My whole discography, many labels requested that. A lot of people work like that, but that's not how we work. I mean, as I said, we do suggestions sometimes, but if the artist says, hey, I want to have this track like this, and this is what I want to express, we are like, okay, cool. That's totally fine. And it doesn't happen often. It's not that like every second track we say, can you change this? Can you change that? Mostly we say yes or no. To the whole track. Because the artist always wants to express something. But it's happened to me many times already. I think if you do a remix for somebody that pays you for it, it's a different thing. But still, it should be in a respectful way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
