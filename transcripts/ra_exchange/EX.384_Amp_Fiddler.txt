♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Stephen Titmuss and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with AmpFiddler. AmpFiddler's career has been decade and genre spanning, working with music royalty the likes of George Clinton, Sly and Robbie and Prince. However, he's always been connected to one place. Detroit. His contribution to the local scene there is massive. He aided the early careers of J Dilla and Slum Village and has also been a key figure in Detroit's electronic music scene, regularly collaborating with the likes of Theo Parrish and Moody Man. To tell his unique story, we discuss some of the records that defined Ant Fiddler's life. An exchange with Ant Fiddler is up next. So we're here with Ant Fiddler. How's it going, man? It's going really good. Cool. In this exchange, we're going to talk about some of the music from your career and how that's informed the music that you've made and the places you've come from. Cool. And the first track I wanted to talk about was Sundown, Spaced Outta Place. That was the first song I ever made. Yeah, so who were Sundown? Sundown were some guys who were from the west side of Detroit. They were friends of mine who I had met right out of high school. The guy who had the label's name was Michael Prather. The other guy's name was Hakeem, who was the drummer. And they were really into, you know, starting to get into funk and production. And since I was a keyboard player, they suggested that I write the song. Yeah, and did the record make any kind of impact at the time when it came out? It did not. But, you know, we got it played on the radio at that time. One of the stations, local stations, played it. But that was as far as it really went. But we were excited because we'd made a record, you know. So I think the accomplishment and the fact that we completed a record was the big thing for us. And it's funny, it's one of those records that sort of became popular with diggers a long time after. Like it's quite a rare and expensive record to get an original copy of now. It's a collector right now. Yeah, I wish I had a Bon Lovel. I've been looking for Michael Brand. Where are you, man? So it came out in 1981. What was Detroit like to live in 1981? 1981, Detroit was kind of difficult because, you know, I watched my dad raise us from working in the factory at Uniro. He had passed away in 76. and my brother worked in the factory after him. It was rough because the factories were starting to shut down and business was closing as we knew it. And I think it was the time when Detroit was really falling. It wasn't the happiest time to be in Detroit, but we didn't pay any attention to that because we were so much into the music. Yeah, and you mentioned your family there. You come from a pretty big family, right? Yeah, I'm the youngest of five. Yeah, so was music a big thing at home? Music was a big thing, yes. My dad was from the Virgin Islands, from St. Vincent. My mom was from Virginia. She liked classical music, so of course he liked calypso and soca, reggae and stuff like that. So I heard all of that. My oldest sister was really a Motown head, so she all the Motown records. And my sister under her was a hippie, so she was really into everything from blues to soul to hip-hop to jazz to all the rock and roll shit. She was just into all of that. And then my brother was a jazz head that was right up under her. He was the hardcore. a jazz head. And then the brother right above me was into a doo-wop, you know, like the Dramatics and Temptations and that kind of stuff. So where did you fit in? I was really not into music my formative years. I was really just listening and watching because we had a piano in the house and some of them took lessons, so I watched and tinkered. But I was really not into music. I was just an innocent bystander, you know, the young bystander. I guess later in my high school years, I decided to, my mom was always asking me to play piano. The piano was there. It was a beautiful baby grand. She was always telling me I need to play piano. I listened and I took lessons and that's what got me started to listen to music. Yeah, because your brother played the bass as well, right? Exactly. So were you guys vibing off each other and playing together or was it a little bit separated? It was funny. At first, my dad took us to a big department store called Federal Department Store and we were shopping. I didn't know what we were doing. Of course, I'm a younger one, so I'm just tagging along. I wanted a pogo stick, but my brother wanted a bass. So he won, and I went home mad, and he was happy. So for the first year or two, I just, must have been two or three years, I just watched him practice and play bass. And I wasn't doing anything musical, you know. I was just wishing I could bump around and jump up and down on the stick. The only thing I could have was a basketball. I could dribble in front of the house because I couldn't go any further than that. It was a wild neighborhood. My mom made sure I stayed close to the house. Later, just going... to my last year in high school, I started taking piano and that's when we started playing together. But it took time because I had to learn the piano before we could play together because he definitely wouldn't play with me if I didn't know what I was doing. So it took about a year for me to really start figuring things out. Lucky you didn't get that pogo stick or things could have been different. Right. I want to move on to the next track that I'd like to talk to you about, which is George do fries go with that shake, which was, you know, a big record for you. It was. Tell me about your relationship with George Clinton because you started working with him. How did that happen? That was like the dream gig. I was... Always buying equipment when I was young. So after I learned to play keyboards, I knew I wanted to record, so I was always buying four tracks and synthesizers. The first synthesizer that I got, my brother helped me buy on layaway. Back then, you couldn't... Go to the music store, give them $50, and they'll let you make payments. So my brother is a drug dealer, so eventually he helped me finish paying for it. And that was a monophonic move that I got. So I was always recording and buying stuff. And I was recording my girlfriend after I got a little more developed and got a little better equipment. And all my friends were coming by and we were recording all the time. And I made her demo and she took it to George because she knew him. He liked it. asked who did the music, and I had to come to the studio to meet George, and that's where the introduction happened. He said, you know, come back. At the time, I was a salesman. I've always been a salesman. My mom got me the first job at a big department store. I was a salesperson. So at this time, I was working at a place called Incognito, and I went back to work. I didn't pay any attention to what George had said. I was happy And I told everybody at work that I had met him. How did that go down at the department store that, you know, you met George Clinton? Were people excited by that? People were excited by that. Now, I had left the department store and I was working at a little boutique store. It was called Incognito. It was a really funky little store. So the owner was really cool. And he played all of these really dope records during the whole time that I was there. He exposed me to like Cocteau side. And he played a lot of reggae, just all kind of music that I hadn't heard. They were all excited about it. And at the same time, I had been meeting like alumni. I met just one of my Andre Fox and Michael Clip Payne. and Georgie Clinton Jr. and all of George's family and young guys who were almost in the band but working for George. Because it's worth saying that George Clinton had these sort of tentacles of different groups and people that were related to him. It was like this humongous family tree of music. My friends were in a band called Trelude. And then I also met the queen of funk, Malia Franklin, who was from Parlette, and she had me play in her band before I met George. So I met all these other great musicians. But it's just really interesting how the whole thing worked out. You know, he called me one day and said that he wanted me to come to do a session. And then Andre called me too and said, George wants you to play on this track. I forgot Steve's last name. He was the producer for that track. They called me and came to United Sound, and I played the Rhodes on that, do Fry's go with that. shake thing and another little synthesizer part and before I knew it you know it became a single and it was out and I was like wow in the interim George was in California and he was having a problem connecting the producers and the musicians Because at that time, they weren't recording with Pro Tools and Logic. They had these Synclavier keyboards that did everything. And this one guy had this big, huge keyboard. But the other keyboard player, who was, you know, all of the world, couldn't get along. They couldn't get along. So here I come. He sends me a ticket to California. I was going through drama at home anyway. My brother had been shot by some guys. And they were trying to rob the house. Was that the same brother who was drug dealing? Of course. Yeah. So we were going through a lot of drama at the house. And when I told George about this, he said, well, it's a good time for you to come to California. And that's why I did the video for Do Fries Go With That Shake. Yeah, that video is cool, by the way. Yeah, it was cool. I was on a fence ride. detail. So what was George like to work for? It was amazing because everybody told me that I was going to be offered drugs when I got the gig, you know, and that they were going to pay me in drugs. But my brother was a drug dealer. So when I got there, I just offered him drugs and he said, damn, for real. And then we developed a really cool relationship because we could talk about things. I could ask him about how I was getting paid and how the percentages work, publishing, all that stuff. So he liked that. We were open about everything. He was very honest about everything. And then when I got to California, I didn't realize that he was really into literature. But it made sense because all the shit that he was writing was because he was reading. So he got me into literature and I started reading a lot. He was deep. It was interesting meeting him. What kind of books was he reading at the time that he turned you on to? I don't remember because we were in California and he just had two or three books there. When I'd come to his room in the hotel we were staying off of, Sunset on La Cienega, he always had books and was always reading books. So it just made sense. It kind of made me start reading again, you know. I don't remember at the time what kind of books he had then, but he was good. It was cool. It was good meeting him, and I learned a lot about the business, about publishing, about... about doing deals with record companies, about producing, about, you know, everything. Do you think George Clinton really gets the credit he deserves as an artist? You know, he's obviously someone who's massive in funk and back music circles, but... He's not necessarily someone who gets the credit of, say, like a Prince does or something like that. I don't think he's been given the credit that he should. For years, the drugs kind of got in the way of the industry. And now that he's clean, I think that he's going to start getting all his accolades that he deserves. Yeah, it'd be great to see that. I suppose, do you think you could really separate the music he made, though, from the drugs, though? It I think if drugs were not involved, that music would not be like it is. All the musicians in the band who I learned from who were amazing musicians older than me were all either alcoholics or drug users. But I learned so much from them. And some of them were clean. You know, a lot of the guys were clean and didn't use drugs. I think it was a combination between the two that made it amazing. And I think what caused so much personality was because they were straight off the street and raw and high and recording some bad shit. Yeah. For sure. Let me go on to the next track then I'd like to talk about, which is one of my favorites, Amp Fiddler, You Play Me. So this record is produced by J Dilla. When did you first meet JD? It's funny that they keep claiming that it's produced by JD, but it's okay. Yeah. Because I didn't mind that. But I'll tell you the story. Yeah. I met Dilla in the 80s just after buying my first MPC. It was 89. I bought my first MPC. I got it. demo deal because I was in California with George Clinton in 89. And I met this guy that took me to Polygram Records where I met Ed Eckstein, who was the son of Billy Eckstein. He gave me a demo deal based on the Mr. Fiddler record. So I went back home to make the demo. I was playing the music loud in the basement and some kids came by and said they rap and they want to come by the house. That's when Dilla came by the next week. I said, bring all your boys. come over and I'll check everybody out and that's how I met Dilla and they brought Dilla with them so I said well you know I can help you with this but I'm in the middle of making a record so it's got to be someone who can help us so that you know when I'm not using it you guys can use it so they said well James would be that guy because he makes beats for us now and that's how I met Dilla that's a pretty interesting thing not everyone would just let group of kids come off the street and use their studio like what made you want to do that was that just like the way you were brought up or you know you just wanted to give these kids a kids a shot well for one thing George Clinton let me work with him off the streets and based on my personality he let me do certain things and use certain things that he normally wouldn't let other people do based on my personality He's a good judge of character, and I think I'm one of the same. So being a good judge of character, I could tell by the conversation that these kids were cool. When I met James, he was a good kid because he was quiet and wasn't a lot of... cursing profanity and a lot of bullshit coming out of his mouth. I didn't smell weed on anybody, so it wasn't crazy. That means that all these kids were respectful and raised in a decent family and just wanted to get creative and make music. Yeah. And I read that when, at that point before he met you, JD was just making records using cassette loops and things like that. That's what he played for me when he came. And he had made all these beats from the cassette. I said, well, bring a cassette of just the loops and I'll show you how to put them in the machine. And that's how we first got started. And how quickly did he pick it up using an MPC? It took time. I had to do all the work at the beginning. I put all the samples in a place he watched and I showed him how it was done. But he came by religiously every day after that to learn. And he kept learning and he learned fast. Yeah, because they're not easy to learn those old MPCs. PCs. They're not. And it was my first one in PC-60, so I had to learn it. After I introduced him to Q-Tip and he became famous, kids were saying that. he should look out for me and take care of me and blah, blah, blah. And I said, no, that's not the reason why I did that. He doesn't owe me anything, blah, blah. So they went back telling him that he should do that. So he thought that it was coming from me. He called me. I said, no, that's not coming from me. You know, I never tripped that way. I mean, yes, indeed, it would be cool if you threw me something. finders fee for you but it wouldn't happen so I'm not tripping about that I said my focus was to get Detroit hip-hop on the map and you're doing that so keep doing it later a friend of mine from the barbershop called me and said I got a bag of zips I want to bring them by for you so he came by the house dropped me off the bag of zips and said make me some beats and you can have them Put the zips in the NPC, they were all Dilla zips. So he just had a bag of... He worked at the barbershop and he bought them from someone at the barbershop. Oh, I see. For $100. Dilla said when he moved house, the movers stole some of his things. Those zips were part of what they stole. And they went to the barbershop and sold them. It just happened to a friend of mine. Now this is how karma works. Good karma, So Dilla said, you can have those because I owe you that so you can have them. Oh, wow. So you just ended up with these zips of Dilla tracks, basically. Exactly. Wow, amazing. Hence comes the track, You Play Me. Oh, and that was made out of basically the loops that could come from that machine. It was the track that came from that zip. So here's what happens. I load the zip in. Here's the track. I record the track into Pro Tools, and then I play keyboards over it. I leave some of it, but I make a bridge, and then I sing over it. So it's co-production. Yeah. But people don't see it that way because they know it's a Dilla beat, so they think it's produced by Dilla. But most people who think that way are beat makers who don't understand what production is. Of course. Something I had to learn from George Clinton. give him music and I would think that I was going to be producer on it and then he does all kind of shit to it. I'm like, okay, damn, he's fun, all that. And I had to let go of thinking that this is all my creation once I give it to him because he's the producer and then we become co-producers. So that was one thing that I had to learn that other people have to learn that. Production is not just a beat that somebody samples. It's the finished product and how did it come about? How was it finished? Who mixed it? who oversaw the whole project. Yeah, of course. And you mentioned collaboration there. You've done so many collaborations. What makes a good collaboration in your eyes and in your experience? You know, two people who are on a good vibration together can create some amazing things. I think that's what makes a good collaboration. That just you're on the same page and the completed project from the collaboration is... is amazing because you work together well. Your ideas really fit. And who have you worked with where that spark's just been very quickly? How do you know when that spark of inspiration is going to happen? I think we don't really talk that much. We just work and then we're continuously working. Like Rafael Sadiq and I work like that. We're continuously just working towards this until we finish it. It happened like that with Sly and Robbie in the studio. It happens like that with George Clinton. We just work until we finish. Friend Yam Hu, who I worked on the last record, it's the same thing. We just work until we finish. The Dames Brown, the girls that sing on that record, it's the same thing. We start from the beginning until we end, and it's completed. It's fascinating to me. You've worked with so many people, many who are considered geniuses. Do you think that that's a real thing, genius, that it can't be taught? I think it can be developed. The more you record, the better you get. And it is part genius because I worked with Leon Ware, who's like a genius at writing, both lyrically. and composition-wise at the keyboard, I learned so much. And I think that it's just constantly doing things, the repetition of things that create that genius. And some people just have it naturally, though. Dilla Head was just a natural for natural genius. George Clinton just had a natural ear for certain things. And Bernie Rorrell, the keyboard player around him, was a genius, just like a wizard. And all the other musicians, Eddie Hazel and Mike Hampton, all those guys, they had a position like it was a team. I think the whole collaboration, what's beautiful about it is when you hear and see your united team win because there's such an energy between the players. Like sports, I think music is one of the same, and I think it takes preparation, and it definitely takes good coaching. So I think the mentorship thing is important in music like it is in sports, you know, like your Manchester United. You know, they have a great coach. And without their great coach, they couldn't be winning like that. So I think with young musicians and young artists, and even musicians my age, when we want to accomplish and go to the next level, we need mentorship and great coaches. Such a good way of looking at it. I want to go on to the next record now, which is Amp Dog Nights. I'm doing fine. Okay. I'm doing fine. I'm going to work. I'm going to work. When did you first become aware of Moody Man? My brother and I were doing sessions for him not knowing who he was. Norma Jean Bell, the saxophone player, brought us over to her house to do sessions for Kenny. They thought we were just doing sessions for a guy. You know, he passed, and it was cool. And at the same time, I was working with Play It Again Sam here on my album, and I didn't know that I was working with Kenny because Carly Kafta, my A&R guy, kept saying, you got to meet this guy, Moody Man. I think you guys will work together. together well and I was like I don't know who he is so one day we came to the studio and Kenny had this record for us and gave me and my brother this record it was the Moody Man record So I was like, "Well damn, who's this?" He's like, "It's me." So that's how we met basically and became cool and that's how I'm doing fine. So I said, "I need a song for my record." When I started doing the record, I said, "I need a song from you for my record." And he brought a beat. And I played the keys to it, my brother played bass, and I just started singing "I'm Doing Fine" over it. And he took everything and kind of cut it up and chopped it up as he wanted to and finished the production. How does a moody man's approach in the studio... differ from yours has he got a different way of working perhaps he has a different way of working because at the time he was using a different way to record we were using a computer he was using a rolling device and the way he put things together was quite different than we did but we have a question there because everybody had the method. I knew that already because I had worked with so many different people. I was just happy because we were being creative. A lot of times we'd just record, and then I'd record, and then he'd take the music and take my vocal and finish it how he heard it and arrange it. So it was definitely a different way than we were, because normally I sing things where I want them to be, and maybe I move them around, but most of the time I don't. I just sing them where I want them to be, whereas in his case, he could move things where he wanted to, like a DJ does, and put things... where he hears it because he hears things different because he plays records for people all the time. Back then, I didn't understand that, but I learned from that. It was cool. Do you enjoy DJing at all? I do. I know you do DJ. Yeah, I do. But I only play my music, so it's even better. So I don't have to feel like I'm a DJ because I'm just playing my music. Yeah. Have you ever played other people's music too? I have done that before as a DJ. The first gig I got was for my friend's wedding. to play all this music for his wedding. It was challenging. Yeah, weddings are hard. Yeah, weddings are hard. And I like to take on challenges. I think that the only way that we can grow sometimes is to fail. And people don't understand that sometimes you go for something that you dream of doing and you lose. but then that's what teaches you how to win, and that's where you win. Another record that I really like that you made with Kenny Dixon Jr. is Love and War. Can you tell me a little bit about that record? Yeah, I love that record too, and it was recorded the same way. It was another track that I loved. He used to play me stuff. to see what I would like. And there was a couple things that he said, you know, you can have that one. Take this one and you can have it. I'm not going to do nothing with that. So he gave it to me. And then I was able to sing all my vocals over it. And then my son was a young man. He was playing trumpet. He played the trumpet all the way through. And I just kept the part that was really cool and looped it. And at the time, it was the perfect kind of a lyric because um we were at war and we always seem to be at war fighting some country over nothing it's it's a really special record in the performance space sun is great on it too yeah i want to move on to the next record now you might not remember this one actually Bye. So this is Free Chairs, Midday Blues at Midnight, which is a record you're credited on. I think this is one that I played on because I played on so many things that I didn't know where the song went. And you're right, because I don't remember. I remember playing on it, but I don't remember. it being on that record because i never got that record so you're gonna have to send that record to me i can send you the album that's sweet but yeah like i wanted to talk to you about that project because it's a record that a lot of that audience really loves But it's so mysterious. Like no one really knows who's on it. I just wonder what your experience was working on that particular record. I mean, I could tell that's me. So it was one of those things where I come over to Kenny's house and he plays something for me and I just play. And it may be one of those things that sometimes he pulls pieces from other records that I played on and puts them in. and put pieces because I was playing so much that he probably had tons of stuff that he could say, I could put this over there on this other track, you know. You know, he's like an artist that has a canvas. So he takes whatever he hears and puts it wherever he wants, so it's kind of nice. Yeah, and not just this record. Quite a lot of records that you've made, certainly with Kenny, they do a really good job of combining jazz and dance music, which I think is really, really rare. Is that something you strive for coming from, you know, someone who's a jazz fan? I'm a jazz head, so I don't necessarily strive for it, but I like to use it when I can because I love jazz. So I think everything should cross with each other. And I feel like if I sing soulfully, then why can't I sing soulful over reggae? Why can't I sing soulful over jazz, blues, or anything else? So, or house. you know, it doesn't matter to me, you know, as long as it fits. I think that that's the cool part about it. Yeah, you're not someone who seems to be constrained by genre at all. Do you even think of music, really music in those terms? I really don't. Most of the time, I just think of good music. and I love a lot of different things so I just love it when it's good it doesn't matter what kind of music it is so that Three Chairs record is a really good example of a very Detroit collaboration you know and you've collaborated with many many Detroit artists who still live there. What makes Detroit so special as a city, musically? It's very cold in the winter and we are in our houses, basements, rooms or wherever just working on music a lot. and our passion for music, I think we all feel like we have something to stand for because we're seen as such a dark, cold... crazy place, you know, and I think that it's important for Detroiters to be innovative, and I think we like being innovative. We love music. Just the passion. It's just like, ah, we gotta have some music. Ah, more music, more music. We just love music. It's just like, ah, music, yes. Later for all the other shit. Music is what's important for us. It's interesting you mentioned the innovation because that is definitely something that a lot of people would associate with Detroit, I suppose. But maybe that is the thing that if everyone's trying to outdo each other and come with something new, maybe that's why it is so innovative. It's not competitive. It's just that it's that thing like Detroit versus everybody. It's like, you know, we have all these other cities around us being noticed. You know, New York is big. Philadelphia is big. Chicago is big. L.A. is big. But in the eyes of us, we see they don't see Detroit, you know, and we're like. We're gonna make you motherfuckers see us. We're gonna make you see us and make you recognize us. Because we were recognized once with Motown and with jazz, with other things that made Detroit amazing, with the auto industry. And once that fell... We felt like, no, no, we still have to be heard. Even with hip-hop, it was important for me to let people know that Detroit has a different kind of hip-hop that's going to set precedence over everything else, and you're going to know that shit came from Detroit, and that was Dilla. Yeah, of course. And our whole premise was to be in a... innovative and creative and different. He and I always talked about that different way to do things, change this time signature, make it, you know, do whatever, stretch it. You know, there's no limitations to what you can do with this machine and what you want to do and what you hear. And do you think now Detroit has got the recognition it deserves? No. I think it's coming, but I still don't think it's gotten the recognition that it deserves. I think people do recognize it and they acknowledge it and that's good. But I think, you know, we still have work to do and I don't mind that. I just think that... I've always wanted to be recognized more in the States and in the world, but we just keep moving and keep creating and not worry about that. For me, I haven't even touched on what I want to do musically because I'm putting out music that was sitting on my computer like this. I've got so much music. I can't wait till I start creating again. Yeah. Well, I wanted to ask you about that because it's been a very prolific period for you. Two solo albums in the last two years and another album collaboratively. That's a strong amount of music coming out. What's made you release so much recently? My family keeps dying. So my mom first and my son, which really just broke me. And then my sister, which broke me again. And now, 2016, it's my brother, who I was super close with, that's breaking me down again. So normally I go into seclusion and just ball up and don't do anything. So people are probably wondering, I'm giving him this tractor right here. He hasn't written to it because I can't get into my head like I normally would. Yet, in order to keep busy, I was really between those things, like just on the border of insanity. I get it together and then I finish a record, you know, and I'm in work. In order to not think about what's happened, I have to work all the time. So I'm a workaholic. I don't like starting something until I finish something. So now I'm into these pianos and restoration of pianos. So I'm restoring a baby grand in my house. And I haven't been doing anything else that I need to be doing. And it's kind of wearing me out because I want to create music. But I know that I also want to practice. So I'm putting all new strings and pins in this piano. That's basically just that thing about if I don't do this, I'll probably be sitting on the street somewhere on drugs or fucked up somewhere because now my brother is sick and he has cancer and there's only three of us left. So hopefully he can pull out of it, but it's been a tight fight for him, so it's kind of on edge. And in order for me to keep my sanity, I have to stay busy. I have to keep working on music. So the creativity is giving you a way of dealing with these really tough, hard situations. Really dark situations. And it's making me more and more in a space where I'm by myself. It was easy before. to finish this record and before because my brother was living in the house with me. But now I'm in the house by myself with just two dogs. So it's even harder because I feel like I'm kind of trapped in a cage and I can't focus all the time. So I'm just thinking about how to work now. So I think I work better if I start in the daytime and work on music and then at night maybe I go to the gym and watch movies or some shit. Well, I'm going to play the last record that we're going to talk about and I think it's actually quite fairly significant in a way. Thinking of your face reminds me of those special times And I light a candle and you cross my mind There's many elements you bring to my life So I wanted to talk about this particular track because it seems like it's a very common theme in your work is positivity. And this is about good vibes. And, you know, you're talking about a hard situation there and how you're making music. Like, why do you think it is important to have positive messages in your music? I feel like I'm here for a reason, and if I'm not saying something positive with all the other bullshit that's being said in the United States musically, then I'm defeating my purpose, and I'm going against the reason why I'm given the opportunity to make music for whatever reason and for wherever the power comes from. And I listen to a lot of songs. I listen to a lot of music and I listen to a lot of artists when I was a kid that only spoke about important shit. And they wrote songs in a way that made you think differently and made you think other than I want to slap that ass, fuck you, smoke a blunt, look at my new car, all that other bullshit. baby, you're so fine or whatever the bullshit is that we sometimes write about. And I'm guilty of that too sometimes, just writing about relationships. But at some point, I think that it's important to write about things to make your audience feel better. And that's what I like, you know. For sure. And I mean, it kind of reminds me in a way of something like Roy Ayers, you know, where he's often got his music full of positive energy. But also as well, you know, just quite big themes that, you know, can relate to everyone. Yeah, yeah. It's interesting you said that because I'm supposed to be... connecting with him soon because we're so he said it to me last time and we gotta write something together man we gotta write together so I'm really looking forward to that because I feel like he's another mentor of mine that I've always wanted to work and God the creator works in mysterious ways I've been put with all these great people who I really love have always wanted to work with I think the only person or type of artist that I haven't worked with is a jazz artist, like a Herbie Hancock or some shit like that, you know. But I'm happy because if I could work with somebody like a Roy Ayers. I think we're on a similar page, you know, and I've learned from him and other artists that speak consciously about the way they write. Do you feel that, you know, your career has sort of been guided by your faith in some ways? I think so. Yeah. I mean, there's a reason why the people who I love the most are dying around me and it hurts and it's hard for me to... to get through sometimes. And the day I watch a movie and it has me in tears because of something that happens in the movie. So I know that the creator has me here for some reason and I have to just keep trying to fulfill that and write in a way that empowers people. You've been making music for nearly 40 years now. I just wondered, someone who's been doing it as long as you, Is there anything you find hard about it still? Yes. What is that? Playing solo at a keyboard, piano, whatever. I still find it hard because I'm not practicing all the time and I feel like I need to... studying more. When I first started playing piano, it was only two years that I got my first gig. So I went straight on the road with Enchantment. I'd only been playing piano about almost three years, two and a half years. So three years and you were out there playing in front of people. Out there. Big concerts. Masonic Temple. After that, I came home and I worked with RJ's latest arrival. I went on tour with that band. And after that, I met George Clinton, and it was 10 years strong. What's not was was before George Clinton. So I never really had the chance to, like my cousin, Greg Fillingames, he's a keyboard player that's been playing since he was five. I had to just keep learning at the time between gigs, between tours. So that's how it's been working for me. My brother and I have always been playing together in clubs and jazz clubs and different dates. But I feel like I just still need to get more accomplished at that. It's fascinating to me that, you know, you can do something for so long and still feel like you've got more to learn and more to go forward. I guess it never really stops, does it? It doesn't. I mean, a lot of my friends who are keyboard players came out of church and I was raised in a Catholic church. Whatever. We're there and they're, you know, and I'm sitting there. I never learned the gospel. They've got a head start, those guys. They've got a head start, man. But. They don't have the funk that I bring, so they're missing that part because when I play funk that I play, it's different than they don't play funk like me because they don't know that side of it. So they miss that whole era of funk that I got. Well, that's... a big one like what is the secret to playing funk because that is something that is elusive i don't know i guess you gotta just shit on yourself a couple times you know how stinky shit's gotta be you know you gotta be some you know piss on yourself whatever you know smoke some weed you know all of that shit you gotta get down dirty you know it's just like you know you gotta get on stage with some other guys that just Drag the shit, you know play crazy shit around up, you know, you got I was playing with team people on stage So I had to really I was playing next to Eddie Hazel so I had to really know how to fall behind and and play in between and we're not to play with and the important thing is we're not play it's not always playing it's not playing sometimes that's cool about fun yeah i guess it's such a thin line between ultra tight and i'm ultra sloppy yeah like you go too far one way it's over Exactly. Well, finally, I just wondered, you know, you've achieved an enormous amount in your career, but what do you still want to achieve? I still want to make a jazz record. Yeah, definitely. I still want to make a jazz record. I think I really love jazz and I don't care what it is. I mean, I just made a jazz record with Will Sessions and it's a fusion jazz record. and that's cool because it's out there. Some of the stuff I play, I'm like, ugh. And then some of them, I'm like, oh, shit, that's really cool. It's called Survive. It's really funky. And then I still want to go back and study with some people. I want to study jazz, and I want to study gospel, and I just want to keep learning. I just want to keep learning. Soundcheck. Sometimes, sometimes you. Sometimes, sometimes. Sometimes, sometimes yes. Sometimes, sometimes no. Sometimes, rock and roll. Sometimes. Disco Sometimes Cause I get moody Sometimes Sometimes Can't get you out of my head Sometimes
