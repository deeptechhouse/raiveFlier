Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Ropline, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisors Exchange. as an advisor. Our guest this week is Darren Hughes, who's best known as the force behind the iconic We Love Parties in Ibiza, first at Space and as of this summer at Sankey's. In conversation with Carlos Hawthorne on the island earlier this summer, he made clear that that's only part of his history, with a story that stretches back to the famed Liverpool night cream. Darren Hughes is a name that's bound to mean different things to different generations of ravers. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. An Exchange with Darren Hughes is up next. you So yeah, first we'll start with your first party at Sankey's last week. How did that feel? How did it go? It was a lot of different things. It was nice to get it, I guess, out of the way, if that's an appropriate way to describe it. But, you know, it was a bit of a rollercoaster ride for the last few months. and maybe not go into all of the feelings and all the different factors going into it, from coming out of space and going into sand kiosks, but it was a big relief to actually get to the heart of what it's all about really, and it was putting on a party, you know. So it was, yeah, it was one down, officially, I guess it just kind of put the line in the sand really, you know, we've started. So yeah, overall I was pleased with the party. I guess I'm apprehensive about a lot of things but I'd had enough time, a couple of months preparing for it which is not ideal in terms of what I really would have liked to have achieved in terms of the time period. I've had six months to prepare for it but it is what it is and it is a party at the end of the day. you know, that's what it was. You know, very happy with it overall. Looking forward to getting to the next one. I mean, if you'd been asked five years ago that you'd be running We Love at another club on the island, I mean, what would you have said? I would probably have said, it's not even crossed my mind, five years ago, that would probably have been true. Maybe two or three years ago. it would have been starting to become on the radar. But still, yeah, five years ago, I definitely wouldn't have anticipated the change. So you were considering in more recent years the possibility of moving it to another venue? Yeah, I guess, you know, behind the scenes for the last... We've all known it's based from, you know, the promoters, the staff, you know, from the top down, from Pepe to Barman, Cleaners, promoters, DJs, you know, we've all been aware that... that 2016 will be the last summer at Space with Pepe holding the reins, I guess, you know, as the leaseholder after that. So, yeah, this summer and next summer would have been the last summers anyway at Space in terms of how it exists right now. And, yeah, you know, at that point, I guess I'd be more and more mindful of... the change, whatever happens, you know, the lease then goes back to Matutis and Matutis' family. And at that point, the future was difficult to try and get a grasp on. And therefore, you know, that played a large part in me deciding to try and direct, I guess, my own. future as opposed to waiting to next summer, which, yeah, it was a difficult, difficult decision to make, but it had to be done. The finishing line was always there in front of me. I decided to change now as opposed to waiting. I suppose there'd be people that would say 17 years at Space, we love in Space, it came as a package. Was there ever a time when you considered just calling it a day and just saying, no, new thing, completely new project? Yeah, I guess, you know, significantly. two and a half years ago, my family, partners, Mark and Sarah Broadbent, moved on from the business, wanted to change, you know, their own future. And that was a significant time for me. I had to do some soul searching then about how. The impact that that would have on me, I guess more importantly, how to move that forward at that point. I guess it's fair to say that I'd sat back for far too long anyway up to that point. It was a bit of a wake-up call, a lot of a wake-up call even. Me and my wife's got a long story short. We'd had children. First child came 12 years ago, the next one eight years ago, and I guess as every year passed from then, it was a significant change for me. If I'd have been based on the island full time, we'd have been living here, as Mark and Sarah were. I think that things wouldn't have worked out quite the way they did. Maybe we would have, almost definitely would have been in there still together. and the future would have been our future together. But, you know, it was what it was. It being a family change was, I guess, kind of the biggest hurdle. But, you know, I decided that I wanted to carry on. There wasn't an idea about, you know, changing then or stopping. Decided to give it another go, you know, and worked with Lynn Cosgrove and Safehouse last year for the one summer, which... which was okay. It was nice to work with those guys. It kind of like steadied the ship, I guess. You know, I had more support from those guys and we mucked in together, but it still wasn't starting to feel right, really, through the summer. So, yeah, at that point, I kind of knew that, you know, changes were afoot. And even to the very end, you know, I was excited when... Ragamundo Luciano came to the table back in January. We were planning for it to be a union, a party, you know, bringing something that me and Juan Narenas had really talked long and hard about for a few years, whether it be Luciano, whether it had been localized, whoever, you know, a dream team member, Massio Plex. We tried to... We worked on a few of the big boys, ones that we thought we could still be interested in coming in and sharing the, I guess, the Sunday sharing the pie, as it were. When that deal was coming off Lucha, I was very excited about it. It was difficult. I tried to work the guy for years, so it was difficult. It was difficult to try and gel the two things together. Less from their side, if I'm truthful with you. We were both excited about it, but other things, other people couldn't get their hands around it. I don't want to go too deeply into that, but if there'd have been enough will there by everybody concerned, I wouldn't have changed. I would have stayed. It was an exciting proposition, alas. Yeah. Got long, short, short. They couldn't be put together, you know, in the end, which is why I decided to take my own destiny into my own hands and move off, you know, just Yeah, you've settled with Sankey's. How did the conversation start with them? I guess the conversation with Sankey's was in large part a conversation with Danny, Danny Whittle, who was a very close friend of mine and somebody that we were working together, or we had worked together for quite a long time. Danny was involved at the beginning of... home at Space, off the back of home in London, which I left Cream to do. And, you know, Danny was, you know, a significant factor in going to Space when I'd left Cream. So we started home at Space in 1999. No matter how bad and unsuccessful a failure home was in London, home here... whether it was called Home, whether it was called We Love, whether it was called Sundays at Space, didn't impact upon what was going on there. The idea was, you know, in retrospect, the idea was stronger than whatever name we brought to the table to do a 22-hour party at a venue that was, you know, an after-party venue, was the sticky thing, you know. So Danny... Danny was involved at the beginning. His idea, to be fair, to do a 22-hour party. I remember the conversations I had with Danny about, at that time, I was trying to convince him that we should be doing Pasha as well as space, or even Pasha on its own, if I'm true with you. Ironically, 12 months later, Danny goes to work with Passion and the rest is history there. And I'm at Space 2. But, you know, the relationship is a deep one with Danny and all the way through the good years at Space to the, you know, the last couple of years, which then started to, you know, things were changing. As I say, Mark has said it, we're moving on. So all the time me and Danny would talk, not with a plan about the future, not with, I guess, a secret plan packed to come together, but the winter this year was difficult for me personally and Danny was always there next to me, always at the end of the phone, always as a friend. And, you know, I guess as we got closer to the realisation that it was... probably the right time for me to make a move. Sankis was the obvious place because of Danny's relationship with David, for instance, and Sankis itself. I'd like the venue anyway. Always been impressed by it. The fact that David had managed to get the venue open, keep the venue open. And, you know, it's an impressive thing. Yeah. Also, I guess the venue itself was appealing to me because it came with less pressure in terms of the numbers. It kind of suited where my head was, I guess. And off the back of that, the people involved, you know, Danny, David, it just made sense, you know. A very quick decision, you know, by second week, third week of March. You know, we talked, not just as friends, but as the potential to come together, or for me to take, go into the tankers with Wheelove to make an announcement on the 1st of April. It was that quick. So if Danny wasn't there having the conversations with me, I guess being a friend and a comrade at that time, probably we wouldn't have made the decision to move. which, you know, in retrospect, I'm glad he was. It's the right thing. No matter what goes on in the future, alas, you know, my relationship or my time at Space had come to an end, you know. It had come to an end. So, yeah, it was with a heavy heart, but... Not in a way that I was feeling like, am I doing the right thing? Just, yeah. It's been a big part of my life, but that's finished. Did you feel at all apprehensive about running the party on Wednesdays? Yeah, I mean, everything is a change. It's like, I remember a conversation I had with Michelle, my wife, she's like... When I first told her it wasn't going to be in a Sunday, it was going to be in a Wednesday, she's like, what? Like institutionalised Sundays, you know. But, you know, I guess that came out. The whole change, not just venue, but night of the week, came out a lot. It was strange. The last few years at Space, I'd probably say we've endured, or came across, as much feedback, press coverage, whatever. Not negative, but as much, not positive, but as much as positive. And I guess at the very end, when I had made the announcement and it was moving, at that point, all of a sudden, there was an outpouring of, well, social media-wise, there was an outpouring of, I guess, strong feelings, you know? Feelings of people reminiscing, almost mourning what was. to some extent, and also people that were, I guess, celebrating what had gone down for the previous 17 years, you know. So, you know, the change was big for me, and obviously a lot of people felt quite strongly about it too. But whether it would be going to do a Wednesday or a Monday or whatever... I'm quite glad that I didn't have the opportunity to go or didn't force an opportunity to go to Sanky's on a Sunday. Quite happy for Steve to have, you know, made his mark on a Sunday. You know, Sundays at Sanky's is even worse, you know. It's like... There wasn't a conversation about, right, what would you like to do day-wise? Whatever it had been, I'd have gone for. Because the change is big enough, why quibble about a night? There's no easy night, there's no... you know, there's no easy party. It's like, whatever it is, we'll get on with it. In terms of the party itself, the bookings, the visual aesthetic, is that going to be similar to the way you're doing it at Space? Big question. I guess the... Listen, whether the party was called We Love Sankers or whatever, you know, We Love was a, I guess, a moniker that... still means a lot to me, but whatever it's been in space. It's been, I guess, at the heart of it, it's been quite a while, I'm true to you, for quite a few years, that I've been right in the middle of the programme. Of course, I've been around it and directing it, but, you know, Mark was around up to two years ago, you know, he was right at the forefront of that. And when Ed gone, Andy, his brother Andy Livesay, also, you know, so... I guess it's now it's, in a way, it's been one of the best things really because it's propelled me to get right stuck back in the middle of it again. And whatever it is or it will be, it's completely different from what was happening in space. There's a lot of reasons for that. And, you know, it's difficult to try and sum up. I want it to be the best it can. I'll still want to. If we can be judged on, at the end of the season, on, I guess, the breadth and spectrum of the type of DJs and artists. For me, that's a similarity. Whatever we did with this bass, I think it was at its best when the breadth of the music we were offering the artists was broad. And that is what I'm always trying to do because that's back to the early days of Cream. If we had Frankie Norcross and David Morales in one room and Andrew Weatherall in another room, then that was always the most pleasing thing for me overall. And I hope that that will come across at the end of the summer and we'll be judging on similar values. You mentioned Cream there. Your career in dance music started a long time before We Love. How did you first get involved in clubbing in the industry? When I finished uni in Manchester in 1990, already a massive clubber, I guess, back from being 16, 17. I was born in Chester, brought up in Chester, and there wasn't a lot going on in Chester, you know. So I'd always had to get out of town to go and discover, I guess, discover things that weren't high street and whatever, running the mill, you know, I guess. kebab house post club fighting vibe you know it was not not good so you know it kind of started early for me in terms of searching out for clubs outside of chester by the time i went to uni manchester and obviously had a lot of other from the hussy end and other other events over there that were that were happening moved back home to chester for six months but then moved to liverpool at the end of, beginning of 91 and following my girlfriend who was at college there, at art college. That was the start of me moving to Liverpool, starting to meet people there. And obviously being a clubber, I started to meet people in Liverpool, you know, went to Quadrant Park a lot, met James Barton, you know, the most key, who, you know, Andy Carroll was his partner at the time. And, you know, James was doing things from... I knew his history in Liverpool. I was still... I'd had no experience of doing parties, but, you know, I got buddy with James. James was doing a few things. He did Quadrant Park and was doing the 051 Club. The 051 Club has set itself up as a, I guess, a Liverpool versus the Hattie Ender. Never was that. It wasn't going to be that. I decided to do two parties, birthday parties, for my girlfriend and one other friend. Six months before I approached James to come out of the 051 and do a night ourselves, those two parties were important because we were both in the small room at what became Cream, at Waston Move Square, the annex, and that's when the seed was sown. That's when me and James started to think about and talk about what could we start something there. I guess I convinced him. I guess he had more to lose than me. He was earning good money, doing well at the 051. And anyway, quite long story short, I nagged him for that long. We decided we'd take a punt on it and started cream. No idea, obviously, at the time what we were going to be, but it was just the right time, the right place. There was a few partners involved at the beginning, very quickly, like Andy Carroll, a couple of other people, that fell by the wayside, and I guess then myself and James kind of, you know, carried on together. I mean, it was a pretty popular party right from the beginning. I mean, how do you reflect back on those early years? Oh, I just, I could consider it as obviously a very... important time of my life I always thought that each week from starting it in 1992 in October 1992 that the following week will probably be the end you know from going from signing on £21.50 a week to all of a sudden having a you know a significant for me then a significant amount of money you know whether it be £500 £1000 whatever it was we were pulling out each week, it was one thing. It probably took me a good year before I had the confidence to know that this wasn't going to go away quickly. Not to the extent where it would mushroom to what it did, but yes, it was a special time, you know, to have worked out the way it did. There was a lot of factors, you know, why it worked. And at the time, difficult to see that while you're in the middle of it. But, you know, looking back, especially when I left Creamy 98, looking back at it, and then comparing that to home in London, which is what I'd left Creamy to go and do. Well, we talked about that much, but, you know, the whole leaving cream thing, it was always about how difficult it was personally. I mean, James, you know, quite an acrimonious split. It took us a long time to both get over that. You know, he was the best man at the wedding, he was my best friend. It was difficult, very difficult. But, you know, the truth is, you know, I was behind the scenes for about a year. I just had to convince James that what was going to go on in London with a guy called Ron McCullough, who was behind the home thing, should be a cream. We should do that together with cream. James never wanted to do that. And ultimately, I decided I had to go and try it myself. Yeah, you know, all I can remember from the Cream Days outside at the very end is just how lucky we both were to have started something that became what it did off the back of nothing, you know, off the back of a mashbox, you know. And, yeah, difficult to remember what you learn in those times. It was kind of reacting to what was going on, like a, I don't know, like a sandstorm or something. Yeah, looking back at it now, overall, I consider myself as very, very lucky to have had that at that time. I mean, what were those key factors that made it such a success? I don't think Cream could have become Cream if the Hacienda was in full flight, if I'm truthful with you. We'd never set up to try and compete with Hacienda. It would have been impossible. By the time we had opened up the club in 92, October 92... The Hacienda was not the Hacienda any more than anyway. It was open still. But I guess James had had, you know, from a young age, was always a bit of a lad. Tickets out, putting on parties, managing, you know, managing a couple of bands, K-class, enjoyed, put gigs on. So he was a kind of, you know, Jack the Lad, local. kind of local hero, I guess. It's family, but, you know, the Bartons are a big family in Liverpool, you know. There's a lot of love for them, just salt of the earth, gorgeous people. And I guess, for me, outside of coming in, ex-student, I guess a lunatic in a way, you know, kind of... like worked solidly you know like non-stop so people tell me now anyway looking back at that I don't know what they mean but I kind of know what they mean I guess coming from a non-Liverpool student, arty kind of... That's where my friends were in Liverpool anyway, my girlfriend and her parents. Those two things coming together really, the fact that we managed to put, I guess, Scouters with an arty kind of college group of people together and we kept it small from when we launched it up until the next three or four months. The gel of those two groups of people, I guess that's what Hacienda had done when it's in its heyday, but this was the real key thing. That's what allowed it to bloom. And I guess if there would have been something, like I say, if Hacienda was still firing all cylinders, we probably wouldn't have enjoyed that success in the same way. you know, because all of a sudden then it became not just a Liverpool event, then, you know, we started to, you know, spend a lot of money advertising, you know, across the North nationally and, you know, then it exploded, you know. That's when people were coming in with coach loads, like, big numbers. So, yeah. The union between James and, I guess, his crew and me and my crew, really. and a safe environment without any, for a long time anyway, without any trouble whatsoever. And it's just, yeah, Liverpool was due, I guess, a success, I guess, you know. you know, 10 years later, 5 years even, 10 years later, Liverpool was unrecognisable to me. When I'd left in '98, going back a few years later, it's like, "God, we didn't have any of this when we started the cream." And all of a sudden now it's Liverpool won, everything, the whole thing, you know, city of culture, all that. The fact that we didn't have all that beginning, I think, was part of the reason why it was a bit of a jewel in the crown, I guess, you know, kind of thing. Or, yeah, maybe an oasis in the desert. Maybe it was a better description. So, yeah, you left Cream in 1998 to start home, and you started home in Sydney, and then in London, Ibiza, and then also Homeland Festival. You must have been very busy around that time. Yeah, I guess so, in 98 we had just completed the first the first cream fills you know and that was just that was that with the mean for there so By the time I left a month later, the relationship with the Moon Fiddler kind of stayed with me because one of the people who were involved with the Moon Fiddler and the Home London Project was a guy called John Reynolds. So I'd naturally aligned myself with John through going to work with Ron. So, of course, a long story short, you know, we'd... We'd already then, we'd been leaving, we'd already forward planning home. London was going to open in October 1999, but we'd already done a summer then, leading up to then, with Home and Space. So we'd operated a summer at Space, which was ace, but from the beginning was brilliant, lucky, whatever, right time, place again. whether it was called Home at Space or not. And Home Sydney had also opened up before Home London, so... The homeland was the last thing to land. Twelve months later, then we were on with doing homelands, you know. The festival, the mean field, which we'd obviously not, we kept the site down south in Winchester, which is the site of the first cream fields, and then, you know, the rest is really James had carried on with cream fields, moved it up north, logically. But, yeah, you know, at that time, Mark and Sarah, my ex-partners at... at space, at Willow at space, were already in line with me. They'd been running cream amnesia up until that point, so they joined me then, we went to Sydney, as it happened, for a few years, and then we pulled them back out of Sydney. Sydney was, you know, the whole, what we were getting up to then, all of it, except for her in London, was brilliant. Alas, Home London was such a disaster financially for Ron and his partner that it ended up bringing the whole thing down two years later. You know, his whole business, not just Home London, but their whole business, which was like 30 operations in Scotland and everywhere else. So, yeah, we were busy. I remember, you know, me, Mark and Sarah plotted up in London in a little office. As soon as we would get Homeland vetted and completed, one week later, we're all out here. Like, in a two-week period, we're opening up space. It's like hermit space, then we love space. So, yeah, we just got away with it by the skin of our teeth, it felt, you know. For those that don't know, Home London was a seven-storey nightclub in the heart of London's West End. Leicester Square. Number one Leicester Square. It's an amazing address. Indeed. It seems like an incredible place to have a club of that size. Why didn't it work? Looking back at it, me trying to talk James Bartlett while I was at Creaming to... joining Ron McCulloch with his plan to then, which would have meant obviously of diluting what cream was, diluting our ownership of it, maybe becoming equal partners, but whatever. James made the right decision. Ultimately, I was too blind. There were other reasons why I wanted it to happen. James wasn't in Liverpool a lot at that time. He was running Deconstruction, well, Pedder Bay and Art Deconstruction Records, and there was a lot of infighting between him and the venue, the leaseholder in Liverpool, loads of bullshit. A lot of that was going on, but I tried hard and hard and hard to persuade James for us to do this, but enough was enough. I wanted to give it a go. I knew that I needed to do it. It never occurred to me, I guess because it was such a wrench to come out of cream, I guess I never looked at the... No one did, to be fair. It wasn't until I'd left, I'd gone in and the door opened, if I'm truthful with you, a year later, that I realised that we were up against it. Let's just go there. £12-13 million investment. from Rom and his company in a seven-storey, four-tiered club. private members bar on the fifth floor, restaurants on the sixth floor. You know, it was on paper, and because of its, I guess its design and its, you know, Ron had put his money where his mouth was with things that I wanted to do in a club with the sound system that I wanted, and in all truth, it sounds ridiculous now, especially you, you all know more than me about London, you know. It, to have not really considered what... We were going into, me as a, I guess a promoter, but if I'm truthful with you, Ron as the person behind it, you know, from the very beginning, it's all, you know, in the background. I wasn't aware of it, but slowly but surely it became so obvious that Westminster Council and Westminster Police Force were so dead against it. and run roughshod over all of it continuously. And it was, I guess it was doomed to fail before it opened. And I guess I was so not close to the middle of it because of me, but whatever factors me leaving my head being in, I guess just concentrating on what I was bringing to the table. and I suspect people must have thought we were mad. Alas, it was never given. The upside of it being in Leicester Square, if the authorities were not set against it from the beginning, maybe it would have had more of a chance, maybe. But looking back, yeah, I guess most people would say, how was that ever going to work, you know, without getting into detail. I think the reason why the venue was closed down... The reason it was given by Westminster Council and police force was it was overrun with drugs. It's the opposite because it was never going to be allowed to become that type of place. Ironically, the best thing about home London for me was Fabric because every week I would dive out of home. I'd be into Fabric by ten past two. We had to close at two o'clock. Every week on a Saturday, I would be in Fabric by ten past quarter past two, having the time of my life for the whole time I was there. And I learnt more by enjoying myself at Fabric, I guess, for me personally, than what I ever did. OK, the failing at home was a big learning curve for me too. but Fabric was awesome to have been a part of Fabric was almost worth failing at home seriously it was it was awesome you know So home was finishing at 2am? Yeah, starting at 2am, absolutely. We tried to get 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, now and again, maybe every other month they managed to get a 3 or 4 o'clock extension, but it was always, people are going to stay later in clubs if it's got all of the ingredients that make you want to stay in a club later. Compared to what we were doing, we launched at the same time as Fabric, almost exactly the same time. And it's just the diametric opposite, really, of what was right and what was wrong, you know? So... Yeah, everything was set against it. But thank God for Fabric and Keith Riley. You switched your attention to Ibiza. Had you spent a lot of time there beforehand? Yeah, me and James came out with him, all the respective girlfriends at the time in 1990. We came out again in 91. Obviously, we'd become friends at that point. I started to do a bit of work for him back in Liverpool. Ibiza experience was with those two first summers we were staying over in San Antonio and you know we'd gone to a few venues here having a lovely time and the time cream opened a year later so we opened October 1993 by the summer of 1993 we did two parties with Jose Padilla at Pasha and two after parties at Space. That was our first experience here, putting on parties, I guess. One of those two parties at Space was... I'm sorry that I've told it a few times, but it's funny anyway. I'll recount it again now. Came a couple of others, Tom and Ed were DJing for me on the terrace. So, yeah, I'm at Pike's Hotel. Didn't even get to there after Pasha. and I went back there. Got a phone call off Jim King, you know, close to me and James, who are working with us at Cream. He said, Daz, you never guess what. Pepe's just come over and said Tom and I kicked him off and told him it was terrible and put David Morales on. I'm like, oh. It took me 15 years to get Chomina back here. After that, I'd say she did. So, but, you know, that's how green we were as well, you know. It's like, but, yeah, it started then, you know. The following year, we did, you know, the following two years, we did eight parties in 94 coup. before it changed to privilege the following year. And then we did a season as privilege there. And then we made the move to Amnesia. The cream was 96. We were in there then. And obviously that was a big part of our summer by that stage. And it's still heavily student-influenced, Liverpool, like most cities are, you know, even now, I guess, you know, where clubbing's concerned. And, yeah, it was an extension of what we were doing in Liverpool, you know, really. I guess we were part of that rollercoaster of British club promoters coming to Ibiza, filling up their summon, and by the time you're finished going back, all the students are back, and then you're off again end of September onwards, so It felt like a natural progression for us, you know. It kind of filled out our year perfectly. Musically, Cream was known for its, by the end especially, and looking at the party now, and Amnesia, known for its trance, known for its big EDM these days as well. But We Love has never gone down that route. No. Musically, were you more inclined towards... The kind of more underground house and tech life? Yeah, it's difficult. I don't want to... Cream, for me, by the beginning of 1997... Not cream, me with it, I guess. Yeah, James was still influential in terms of what the line-up of what we were doing, putting together, but this was me at the forefront of it. I can only blame myself, I guess, because at that point, OK... The Significant Residency at that time, with Paul Oakenfall, was a commercial trance-ish sound then. It still worked, it still fitted. It didn't feel wrong, it felt... felt brilliant in a lot of ways however you know it kind of that was the no disrespect to Paul far from it and you know what we were doing at Cream but it was I already felt that we turned a curve or hit the curve at Cream by that point and that we needed to do one thing that will cover that type of the market the more commercial ends of the market anyway, with one person in one room that was at least the best of all of that, as opposed to getting into what I started to feel was the case, booking artists more for bums on seats than for the right reason. You know, I talk about some of the names. There was far too many times when I was booking... people like Jeremy Healy or Boy George or John O'Pleas, but you know, that end of the market, not for the right reasons, anyway, not totally. So, yeah, I guess that was my lean towards it, but I knew then at that point that we needed to change, something needed to happen because I didn't want it to have to go down that road and it was already feeling uncomfortable and I'd be the person, I guess, who would. I guess because I was the main programmer that would get... It was feeling uncomfortable with me. So it was always a matter of time really before something had to change, you know, and that's why I was pushing for London as well with James. I wanted something else to happen. I didn't want to start to be just another club. Well, I guess when I'd left by 98, it was going to be an opportunity. You know, home London, we had Paul as a key resident. We tried it there too. You know, it wasn't the same thing. And I guess the writing was on the wall for me. The opportunity with space, the fact that we were doing homelands by that point, Sydney too, home Sydney. Definitely between space, home and space, and we love space and homelands, it was the opportunity to get, to not go down a road that didn't feel right with me or comfortable, you know. It was the obvious way, I guess, for Cream to go. It's not really my, it's not right really for me to talk about what Cream and I went on to do. They did what they had to do. You know, in Liverpool, they align themselves strongly with Bogdout. Bogdout was somebody that I'd always tried to get in there. The pals of mine, back from being in the Union of Manchester, you know, going to Justin Robertson's night, most excellent, was a big part of my, I guess, upbringing in Manchester. So that was, I guess, Kareem's way of... filling some of the gap that I'd left but most of that gap meant going down a more commercial route I guess and trance whatever say EDM EDM wasn't around at that point I hate that term anyway don't even know what it means sounds a bit naff but there's only two types of music good and bad And I guess by the time that I was starting to make my way out of Creem, it was tipping over to, for me anyway, to the other way. I don't really want to sound disrespectful to Creem in any way. You know, to be fair, Creem's probably been a lot more successful without me than when I was there generally, nationally, internationally. I don't think you can be that successful without. being closer to the middle ground, you know. But when you found yourself at Space, booking Morehouse and Techno, you felt comfortable again? Oh, yeah, I did, yep, absolutely. The festival was important in the UK with Space for me because it allowed us to try different things out. We could do a lot of other. Worked with a lot of other genres, whether it was like straight out now indie rock bands, whatever, main stage to work with, say, Leo at the end, you know, movements. There was a lot, like, working with Giles Peterson, presenting stages, Radio 1 on a book commercial tip. It was like, it did us a lot of favour. That was a real big string to our bow here, and we benefited that. Maybe not clearly to everybody, but there was a lot of benefit. The relationships we were having in the UK still, even though it was out of cream, homeowners allowed us to continue. But space specifically, you know, the first two years, okay, let's say the year 2000. We had 16 shows. There was... Sasha did seven. Carl Cox did eight. Danny Tornado did seven. Lauren Carney did six. You know, and the things around it, that was just like... It felt like it was another cream for me. I couldn't believe it was happening again. And I still can't believe it happened again. And nobody deserved to have two of those, and I did. You know, it was... not down to me, down to the circumstances, just the right... It just worked and it was all of a sudden, it was so... It was open again for us to do exactly what we wanted, but I guess, yeah, without pressure. It was a wonderful time, those first few years, you know. To have found another one, again, like I say, I felt very, like, double, double blessed, double lucky to have a cream the way it was and then what looked as if it was going to be another. Another blessing, yeah. You mentioned all those names there who obviously were stars then but have gone on to become real superstars. But 1999 was a big year on the island. Circa Loco Cocoon, We Love. It started these parties that weren't solely about the superstar DJ. They were people-led. Yeah, I mean, you know, I guess they were superstars then, but... If you compare it, fast forward to 2015, your idea of a superstar DJ, you've got the big boys on the island now. I guess Carl is the one not like everybody. Carl Cossey is, for me, unique on the island. He's unique everywhere. Back then... When we started, take 1999-2000, Carl, Sasha, Danny, Laurent, the four people I mentioned, were probably there or thereabouts with each other in terms of profile, whatever. No disrespect to the other three, but Carl took Ibiza by the throat, I guess, and nobody could have imagined that it would have... what could have happened to him over the following years to where he is now. It's just that was the way to do it. But Sasha was a part of it from the beginning. When the home thing failed in London, Sasha was, by 2001, Sasha got quite significantly involved with me in the conversations I was having with Space. Not as a partner, but close. Those relationships were strong. Me and Daddy at that time were strong as well, you know. And it was still a special time. It almost felt like you could do no wrong in a way that was just the right time. There wasn't a lot... It didn't feel as if there was a lot of... You didn't have to push anybody. Everyone wanted to be almost... a part of it you know so again the superstars that is a different thing now I guess if I think superstars now I'm thinking more this EDM thing that you think of you know Avicii, Etel, Eshwar whatever that type of thing and superstars but Loco Dice wouldn't be calling himself a superstar he is but It's almost like a dirty word superstar, isn't it? You know? But, yeah, that's how I feel about that, you know? Yeah, Wheel of Fandit's niche were these incredible 22-hour events you'd run from 8am to 6am. Yeah. I mean, what was the atmosphere like at these events? The start, you know, in 1999... But the truth is, it took me a while to get my head around the idea. Danny, I mentioned Danny Whistler again, Danny was with me at the time, part of whatever you want to call it, Danny was with me. I guess he had more of an idea of what it could be than I did. Of course, you know, I love spaces and venues. but it was difficult for me to see how we could get from operation on a Sunday, a club that had been starting at eight in the morning but really wrapped up by four or five, maximum six o'clock in the afternoon. So for them to carry on, tell you what it felt like, the 22-hour thing felt like three parties in one. They wanted to continue to harness what was going on as an after party. that we'd been able to operate the inside of the space for people who didn't want to be on the terrace from first thing in the morning, but then also operate what we'd seen, the terrace, this, you know, halcyon outdoor lo-fi, I guess, you know, breakfast on the bar there kind of vibe, not to ruin that, just to make it a bit more serious. and then have, trying to extend it into the evenings, you had the terrace mainly focused evening, six, seven, eight o'clock in the evening until midnight. That was part two for it for us, and then from midnight onwards, the terrace closing, which was the case up until 2005, before the roof went on. Then we had... the third kind of part of the show, which was a proper club, but to all intents and purposes, a club that you knew people would be able to associate with, which was mainly based around the discotheque of the inside room. So, yeah, it was, it felt like three in one, you know, and we, for a few years, we looked at it in that way. We'd have... people helping to promote the morning with us in terms of the inside. We work with lots of different people. Rob Starr comes to mind and Geddes and Joe Upton were all quite important in the early years, helping us get this after thing put its way. No matter how young we might have been then, we were young enough to be able to do... All of us had to do a 22-hour thing week in, week out ourselves. We had to compartmentalise it, I guess. At the same time, also trying to tie everything down and make it look like it was a three-tiered event by trying to keep it rolling. I guess it probably took two years of that for us then to start to see it as one whole. So by the time 2000 came, 2001, up to 2005, then I see that the party was one party as opposed to trying to break it down. And at that point, then it really started to roll, you know, which had Pepe, Pepe Rosillo had started to get an understanding that this wasn't a blip, it wasn't going to be going away quickly. So therefore he was... you know, critically, he was incentivised enough, you know, excited enough to be able to put money into the club, to up the ante with it, you know, sound system-wise, decor-wise, putting money where his mouth was, I guess, you know, which was critical because then we started to raise our game and I guess, even though it's not for me to say, I guess... Circle Oco Boys, DC10, Cocoon, Sven, all, OK, might not be 22-hour parties, but we were all different in our own ways. But I guess we all became, learned how to become serious. The relationships with the venue owners were critical, obviously for me and Space. I'm sure, you know, Andrea and they're, you know, the owner of DC10 and Martin, Ferrer and Sven. The early years were important in getting this foundation. I'm sure there was no great plan with those two parties either. I've talked about Van Veer a few times over the years and it just, I was hardly aware. I knew of course DC 102 and Cuckoon, but I wasn't. I was too busy doing my own thing to totally understand what they were up to, but I think it's interesting you talk about those three things. Quite nice as well for me, but we were all, I guess, a similar-ish journey. The relationship with the venue was critical and I guess we all benefited from that in the long run, you know. So a 22-hour party, are you on your feet the whole time? I'm hell. Or what the hell then? No, I'll tell you what used to happen. Sarah Broadbent was on her feet the whole time for years. She was like the proper Trojan. Me and Mark would, all the people around us, would cherry-pick, I guess, what we'd do. We'd go down in the morning, we'd... be around, help Sarah, put bosses together, get the staff in, just, you know, I guess, brainstorm the operation for the day, put the foundations down, then we'd go off at lunchtime, maybe 12, 1 o'clock, and get back to the venue for about 4 or 5 o'clock, and then we'd be in there then for the rest of the day. As every year passed, that got a little bit more difficult to do. But, yeah, it was a... Yeah, Sarah was the You brought a very diverse range of artists to the club and also some very adventurous bookings. Apex Twin stands out, Grace Jones, The Chemical Brothers, of course. I mean, are there any performances, any moments in particular that stand out? Yeah, just picking up on the one you just mentioned, Apex Twin was something me and Mark had always discussed, but it was Mark's real dream booking, yes, you know, so that's a Mark thing. He was, I'll try and answer it on behalf of him. Talking to him about it yesterday as it happened, up at Pyrex for the Immersionist Party. We'd been asked to do a few interviews since I'd announced I was going out of space. And Mark too, you know. Definitely one of his three highlights at the club. And AFX to him was a dream for him. We'd just about got away with it, I'd say. He would say, no, he would say, more go away with it. But it was brilliant. For me, Apex Twin was, you know, that's the spectrum, really. That really is, well, for us anyway, it was a real coup. And the fact that Richard loved it, that it worked so well, and Richard loved it, it wasn't expect unrealistic in what his expectations were going to be. I guess similar to Nicholas Joll when we did Nicholas Joll last year, it was a real big thing for me and Andrew. Andrew Lives, Mark's brother, it was a big thing. And it wasn't a sensation in terms of the performance, but it kind of was because it worked enough. We were so nervous about not working for Nicholas Jones, we so wanted to work, you know. And, you know, that was key too. And I guess similar to Apex Twins, you know, Grace Jones was, again, you know, awesome. of a dream gig for us, but I'll home in on that because at that time, when Grace did it, she was the main person of the whole party, who's wrapped around, you know, the anniversary. But on the terrace at that point, you know, and this is, again, the spectrum thing for me, on the terrace, up against her, who we thought was up against her. was David, was David Guetta. And, you know, he wanted to be played at the same time as her. And David was getting big then, but not what he then went on to become. 2008, yeah? It's like... It was unbelievable because the performance, the room that Grace was in, it transformed the club. It didn't feel like anything that I'd been to in Ibiza. People said, oh, this is just some of the old heads in there. This is how cool it used to be. This is Grace Jones, blah, blah, blah. But for me, just as impressive and even more so was what was going on in the other room when David Guetta was on. It's like... There were more people on the tennis than what was in the disco. You're not talking about David Guetta three, four, five years ago. It's like seven, eight years ago here. It was unbelievable. Okay, it was a very different thing. The performance is a different thing. However, it was, I guess, a sign of things to come. We could get away with being as risky, I guess, is it risky, gracious, whatever. That type of performance, more of a, I guess, a cabaret thing than a club show. And in the opposite room, David Guetta was... becoming just about to become what David Guetta was to become afterwards, you know. The last year with us, that was his last year with me. And the rest existed. So it was a special night, not just because of Grace Jones, but because of Grace Jones and David Guetta, who's always remained a really good pal. Him and his wife, you know, Cathy, they were delightful. So there's always a yin to the yang, you know. It's like... With Apex Twins, the things we were doing on the tennis team with Paul, Paul Walford was for me just as important for me because he was, at that time and place, Paul was, he'd taken up the reins that Steve Law had had before him, I guess along with James Abila too. There'd always been... to every big artist there was always a foil to that and the tennis for me then was my room I guess you know so yeah there's been some special times you know and you know there's many many many more obviously and hopefully there'll be a few more to come in the future in Sagres let's see You mentioned in 2005 when they were forced to put the roof on the terrace. Essentially the club was transformed from a daytime venue to a nightclub overnight. How did that affect the way you approached the party? So in 2005, through the winter, the roof was being erected. It was supposed to be done for when we opened up. our party but alas it hadn't been finished so we we operated four parties that year that summer without the room and ironically the roof goes on the terrace it's a month late but what Pepe had done is opened up another I guess a watered down no disrespect but poor man's version of what the terrace was We had no idea that that was going to happen until about two months before we were due to open. So I guess why I mention that is the key artist or the key resident that summer was on the terrace with Groove Armada. They were doing eight shows with us. The first three shows were on the Sunset Terrace. So by the time... Four shows in, we got the old terrace with the roof open. There was already quite a bit to try and juggle, trying to keep everybody happy before that actually opened. You know, from day one, of course it changed things, you know. We were... Again, in the same moment we started, at the beginning, 22 hours, we didn't know how things would turn out, how we were 22 hours past. We kind of went with it and had to react accordingly. And the same goes for the roof on the terrace. It changed everything. We didn't know for sure that we'd be able to have the discotheque and the terrace rolling out. club a proper club whilst how that would work with the sunset tennis it was took a few years to get a head around it quite a lot of people have said now i don't know naysayers have said that when the roof went on the space on the tennis it was the start of the end but i'm sorry whatever dramatic or gloomy. I might agree with them a little bit, but I wouldn't say not the same way. Start of the end, no start of a big change. What was before did change. It did change the feel of the club, but it was also awesome. You know, for years, maybe the next four or five years, that's where people wanted to play. Even, you know, just for the same reasons as what they used to want to play in the tennis beforehand. because it was, you know, it was, the way it was designed and the fact they could still let it light and et cetera, we still had that kind of feel of being outside, I guess, like that means tennis had become too. At the same time, it was also allowed us to have a wicket down system and operate it with air conditioning. It was a proper club room and it was, so we kind of had the best of both worlds, I guess, with that room. you know, for sure it changed things then. It was the start, I guess, of other venues operating on the island, other people looking at maybe what space was doing, you know, not one too long before Amnesty's Terrace became what it is now. And that, you know, for me, it would be the best room in Ibiza anywhere. maybe not club night, circle logo, but that room, you know, I think all serious clubbers, DJs, artists, whatever, would say the same. Ultimately, it's killer. And, you know, I guess it upped the ante. You know, then all the clubs started to put more money in, you know, clubs that maybe hadn't done before. Pash had always done it, but... I'm an easy up to Tanti for sure. I think that it kind of stepped everybody's game up. Obviously, you know, four, five years, six years later, Ushuaia opens and changes the landscape again, you know. But I guess it was, for me, it was the start of it becoming a serious business, I guess. That's what kind of summed it up for me. I mean, as a promoter on the island, you mentioned all those other clubs. I mean, how much are you keeping an eye on what everyone else is doing and competing? Again, it's many different answers to that, really. I remember more recently with the Schweyer opening, I remember being intrigued, I guess, by not just the venue itself and the operation, but the story behind it with Matutis and Pepe's relationship. In the early years, it would possibly have been discussed that he could. The conversation was happening between the two of them that, you know, that Matusis was going to do this, which is why it was just a beach ball up the road. And Pepe and Matusis were talking. Pepe didn't go for it, for whatever reasons. And I remember being, I guess, intrigued by... what I thought about the lad, Avicii, being up against us, it was like, OK, up against us, you know, while they were opening. And, you know, the impact of that was very interesting. It kind of proper shocked me, I guess, at the beginning. I was expecting to see, I don't know, a terrible thing to say this. It's not how I feel now, but I expected to see, I don't know, 4,000 or 5,000... Northern England kind of ravers, boys mostly. This anticipation, what I thought it might be, wasn't that. I started to go there, have a look, look a shwire closer, I guess, but specifically if he should know it, and realised that this was not what I anticipated it to be. Again, a bit of a wake-up call. whatever it was, it's not what I anticipated it to be. And all this, you know, for me being a bit green about that to starting to be intrigued, I guess, by it for a different reason, especially reaching his thing as opposed to other things that were going on there, was interesting. And that is what, I guess it was iconic really, but it was the start of a new thing in Ibiza, you know, a new... this EDM thing, whatever you want to call that, it truly landed at that point and it was something that had space still, opposite Ushuaia, in that area. It was important to start to comprehend it and understand it, I guess, you know, because it's there, it's on the bus, it may not think it's competition or whatever, but you can't ignore what is going on there. It's changed the landscape. And as a promoter, I imagine there's a lot of behind-the-scenes goings-on. Do you think the politics are greater today than they were when you started? I think the political arena is wider and bigger, more people involved in that, for sure. Yeah, you know, it'd be very easy to get overly wrapped up in being negative about this, that, the other. You know, how things have changed, how Ibiza right now is about the top-end VIP, you know, crowd, the effect it's having on Ibiza, becoming Americanised, I guess, becoming Miami-ised almost, you know. For sure. Whatever's happening now won't be the same in five years, seven years, eight years. My experience of it is it's cyclic, you know. Whenever it is, there's no law to it, but it goes through cycles. Whatever it is now won't be around forever. And things change, so I guess I can't afford to get too... ..wrapped up in the politics. I need to... Especially now, if I'm true with you. I guess that's bringing it back to sound, because that's why I am comfortable where I am now, even though with the change and the impact that I'm having to get my head round and liking getting my head round. It kind of feels about the right size and feel right now, the impact upon me with the political thing, what's happening in Ibiza. I feel better about where I am now and what I'm doing because it just feels more right for me now, just right now anyway. And I think for the next few years, it'll be a good place for me to be, follow the cycle and see where it's going. in a bit more of a comfortable position, I guess. So is that the plan for the next two, three, four years? I've not gone into this like I didn't go into space with a start and an end thing. It's the people at Sankys, I guess, Danny, David, that I'm keen on working with both this summer at Sankys, what will happen after that with other projects. both here and in the UK and other places, other parts of the world. I'm committed to working with the people and Sanky's is important here, but it's not just Sanky's in Ibiza, you know. It's what I'm putting all my effort into now, that's for sure. There are other things, other projects that I'm... talking to David and Danny about this, I'm excited about it too, you know. You're keeping them under your hat for now? For now, yeah. I mean, you know, there's something in the UK that I'm interested in doing with David, but I can't really say I don't want to ruffle anyone's feathers. Are you still as passionate about promoting parties now as you were 25 years ago when you started? Yeah. passionate I may be as athletic in terms of how I can turn that passion into reality, not as much. It's important to have people around me, younger people to be honest. It's supposed to be the right people around you, young and old, but definitely younger for me. Andy Blithes, he was important over the last couple of years. He'll be getting involved with me too here very shortly. I need to know what I know and also, more importantly, know what I don't know. What do you think have been your main strengths as a promoter over the years? I think knowing what I am and what I'm not. What I'm not is a DJ. What I'm not is the best businessman in the world. What I'm not is clear to me. Whatever promotion means, that is me, you know. There's quite a lot of conversations I have with DJs, for example, or agents of DJs. Especially now. Everyone's a producer. Everyone is a studio or whatever. It's like, well, where's the DJs? For me, knowing who you are, what your best... I do anything that's important, and I know that about myself, you know, there are no illusions. I think that's the most important thing, is to not kid yourself. OK, you should be allowed to try anything out, but for me, I'm happy in my own skin of what I am, and I guess that's the most important thing, really. Bye. you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
