*music* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Ian Cooley was there from almost the very beginning. Along with DJ Tonka, he made his name in Mainz, a city near Frankfurt. But instead of finding himself inspired by the sound of the German hub for electronic music, electronic music, Pooley's ear always seemed to drift further afield. Detroit, Chicago, Brazil, anywhere that had a bit of funk in the beat. Pooley's enormously successful career has included albums like Meridian and Since Then, but it's also had setbacks as well, including a period where he quite simply didn't know what he wanted to do for a time. At the moment, however, Pooley has found his balance between the mainstream and the underground, has a forthcoming single on Intervisions, as well as an album due before the end of the year. In this revealing exchange with the DJ and producer, we go through the artistic ups and downs of his career thus far. you You moved to Berlin in 2006, I think. To today, almost to today. You were in Mainz before that. Did you grow up in Mainz? Yes, it's my birth town, hometown. You might think, okay, it's a really small town, like 300,000 inhabitants, but it was really, really good for the music. Like it was really, there were a lot of people into the music. And when I started getting into electronic music, you know, Mainz and there's another town called Wiesbaden and Frankfurt they're really well connected you know so it was easy for me to go in the late 80s and early 90s to for example the record stores in Frankfurt called Boy Records or Delirium Records and in Wiesbaden there was another Boy Records where I used to go. go to pick up the early house and the early Detroit techno stuff and everything and besides that you know Mainz was really really good in the early 90s with the club scene I'm just actually hanging out with Kenny Luck and he's staying at our place for a few days. And I told him that we were one of the first people to book Derek May to Germany. I think it was his second gig or something. And he was playing in my hometown in a small, like at the edge of a bridge in a small room with maximum of 120, 130 people capacity. That was amazing, you know, back in the days, being a fan of Detroit Techno and having him over. Who was booking those backs in Mainz? I mean, who was, I mean, obviously you had those records and they're coming in, but I mean, who was kind of reaching out? I mean, it was, we were, me and my friend Tonka were the residents at that club. And in the beginning, I think the first two parties. It was only us, but I think it was a mutual interest for that kind of music. The main promoters were like five guys that were a bit older. They were like in the mid-30s or something. And they had similar taste to us with the music. And also running the club was Achim, who was running, forcing the label, forcing Musicworks. He was involved as well. So he was like, okay, pulling some strings. So actually Derek May, his first gig was then Tresor the day before or something. So we were like, oh, we need to have him over here. And we had Jeff Miltz. I don't know. two months later or something. I was always curious about how that information chain would come along. So if Derek May is playing a Trezor, who would you call once you learned about that to be like, how can we? I don't know. Probably like through people at magazines maybe or the direct contact between the Achim, the label owner. forcing and maybe it was Dimitri I'm not sure I don't know who it was but somehow word of mouth and or and or the booker of course of Derek or something And then it also helped out that Derek and all those people from Detroit really liked our music as well. So when me and Tucker were producing as TNI Space Cube and we had our first release picked up by R&S, came out on R&S with a Richie Horton remix and everything. So we were like, okay. buying this music of our idols playing it and at the same time being well received by our idols and you know having kind of mutual respect and i was like 17 years old so you know it was like really fascinating for me everything were you into different music before then or was it that was the first music that really caught uh um before i was like um I don't always want to say that, but, you know, like, because everyone is saying it, like, Kraftwerk, yeah, Kraftwerk. But I have this funny story that I always like to tell is that when I was, like, I can't remember how old I was, like, nine or ten, and my mom had this really eclectic record collection, and she would, she had, like, two or three Kraftwerk records, and I would always listen to... repeatedly to Autobahn because I loved Autobahn so much, the music. And one day my dad had it because I was playing around with his PA. Expensive. PA and put a record on and he wanted to watch the news so he was like really you know nervous and pissed off so he broke the record you know and I remember that really clearly him breaking the record and I was like devastated so he came back like a couple of months later brought me a tape of the same album or something so i i really don't know why it caught me the most but i was always into more the more instrumental electronic music and then i started buying my own records and the usual stuff what you buy like i think boys western girls or prince and stuff so 85 there was one 85 and um and then prince was in there as well prince was in there as well yeah but that's really randomly you know i wasn't like a huge prince fan i just bought sign of the times because i just liked the song And then I turned to be like a real yellow fan and I bought all that I could get of yellow. There I started my tradition with buying US releases, US 12 inches with special remixes, UK releases with special remixes. So then I suddenly found out about all those American producers, you know, I bought Work Your Body, Steve Stacoli, I think 86, 87. And then pretty much, you know, like then Acid House as well. And at the same time, inner city big fun, you know. And so I had like a partner in crime, Tonka, you know, that I met in seventh, sixth grade. And we were both like 12, 13 that we, you know, both started going record shopping, you know, like once a month if we could afford it, you know. Who is Tonka exactly? Tonka... How do you want to know? You said you met him in school. Yeah. So I don't know how it is with the generation these days, how much they know about Tonka, you know? If I speak to older people, they know all about him. And yeah, we started making music together and it just happened randomly. In school, we were put together in class, sit next to each other and we find out, you know, that we like the same kind of music and we became like, you know, best friends. And he came from a musical background. So he kind of was that part that filled, you know, when we were producing with the harmonic stuff, you know, putting harmonies together. He had a very musical family. His dad had a studio. So that was our studio where we started doing our first tracks. And so we had everything there, the whole infrastructure. And yeah, and so he was always the more for the more melodic parts, you know, like he would like that a lot. And so the first three or four years when we had our releases was always me and him together as T and I like Tonka and Ian or Space Group for the more harder stuff, Acid, Breakbeat Influence. this kind of stuff. How did you pick your names? I mean, you changed your last name. That's my mom's maiden name. Okay. So I didn't want to have, you know, back in the days, it wasn't so fashionable like it is these days to have a German name, a complete German name. So, you know, my last name Pinnacamp was hard to pronounce. And, you know, it was always destined to be written. and so I came up with my mom's maiden name and it sounds good together sounded good from from the beginning and that's what I kept and Tonka had always on his releases first is just his normal name and then when it came to the year when I started doing my solo stuff and he started doing sort of stuff he just came up with a name Tonka When you were DJing together, you were playing mostly just Detroit techno and early Acid House? No, it had to span from... Strict Rhythm, really New York, soulful stuff, urban soul, sub-urban records, Strict Rhythm, Groove On, like Mutu Swing, till Anagon Resistance Fuel for the Fire or Fuse. So it wasn't just a techno club or anything like that? No, no. Yeah, I mean, I think that counts for many of the first generation DJs. you know they grew up playing everything and then they grew up collecting everything and it was the most normal thing i mean if you look at sven fiat in the late 80s he was playing at omen he was playing snap the power you know and stuff like this or his own stuff his own off stuff Were you going to see him at the Omen? A few times. I went, especially when they had the label night with Plus 8, with Richie, Speedy J, and John Akariva. That was like... early 92 or something but not on a regular base because I was too young first of all and I had to go to school and we had our own really good parties that I really loved and you know I was didn't have a driving license and it was really hard to get there, you know, on the weekends during the night. So you never really had a legendary club that influenced you. You had your own club that you were doing parties in. Yes. And I lived the music also day by day, you know, it wasn't for me, oh, it's a club experience, you know, and everything what comes along with it. It was for me the... the music living the music, you know. And also on the other hand, you know, we had our own scene and we're like, okay, we don't need Frankfurt, you know, we have our own good parties, you know, we get all the good DJs over, you know, and I had a really specific taste, you know, I was always more focused on American sound and playing American songs like Detroit techno, Chicago house, New York house and Sven Feld in the beginning was more you know with his label Hard House was really a very European sound coming more from the EBM scene from Belgium, like straight, hard kick drums, you know, not much inside. And I like, for me, it was important to play the funkiness in the music, you know, or enjoy the funkiness of it. What was the first sort of hit that you had with Tonka? Was it a T&I track? Yeah, it was a T&I track. I think pretty much the first EP we released in November 91 was really well received. And that's when Renard from INS licensed tracks off and got Richie to remix. from the beginning actually. Did you know when you were creating it that you had something there, that the collaboration made sense? The music when I finished? No, totally insecure of course. Is this enough? Is this good enough? I mean if I would listen back now I would be like, okay this is a typical... you know when a newbie starts making music newcomer full of ideas you know and not finding this one red line in the track you know like okay let's put some more let's put some more let's put some more so definitely it's um it had a lot of ideas in each track but In the beginning, you're never sure if this is good enough or if it's living up to the standards that we think were the right standards like Derek Mayer, Kyle Craig. Kevin Saunders and stuff like this. So that's who you were thinking about almost? Me, yeah. And maybe Tonka had different stuff in idea because it was compared to the Detroit stuff a bit more melodic, you know, and a bit more jumping between harder parts and melodic parts and stuff like this. But for me, that's what I was looking up to always. Why do you think the collaboration worked so well? Because he was doing the things that you weren't that strong in? Yeah, I was the drum machine guy. I was doing the Mahara parts, 909. Where did you get these machines? I don't know how you call them in English, but those classified papers, what we had in the late 80s. And I was fortunate enough that my parents were really, really tolerant and really, really supportive, you know, because I told them, OK, I need this, you know. But fortunately, back in the days also, they were really cheap. So the 909 I bought... a guy south of my of mines of my town like in the middle of nowhere and he was a rock guitarist and he he was fed up with the sound of the 99 didn't sound real enough to him so he was like He played it to me like, this sounds like, okay, actually the ride sounds okay, it sounds real enough, and the crash, but look at the snare and look at the kick, it sounds so dated. And in my head I was freaking out, like, wow, this is it, this is really those 909, because I didn't know if really that was the right machine. And I was like, wow, okay, the kick, yeah, that's it, okay. hey, this is the collapse. It's interesting how that perception shift. For him, it was like, it doesn't sound like a real one. So that's a huge problem. And you were like, exactly. It doesn't sound like a real one. So all my research, like, yeah, I was right. For example, there was a video from Norman Cook, Beats International. Was it one talk about it or that be good to me? And there's like scenes in the video where he's like with his other guys lining up all the machines. I think it was a 303, 606, 808. And we would record the video from MTV and then watch it in slow motion to see what it is, you know, what kind of machines it is, you know, and or cold cuts. For that split second. Yeah, yeah, or cold cuts. people are done there's a 303 floating through so just to make sure that when we buy those machines that we don't buy 606 instead of a 303 you know and uh fun times you know because it was a proper research i mean these days you have everything in front of you you know like okay everyone knows everything you know and for us it was like a real discovery you know So to get back, I mean, back in the days, in 1999, I paid 600 Deutsche Marks. And so I could afford those machines secondhand. Your parents knew that you weren't going to become a businessman. No, no. They tried it when I graduated from school. Okay, I was the only one in the family that made proper A-levels, you know, so I was, I could go to university and study, but I just, I did my civil service and then I pretty much, you know, that was like 1995 and then I was already touring all the time, so. Where did you first tour outside of Germany? Also straight away in 91 November, December when we had our first release I just talked to Laurent Guenier about it because he was playing there it was outside of Paris I don't know it was in Paris but it was in this off venue like not a club and it was Us playing live with 909, Sampler, Juno and stuff. I still have a video of that at home. Totally embarrassing, but it's fun. I don't know, 7,000 people off their heads, of course. And then Laurent Agne playing after us. And I think Atta was with us. uh being being a member of the forcing crew and uh upstairs was the guy that later did um sergeant i always forget his name i forget yeah he was doing scan x or something or i don't know anyway so the whole fnac crew so fcom crew But back in the day, it was not. Yeah. Tell me a little bit more about the scene in Frankfurt. The way that looking back on it now, it seems like that was the German, a huge German hub at that time. I think to start with, I have to make it clear that us and with Forsink, we were always a bit of the outsiders. You know, because Akim, the label owner, was always... He's an old 60s guy, so he was really into politics, left wing, and hanging out with all those bad left wing that turned out to be terrorists in the 70s, you know, so he was in that sea, kind of. I don't know if I should say that, but it's true. Like he was very political. And later in the 80s and the 90s, he turned to be more philosophical about, I don't know, Foucault, he was always talking about this French philosopher that always talked about electronic music and society nowadays. So that's what Akim, you know, that was his idea of running a label. And it was more like a family, you know. So we were like the forcing family, you know, the forcing crew. And we had label parties most of the time. So it would be like a takeover of a club or takeover at a rave of the floor. So mostly we would go in a big bus. go somewhere you know like like a field trip it sounds like the philosophical stuff didn't really for us not at all for him you know he could have his three years or dog you know when there would be forced incommunication he would write a text to it you know and um but for us it didn't For us it was the fun, being on a field trip with the people that you know anyway. It would be Mike Ng from Cologne who does Compact now. that crew from Cologne would come, you know, with Bionaut and all the others. Or it would be us from Frankfurt and other people from Mainz, like Thomas Heckmann, or Alec Empire as well from Berlin. And this would be for us the fun part of it. And for me, I was always not really a political person or like anything else. It was only about music. Alec was quite, is quite political, right? Yeah, so he fitted really well in that, you know, so he was discussing with Achim about things, you know. You did a record with him, I saw on Wikipedia. Many records. Yeah. We did, we did... Techno records, the two Space Cobblers things, two of them. We did an ambient record on Mill Plateau. Many, many things. What was he like back then before Atari Teenage Riot? He's a really nice, really nice, nice Berlin boy. He's totally different to what he represents. you know, in the media and the PR and everything. Very, very super nice guy. You say Berlin boy, though. Yeah. Is that quite a difference? West Berlin boy. Okay. Yeah. I think, you know, like typical, what I think of typical Berlin people, really funny, actually. Nice kind of humor. Really, really funny. really focus on what I want to do and is that different from the south Frankfurt or Cologne or something like this in your mind I would say, you know, because I think Berlin people always had to prove themselves, you know, because they were so far away, you know, like Berlin was a bit, you know, not really Germany and everyone was looking a bit down on Berlin. You know, there's only those people that, you know, they escaped from the army and, you know, they're hanging around, they study for 15 years or, you know, stuff like this, you know, permanent students. And so the Berlin people always had to prove, okay, we're actually the big town in Germany and we are, you know, there's always a fight between Frankfurt and Berlin, like who invented the German techno and who was doing the best parties for the first time, you know. And, you know, Sven and his crew looking down on Berlin and stuff, you know. You could read that in the magazines, always like front page, you know, themselves, you know, fighting. behind the scenes and um that's what i think you know that made people you know maybe people that i admire in berlin you know that make them really work harder and i saw that with alec you know it's like like a working machine i'm really really focused i know it's fascinating how times change you know the perceptions of these cities is so different i know i know i know i know And it's like, I remember like Berlin then in the early 90s, everything was a bit chaotic, you know. But I liked it from the beginning. I liked it. For me, techno and house and the parties is always about being playing in dirty, dirty basements and not the shishi, you know, the lights and blah, blah, blah, you know. One disco ball is enough and stuff like this. And I really liked Hardwax, you know, because they continued with the tradition of really focusing on Detroit sound and stuff. So I was happy to go to Berlin. Tell me about moving on through the 90s. I mean, you got into a major label system at a certain point. How did that come about? Oh, it's just really, I wasn't screaming for it, you know. It just all came to place at the right time. And my friend Thorsten, who used to be the A&R at V2 Records. When he started working for them, when they grouped the company, V2 was founded, I think, in 96, 97, and then they opened offices everywhere. And then they hired Thorsten as an A&R. He used to work at Delirium Berlin and was really well connected to the electronic music scene. He said he wanted to have me and DJ Hell. And that's what he signed. I didn't make any compromise. Maybe later, if I look back, maybe later I made a few compromises. We can get to that. Yeah. But in the beginning, I just collected the tracks I had there. And there were also a few tracks I had on forcing before, like What's Your Number? And which other tracks? I don't know, for what's the number? Maybe one more. On the first album, Meridian in 97, the first major label album, because I had an album on 4SYNC before, which was called The Times, and it had some new tracks and some of the previous released stuff, so my first CD, so to say. Why make the jump, though, from 4SYNC to V2? I mean, it was just, here's the contract. It's just like money, no compromises. Yeah, I mean, yeah. Okay, the money is always nice to have, of course. But I don't know, for me, I just thought it's like the next step, you know. So it was 1997. I've been with Forcing for six years. And then I think at this age, you know, like from being 17 to being 23, 24, you just... you develop a lot, you develop fast and maybe develop different ideas, you know. And also, Fawcink wasn't really doing that well and there was some chaos between the people. you know the people working there not doing the right thing i just didn't feel 100 at home anymore you know and then pretty much at the same time torsten from v2 records came but it wasn't that i only released on v2 then i mean i i started the relationship with nrk music i think Also in 97. I had my first release on NRK, so I kind of always wanted to release on underground labels as well. I had my Plus 8 release in 98 as well. And Transment was a bit later and stuff like this. And I had a few things on Forcing still. How did NRK come into the picture? I mean, you talk about the Detroit influence, plus eight makes a lot of sense, obviously, but NRK is this UK label that maybe wouldn't be a little bit unexpected. Or maybe not. Yeah, no, since 1992, when we were earning a little bit of money, we made it as a rule to go like once every three months to London to buy records. Because back in the days, it was special to go to London. It was hard for a normal guy in Germany to get the records from London. So we were like, I mean, me and Tonka, we were really into breakbeats and drum and bass was evolving. and you would stand, be in a black market in this back room, and the guy would just mix and play records, and you would, like, lift your hand, like, I want this, I want this. And so I was always open for new things, you know. And then just Nick started doing the booking agency, you know. So he started doing my bookings and I liked the stuff he was releasing, you know. He had stuff from Gemini and Kate Chandler and I think it was, who else? Claudio Cucullu, no, Greg Costelli or Claudio Cucullu. Cuculuto. I like their music as well, you know, so. What was the scene like in the UK for a person like you who was coming over as a German DJ? Was it very welcoming? to what you were bringing over yeah because I think people always understood my affiliation or my love for the more the funkiness like to like I would never people never perceived me as like somebody from Germany like because I have this English name and I produce this kind of more you know funky US sounding sound or compared to some things from England as well. So it never seemed like, okay, there's somebody from Germany coming, you know? I think a lot of people, even after 10 years, and they knew me for 10 years, they would still say, oh, I always thought you came from, I don't know, Brighton, or you came from London, or you came from Toronto. I had all the cities in the world. what people expect me that i came from so um yeah i mean it was totally normal for me to play in england you know when you went i mean walk me through your v2 yeah stuff in a way the first album was a collection of tracks yeah 97 that you had done but in the end you know when i i just started listening back to it They actually fit really well together. I'm happy. Sounds good. You know, a lot of people, I mean, most people talk to me about the second one, but the first one, a lot of people say like, wow, this is cool. A lot of other producers actually. So that was 97. And then I immediately started working on the other one, which came out in 99, 2000. And that was the one that was doing really well and kind of brought me into a bigger audience, speaking like of bigger festivals, bigger tours like in Australia and in America and stuff like this. Tell me about... the recording of that album I mean you never know really that it's gonna be no never never I had my studio at home in Mainz upstairs so I was doing most of the stuff at home still no computer I mean till 2006 no computer So most everything with MPC 3000, all the arrangement, everything, vocals that are recorded somewhere else before, like with the Brazilian girls Rosana and Silja, or the vocals from Estero and Balmes, I would have longed that. you know, and I would sample them into my sampler piece by piece and then try to put it all together later. But I would do everything at home, mix down everything. So you didn't do those recordings of the vocals at home? Well, the recordings of vocals were done somewhere else because I didn't have good mics and good preamps and stuff. Did you meet them? I never met because she's from Toronto, you know, and was back in the days pretty successful, you know, touring a lot. But Rosanna and Celia, the other girls, and Kirstie Hawkshaw, for Kirstie Hawkshaw I went to London to record, and Rosanna and Celia were two Brazilian girls, but they were living in Frankfurt in Germany. So I recorded together with them and told them, okay, what I want, you know. Where did this kind of Brazilian influence come from? Was it, were you always kind of interested in buying records of that style? It was just a general interest of discovering new things. And, I mean, started already, I like percussive stuff as well with Yellow, you know, Yellow having a really Latin influence. I remember playing in Portugal in 95 or 96, and we went to a bar before, and this guy was playing all the Bostanowa classics. wow I heard this in the radio somewhere and I remember this from this and this and this and this so I had memories with those kind of songs and I just really really heavily got into it you know just collecting it you know and trying to find all of the original releases on vinyl and then stuff on CD as well like compilations and then just had an influence on my on my on my production then you know because i spent my time you know researching that music it was like a natural thing you know i mean the rhythm it's it's always brazilian music i never liked the word latin a lot of people would say like latin house latin house is not true i like brazilian music you know what's the difference Because Latin is more like Cuba, you know, like it could be anything. It could be salsa, it could be rumba. And that's, that's the, always, I never really liked that, you know, like it's, it's always a bit like. cheesy you know and the brazilian music has a more like a melancholic touch to it with the harmonies and everything so harmonies that could perfectly match into a detroit techno track or into a house track in my opinion if you would use it smart and also the funkiness of it with the rhythms that the way they you know layered different percussive sounds you know it's kind of a similar vibe how Derek May would layer his percussive sound you know like playing stuff playing against each other and next to each other and creating a rhythm out of it you know and stuff like this so lots of similarities I think I know yeah I never thought about the melody having that similar melancholy Yeah, the harmonies, the way they choose the harmonies and everything. A lot of relations, especially the unknown tracks, Brazilian tracks. Who are some of the artists that really got you into it when you were researching it? Well, definitely Marco Weil. Marco Weil is like... nine years ago i discovered albums that only you know like were released and re-released in japan you know and vinyl only from brazil and i was like wow he did this album as well and i later worked with him on one track on on was it on souvenirs yeah it was on so many something and uh i'm sorry he was one of my big big heroes you know also did albums with synthesizers and stuff in the 72, 73. Those must sound amazing. Those must sound pretty amazing. Yeah, really, really cool. And some of the tracks he would have like three different versions on one album and, you know, like an interlude of the same track just with some solos on top and really, really cool. Really, really talented. And of course, what a classic, you know, the classic inventors like Tom Chuglin and, you know. Gilberto. What about ballet though? Like, I mean, obviously you mentioned that you were researching him and finding out, was it his voice or was it his, the production? No, the production, talented writer and musician, really talented. And, uh, you know, like catchy stuff, you know, like really catchy stuff. And, uh, amazing musicians he chose always. I mean, he plays a lot himself, but good, really, really good musicians, you know. Must have been strange to work with him on a track. I wasn't there. So he did it himself. I gave him my, my layout, what I did. And. He did it on ADAT. Remember Alesis ADAT? He sent me all those huge tapes back from Brazil and I had to rent an ADAT machine to get it into my sampler somehow and with SM. pte code and everything and nightmare nightmare but uh it's beautiful you know a lot of people would just say yeah it's just beautiful music and i'm i tend to be more a bit more analyzing like okay great musicians great songwriting and blah blah so that's how i listen to music you know i always have to analyze but i think like all in all like he was just really good writing catchy good songs you know do you think that constantly analyzing songs you're you're missing yeah i would love to be i would love to have that naive ear again where you just hear a full track Nothing else, like the playing the full track, how I would listen to tracks maybe in the mid-80s or something, you know? Now all you can hear is the mixing and the production choices and all these different things. Yeah, it's only with a few genres where I can still... turn my analyzing function off, like with some indie stuff or something, but in general, it's always analyzing. It's automatic. So that catapulted you. Do you think it was the vocals, a lot of the vocals that just helped? Yeah, and the vibe, the overall vibe of the Since Then album, you know, like a lot of people said that it got them into house music, you know. I hear that a lot, all the time. Just the right time, right place. Yeah, right time, right place. And, you know, really positive vibe on the whole album without being cheesy. And also looking back at it as if, you know, objectively not being the artist myself, you know, I think the tracks really fit together well. Like they're really all over. the place you know downbeat stuff ambient stuff mid tempo house tempo i was struck by some of the the vibe and you're exactly right it's it's somehow positive without being cheesy and that's it's really tough it's hard to pull off you know and uh um so i get like dedicated fans you know that You know, they wish, you know, I would do this a bit more, but I'm so over, you know, the whole Brazilian influence sound or something. I couldn't do this at the moment. I just couldn't do it, you know. I'm into totally different stuff at the moment. When did that change? Is it immediately after the album? I mean, I did that thing and now I'm going to challenge myself. The whole album was kind of dragging. Like it was kind of, how do you say, like it was kind of boiling for a long time. Like it was still selling really good and people still really talking about it. playing it a lot and actually asking me a lot to play like until 2005 and 6 you know and I was kind of followed you yeah haunted almost yeah and uh your words not mine yeah as an artist you know you get kind of fed up with it you know and I was playing also a lot of Latin house the real latin house and i mean brazilian house as well like brazilian influence sounds like unfowed recordings and stuff like this but also a lot of latin house you know like the other boys were doing back in the days like knee deep you know the bus he was doing lovebirds now he was doing as knee deep a lot of latin house things and a lot of stuff on azuli and i remember I already moved here. Like 2006, I took the whole crate of Latin House and was like, that's it. I had enough. I'm so bored. You know, I can't play this anymore. And then... I guess it... I mean, you know, at a certain point, it... descends in the formula yeah and i think like i was taking it too easy as well you know like just playing pleasing the people playing the sound you know and i was like i was myself i wasn't you know happy enough with it anymore i think i wanted to go back a little bit to my roots already back then you know but i found that out a bit later you know it's like it took me a while to find out what i actually wanted to do but i think it was more getting back to my roots, you know, doing more underground stuff and, you know, like releasing underground stuff and really, you know. releasing stuff that I wanted to play actually you know like at the end you know I didn't want to play my stuff anymore because I was playing it all over and over I was just tired of it you know and it has to be a really tough position for an artist to be in where you know it is your life you're an artist but you kind of don't know exactly what you want to do I think what I did is I kind of lost the balance between the under round and the over round stuff and that's something I was in my opinion handling really good between 97 and 2000 four and five that i always had also some underground stuff so the people that liked me from my technical period when i was doing more tech house techno period like in 95 to 99 they would i would still do stuff like this as well you know on many labels like i don't know odori or like the plus eight or the transmit or you know sue has had this v2 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because i liked it all it's not like yeah i want to make these albums because i want to make money with this and uh i want to make underground stuff you know to just to do it like for me like i i liked all of it you know i liked I like all the aspects, you know, but just like there was this time, I would say between 2004 and five and six, where I would just focus only on that one sound, you know, and maybe taking it a bit too easy, you know. When did you realize? Huh? When did you realize you were taking it too easy? Oh, it takes a while, you know? You just like, you think after a while, you think like, okay, that you don't like the stuff that you're playing. You don't like it anymore. You want to change something drastically. But it didn't have to do with moving here. Not at all. There's a lot of people say that and I don't like that at all. And no, it's just like, I think after a while, you kind of can, you can reflect it better. And back in the days, you just, you knew you had to change something, you know, so. It must be tough also, though, to make that drastic change, right? Because you get, you're in this kind of situation where you're getting booked. in all of these parties and getting asked back. And then it's like, how do I get out of that cycle? Yeah, and people think, play 900 Degrees, play Bioness, play 900 Degrees, play Bioness, you know. Then I'll play the remixes, you know, just to have something different, you know. Yeah, I mean, really, really hard to make people understand, you know. But on the other hand, you know, I made peace with the tracks, you know. You have to make peace, you know, because if that's what you're known for, then you should really, you know, you should once in a while, you should play it for them, you know. That's how it is, you know. It's like a lot of people... they make that mistake and then, I mean, maybe I made it as well that they just really make a cut and they say, like, I don't want to do anything to do, I don't want to have anything to do with this anymore, you know. A lot of people made that cut in 2006, 2007 that went from house, from, like, Vocal house, normal house went to electro and this kind of stuff. The new sound coming up, like electron minimal and stuff. Don't want to say names, but you can imagine. And yeah, and I think, but you still kind of have to remember what people know you. think you're famous for but i think it's absolute natural instinct yeah after a while I can't hear this anymore. And then maybe a few years later, you come to that realization where you're like, yeah, it's okay. Right now I can listen even to Khorasan Dabur, which is to my standards these days quite a commercial track, you know, and like pretty much in your face. I like it, you know. I like most tracks that I really like of myself is the tracks where I can't remember how I did them. And that's what caused on the boy. I was like, I'm like, wow, because I didn't know much about mixing down vocals and, you know, getting it right. And when I listened to it, I think like, wow, the mix down is really good, you know. And that's cool, you know. But then it takes a while for you to be recognized again as a different kind of guy, you know. And just like for me, it took a couple of years to get to the stage, you know, maybe where I am right now, you know. Where are you right now? At the moment, I'm really, really happy that there's been a renaissance with classic house music from mid-90s, I would say. It started, I think, around two years ago, like here in Berlin, and it's kind of spreading around the world. And I'm really happy about that, you know, because that's the platform I like. What sort of labels are in your mind? kind of examples of that sound that are pushing that classic house thing it's always when people ask me i don't remember pretty much everyone kind of is changing a little bit you know if you listen to a free range production from maybe like six five six years ago and compared to now it sounds more organic and less loopy and things like this and Pretty much with every kind of label. I mean, you could find a good release on Cross Run Rebels as well as you can find a good release on, I don't know what's left on Vincent's label. Novel Sound. Yeah, like White Label only, DJ Q or he's called. So I kind of collect myself and I don't, there's a few labels that I follow on a regular base. Who is it? I should look on Beatpod which ones I ticked. But anyway, you know, all producers are kink, you know. Kink sounds really 90s. And I think I was reading about kink that, you know, tries to do everything. Not so much computer-based, more outboard gear-based. And you can really hear that, you know. It's a question, though, that... Or that's a sentiment that begs the question, you know, if techno was about the future, then all these people are trying to replicate the past. I know, yeah. Sometimes people are trying too hard, you know, but I think he does it in a very elegant way. And for me, it's just a thing that I grew up with this. So I don't... There's no replicating the past. It's just what you love. It's the way I've been producing. I still start my tracks only on MPC and sampling the sounds on MPC. I don't have sound banks where I look at all the kick drums and choose a kick drum. I always sample a kick drum fresh from some record or something and then compile everything fresh. And then I use a 909 and use some other drum machine. And use a keyboard, you know. It's like 20 steps where you can have one step only, you know. But I like it this way and that's how it works. And at the moment, this kind of sound is kind of hip or something, you know. When you... Moved to Berlin, even though it wasn't connected. You were trying to recalibrate, I guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What were some of the steps that you took? I mean, did you get a different booking agent or did you say, I'm not going to release on this label or I want to release on this label? Well, in the beginning, I wasn't doing releasing so much because the scene didn't really inspire me. It was really, really heavy and minimal sound and this electro sound and which which I think is a kind of it was a natural thing because before it was Latin house or deep house or naked music that was all really, really hip. So. it's a natural development always in the techno now scene that everything comes back in waves so i think it was normal okay there was a new generation coming new new kids and i wanted to hear more radical sound so it was moving there and but i didn't like the music it was too too clean and too digital and too straight not funky enough and maybe too European sounding and so that was the time where I didn't produce so much and then later when I saw like labels popping up like Free Range and or especially like the Jimster Sound or I released a record on Simple Records you know Simple Records were doing nice stuff and that kind of inspired me again like the more deep house sounding you know deeper deeper sounding and then you know obviously hanging out with stefan with dixon you know what he's doing you know with arme and stefan goldman i liked some of the stuff you know like a bit more deeper but with some real depths to it you know and that kind of longer process got me back into like doing this kind of sound And what I kind of stopped for a while in the early 2000s is just being in the studio for fun. I would always be in the studio with a schedule, like remix to finish, production to finish. And I tell everyone who's in my first generation, who's maybe a little bit uninspired or doesn't know what to do, just be in the studio and do stuff for fun. Just jam around. Save some snippets. Save some ideas. Go do something else. Maybe go back to an early idea. Just do some things. What about going fishing in Croatia? That's something that haunts me. Somebody wrote it somewhere. I can't remember. It was in an interview and then it somehow made its way into my biography during that, in my opinion, unfortunate time with Minister of Sound. I hated that quote because I never... really said that you know it's just like okay i have a croatian wife and um i i love the country and everything you know and it's it's a nice idea to have a house over there but that wasn't my plan you know but i really hated that and it's like and every party still these two these days it's like you need to get a new biography yeah the second sense or the first sense but i always remember when i see the fly i'm like fuck i have to change this when i'm when i come back home you know yeah I love Croatia. Nothing against that. Of course. Nothing against fishing. Yeah, I love fishing. I always do that when I'm in New Zealand, in Auckland, with my friend Dick Johnson. But music will be always part of my life because I grew up with music. I started with 12 and it's just a normal part of my life. But I always tell people, DJs, musicians it's good to have some other hobbies from time to time Thank you. Bye.
