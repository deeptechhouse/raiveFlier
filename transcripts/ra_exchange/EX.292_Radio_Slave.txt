Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch, and I'm the Associate Editor of Resident Advisor. Our guest this week is Matt Edwards, the UK artist who makes music as Radio Slave and who runs the label Wreck-Its. Over the last 10 years or so, Edwards has kept himself very busy, dipping his toes in everything from balleric music to Japanese toy design. But for most of his adult life, Edwards has been primarily interested in one thing, raves. He loves playing them, he loves making music for them, and more than most professional DJs, he loves simply being at them. As he told me here at our office in Berlin, this lingering passion has shaped his sound as an artist and remains as strong as ever today, 25 years since his first. You can hear our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The Exchange with Matt Edwards, aka Radios This Year. is a bit of a milestone for records. - Yeah, I mean this year, 2016, is 10 years of the label. Started in May back in 2006. - How are you gonna mark the occasion? - Right now we're planning events. We're also looking at the back catalog. We're talking to some of the artists we've worked with in the past. We're also Yeah, we're working on some interesting concepts. You know, there'll be the usual, maybe a compilation, maybe a box set. You know, I mean, of course, these days it's not as easy to pump out compilation CDs or, you know, maybe some of the more traditional formats. So we're looking at some interesting ways of kind of maybe revitalising. maybe bringing in some young guns, new people to have a go at the music. So what's an example of an interesting new way? Yeah, it's too early to maybe say. But we're working on it, yeah. I mean, we've been working on it a long time. One of the things we're doing, we're working with Japanese producers. We'll be doing a Japanese remix CD, including some of your favourites like DJ Nobu and Kurumi Tanaka, people like that. So, yeah. Any toys? No toys, but maybe T-shirts. I mean, I would love to make more toys, but they're really expensive. And maybe in the future. I mean, we're working with this young Korean artist, Peggy Goo. And yeah, she's a great illustrator. And she's come up with some cool, really cool characters. So yeah, maybe. Won't rule it out. No, I've launched this new web store, Love Hangover, and with one of the concepts of it being like this marketplace for cool stuff, you know, will be the possibility to create art, toys, items, stuff like that. So when you started Wreck-Its, or when Wreck-Its was born, did you have any inkling that this would still be, you know, one of your main projects, it would be part of your day-to-day life 10 years later? I guess we were looking at it being a kind of traditional record label, signing artists, kind of building the catalogue. You know, in 2006, we could sell a lot of records and we could sell albums. CDs and this was before the kind of, well the digital wave of like Beatport you know that kind of took over so When we started, we had big plans and of course that's changed all the way along the line. I'm just super happy that the label's still there ten years later. I mean, it's very easy these days for a lot of people, I think, just to say, you know, I'm done with this, let's start something new. You know, it seems like everyone wants something new. to have a label that's still there. And I think it's still relevant. I think we, you know, we're signing really cool music. I love the stuff we're signing. You know, I've got a good team and looking back, you know, I mean, I probably had no idea what we were kind of doing at the time. We knew maybe what we wanted to do, but yeah, it's, it's, it's changed all the way along the line. If you could go back in time and find your younger self, Matt Edwards, 10 years ago, thinking about starting a label. If you could give that younger self one piece of information, what would it be? That's a good question because I was actually, I think I was at Watergate in 2005 and Trevor Jackson was there. And of course Trevor was doing output at the time, his label, and he was signing a lot of bands like LCD Sound System. His advice to me was if you're going to start a label, then... Don't sign anyone else. Just release your own music. And kind of looking back or maybe looking at what's going on now, I think that's not a bad... word of advice. I mean, if you look at Robert Hood or Moody Man, Kenny Dixon Jr., you know, all those guys kind of just release their own music. You know, they have their own platform and they do their own thing. I mean, I think the problem with me is I'm still a fan. I'm still like a kid in a candy shop. an enthusiast and a collector. So the minute I hear something new or I discover something, I want to release it or give it the best kind of platform or, you know, do something with it. So that's maybe my downfall is that, you know, but we're still here. Yeah, of course. But I feel like in a way, over the years, records at least has been pretty focused. You've had these sort of core artists, a few of them since the beginning. And even if new people come in, it does have the feeling of sort of a coherent. little band of artists yeah it's clear what records represents then you you're kind of at center stage as well yeah i don't think we've ever had that kind of gang mentality which has kind of inflicted a lot of other independent dance labels you know i think one thing i've always been into is is music with personality of course working with someone like nina She's got an amazing personality. She's full of this energy, creative energy, and working with her and seeing what she's done, it's been incredible. I think with records, it's gone from everything, from disco to house. techno. Also, along the way, we've kind of been part of some of these trends, which in some ways might have benefited us or otherwise, but especially with a track like Grindhouse, which became such a huge hit, you know, that pushed the label into another direction or another world. But yeah, it's interesting. I guess to me, it might just be a result of when I first heard of the label. But in my head, as you said, Records releases a nice variety of different sounds. And also you've got a bunch of other, you've had many other projects over the years with all different sounds. Serious Techno to Blyrik. But nonetheless, when I think of Radio Slave records, I guess what jumps into my mind first and foremost is this big, utilitarian-sounding, groove-oriented club music. Is that the way it feels for you, or is that just one of many things? No, I mean, I think that's always been the... core essence of records has been releasing music for clubs. We're doing that right now, working with artists like Marcus Zucker or, you know, all the other guys that we're working with, or girls, and I love all kinds of music. I love buying ambient music, I love buying kind of weirdo whatever, you know, I'm trawling the record shops every week, but... What I really need is music that I can play. And that's what we've always tried to do with records. And whether it's disco or house or techno, it's about... releasing records that, I mean, I'm not going to say accessible, but playable, you know? And I think these days a lot of people try and deviate from that. And it's very easy these days to release a very obscure, grainy, weird record. For me, that's great, but I'm primarily a DJ and always have been, and I just want to put out music that I can play. So that's it. I think playable kind of sells it short. Someone like Marcus Succa is a great example, and also things like the No Sleep series, the original Grindhouse, it might be playable, but it's definitely not. a standard track it's very long yeah I mean I guess but I guess playable in our world you know yeah sure like the panorama bars or clubs like being in Japan where you can play for nine hours and you have the time. So it's our little world, you know, and this is the club world. Often when someone says something is a functional club record, that sounds like faint praise. Yeah, but I think that's, I read a lot of reviews and I also go to the shops all the time. and there's a lot of music being put out there that's not functional. You know, it's very cool and it's very arty and it's lovely, but it's not playable. And I think a lot of these guys that are making this music, when they come and play in Berlin, they're then playing retro house records because they can't play their own music. So that's what we're doing or that's what we're about, you know. I think it's also important to sort of... acknowledge that it's not just that it's easy to play. It's that if you play these tracks in a club, it just really, really, sometimes to a surprising extent, just totally works from the way the drum sound on. a big soundstorm to the sort of pace with which the track unfolds, like, you know, hi-hat pattern comes in at the exact right time. It sort of reminds you that it might seem like, as you said, a sort of grainy techno record somehow has more artistic credibility or something, but there really is an art form to making a record that just works perfectly in a club. I guess as an art form, why is that so captivating to you? It's one of these things where we're always looking for the perfect beat, always trying to search for the perfect arrangement. It's that constant search for these records that are just magic, that create that kind of magic. in a club environment. I think, you know, again, that's why I think people are really going back and looking at the past. Because I think, you know, I think house and techno has been around for a long, long time. There's some great examples. And I think a lot of these great examples. are records that work the best in clubs. And, you know, as well with the remixes I've always done, I mean, I've always tried to close my eyes and think about how it would sound or if, say, I think about, say, someone playing it, like Ricardo or whoever, and, you know, with the structure and a lot of the times... I would just, well, I still do, I just let the track record and I try not to look at the screen. In 2016, it's going to be, again, more focused on the dance floor. It's obviously different if, you know, you find yourself in clubs most weekends just automatically. But how often do you turn up at a rave just for fun? Well, how often? I mean, I was at Berghain last weekend. Actually, no, it was two weekends ago. I was there on a Sunday night just before my girlfriend gave birth. So I got a phone call and had to leave the club. So, yeah, I do pop out. And, of course, living in Berlin, I'm extremely fortunate and lucky that, you know, have places such as... the club that's just around the corner from here and you know in that respect I think maybe if I was living somewhere else it would be difficult for me but living here it's great and you can you know you can go and hear some really good music congratulations on thank you um yeah the reason I asked that I guess is um this might not actually be true it's kind of like an anecdotal observation but I find a lot of artists that um it often goes like they pump out these wicked club bangers early in their career and then it kind of gets sort of trippier and more subtle as time goes on like Ricardo Villalobos or something it's interesting to remain you know so inspired by just the club experience the rave experience so I guess in a way it makes sense that the reason you're still inspired to make those tracks is because you still personally enjoy that experience yeah I mean I'm still I guess over the last few years I think maybe in 2013 I've had a moment where I was a little bit like confused or wasn't really sure about what I wanted to play and but right now I'm really really into it more than ever and I love a lot of the new music that's coming out at the moment. And yeah, it's great. I think we're going through a great period of club culture. So it's good. I mean, basically, you're part of the generation that was just right place, right time, right as rave culture hits the UK. I've sort of got the impression that that's something that, I guess, unsurprisingly... you still kind of carry with you, for instance, like naming the record Children of the E, you know, their little shout outs. But as someone who's like not old enough to have been there, I guess I would have imagined that like if you were there for those sort of pivotal moments that today's atmosphere would, you know, pale by comparison. Yeah, I mean, you could look at it like that. I mean, I guess it's... the same way as when I was 15 or 16 and I first heard James Brown. I mean, I wasn't there when the records came out, but it still blew me away. And I think no matter how far we progress with technology, sound systems or how you play the music, kids still love to go out and party and be part of this. social environment. So yeah, I mean, it's great to see young people really, really into electronic music. I think it's kind of weird. It's kind of because maybe five or six years ago, there was still like a indie scene, I guess, or maybe there still is. But I think kids these days, it's just electronic music. That's what they're into. back when I was first going out, you know, we didn't have a lot of the things you have now. So all the technology to, to make music on your own, stuff like that. So, you know, it's, I think it's as exciting now as it was back then, but in different ways. There was definitely more romanticism involved in the music scene going out because you didn't have this social networking or the internet. So it's very different. There's this theory, I guess you could say, that I've always sort of mulled over. There's this guy, Leland Kirby, the caretaker, he did an album called The Death of Rave. And he sort of put forth this opinion that, at least in his experience, going out to illegal parties in the UK in the early 90s, he felt like... It wasn't just that it was really fun or that you're connecting with these people. There's also an element of... A very powerful kind of optimism of like the future is yours or, you know, it belongs to this generation. Like almost like vaguely borderline political sort of triumphant side to it or something. And he said the first time he went to Berghain, he felt really depressed because he felt like that wasn't there at all. Right. What do you think about that? For sure. I mean, I compared my last visit there to being, it was like being in a set from Terminator. That's how I felt. It was like going back to 1984, kind of a mix of goths with this kind of, you know, this electronic music. But it was great. I'm not saying it's bad. But when I was growing up or in my teens or... late teens and I think guys like Jeff Mills always talk about this I mean I think we were like a generation that were obsessed with science fiction or sci-fi this is moving away from your political point but it was always about the future you know future thinking so music was always I guess this kind of had this sci-fi future looking forward element to it. And I guess the millennium is looming. Yeah. And I think that feeling kind of vanished as the nineties went on, you know, you know, of course albums from model 500 or they were, you know, there was still this kind of sci-fi kind of vibe, but, um, Yeah, it changed. But you're not too nostalgic, it seems like. You won't say, like, it's not what it used to be or whatever? No, I mean, I was really fortunate, really lucky, and I was in the right place at the right time. I was lucky to go to clubs like Ministry of Sound when they first opened and hear Larry Levan play all night. And I think artists and acts like Future Sound in London. really influenced me when I was like 19, 20, because I'd never heard a lot of new wave or new beat or these kind of strange European records. You know, I think growing up in mainland Europe, I think if you grew up here, you hear this kind of stuff if you listen to the radio back then. Blew my mind at the time. So, but yeah, I think now it's the same. I think if you're a kid and you, you know, even if you turn your laptop on and you discover whatever, I still think it's just as exciting. Well, I hope it's just as exciting. I think it's maybe the way that you... absorb it or consume it. I think back in the 80s and 90s, you know, reading a magazine, you had to imagine what something was like. Or you bought an album and you played that album to death. You know, or if you went to see a movie. you had to have the memory of the movie. You couldn't go home and turn on your laptop and watch it again or even, you know, it was completely different. Yeah, I've actually heard that, exactly what you just said, as an explanation for... part of the unique allure of Berghain. Yeah, for sure. It's just in your memory. Yeah, exactly. And I think that's important. I think having that imagination or that romanticism of what it's about. We would read back in the early 90s about, you know, disco DJs or Larry Levan or even Chicago guys, you know, and these were all just like, you know, you'd have this image in your mind of how it was, what, you know, you couldn't just go online and download the set, you know. So it was very different. So by the time records started, you'd actually already been a professional DJ, you know, in one form or another. Yeah, for a long time. Yeah, right. About 15, 16 years. Right. 15 years. And your first gig was? First gig was back in London in, I think it was 91 or 92 at the Milk Bar. Right. Which was a very small club just off Charing Cross Road. Yeah. So how did you get from? like how did it happen from you know your first rave experience where you know you're introduced to the culture to then you have a residency at Milk Bar it wasn't a residency it was kind of a one off gig for a friend it was actually I think it was a Saturday night with David Durrell and Pete Tong and I got invited to play because one of them couldn't make it and from there I mean it was yeah the 90s were kind of Hazy days, a lot of illegal raves in Wales and... Again, I was living in London, travelling there, so I was experiencing all these kind of new clubs in London, like Club UK, Ministry of Sound, which I was later resident at for open all hours. And then on the flip side, I was travelling to these illegal raves in the woods. And yeah, it was fun times. But from there, I ended up moving to Brighton. And started making music again. And then, yeah, fast forward to 2006 and I've suddenly become, well, been doing a lot of remixes. I think from 2003 to 2005, yeah, was kind of the heyday for me of working with pop artists and doing remixes for Elton John or Paul McCartney, that kind of stuff. How did you get started on that? How did that happen? I was really lucky. I guess I met a lot of quite well-known DJs back in the early 90s from going to parties in London, being part of that rave scene. The club scene was much smaller. There weren't the sub-genres that there are now. So it was very easy to meet people and a lot of good times. So there was a lot of bonding. And yeah, so through those connections, I was really frustrated at the end of the 90s with a lot of remixes, a lot of remixes. But I liked a lot of, I still liked a lot of the more pop, pop tracks, basically, that were in the charts. And this Kylie track, Can't Get You Out of My Head, started to be promoted. And at the time, I was really, really into disco and into medleys and listening to Walter Gibbons and his kind of remixing style. So I decided to put these two or three records together. and make this kind of remix. And I gave it to a friend, and it was played on Radio 1, and that was it, basically. When you say you put two or three records together, is that the Walter Gibbons style? Yeah, it was more kind of like a disco. It was more like an edit kind of way of remixing. So in a sense that it was really taking overlaying tracks. It wasn't really a remix as such. It was more like a re-edit. It had a segue through the middle where it segued into Brian Ferry, Angel Eyes, and then cut back into Kylie. So it was very long. It was like 12 or 13 minutes. But it was more of a medley. It wasn't actually a remix as a traditional remix is done. Was that your beginning as a producer, doing those pop remixes? Yeah, I mean, I made music in the 90s with two friends and we had a small studio and we released some records and we're actually going to look back at some of these productions this year and we signed records by Justin David. who runs the Isono company. They make isolators for turntables and he's produced the mixer for floating points. And also this other artist, Sir Lord Comics. This was going back in the 90s, but yeah, I kind of stopped making music around 97 and then didn't start again until 2000. This was when I discovered that I could... I produced music on my own. Back then it was with a friend, but this was with a PC. And I had experience with computers when I was a designer when I was younger, so I kind of... I found it quite easy. I think back then I kind of... passionate and and I kind of had this kind of anger not you know about maybe what I wanted to achieve so I was very hungry for it you know you recently left a comment on RA and which she said something like as a producer the only way to properly realize your dreams or what you have in your head is to give all your time to the studio. Yeah. Was there a specific point where that's what happened with you? Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think on the comment, I mean, I think looking back at the early 90s, I mean, it was so common for a guy like myself. I met... I made friends with these two guys and they had a studio. And of course, if you can have a studio on your own, I mean, for me, it was always difficult to express myself when you have three other minds or three other people in the studio. And I think the only way you can really realise what you want to do is to do it yourself. Of course, with music, it's very different. I mean, it depends on what you're making, you know, as well. But for me, it was important to produce the music myself. Yeah. When was it that you kind of turned that corner? Where like now you live in your studio? Well, I think I sacrificed everything. I had my own little studio in Brighton and I would be working every day. I mean, I had a part-time job working at a call centre for a bank and I would work there from 7 to 11 in the morning, so four hours a day. It was just bringing some money and every other hour was spent at home working. And, you know, from this, very quickly, I kind of... I started making music with Joel Martin and the Quiet Village project was formed. And yeah, I think we just realised that we, you know, for years we'd kind of looked at studios as being kind of like scary places for me, you know, quite daunting because, you know, there was so much to learn, you know. But then with the computer, you know, it was very easy to sample, but not sample just for two or three seconds, but, you know, sample. endless amounts of music and so it was yeah it was good what were the um results of all those hours in brighton well i mean i think i did some of the best music i've ever made Back then, I think the album's like the record album for Soul Jazz. And I had a really nice room. It was a perfect spot in a loft. Yeah, I mean, I was doing a lot of remixes. And I think around maybe about 20 or 30 a year. I can't remember, but a lot. So, but you know, I was really enjoying it. I was loving being in the studio and being so creative. And, you know, I think... problem for for all of us well the more successful I came or the more time I spent on the road the less time I had and then I started forgetting how I was doing things I mean I think I look back at remixes I've done like the peace division you know which Nina plays or Rod had and now and I'm like I don't know how I made it so if you want to make music you've got to devote all your time to it Or at least have a period in your life where you have this monk-like devotion. Yeah, yeah. And I think it shows. I mean, when I was studying fine art, you know, the teacher that we did the life class, he was like, he said, if you want to do this. He said, you need to do it every day. And I think, you know, with making music, well, the repetition of doing it, I think it's great, you know. I think you learn so much. Yeah, it reminds me of, I remember hearing some quote about how the Beatles never would have been the Beatles unless... they had a residency playing every night of the week at a club in Hamburg if they didn't clock all those hours. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think it's the same with DJs as well. I mean, you can really tell DJs that are DJs that, you know, have had long residencies in clubs. It really shows on how they play, how relaxed they are. If you look at Sven Veith, he's so relaxed. Maybe too relaxed, but he's very relaxed, you know, and he only plays vinyl, but he does it so well. And this comes with confidence and also, you know, just the amount of time you spend on things. And I guess just feeling completely at home in that situation. Yeah, I mean, back in the early 2000s, I was kind of blown away. by producers like Dave Taylor, Switch, and also James Holden. And I think they both became masters of their craft, you know, within the computer. And I think they, you know, the music that they produced was really, you know, very forward thinking. And it really showed, I think Dave was holed up for years learning logic and just, he nailed it, you know. Yeah, it's interesting. It seems like sort of again and again, you're sort of pointing out the arrival of the computer as an important turning point for you. And why did the PC kind of unlock your creativity the way it did? I guess it was just that kind of like just a hands on side of it. I've trained as a graphic designer. And I've always loved using my hands and that kind of, I guess, creating collages. I guess that translates into music and sound. And with sampling and, you know, with just the accessibility it gave. me the options or the ability to to do what i wanted to do and that's it you know and it's just as simple as that and before i mean now i mean i do a lot of projects in other studios and i use hardware with stuff but you know and it all depends on what you're trying to create you know and what you're trying to achieve in the studio yeah it's interesting because i guess Whether it's true or not, there's kind of an idea floating around that the advent of producing music on computers and things like Logic, Ableton, etc., people are fond of saying that... that gave us like a wave of, you know, really amateur music. Yeah. It's the same with graphic design and designing. It happened in the same way with the Apple Mac. Yeah, it was exactly the same. And it's even kind of the same. There's a parallel too with blogs versus newspapers. For sure. It's the empowerment of the amateur, I guess. It's interesting though to hear that. Maybe in addition to, you know, 16-year-olds with a cracked copy of Ableton, there are also some of the most influential artists, you know, in recent memory, like James Holden or something. It's interesting just to hear that for really serious artists like them as well, the, you know, the arrival of production software was, you know, essential. Yeah, of course. I think it's... I think it's all about ideas and having ideas. I mean, of course, you can make mistakes or find weird things happening with a computer as well, you know, that enable producers to have their own sound or a unique sound. Yeah, again, it's all about having ideas. I mean, if you've got no ideas, then you're not going to make music on anything. And I think this day and age, or say in 2016, I think a lot of guys or people get caught up in having so much hardware. But at the end of the day, I mean, do you want to sound like a producer from 1998? I don't want to hear music that was... I mean, I love this sound, but I want to hear forward-thinking music, not music that's so retro-sounding, you know? So it's very easy to copy as well, and that's the thing. I think it can be a nuisance, but also it's a great thing. So, yeah, it's up to the individual, the user, let's say. Yeah, I read, I think it might have been the interview you did with R.A. at this point, like six years ago or something like that. You said something like imitation is like a big problem in your life in general. What do you mean by that? Or how does imitation, you know, hurt the scene, I guess? Well, I guess, I mean, this is the thing. I guess there's so many people making music and it's so accessible. I guess if you look at like other things, like if you look at say Instagram, I mean, it gives people the instant gratification that they're great photographer with all the filters. And I think you can have that with music as well. And I think. A lot of software enables people to go, wow, I'm amazing. You know, when, you know, it's maybe the, that's the thing that maybe it does look great or sound great, but. how many times do we want to hear the same thing or see the same thing, you know? So I think it's difficult to stand out in the crowd these days because there's so much noise. But yeah, I don't know. Well, you kind of touched on something there with something like Instagram gives a non-photographer. instant gratification whereas you know in photography music i think it's the same with the same with with djing and i mean the same with with using a laptop or using cdjs with a pen drive with a sync button i mean it gives people that that gratification and it's great and it is great because it means people can go wow look at me i'm i'm mixing two records and And yeah, it gives them that feeling that they're a DJ or they're a photographer or they're a producer. I feel like, to some extent, an obvious truth is maybe why that has such a magical effect is because the reality is that being really good at anything can take... very frustrating amount of time in many cases. And it's basically, I think it's interesting to, you know, your kind of, your story is an example of it. Yeah. That, you know, it's not until 16 years after you start gigging that you set up a label and you probably started gigging around the world and, you know, more than 10 years after you started. Yeah, I think going back to the label and records, it's so easy these days for people just to give up, I think, or not see things through and not really learn about something. And I think it's so easy just to say, okay, this isn't working. We'll start something new. We won't see it through. You know, and a lot of people, when I was going through some difficulties with records, they were like, just, you know, just close the label, start something else. Records have been around for a long time and we've got some great music, great artists, and we'd be ashamed. But I think these days that throwaway element goes through everything, you know, and it's just like, let's see it, let's listen to it, that's it, you know, let's move on. I'm sure with Resident Advisor, if you stream something, that's as far as people will go with it. They won't entertain the idea of visiting a record store or even going on a web store that sells vinyl because they'll listen to it and they'll go, that's great, but what else have you got? What's next? And that's good. That's both, you know, that's quite, that's frustrating, but you know, I'm, I'm proud with what we've achieved with records and, you know, I think it's, we still got a long way to go. So I don't, you know, I see it, see it working really well. Yeah. Something I was wondering about was, you've seen a lot of pretty dramatic ups and downs. As you said, when you started the label, you could expect to sell a number of records that would probably be inconceivable today. And you had some hard knocks. The label went on hiatus a few years ago. Was it ever difficult to maintain the confidence that you should keep doing this? It's a constant battle to navigate through this kind of world, the music industry. And it is ever-changing. When we started records, we could... You could sell quite a few thousand of each 12 inches and sell thousands of albums, still sell CDs. And of course, then everyone went digital. You know, everyone was like, sell your records. All the DJs were selling their vinyl. records became kind of not worthless but they lost their value and now we're in a phase where there's a vinyl revival and so it's always changing and I think Yeah, I mean, I enjoy it. I really love, I mean, I look at your site every day and sites like Hardwax, Dex, Juno every day in case I miss something. So, you know, I love it. I love this kind of... I guess it's become much more of a cottage industry, but it's a big one, you know, and everyone seems to have their own label. So it's a kind of, there's also their fight to have your place and also, you know, release music. That's interesting though, a cottage industry as opposed to... I guess, you know, just 10 years ago, it was like a regular full-blown industry. Yeah, I mean, I could easily make a living from selling techno. 12 inches. Yeah, I think it's funny because people always say, well, you know, there was loads of people writing about how the electronic music's here, EDM, you know, but if you look back to the 90s, the early 90s, every pop artist had a remix by someone like Master at Work, David Morales. You know, they were spending, record companies were spending so much money on remixes and, you know, you'd have these Todd Terry. triple pack promo so you know it was really big back then but of course the record companies had money you know you could sell records to people people had no other option but to listen to music on a turntable if it was a single maybe there was a single cd that was it and you know Records were broken in clubs. That was the thing. The record labels would give DJs the acetates. And that's how it would work. And it's very different now. It's completely different. So, you know, and it's only big in a way that's really, it's an event industry. And that's what's driving this whole mechanism. It's not, you know, it's not the record labels. It's completely the opposite. It's basically the record labels are... kind of like a side project to the DJ gigs. Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's still so important. And I mean, I'm really in awe of a lot of labels that have been going for years, you know, like, say, Perlon. I mean, there's quite a few, you know, that just still do their thing. They don't sell their music digitally. They've got their own vibe. That's what they do. And I think it's great. There still is a fan base for music, but I think it's still very odd that a label like Wreck-It or another independent label, we can now only produce a limited amount of vinyl. We're considering how many millions of people are actually... actually into this culture. Yeah, I mean, it's weird to think that the same artist who, you know, presses only 500 copies of his latest 12-inch will play to crowds of thousands on the festival circuit. Yeah, but I think, I mean, as long as those artists, as long as they're giving something back, I mean, I love buying records and I'm... I'm not so into, I don't really download music. And I really like to support the scene. And I think as long as people are doing that, I think even if it gets smaller and smaller, I think there'll still be a core audience and a core amount of labels that will have the ability to release music, you know, on vinyl, that is. You mentioned that before that it sounds like you buy records completely as a normal record nerd from the way you're talking about it. I guess I find a lot of DJs develop. natural phenomenon for a DJ to develop a slightly different relationship with records you know like records become your to some extent like your work materials or something like that it's only some DJs that never lose that sort of I think you just you said earlier like a kid in a candy shop yeah I mean I'm still a fan boy and still an enthusiast and I've still got that mania yeah it's quite worrying sometimes but it's it's I mean, I've still got it. I mean, I think, you know, I grew up looking back again to the 80s. I mean, I was really into soundtracks. And if you're into a movie, let's say Blade Runner, you know, the only way you could really remember that movie was to buy the soundtrack, you know, or read about it in a magazine. So I've always had that kind of hoarding kind of mentality when it comes to culture, like magazines or books and vinyl. Yeah, I still love buying music and I still love the format. But I think it's, you know... It's different for the younger generation. I mean, luckily for them, I don't think they have the need to consume like we did. You know, you don't need to buy music or books, maybe unless you really want it to keep it. When we were collecting disco back in the late 90s, when we got really into it, you know, we'd have to go and see a record dealer. You know, there was no Discogs, no eBay. And it was, you know, it was difficult. You had to go digging, you know, go on trips. Me and Joel used to travel to America and go to the WFMU record fair. Is that Joel from Quiet Village? Yeah, yeah. And he's one of the biggest record diggers in the UK. And, you know, it was very, very different. So, I mean, if you wanted to have samples for production, like sound effects or beats or anything, I mean, you needed to go out and get them. You now, you know, if I'm really stuck. then I might go onto YouTube or I might look elsewhere, you know. I might ask a friend, someone who knows how to get something. But, you know, it was completely, you had to have it. So that's why I've got walls and walls of, you know, records just for sampling or, you know, you had to have that stuff. You know, there was no way around it, you know. I thought it was funny that a minute ago you said your kind of undying love for this stuff. You said it was kind of worrying. But I think the funny thing is you're actually incredibly lucky. A lot of people... I mean, the opposite would spell out a bad situation for you. Like if you were flying around up there DJing and didn't 100% want to be there, people don't really have control over that. Yeah, I guess it's just interesting to me why it is that for many people the thrill of a dance floor or the thrill of a rave is something that even if you're a dancer, If it's very strong for a while and even if it's strong enough that you make great music and DJ really well, it sort of takes on, you know, loses some of its polish sooner or later. And it's curious to me how someone else that sort of is like you in that regard is Marcel Demann. I remember he had a line where he said when he's walking home from Hard Wax, the records he just bought. He's just as excited as when he was on the train from Hard Wax as a teenager. I don't know. Why do you think that is? Why do you think it remains so strong for you? I don't know, I guess there's always that thing about getting something new and listening to something that's brand new, that a record label's released, you get the finished product and you put it on at home. It's still the same as when I was 12 or 13, I guess. And I think that's the same with the whole kind of club experience. I mean, talking about Marcel, I think the first gig that Marcel and I did together was like 2006 or 2005 in the canteen opposite Berghain. And after the gig, we went, I think it was a Sunday and Boris was playing in Panorama. And it was a summer's day. You know, I had again that feeling of being a teenager when I'd already played in the club, but I'd never really, my first experience wasn't that amazing. And of course, going back. that second time you know you walked in that room and you know you feel like you know I don't know you get that getting goosebumps goosebumps and yeah and then you realise this is what it's all about you know and from that you know especially hearing guys like Boris playing I was like wow these guys are playing these records and it was all this stuff that I'd been collecting in the 90s And, you know, it's like the cycles and especially with like music, it's the same, you know, discovering like an old record can be as great as discovering a new record. And the thrill of being in a record store and not recognising any of the sleeves is unbelievable. I get goosebumps thinking about it. It's crazy. Yeah, I wanted to mention that part of your way of working, that you seem to always have new things bubbling up. There's quite a bit we haven't even mentioned yet. You did Pyramids of Mars. You're still doing Cabin Fever. Yeah, yeah. Rebirth or Records 2.0. We've now relaunched Pyramids of Mars as well. What do you mean by Records 2.0? Well, it was kind of with the hiatus or I guess it was like a rebirth, finally getting the label back on track. And it's got, you know, we've been changing the feel, not the feel musically, but feel maybe with the artwork. The label's kind of pretty much based here now, which is great, and in Berlin. And, yeah, we're working... on Pyramids of Mars and trying to make that as a standalone label, more kind of experimental, left field sounding stuff. Yeah, and trying to separate all the different projects out. Of course, I'm still doing the label with Jamie Fry, the double arm, and we're still sporadically releasing records when we can, when we can find the music. that fits and yeah, so there's lots of different avenues. I understand if you don't want to go into specifics, but about the hiatus, I'm just curious, I mean, wreckage from the outside seems like a quite healthy operation. But what are the kind of challenges that label like records would face that would force it into that sort of position of having to take a break for a year and a half? I mean, there was lots of different things that happened. I mean, I got pretty sick in the middle of 2013. I ended up in hospital for a couple of weeks and had my tonsils removed. and it was kind of a bit of a wake-up call for me and took a step back, was more focused on looking at what was going on with the label and everything around me, personal life. I was sober then for nearly, well, until the beginning of 2015. It was good for me, but with everything that... I kind of, everything that happened, quite a lot of things transpired that meant that the label had to be put on hold. But it's good now. I mean, it was kind of like the label was a little bit sick and we had to kind of fix it, you know, and it took a while. But yeah, it was, I think it's just... One of the challenges, like you say, challenges that faces a lot of labels. And I mean, it's as a label grows and there's over 400 titles on records, you know, this blew up to, I think. We're nearly at records 90. And it's a lot of music, a lot of albums. And this needs to be looked after. There needs to be, you know, the accounting, management, everything has to be, you know, it's got to be taken care of. And this isn't easy, you know, especially as... Sales decrease. You've still got to do all this stuff. It takes money and it takes time. We've found a way to make things good again and make it right. Is that a matter of just smart business, smart accounting and things like that or is it more of a creative thing? Yeah, I mean... To be honest, I'm terrible with money and it's not really my forte. I mean, I know how to spend it. You know, I've always said this when I'm talking to artists who want to launch their own businesses. I mean, you need good accounting and that's really crucial and to stay on top of what's going on. you know and especially when you're especially when you know records is like a family and we've got you know artists like Nina or you know people that are it becomes a close close circle of friends you know it becomes more than business you know and you spend a lot of time with these people we could have just could have just shut the label But of course my music's in there. There's a lot of... It's too precious to just let it go. So it was worth spending the time to fix all the problems. It took a long time, but we got there. For you as an artist, as a creative person, how much sort of satisfaction do you get out of running a record label versus making music and DJing? I guess it goes hand in hand. I mean, I really love working with other artists. I like seeing the whole process from start to finish, whether it's the artwork or... getting the tracks mastered, remixes, that kind of thing. I love the whole process. It's very challenging these days because, of course, you've got to realise that there are so many limitations with what you can achieve. I'd love to spend thousands and thousands on crazy remixes and stuff like that, but it's just not possible. Especially when you can only sell a few hundred or a few thousand. So it's tricky. It's a tricky game. Maybe compared to DJing or producing, it's more about... you know, facing certain realities where it's like, you can't just do whatever you want. Yeah. I really enjoy it. And we've, we've signed some really cool stuff for this year. And, um, it's just about course selling the music, but also making sure people can get it, you know, and it's a lot of work. I think these days it's a lot of work, but it's still worth it. You touched on earlier the kind of buzz of producing music and the buzz of buying records. what's the buzz of curating a label? I mean, there's so many parts to it. I think, again, it's like, it's that thing from, you know, signing a record or hearing a demo to then receiving a package with the finished copies, you know, and hoping that they're going to be okay, you know, and hoping that everything, every part of it from the label copy to the... to how it sounds, you know, hoping that there's no faults with the pressing, that it's been shrink-wrapped, you know, making sure that, you know... all these parts right but you know it's it's great and especially if you see you know if I'm playing and people come up to you with records or you know if I'm with the DJ in the club and you know I remember being with I think like with Ryan and he's got like he was showing me he was Ryan Elliott and he was showing me every Mr G record that he had in his his box you know and it's it's things like that it's you know it makes it all worthwhile And again, if I can help and support other artists, I mean, it's been amazing to see how well Nina's done. And, you know, from meeting her in Australia in, I think, 2006 or 2007. Wow, that's that long ago. Yeah. Me and Gerd Janssen hearing her DJing from that to then signing records from her and, you know, having to convince clubs to let her play. But we had records, you know, we had a label. We had this platform that enabled us to put new artists into clubs where we had residences like Panorama or Rex. In that way, it's great because, you know, people hopefully they will believe in you and trust you that you can bring the right artists to the table and not, you know, it's been the opposite of being, you know, something that just doesn't work. And I guess, you know, it's not an easy, in many ways, not easy. easy industry it's not an easy way to make a living so I guess if you can help out as far as you believe in your friends for sure I mean and I mean of course everyone wants the newest thing these days but it's still hard I mean to to get people into clubs and to to convince promoters that you know you should book this person well in that respect it's great if you can have a label night or label party showcase in clubs where you can bring new talent. And, you know, of course, with Nina, that's just been a huge success. Much earlier, you said something about how as you kind of get more successful, it gets harder and harder to balance all the different parts. But you seem to have it sort of worked out. Your output is really consistent and you run a label, you make music, you DJ. What did you learn over the years that sort of, you know, how did you find that balance? I think it took me a long time and I'm still learning all the time. And it's not easy. I mean, I would love to have more time to make more music. I'm also kind of interested in other things. So it's... it's tricky. I mean, it's tricky. It's tricky to run the label. I think over the last few years, I've slowed down definitely on how much I'm touring and probably DJing more, say, more locally, so more in mainland Europe. And you need, I mean, you do need time. You need time to run these things. I'm really lucky I'm working with Jamie Fry and, you know, he's great. He's helping run records in Berlin. I've got a great label manager who's in London. And yeah, I think, yeah, it's just not easy, but it's doable, you know. As we've said, I've got this problem. I keep starting all these new things and I've just launched this web store, but ultimately the web store, I'm hoping, is the final platform for everything to go in, you know, like this box where everything fits in there. Yeah. When you said you're interested in other things, do you mean like other creative projects? Yeah, I mean, like making T-shirts or art projects. And the thing is, you know, you need time to listen to music. With all of the touring and with everything else, you know, again, you need time to just sit down and listen to the music, especially the music I buy. You know, I try and make the time to sit down and go through it all and listen to it, you know. Because I miss that. I mean, when you're a teenager, you just spend all your time just, like, listening to music. That's all I did, you know. But now, of course, you've got the laptop, you've got your phone. There's so many distractions and, you know, it's important to switch it all off and just listen to music. I saw somewhere you sort of jokingly referred to yourself as part of the over 40 set. Did I? Of DJs, I guess. Right. I mean, and I guess in a general sense. what's that like or how is DJing as a profession you know I guess I think I still thought I was a teenager up to about the age of 42 and then I've kind of realised that maybe my body doesn't function as well as it did. It's fascinating that some of the guys at the top of the game, like Robert Hood, for instance, who's amazing. I mean, you know, he doesn't live in Berlin or Detroit and yet he's so on it, you know, and the music he makes is incredible. And so I think we're living in an era where, of course, these gravers, as they're known, you know, these are the people that are still, you know, they're still into it. I've got lots of friends who are still mad about partying or music. And, of course, as the older you get, well, it depends, but... for a lot of people they may have more money so they can buy even more records you know as they get older so I think definitely there's been this generation of guys in their 30s or 40s who started now obsessed with discogs and stuff like this you know and I think that's definitely maybe an older generation thing than maybe a younger generation but you know I mean also look at DJ Harvey you know I think he's in his 50s now and or Francois Kovalkian Yeah, I mean, I don't think it's any different. I guess it's just interesting to me how, you know, on a kind of a superficial level, just I guess the activity of going out feels like it's a young thing to do or whatever. But then, as you say, there are so many compelling examples. There's so much evidence that you can basically just carry on. Yeah, I mean, I used the example of like, I mean. Francois, I think he's still as enthusiastic as he probably was when he was a teenager from the sound of how he speaks about music. I don't see there being any difference. I think if you're into it, you're really into it. And I think there are these people where it just is, that's their life, you know, that's with me. I don't know any different. You know, that's all we do. So when I was growing up, I was really into skateboarding. And when I was 16, I didn't know any skateboarders who were like 50. But now it's normal. You know, it's normal for the dads to be skateboarders, you know, and still have this kind of very much of a kind of young person's lifestyle. I don't know. I mean, it's kind of the norm, you know. So, of course, there's now kids that are probably going out with their parents raving. Yeah, I know for a fact that there are. Yeah, so I mean, it's, you know, that's just the way it is. I mean, I think, I think in the 70s, when I was growing up, you know, being a teenager, you were still very much a teenager and adults were adults. But you know, that's, that's all changed, I think. I feel like, I don't even need to ask this question, but what lies ahead? Well, I mean, as I said, it's 10 years of records this year. I'm hoping that I will finally make an album as record, another album, because it's been like 10 years since I made the first one. And I've kind of, I've always put it off. I don't know why. And I've amassed a lot of material. that I want to use. And I've also kind of, over the last year, the last two years, I've really been getting back into the studio environment and I really love it. I'm really enjoying it. And so I think there's definitely going to be more music and, yeah, so other things. I'm working at the moment on this web store. And we're working on a collection of T-shirts and working with it. We've got this platform, which is like a marketplace for cool stuff. And we want to start. selling more music there and just having this cool little store this online store I'm really passionate about that I'm really enjoying that I'm really seeing it I really like liking how it's developing and I'm hoping that as things maybe shrink you know that we can bring some cool labels on board you know I'm quite into this sort of self distribution thing especially when it comes to t-shirts or books or small like products you know and I think it's all just about you know if we can create a nice space yeah I don't know who knows Maybe we'll open a store in Berlin. That might be the next thing.
