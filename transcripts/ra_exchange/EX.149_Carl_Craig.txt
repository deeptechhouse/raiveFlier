Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. For many, Carl Craig is the finest electronic music artist Detroit has produced. So starting out in the early 90s, he's amassed an immaculate discography that has spanned myriad aliases and genres. Much of this music has arrived via Planet E, the label he's been carefully cultivating for over 20 years now. Craig released a string of impeccable remixes a few years back, which further fueled his reputation as a specialist in the form, but he's been comparatively quiet on the production front since. This will be addressed next month with the release of Masterpiece for Ministry of Sound, a triple CD that will collect his influences, the music he's currently playing in clubs, and a brand new collection of original material. It was on this subject that Joe Muggs began his conversation with Craig, and the pair went on to discuss the Beatles, technology, modern pop music, and the idea of the studio as an instrument of war. you you Okay, before we delve into your heritage and your place in the scheme of things, can we start with the present moment, I guess? What's summer 2013 hold for Carl Craig? This year I played Glastonbury. First time. That's exciting. Yeah, yeah. That's really interesting to do that. I wonder when Noel Gallagher will come out and start ripping on me or something. You better have your Oasis remixes ready just like Jay-Z had. No, I'll wear an Oasis shirt with tape crossing out Oasis. Call it Mirage instead. Hey, are you familiar with all the mythology of Glastonbury? Are you kind of ready to get spiritual there? I'm not going to be there long enough to do that. I mean, actually, I fly in. drive down and play. Yeah. And then I got an early flight the next day. So we're still trying to logistical aspects of it. Actually the gigs, I don't really get a lot of chance to spend on site. I guess the one that everyone talks about all the time, which is Burning Man, which, you know, I don't. I don't think it's even possible to go in and play and leave because it's so far out and everything. You know, maybe when I have my epiphany at some point, you know, then I can do it. you know, a lot of it is related to, it seems like, copious drug intake. Yeah. So... This is the case. Yeah. I mean, you don't like to throw yourself into 24 hours inside the club, then? No, not in the club. No, I mean, that's just like if you work at McDonald's and you want to stay there, you know, for 12 hours over your shift. I mean, you know. Eating extra burgers. Yeah, well, eating extra burgers. Sitting there like, you know, just eating the fries and working the cash register. Like, okay, you know. Maybe R. Kelly likes doing that, but I don't think that's the case. And what else is going on this summer? Well, I'm doing a compilation for Ministry of Sound. Have you heard of it? This will be the famous masterpiece collection. Yeah, you've actually heard of it. Yeah, I'm doing a compilation for Ministry of Sound that seems to be quite... mystical right now because I'm still working on it. Nice. Have you listened to the previous volumes in that? Because that's been a really serious series. Yeah. I've listened to Giles's I don't know who else has done them Andrew Weatherall did a really good one I'd really love to hear that yeah and it seems to be that they throw themselves a bit more into this one than you know a standard either retrospective or mix album it's something that's a bit of both and people treat with quite a bit of seriousness. What sort of approach are you taking to it? Well, one that's considered a mixed CD is more current things that I'm playing out in the club. The second one, which is an inspiration one, which I really am feeling a lot, is tracks that have inspired me as well as tracks that I like. So it includes, you know, some Motown things, which I never really talk about Motown, but there's like some real big influences from Motown. You know, I've got a David Lynch track on there, which I really like what he's doing musically. I think it's actually quite incredible. And then the third one's more of a meditation kind of thing. So it's... Or new age music. But I'm creating it so it's not of music from other artists. It's like I'm creating something new for it. Oh, okay. I mean, I guess it's been a while since we've heard anything. Less beat orientated from you. Yeah. So is that a pleasure in the studio? Do you have to rewire your processes? It's a rewiring that's involved. I have really been getting into the technical side of things, especially because of all the possibilities with computer programs. You know, you can get just so lost in the technical side of things. You know, I've always said that fucking around with plug-ins all day long, you know, you can just screw your mind up because you're getting so locked into that concept of what plug-ins can do. And, you know, so I'm at a point where now it's like a scaling back of the technology because I found out. as much as I think that I need to find out about it in order to go further creatively. That's a very interesting point that I think a lot of people find themselves in techno and related music. Techno was always forward-looking. We must embrace the possibilities of the technology. And there came a point where the technology just overtook and it became impossible to deal with it all. But also the technology made everything so easy. Yeah, and unfortunately, the concept in futurism, as far as techno is concerned, a lot of people were still stuck in the past in making their techno. So, you know, it ain't techno unless it's 808 and 909 and, you know, Mirage. And if it doesn't sound like a Derek May record, it ain't techno kind of thing. Or if it doesn't sound like Juan Atkins, it's not techno. And that's really a stagnating point of view in relation to what techno really is to me. Of course. But the flip side of that is that it has to have all the latest plugins and then everyone sounds the same because they sound like the plugin. Sure, yeah. You know, Francois K and I were talking about it a couple of years back how... you know everything that you can do now and in uh logic or or pro tools whatever i mean you wish you could do that 20 years ago when when i was starting and you know 20 25 years ago when he was mixing a lot of those big records, you know, it's, it's like now a kid with a crack version of a, of, of a software can sound like, you know, like he's in a million dollar SSL studio, you know? And I mean, that's cool on a technological aspect of it, but it's kind of fucked up. It's really kind of fucked up. So how do you navigate your way through that? I mean, how do you stop yourself from going, I'm going to have all of these toys and utilize every possibility? Oh, yeah. I had to start selling stuff, you know, because I have a lot of hardware. And when you have hardware, especially before the plug-in started being so common, you know, in order to have the right sound on. you know, a vocal as well as other instruments at the same time, you'd need four or five pieces of the same gear, you know, and many times you want to have maybe a bit of a variety. So like going to the ice cream shop and. You know, you have chocolate and then you put vanilla on it and then you put some strawberry on top. And then, you know, you put Superman or whatever flavor on top. So you have like five different ice creams on top. Really, all you wanted was the fucking chocolate and the chocolate's on the bottom, you know, or in the middle or something. So you could end up having like all this freaking gear and you only really need, you know, one compressor, the same compressor on everything. So plugins made it possible where you can have one of a specific type. plug-in and then you could put it on everything that you ever wanted to put it on and instead of having the hardware stuff so I had all these various flavors so I just decided to purge myself basically stick my finger down my throat and sell off all this stuff that I really didn't need and then of course the other problem that you come into after you start getting rid of the gear is that you have replacements and plugins of it and you have about 10 different plugins that can do exactly the same job, except that they might have a little character difference or something. And that's another thing which is like, okay, you know, I'm just going to cut out what I don't need, you know, and Logic could tell it not to see what you don't need or pull out a plugin folder or whatever. So, you know, it's just getting to that point. So it's almost a bit of punk rock attitude in the stripping away of the extraneous frills and unnecessary stuff. I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish. You know, I love Throbbing Gristle and that industrial concept of what they did with guitars and tapes and stuff. But they were still a very technological band, especially when you look at... Chris Carter and you know that he's a synth cat and stuff so it's like yeah you know maybe I want to you know I just want a Les Paul and I just want the Les Paul to play drums and I want the Les Paul to be the bass line and I want the Les Paul to do all this kind of stuff but You know, no, I mean, that's not that's not throbbing gristle to me. You know, it's it's not it's like Chris Carter and the Gristle Later and, you know, all the other stuff that he was doing. I'm into that kind of thing. And even he's selling off gear now, you know. Is there anyone that you're finding inspiration from in terms of sheer simplicity at the moment? You know, I don't know enough of his music. I've listened to a little bit of his actress. He seems quite simple in what he does. Another guy who's really fucking simple is Tyler, the creator. Yeah, his shit is super simple. You know, I kind of... I listen to a lot of radio these days. And one of the kids that I like, and I listen to quite a bit of lyrical rap shit, rap bullshit. And I like this guy, Aesop Rocky. He's got this track called Level that basically the music sounds like an Urban Tribe record. Yeah. There's a lot of these guys where, you know, they're surprisingly popular. The Odd Future guys, Tyler and his friends. And actually the music does sound like some kind of experimental thing from the 90s. ASAP Rocky is, I mean, God, he's working with Skrillex. Oh, right. Yeah. You've never been someone who seems to accept much divide between underground and what reaches the radio, though. I mean, is that still the case that you kind of you listen to them with the same set of ears as it were? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I grew up. listening to the radio. Actually, Shuar from Urban Tribe, we were talking about it the other day because he's retooling his album. And a lot of his album was maybe more like his other moniker than Urban Tribe, you know, higher BPM stuff, maybe more electro sounding. And I played him the A$AP Rocky track and he's like, okay, I got to do Urban Tribe like what we did early. an urban tribe. So he retooled a lot of it and we were discussing, we were discussing sounds and he's the guy who told me back in 19. 87, 88, that the 808 was the future, you know, and he was spot on because by that time the 808 was getting a, you know, everyone was, was using more Lendrum sounds. It was more realistic drum machine samples that are drum samples that were using drum machines. And then of course, Luke and, and all those guys that were still using 808. And then when cash money came out, with their whole thing. I mean, it just really opened up the door for 808 across the board, for trap music, for everything. And we were talking about it, about sounds and how people still now have the idea that Kraftwerk sounds are still futuristic. And you find people using these kind of craftwork sounds that are supposed to be futuristic sounds, but they sound dated. They sound like they're 30 years old because they are 30 years old, you know? So then we got into the conversation about what we grew up listening to on radio because I listened to a lot of radio. And it was forward for us to hear. Soft sell, you know, on the radio, human league on the radio, hearing craft work on the radio and all this stuff. And, you know, in 1980. don't you want me baby to me I mean it was the shit I was 13 years old you know but it ain't the shit anymore you know I'm saying so like when I when I hear people kind of dissing what's on the radio these days, actually there's a generation of kids that that shit is cooler than hell. I mean, me as being somebody who's been in the industry for a long time, I can just kind of guide people, but I can't make you have the taste that I want you to have because I've been doing this for a long time. you know, what I do, I try to be forward about it, but the younger generation are the future. And I should probably be listening to what their opinions are musically instead of trying to force my opinion on the younger generation. I'm sure. I mean, there are things that come on the radio. now whether it's Lady Gaga or Rick Ross that sonically you can understand how someone who's 15 now will listen to something that you or I would play them and it just sounds lame in comparison because this stuff is is tooled like a war machine you know and of course there's a lot to learn from that They may go back the same as we went back to jazz records or to Led Zeppelin or whatever and find the sophistication of stuff from the past. But for now, that stuff that they hear blows everything else out of the water. Exactly. But what's great, I think, about Rick Ross's music, Rick Ross, I think, has a very high standard of sonic. music sonically so you might not like the actual music but the sonics of the music is is really incredible and i started listening to rick ross's music as being more like an earth wind and fire record because it sounds like earth wind and fire to me just with him rapping on talking and doing whatever he's doing but it sounds like earth wind and fire and And I love that concept because Earth, Wind & Fire records were actually, you know, the war machine of 1976, you know, 76, 77, whatever, because one of the most respected sound engineers engineered all this shit, George Massenburg. And, you know, George Massenburg makes some of the high line, most pure. uh audio gear for mastering and for studio and you know so they were they were doing it the arrangements they had uh charles stepney that was involved uh uh up until he died i guess um so you know he was the cat for arranging and co-production at the time so yeah they were they were the war machine so now It's changed from the war machine being B-52 bombers to being... you know some stealth crazy shit you know and the stealth shit is as as you were saying earlier you know what we hear the whether it's gaga or whether it's actually gaga might be a little long in the tooth right now but uh it might be will i am with britney spears you know because my my nine-year-old loves that record she goes nuts over that record and You know, we had this dance, this daddy-daughter dance. And, you know, she played me music that she goes, Dad, you know, she'll find something on YouTube. Dad, listen to this. I really like this, right? And I'm glad that she does it. But then when you see your nine-year-old at a dance with all the other girls that are their age, she's standing. by the speaker the guy has a sub and and a speaker on top on the stack and they're pogoing you know just jumping up and down going crazy right and then when a song comes on that they love it doesn't matter whether it's a girl's song or a girl singing or a guy singing they squeal And they just get down. And it's incredible. It's really incredible to see that. And, you know, I don't know if I was like that when I was nine years old, but, you know, I was into it. And it's good to see. It's good to see it again. Definitely. So I'm not going to go over there and say, don't test this record. This record is crap. Even if it's One Direction. Yeah, right. Even if it's One Direction, I'll just do like my parents did. Hey, do you hear this? No, I was ignoring it. And what about... more, well, you know, I say we kind of deconstruct the split between underground and mainstream, but what about more experimental stuff? I mean, you know, you look at someone like Flying Lotus, who I was listening to recently and thinking... actually he's kind of taken what Inner Zone Orchestra and Urban Tribe in the late 90s were doing and just complexified and made it bigger and bolder. I mean, are there particular artists that you notice doing this kind of, you know, making those war machines? As far as real music is concerned. As far as music you want to listen to. As far as music I want to listen to. You know, I believe that I'm going to have to have a new mentor. I'm going to have to have someone sit me down and play me a lot of music that I don't get a chance to hear, you know. so that I can discover music in another way. I need a John Peel. I need an electrifying mojo. In radio in Detroit, no, we don't have that. And I don't know if you have that here right now. I don't know if Benji's the guy or who's actually the cat that's carrying the torch and really putting it all out. you know yeah benji for sure and and you know alex nutt on rinse fm and a few of the other kind of rinse fm djs it seems to be that they each have their zone i mean you know there's there's still no one who who crosses all the lines like john peel did right I mean, when was the last time you felt that someone kind of turned your world upside down musically like that? Because I remember you saying about when you were kind of introduced to out jazz in the early mid-90s. Yeah, that was Francisco that turned me on to a lot of stuff, yeah. I mean, have there been other points like that? in your career where it's just, you know, someone's opened up a whole world? You know, I think it's been more on the technical side. of things that I've been really paying more attention to. And I need some more openness, openings on the creative, actual finished music side. Because when I watch certain DJs, I get really intrigued by their technique and their control. The technique and control has to do with not only, you know, what music they're playing, but how they actually play it in their set and then how they're able to play it for the crowd to respond to it. You know, so I get into. into analyst mode in relation to that, where I really, and I've wanted to do these workshops in Detroit where it's like a set of, you know, B&Ws or PMCs or whatever with some beautiful amps on them, Macintosh or whatever amps, and, you know, just a beautiful thick platter. perfect tone arm, perfect cartridge, and just play records that are inspirational from people like Matt Mike playing records that inspired him to people like Jimmy Douglas, Jimmy Douglas down in Miami, because he started out working on Donny Hathaway and Aretha Franklin records. Now he's still mixing Timberland and Justin Timberlake and all this stuff. He was a mentor for Timberland. To really let the young guys hear what these guys got influenced by, but then get the young guys to come on and play the stuff that really they're into and influenced them. And just have that kind of sit down, almost like the cat. I don't know if you guys had these commercials, but Memorex Tape, when they were doing cassette tapes, they had this ad and they had a commercial of a guy sitting in front of a sound system. And the wind from the low end is blowing his hair and his tie. I think that guy was Peter Murphy from Bauhaus. Was it? Okay. you know, this kind of thing where, you know, you're really hearing everything with sonic importance and with creative importance and stuff so that I can be influenced and inspired in the same way that hopefully, you know, the people that I want to invite would have that same. This is a great idea. And I mean, I guess it keys into the idea of, you know, listening clubs are increasingly a thing, whether people actually go together into a nice pub with a good sound system and sit down and listen to an album all in one go, or you get it online where people all log on to Twitter at the same time, just sit down at home with a record and discuss it as it plays. It seems... to be an idea that's time has come i guess um you know do you find there are clubs more than others where you feel people are kind of listening because because clubbing as such began with maybe david mancuso and for him it was his his house and his hi-fi and people listened to the record from beginning to end. And yes, there was dancing, but it was a listening experience. I mean, are there still places that you go to or play where you find that there's an element of that? Well, Plastic People is the ultimate for that kind of thing because, you know, you're still playing music for people to dance to, but... you can go out, you know? So last time I played there, I started out playing very low BPM stuff. And one of the tracks that I played was a, was considered a cover version of, but I think it was still Toto. but that they just did it under a different name so that they could release it again, but of Africa, but it's dubbed out with effects and shit on it. And I mean, it is alcohol, this version. It goes into the typical Africa vocals and everything. But man, you know, the impact and the power of this track. And, you know, I felt that I could really play that there. The only other places that I would think that I could play something like that would be Precious Hall in Sapporo, which is like, you know, like the loft. Actually, they built a, it's supposed to be a one-to-one version of the loft in Sapporo with the exact. same sound system David Mancuso came over and approved it and you know so they have the Thorin's decks they have you know whatever Bozak mixer they have the the the speakers what were they called a clip shorn they have the clip shorns they have you know across the board they did it you know so And then the other one would be Eleven in Tokyo as well, which is like that. And Panorama Bar, I feel that I can get away with a lot of stuff, but I don't think that it's as possible to get away with playing things that can be on the edge of corny, but that's just sonically there and that people would actually get it when you play it. I guess that's the old balleric trick. I mean, like DJ Harvey was always the king of being able to do that. There were records that Harvey could play in anyone else's hands. People are just like, what is that? Right, right. Do you find yourself craving the chance to do that more now? You know, does playing four to the floor kind of pull with you or do you have periods of getting tired of? floor-to-the-floor music? No, I mean, floor-to-the-floor is just almost like a heartbeat to me, you know? I think creatively, I might get a little self-conscious in relation to that. I still love other music, but I think it... has with the variety it might have more to do with BPM than it does to actual the impact of the kick drum because you know I'm you talked to Niles Rogers recently right or no you haven't talked you haven't done anything with Niall because Niall's like out there now right yeah and um you know this is a guy who has made a career on funk music but that was typecast as disco you know but what he was making was you know real fucking music and his his musical um experiences are in a similar way as say somebody like Hamilton Bohannon, you know, whose biggest records were all Florida floor records. He just changed the tempo. So let's start the dance. which was quite uptempo, I think it might have been 128 BPM, actually sounds exactly like South African Man, which is about 110 BPM. Pretty much the same record. He just changed the BPM. And you don't hear it as being... the same record because you have more space in between the notes or more space in between the beats on South African Man because it's a lower tempo. So it gives a little bit more air. And in some cases you can hear the air as being. a musical thing that makes you think that something's actually different than what it actually is. This is something I wrote quite a bit about in the last year or two because there's just been so many people bringing tempos down of different styles. Andy Weatherall is one example. And Andy Stott, I don't know if you heard any of his stuff on Modern Love. He's a Mancunian guy. you know his standard thing was kind of warehouse techno very basic sophisticated warehouse techno and then his last couple of albums he just brought it down and down and down and sometimes it's techno at 90 bpm sure yeah and suddenly you're inside it you know your relationship your physical relationship to the rhythm is is another thing altogether yeah yeah because this is This is similar to the perception that I get in the studio when I'm working on a loop. If something's looping. whether it's two-bar loop or a two-beat loop or a four-beat loop or whatever, and it's looping and it's just looping, looping, looping, sometimes you walk into that world and then you hear other shit. And then that other shit inspires you. And that's what happens when you change the BPM. And then you might, in a club, it can be kind of risky because... you know, the guy on before you might be playing at 127 or 125 or whatever, and then you walk in and decide to do, you know, 118, you know, you've got to be willing to let more than 50% of the people leave the dance floor. And potentially 50% of those 50% will actually leave the fucking club, you know. But you have to take that risk for the cause, you know, if you're going for that cause. I think it was Derek Carter who said that any halfway good DJ can fill a dance floor. It takes a great DJ to empty it and then fill it again. Man, that guy is a philosopher. He's a genius. But yeah, you do have to take the risks. And if you don't take the risks, you're going to end up losing yourself. And that's what happens with a lot of bands that... and producers and whatever that just keep trying to make the same record over and over again is you know after a while people get it and then after that people don't want to get it anymore you know so maybe you'll have to wait another 20 years to have a comeback or something you know in comparison to kind of change around and this is why i like the Rolling Stones because the Stones they actually fucked around a bit you know and when they did disco they weren't corny about it they you know did I mean they got Arthur Baker in I mean did they get what did they get Arthur on um uh Blood what's the track just sounds like streets like blood no I can't remember it was after Undercover of the Night the track after that okay something blood I'm so bad with titles it's not blood on the dance floor is it I think that was a Michael Jackson song yeah yeah okay yeah they were with the right people I mean they were in Studio 54 right right Because I'm thinking of Missing You. Yeah. You know, which was Bob Claremountain who engineered that. And, you know, I'd still use that record as a reference because sonically, the kick drum is fucking incredible. The kick and the bass lock in so well. And it's just incredible. When I was a kid, I used to like start me up and I was the other side of the 12 inch, you know. So, you know, you could hear that they weren't making satisfaction, you know, at that time. They had stopped making satisfaction back in 1967 or whenever that record came out, you know. And then when they did Sympathy for the Devil, you know, that. was another transition. And then they just kept these transitions and that made them, I think, you know, the greatest band that's alive. And then of course you look at the Beatles and the Beatles had the same type of, of changes except per album. They fucking seemed like they were just changing, you know? There was never Eleanor Rigby part two. No, no, no. You know, talking of that kind of, you know, when a new track sounds like a war machines in comparison to everything that's come before. I remember Danny Baker. I don't know if you're familiar with him. He's a radio DJ here. Playing on the radio, I think he'd had someone on who was saying the Beatles were not that significant or something. And just to demonstrate their achievement, I think he played Please Please Me and then played I Am The Walrus next to it and went, the gap between those is three years or something. And yet they had transformed from something that was great into something that was monumental and strange and even now still sounds... ridiculous and that was because they just wanted to experiment with sound right sure and i think the first the first track i think they they actually had the most experiment with sound was um tomorrow never knows Because I don't know any other Beatles song before that that was as out. And that's still one of my favorite, you know. That and Come Together are the two tracks that I really feel, you know, they just really, it's like, you know, that mind. explosion that happens you know it's just like what how the fuck did you come up with this you know what what what you know i mean i've i've had people come up to me and ask you know that track you did that track what did you what what the fuck were you thinking of when you did that track you know, I want to, I want to ask, I want to like, you know, go to a seance and ask John Lennon, you know, what the fuck was he thinking? You know? Well, it was Paul that was into all the Karlheinz Stockhausen and the loops and all this stuff. But did you ever kind of take stock? I mean, obviously you had the E20 years. Was that a period where you kind of assessed different periods of what you'd done and got a big picture of your past? just not like to do that on the whole. You know, I do go back and reference music every so often. I used to do a lot more, especially when it came down to dats, because, you know, you just I used to keep these dats on my dats and a little safe. And it's like, OK, well, what am I going to release now? And I'll go back and listen to something. And, OK, I did this like five years ago. What the fuck was I thinking of when I did this thing? You know, and that those points where I kind of like past Carl was trying to influence future Carl. kind of thing you know it's like like i had a time machine and i went forward and said this is what's what's gonna happen you know so you got to do this or you know or or forward curl went back to past or however the time machine oh it's like dr leaving little notes on the hieroglyphs in the pyramids on holiday you see a note you left for yourself there you go so those are definitely like freaking notes you know and it was it was really quite incredible to to go back and and have have those experiences and then also with the 20 years listening to stuff that other people had done you know that I hadn't heard in quite a while so it's good Cool. And finally, I mean, are you planning ahead at the moment or is it kind of do the summer shows, do the masterpiece and then look for the next thing? It's been preparation for the war machine. So all the technical stuff that I was talking about earlier is preparation for the creative stuff. Because you can be ultra creative, but then not be prepared. It's like going to war with major artillery, but no actual bullets. You go in with... for Uzi, but you don't have any magazines, you know? So it's, it's just, it's like, you got to get all the destructive, the little destructive shit to come together in order to, you know, to, to make that creative thing effective enough. So if I don't like how I'm EQing something. then it can completely ruin the concept of what I'm interested in doing. And what I'm interested in doing is not only making timeless music, but that I can get as close to sonic perfection as my ability will let me. you you you
