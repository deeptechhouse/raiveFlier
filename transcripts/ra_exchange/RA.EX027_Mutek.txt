Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Over the past decade plus, Montreal's Mutech has grown to become Canada's premier electronic music festival. It has had a dual role. both introducing the world to its vibrant local community, Accufin, Deadbeat, and more among them, and introducing Montreal to some of the world's most challenging and forward-thinking music. We caught up with Alain Mongeau, Vince Lemieux, and Patti Schmidt, three of the brains behind the event earlier this year, to discuss Mutex's origins, impact, and future. I'm Vincent Lemieux. I've been curating the festival with Alain for 10 years now. And I also run Musique Escape, which is my label that I start with a coupon. And I'm also a DJ as well. I'm Patty Schmidt. I've been part of the programming unit at Mutech for two years now. But previous to that, when I worked for CBC, I was collaborating with New Tech and recording concerts and interviewing artists and making... So I'm Alain Mongeau, I'm the founder and artistic director of the FESO, which has been running for 11 years so far. This year is going to be our 12th edition. And I guess... The festival began as an outgrowth of another festival? Or you were working for another festival before that? Yes, I was involved with the film festival, Festival of New Cinema, which was also a festival that had a whole new media component. So my task at the film festival was to develop new media content in relation to image making. And back then, that was like from '97 to 2001, there was a lot of music that was featured at the festival just because for me that's where digital culture was striving as opposed to like everything that dealt with digital image making wasn't so evolved so my idea was if you wanted to have an idea of where image making was going to go you had to look at where digital culture was happening and it was happening in terms of sound and music because the sound and music technology was much more advanced. So back then I did something that was called the Media Lounge. So for five years we had editions of the Media Lounge which was kind of the ancestor of Mutech in a way because that's where we started to lay the roots of what became a Mutech a bit later. So a lot of the artists that came to Montreal for the first time, like Paul... like, I don't know, Rick and Cintra, Richie Houghton were all featured before at the film festival and the media lounge. When did it become apparent that you wanted to do something separate or that, you know, under a different billing? Um... Well, it overlapped. It overlapped, but the thing is the idea of mute take I had even before doing the media lounge. Like, we... I found the project that was written in '96, so it took like four years to actually do MUTEC before it actually happened. So it was a matter of opportunity. And that opportunity came when the Eccentris Complex opened in Montreal and the Film Festival moved to that complex. and I had like a mandate to develop new media within Accenture. So that was the opportunity that I saw. since I was working developing new media in relation to image making with the film festival I had the idea of coming back with like a second festival six months apart which would more or less develop new media but in relation to music and sound so for two years there was like two festivals six months apart developing the flip side of the same coin in a sense and when When you decided to, I guess, book artists for the first festival, was there a particular thing that you wanted to focus upon that you knew that, you know, going in, that this is the... Well, the thing is, is within the Media Lounge, a lot of the nights that we had to program, because it was a film festival, I felt we had to... include a lot of image making and it's like there was VJing and all that so with NewTek for the first time we were able to escape the tyranny of image making and just go into pure sound events, so there was no visuals involved and it was really more focused on music. An immaculate sound environment. Was Accentris quite an immaculate sound environment? It was a new media mecca, was how it was set up. So the fellow who founded it, Daniel Lanois, was... responsible for Softimage, which did a lot of early Hollywood special effects software. So he was already driving for this to be like a kind of a lab, I guess, for developing new media in Montreal and related arts. When you decided to do the first festival and it happened and everything, can you talk a little bit about the reaction? I mean, was it an immediate success in your mind? Did it seem like there was an appetite already for this to happen? Well, it was funny because in a sense, our models were in Europe. Like back then, it was in 2000. We're looking... towards what was happening in Europe and we felt like okay let's build something that will relate to what's happening over there and what happened is after the first edition we received about seven requests from seven different cities in Europe to do like a new tech edition so it was a bit weird because we felt we were kind of doing something that was linking towards Europe, but it's more like they came back and tried to link with us. And actually the first invitation we accepted was to unite with the Club Transmediale in Berlin. So the Berlin edition of this Club Transmediale in 2002, I think, was the first place that we did an offshoot of what Mutech was. The funny thing also is we got more reactions from abroad outside of Montreal than in Montreal itself. Which was kind of... still the case today I think like NewTek is more recognized outside of Montreal than it is in Montreal. No but it's respected now in Montreal. It's really as an institution. Whereas like five or six years ago it was stronger. It was still building the reaction from people in Montreal. They were really... Skepticals and people who found it really closed environment and musically maybe sometimes they thought and it was not but from what it was it started from and then five years later what was happening a lot of people still had like old preconception about the festival being minimal techno and all this because it started a little bit around that style of music in the beginning. But there was really a ripple effect because the second year of the festival people paid, like journalists in Montreal paid more attention to NewTek because they had been traveling and everywhere that they went people were talking about NewTek and they said It was a situation where it's like we managed to position the festival on an international scale from the beginning and that's what kind of helped to establish its reputation even in Montreal. But there were also artists. who were involved in the community in Montreal, not just Montreal-based ones, but it started to become a little bit of a hub in 2000, 2001 for people to move from other places in Canada because there isn't a lot of cities where there's enough critical mass to play to people or whatever, to bounce ideas off of other artists and develop your craft as communities often function. So that was also the other thing that was being exported too. But I think that the Media Lounge has to be recognized as an important base, like a face. It helped us create, like, we had, you know, we had, like, Escape Night, we had a Perlon Night, we had a Minus Night. We could try. There was a tense. So there was already a relationship towards the whole scene that was established through the meeting that really helped after that. I think it jump-started Mutech on a higher level. One of the things that I've always found really interesting about the festival, I guess, is the right place, right time for a lot of different community and producers coming up at that same time. obviously Mark and yourself and... Scott and other people. I guess this would be a good question for you Vince. I mean what was the impact of being able to talk to and see you know people from Europe maybe that you just heard their music and didn't really know them aside from that when they come for the festival? Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. But also, I mean, the thing with Mutex was related. with the artists because we kind of made a group out of it and people like NewTek helped the artists but the artists helped NewTek as well because like the artists were traveling and spreading the word and people could hear about it but also in the other way like we could really profit from it and but a lot of yeah I think I discovered a lot of people through the festival but also it was a It was just the right timing, I think. It was just like everybody was kind of merging to the city. In Canada, and also there's one point even some people from outside Canada came to Montreal because it was the right place to be. I mean, John Barry was one of them. He was living in New York. He's a Canadian, but he was also living in New York for a long time. And I think it's because of New Tech that he came here, came to Montreal. And he was working for 4SYNC. Yeah, he was working for 4SYNC at the time. I think it was the first year he came. I remember because I've been in him. Because the first year we had a lot of 4SYNC, 4Strikes artists like Sutec and Safety Sojourner. Yeah, I think the festival operated like... in terms of building relationships between people. Because, for instance, John Berry came to Montreal as the 4SYNC rep because we had a 4SYNC night, and then he met Mark, and then eventually became Mark's agent, Mark Akufan, and then moved to Montreal. But if you look at the relationships, most of the Montreal artists developed. Scott being on Escape the label it's because Paul came to Montreal through the festival And Perlon with Akufen, same thing. And it just goes on and on, these relationships that were built in the background of the festival. And also not only for us, but also in between artists, because the festival, since the city you've been there, it's so small and there's this square. I mean, where everything is happening, people would meet all the time and for five days, usually that's the thing that we do with Mutech, is we bring the artists for five days. We ask them if they want to come. And sometimes it's really great because certain artists that know each other but never met. finally meet there and not only meet one time but then meet the other day and then a lot of like projects were born because of that like because of people meeting there and like so it's really it's really great for that it's not only for us for the people from Montreal but also for everybody around because the festival the way it is as well because it's one show at a time for a long time it was like that it was one show at a time so people They didn't have any things to decide. They had to go there or they were waiting outside, you know, so people would meet a lot there. It seems very rare. You just talked about that a festival brings in artists for multiple days just to sort of relax, you know. A lot of festivals are just in, you're out, you don't see anyone else who plays. Yeah, usually there's this human feeling that you try to... really focus on. And also for us, it's also a matter because it's easier because we're bringing everybody from Europe. So it's easier that they leave on Monday and leaving during the weekend, which is like sometimes because of money issues because it's like more expensive. But also I think it got into, probably Adam can tell, we started like that and then we found out that there was really a nice way to. Thank the artists. Is that something that was really important to you? To have artists over a while? To an extended period of time? Did that just kind of happen by happenstance? It's a little bit cheaper to send them away on Monday. No, I mean you have to remember that. The know-how that I developed in relation to festival making was working with the film festival. So the film festival has a whole enabling side for directors where they come, they do press conferences, they stay a few days, they talk about their films, they present their film and all that. The idea was really to focus on the content and for me the content of a festival is not just the show, it's also what the artist has to say. So what we wanted to do was really to enhance communication exchanges for everybody involved, like to add a layer of intelligence to... type of music or a practice that was basically judged as just party oriented and I thought there was always much more content than just a party factor. And it's the same reason why we did the festival always featured like experimental music on one side and like more dance stuff. And we were interested in the connection or interconnections between both extremes. in a way. I remember the first year we had Carson Nicolai dancing on a Thomas Brinkman set. For us it was the proof that the formula worked because You could enjoy something totally experimental one day and enjoy something totally danceable the next day and It one has the same kind of value as the other there's not one that's better than the other It's just like a different off offering. So we were always interested in trying to feature artists that were as creative on one end of the spectrum on the other end. Do you feel like also the experimental side of it made it a little bit easier to sell to the city in a way? Like to get funding for things? Or did that even make a difference? So I imagine, say we're doing electronic music, they have an idea of what that is in their mind and they'd be immediately... Yeah, you could see it as a strategy, like by packaging all that. together as a contemporary art form, it was easier to get some support and to get it considered on the same level. Like for me, let's say the craftsmanship that, I mean, Thomas Brinkman's a good example because on one side he does that like totally danceable. sets and on the other side with his clicks performance he's much more like experimental So that's one side of it. But the other thing is, most of these artists, if they'd be given a chance to, like even, let's say, a house artist, someone like Ekufan is another example. If they're given a chance to do something that is considered a bit more serious, give them a commission, they'll come up with something totally interesting. So it's a bit what we've been trying to do. broaden their perspective and say that these artists should not be pigeonholed as functional artists for dance floors. They're much more creative. Another example is Sutec, for instance. He does the most effective dance sets, but he's also totally extreme in experimentation if given the chance. Do you think Mutec... exists as that you're giving the chance to these artists. do something that they wouldn't want to do. Yeah, well, I can say for myself because sometimes I meet artists and I tend to say, like, you know, this is the chance to do something different or try something new. And I try to focus a lot on it because that's why, I mean, I really like to meet the artists sometimes before because, like, if you're dealing with the... booking agent they are they have in mind that they're just booking their artists for a festival which is like i mean there's this conception in europe there's a lot of festivals which are really great but also sometimes it's just like one dj after another and it's i mean it's it's like a club night but it's a festival so when i try when i meet some people i try at least to talk to them or sometimes I meet them over email try to explain what the festival is about and what we're trying to do and and just trying to ask them also if they have something special with you know that they feel free to do something a little bit outside from what they're they're usually doing you know because you're not there to absolutely make people dance or make people whatever. It's open to new projects. Has the booking agent situation changed over the years? Was it always so professional? Yeah, well, I for sure can probably tell you a lot more, but I've been there for 10 years and I can see... I mean, we started... When I started with him, first it was difficult just to get the email from one guy, because there was no info on the internet. And then it started, you had MySpace at the beginning, so it helped a lot, it was quite easy. But at one point, you could see it. There was one point where you're trying to just relay information to the artist. as I was saying before, about special projects. And also what is important is that sometimes we try to give them the context where they're going to play and who's playing with them so that they can make an idea about it. Like let's say it's just a sit-down audience instead of people standing up. Or is it more an environment where people are talking or people are not saying one word? And at one point it was just difficult because you had this blocking because the only thing, like the agent was there. I mean, they're there for a good reason. Maybe it's probably easier for email, everyday email, but sometimes it's just making, it's blocking between the director and the artist. But Mela Ale for sure had some... Yeah, well the situation changed totally. I think the first five years of the festival, I'm not even sure we dealt with one book in each. But ever since the last six or seven years, there has been that layer of booking agents more and more in between. And it makes it sometimes more difficult to actually get to the artist. I mean, one example of that is... I remember the first years I could actually call Matthew Herbert on his cell phone and talk to him. And then he lost his cell phone. An agent popped up in its place. Exactly. Exactly. And some years we actually had three layers of agents before getting to Matthew, just because there's a manager, then there's the European agent, then there's the North American agent. So you have to go through the North American, just so many layers, which makes it difficult to do the kind of work that we were set to do at the beginning. So it kind of displays the challenge in a way. Now it's a challenge just to get the artist to know that there has been a request. That's the thing, I'm sure you send out a very detailed email to this booking agent and then it loses paragraphs as it goes to the artist or if it ever gets to the artist. You never know what happens, which is kind of a tragedy for us because we're... I mean, the other problem that I see is there's festivals and festivals. Like when we take started, there wasn't so many electronic music festivals. And 10 years later today, there is like hundreds of festivals and many different categories of festivals. So now there is, I think, a kind of automatic. gesture from a lot of the agents that when a festival sends a request they think it's big money festival so they will like double or triple the fee and they don't make a difference like for From New Tech, for instance, if an artist was booked at Coachella and gets, let's say, $50,000, then the same agent, if he receives a request from New Tech the year after, he's going to ask $50,000 for the same artist. And it doesn't make sense. I mean, the scale of the festival and all that. So you're stuck with that perception, oh, a festival, it's time to cash in on things. And it makes things a bit more difficult. I'm sure there's many ideas that just haven't come to fruition that you really... But at the same time, when artists come... A lot of artists come to Montreal, when we ask them again, then they know how it is made, it's a human level. They know, they meet the people because it's like a benevolent volunteer that sometimes works there. I mean, you meet people. It's not like you're getting picked by somebody and then you're dumped at the hotel and then that's it. You come and pick up your stuff. It's like every level, there's people working there. I mean, I've always felt that it's a human-level festival. But for the audience too, not just the artists as well. So it's designed not to kill your audience over the course of five days. too and to understand that many people come from outside of Montreal and are going to commit to five days of festival and not just cherry pick a show here and there and so there's kind of an idea that's always in the back of the festival's mind of considering the sociability of that as well and you will get a group traveling together when you don't have a festival that's a fair where there's many different shows going on at the same time is a kind of entity. of its own in the audience, which is kind of an inadequate word, develops also. But it's funny also, like, some of the public will end up booking rooms in the same hotel where the artists are staying, so they will bump into the artists in the hotel, or then they're on the dance floor and, you know, they're... There's Uwe Schmidt, cut the rug! And the artists like that. I mean, those who come, that's what happens. Once they come once at MUTEC, then they all want to come back many times. It seems like you have a lot of sort of... house artists in a way, festival artists that aren't necessarily Canadian like Uwe seems to be asked by Quotidien. Well, it's a community. Yeah, but also like an artist like Uwe, you have like one within like ages, you know, like there's just... these artists that can act as different artists and he's like one of the and also he was a relation when we did something in chile he was like kind of like he was not working for the festival but it was kind of like a link between montreal and chile and But it's normal for festivals that have been around for a while that they develop relationships with certain artists that they like. If you look at Sonar, you see that. If you look at Melt, it's a bit the same when you have a film festival. Let's say you have a film festival that discovers a director and they like that director. Then a few years later, if that director creates a new film, you'll want to feature the film of that director. So over the years, we've developed that kind of... faithfulness, if we could say, to certain artists that also helped develop the festival's profile. So it's kind of a two-way relationship in that sense. the booking all three of you work together on that now on different levels I mean I don't really deal with the I don't mainly will deal with the contracts and the fees and stuff like that but in terms of building the program which it seems like it's quite It seems like a very coherent vision, but I imagine it's not a coherent process. Well, Patty should say a little bit about that because she came into your process. Well, we have to say that we started, we were three now, we were three before, Eric Madsen was doing it before, and he kind of like... Dropped out. Yeah, dropped out at one point. still is a freaking collaborator of the festival but when i started it was with eric was already there and you know in my mind yes so we did it at three and i think if we did i think my language and i we did one year or two years by ourselves like two And it was okay, but it's always difficult because the trio is always good because when two people want to do it, then you're like, okay, let's do it. But when you're two, sometimes you're fighting and there's not a sense of like, well, you know, like I think it's good. So I think it's better that way than since Patty and also Patty. He's a girl, so... I'm not even in touch with the thing, but... So she settles the fights, is what you're saying? No, I starve them. You starve them. But we're three people and we're really stubborn, each one of us, so it's kind of... It's really weird the way we work. It's probably weird in every festival. I really don't know. I think the way we work is probably crazy. It's really... Slow. And it starts in the fall after the June festival. So it's a good four-month, five-month process. And then starts to be a meeting every week or twice a week that they can go for three or four hours. Everyone has their own little area that they're looking after, certain artists that they're going after, and feedback back and forth. And before someone gets booked, it could be up to a dozen emails between agents and artists and each other trying to convince each other that this might be a good idea. And the form only seems to... It's not even there yet, and we're a few months away. And there's nothing, there's no filling in the way. But I have a feeling it's going to happen. Each artist, like each decision and each artist, it's like... It's like they're all hanging in the air right now, and as soon as few are going to land, and then it will all start to color west. But also that certain artist... we really want to work but sometimes they just don't fit in the programming and that's really that's what I felt was really important every time we're choosing artists it's not because he's hot at the moment just because he's fitting in what we want to show. And people maybe acknowledge that over the years that we're really, really precious on how to build a night. And sometimes it works. For sure, sometimes it doesn't work. But when it goes well. Yeah, I would say most of the time it works. And that's why it's so long. Because sometimes you have an artist, you know the music. but sometimes you don't know really know how he's like gonna present his stuff live so you're Having an idea. So now I mean it's more the years goes by it's easier because you have YouTube you can go check like clips but you have an idea but still like it's it's like every addition is a bit like cooking a seven course meal or 17 course meal more than seven. I was surprised at how slow the process is in a way that the carefulness and Yeah, the carefulness in each program is really... It's crazy. It's crazy. You mentioned that you all look after certain areas. What would you say? Oh, I don't think it has a genre or anything like that. But it's like, you know, personal taste or people that you might already have relationships with. Each of us has like a little, you know, stable of artists who we like and know or whatever. Or are willing to reach out. And Patti met a lot of artists through her job before. She was doing a lot of interviews for CBC so she already has also nice contact. It's really helped. I also by myself because I'm touring and I meet people and I'm quite easy to go along with so I meet a lot of people. You do say so yourself. yourself a lot of self confidence yeah and he hates a lot of things which is a problem yeah yeah if Vince wasn't there I think it would be much easier but no No, I know that's also the thing because I really hate certain things. I have to try to separate my DJ work to my my curating work and sometimes it's difficult to make the difference. There's your own taste what you want to hear. There's your own taste. There's taste of people what they want to hear. I like it if you're just trying to find a border in between. But I'm really, really strict sometimes. But I'm getting better at it. But I think it's, well, I mean, it's probably not as drastic because I'm a little bit outspoken, maybe I would say. But Alain also sometimes he just doesn't like it and we come from different backgrounds as well like Alain is like 15 years older than me so we have a totally different musical background and Patti as well so we all have our like... - Luggage? No, bags. - Sure, sure. - Yeah, bags for us, and we're coming to, and sometimes we, it's cool that you have them with you, and sometimes you just have to leave them home when you come to a meeting, and I think it's, I'm getting better, we're all getting better. Sometimes there's decisions for the audience or for the festival rather that are... It's for the festival. It makes sense in that context. We never try to think in a business way but sometimes there are obvious decisions that you have to take and they are kind of like... I wouldn't say they are the main thing but they are... You have to think about it because all the festivals have to deal with this. It's not about making money, but it's at least not losing. money which is quite difficult especially in the market like we're saying before in Montreal it's a different market than in Europe you don't have like major sponsors you don't have like all these different things that make sometimes the European festival pay those amount of money Has it been quite hard to find sources of funding for the festival over the years? I would say it's very creative. Very creative. Well, it's a non-profit. Yeah, well, it's been difficult to find private sponsorship, for sure. I think because of the size of the festival. We're not big enough to attract sponsorship because of the nature of the festival, which is not commercial enough. Again, it's difficult. And also because Montreal is the poorest metropolis in North America, so really far down the food chain in terms of private money. So on that side of things, it's been not so successful. Seems like things have been changing in Montreal. There are quite a few buildings being added on or built specifically for the arts. The symphony. There's a new symphony hall that's being built right now. And SAT, which is where a lot of the events are. helped is actually had an addition yeah well I think again that has to do with the strategy that the governments have used to deal with the economy. There's been a lot of money poured into infrastructure. So there's a whole neighborhood in Montreal that has been transformed into a cultural neighborhood. So at the moment, the face of downtown Montreal is being reshaped. a lot but that's kind of cosmetic at the moment we'll see what comes out of that But it doesn't change the fact that, again, the festival's format makes it so that it's a bit off-radar for a lot of the sponsorships. We'd actually need to transform the festival into something much bigger to try to attract the attention. But it's never been the driving force. And you lose everything about what the festival is, I think. if it was much bigger? Well a lot of people, especially the first years, a lot of people were begging us not to grow. Again, you know, not that I want to talk, I don't want to name names, but like they they say we like the intimate nature of the festival, please don't become like other festivals that have grown too much where they become impersonal and all that. it seems like the people value that side of MUTEC. So we're kind of in a weird situation where we have to... What's recognized as the value of the festival makes it so that it's difficult to get more support. That being said, I have to say we're lucky to be in Canada because a festival like that would probably not be possible in the States or even outside of Montreal because we have support from three levels of government in Quebec, which is not the case in other provinces. And there's no electronic music festival in Toronto. which is kind of surprising. You mentioned North America and other festivals in the States, and obviously... there is Decibel and Communikey and a couple of other things, and you all sort of are bound together by this ICAS organization. Can you talk a little bit about what that is and what it's built for? Well, first of all, if you talk about Decibel, Decibel and CommuniQui were bound together by the spirit of things. Like when Decibel was created, they positioned the festival as like the North-West response to Mutech. And then CommuniQui had like a link to both Decibel and Mutech. So there was a spirit that exists among ourselves. And we've been collaborating among... These vessels have been exchanging, so there is a sense of community that exists on a North American level. We have been developing a lot in South America also with Mutech, where we have done events in Chile, Argentina, Mexico. So we created for ourselves a sort of Pan-American network. And a few years ago, three years ago, there was a set of European festivals that got together and started to want to develop projects. especially because they were trying to get some funding from the European community and there was kind of a gesture that we made to invite the networks to connect. So we actually invited everybody to come to Montreal two years ago, all the European network and our Pan-American network, and created this international network of festivals called the ICAST, which is International Cities for Advanced Sound and Related Arts Network. which works on an informal level, but I think we saw a lot of exchanges being triggered within that network that are really interesting because I think it opens up a new era of collaboration that will enrich all these festivals for years to come. Well, an extreme example would be community... in Boulder collaborating with Dispatch in Belgrade and doing a tour in North America and then a tour through Eastern Europe, which wouldn't have happened if people hadn't met and trusted each other sort of and shared the same spirit. And yeah, so I mean, it's a kind of interesting example of something. very anomalous. Is there sometimes worry that, you know, because you're collaborating so much that the festivals look more alike in a way, you know, with bookings and other things? you lose a tiny bit. Maybe you gain more. Yeah, we talk about it and we're sensitive to it for sure. But there are so many, there are only so many artists working in a certain area at a certain time too. So it's not like it's a gigantic and endless pool. It's how you put it together probably in which you can distinguish yourself from each other. But there was a question on Sound and Pull a couple of years ago where some guy was like, why would I, you know, I like... to be a techno tourist or whatever and go to these European festivals but here I am and it's the same lineup that I saw it somewhere in London and why is that and how do you distinguish yourselves and it's definitely been a discussion that people have and you don't want to just be doing the same thing as someone else either. What makes MUTEC different now than what Decibel is doing line-up-wise and CommuniKey is doing line-up-wise? Well, I think each of those festivals also knows their local publics and serves, so at Decibel you'll get a lot of what people will call West Coast-based music and stuff, and maybe more trance than you'd ever, ever hear at MUTEC. maybe more a house and disco and techno crowd. So there's certainly that way that festivals distinguish themselves because they're always attached to their localities or their cities and their publics, which would be the obvious answer. But you said earlier that one of the distinguishing features is that, you know, 50%. come outside of Montreal. So are you actually playing to what Montreal people enjoy? Yeah, we try for sure. What are the artists that you... Because we have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and sometimes a lot of people, I mean the majority of people, they come for the weekend usually. And we try, that's for sure that on Wednesday and Thursday there's a... We try to, by ourselves, bring some people and make these shows stand by themselves as good programming, solid programming, not through the weekend process. So on Wednesdays and Thursdays we try to do shows that will also bring people from Montreal. maybe a little bit more and that's one thing that we have to acknowledge for those shows. Maybe a lot of Montreal people don't commit to the festival. You have to take off days of work to really get the whole experience. And so one of the challenges is trying to get local audience to commit to the festival and not just cherry-pick a show here or there because it's not the same experience in isolation as it is as a collective experience, which is something we talk about. I have friends that take their week vacation from Utec. I know two people around me that do that and there's probably a lot more. And they just do it because they don't want to... Because sometimes it's hard on your body to have shows. Sometimes it's hard. I don't know what time it starts, like 4 or 5 in the afternoon. Sometimes even if you do the panels or workshop, it starts even before. And it goes till 3 in the morning, which is not that crazy because it's North America. I mean, in Europe, you probably have it till 7 or 8. But we try also to give. kind of we say always the same word trajectory you know like kind of a path that you you would follow and you you have moments where you're really it's really demanding on your or your brain on your like attention and sometimes it's a little bit lighter so that you don't get tired of it as well you know because if you're asking too much in the beginning then like in the end people are like they just don't have any intention And also there's the fact that like five day festival, there is like the beginning where you're really aware and at the end you have a different way of listening to music. And I don't even remember one of the first discussion we had, he was telling me about like how and like those rave parties, you know, there was also the fact that... When you started at night, like at 10, you had like a kind of way of hearing. And then like at 2, there was another. And then at 6, when you've been listening to music for 8 hours, then there's this new kind of listening that you have. I mean, I'm not talking about drugs here. I'm just talking about... listening experience. And also the festival is the same thing. After five days, I know for myself, I've been doing the festival for 11 years, on Sunday you have a totally different way of listening to music. You're not as focused on it, but you're hearing all the subtlety of it, you know, like really, really sharply. It's really strange. Our best nights, I think the best programs have always been the Sunday nights. It's like dessert after five days. I think Theo Parish was last year. It was the obvious, he will play all sorts of anything and it wasn't so focused. Theo Parish, usually what happens is we also had... Morris Van Oswald Trio. The last act is usually it opens, but just before you have something that's pretty complicated in a way for the audience to deal with. like the Moritz 1 as well so the audience is more receptive to things like that and we like to leave people on something that opens like okay and when you check the programming it's really weird you start with Moritz 1 as well and you finish with Theo Parish which If you put them next to each other they don't fit at all. But within the program there was this and then you had "Brennbauer Freak" which was like a kind of extension of "Maritz Wanderer Zwart" but a little bit more dancey. And then after you had like the total craziness of "Tale Parish". For certain people it was really fantastic for certain people that they didn't like it but we we try stuff that's the thing also with it we're trying we're not really trying to redo because sometimes even like we're checking ourselves and we're like yeah but is it like a little bit like what we did last year because we tried each year i remember with that name in that discussion we tried really to To say that the last showcase is like opening to something what's gonna happen or where it's kind of going or like... And I remember one year we did Naradunki which was like when live started to... be really really popular and it was kind of like a moment where we're just making a statement about like so maybe this is where it's going and a couple years before it was the same thing with with uwe with ricardo and martin when they played together it was one of the first time i I saw for myself three people jamming together live and it was kind of mixture of like this German thing with the Latin influence and it was really fantastic. One of the most interesting things I think about the festival is that there's almost every single year some sort of strange collaboration or premiere or something that you can't see elsewhere. Is that something you really put a premium on when you're doing the program? programming and thinking about who you want to book? I mean, are you thinking, you know, what if we go to Richie Hartman and say, why don't you play with 12 other people? Yeah, well, there's... Two answers to that. I mean, first is we really see ourselves as having a role in bringing artists, especially from Europe, that have never or could hardly make it in North America. For instance, something like Bird Friedemann and Jackie Liebeside. We did them maybe five, six years ago, and they've been trying to come back to North America many times, but we're never able because it's too much of a commitment. The finances don't make sense. So we actually redid them last year just because they've been trying to come back for five years. So we see ourselves as having a function in North America to bring. people that have not played so that's one thing and the second one is linked to what we said a bit earlier is to trigger like collaborations and to invite artists to try new things say we have a we have a context where we could follow accompany you to take some risks and try new things so what is it you'd like to do because they usually they don't have that luxury anywhere and that's what a festival like MUTEC is about is to try to push people forward in terms of what they do and yeah we every time when we report about what the festival is about we count like how many premieres we did like Canadian premieres, North American premieres, or even like world premieres. And that's important because the festival has a signification within this discipline. It's a bit... I don't like the notion of trendsetters. It's not about setting trends, but it's more about... enabling artists to move ahead in what they do as much as possible. I mean, I'd love the whole festival to be about that. If we'd have more means, you know, commission people to make strange connections between... One day, maybe we'll get there. Thank you.
