*Dramatic music* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Paul White is one of the UK's most talented hip-hop producers, a beatmaker that can, for example, make an entire album solely out of samples from an obscure Swedish psych rocker. He's a studio hound, someone who'd prefer to make tunes at every hour of the day, aside from when he's performing live with his friend Moe Cullors, that is. As part of our live RA Exchange series at this year's Mutech Festival, we tracked down White to talk about his live show, skateboarding, and much more. Welcome to the first of three RA live exchanges. My name is Todd L. Burns. I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Opizer. Thank you. And I'm proud to be joined by... the UK's Paul White for the first one. So thank you, Paul, for coming. Thanks for having me. It's good to be here. Yeah. Well, to begin with you, you make hip-hop, sort of. Would you say you make hip-hop? Sort of. It's that dreaded question, isn't it? I suppose it would fall under that. I mean, you know, instrumental, I write instrumental music that's, you know, inspired by hip-hop and other types of electronic stuff. I mean, I grew up with a lot of ambient music and, you know, I used to love Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada and, you know, just like emotion in music. But, yeah, I mean, it would fall into instrumental hip-hop, yeah. Your last album though, not instrumental at all. Yeah, the last album was straight up, yeah. It was a rap album. I mean, I had rappers on it and... It was always a dream to do that, you know, it was great to be able to do that and you know But I suppose I want to try as many things as possible Tell me about this last album that you did you? worked with ten different rappers a number of different yeah, it was um guilty simpson Marv one Danny Brown homeboy salmon This guy called Mo Pope, Jest and Tranquil. So it's kind of a mixture of a couple of people from the UK, a few people from the States. and it was amazing to do, you know, so much fun. I mean, it's amazing to, you know, I mean, when you make a track, it's like, you know, it sounds silly, it's like making a baby, you know, it's like making a child. It's like, you know, you've got to make that track strong, you know, it can go out in the world and survive on its own. So it's quite magical to make a track with someone else, you know, Well that's really like making a child. Making it with someone else. You can add their DNA to it as well. That sounds really bad. How did you get in contact with all these rappers? Was that you can contact with these people already? A couple of them. I mean the album I did before it was called 'Pull Out On The Purple Brain'. that came out on Now Again, which is an American, LA-based label. And kind of a lot of connections came through that, basically. The guy who put it out is a guy called Egon, who works with Peanut Butter Wall from Stone's Throw. So, you know, that connected me with Guilty. Simpson so on the Purple Brain album I did one track with him and then through that my manager also the guy who runs One Handed Music the label that I'm on in the UK he works for Stones Row in the States as well and so he kind of you know I had a lot of connections as well. And then also this guy called House Shoes, who's a big kind of Detroit DJ and producer. We kind of all got close. So between the kind of mixture of House Shoes, Egon, and my manager, you know, we connected with all these different people, you know, like Danny Brown. And did you have any of these guys in the studio with you, or was it all sending them beats? I heard most of them were sending beats. Sandman was the only guy I actually did it in the studio with. Which is, you know, I mean, it's kind of mixed feelings about that. You know, it's magical to be able to work with people across the other side of the world and not meet them, you know. Otherwise I wouldn't have been able to do it. But I'd also love to, you know, it's a personal thing. to meet these guys as well and look into their eyes. Yeah, I guess you were sending multiple beats to a rapper. Yeah, yeah. Were you surprised at the ones that they picked? Always, always, always. You're like, that one? Really? Didn't you want to pick the other one? So that was a real learning experience in itself. It's kind of creating an album of the people. you know, they have an input on what tracks are coming out on your own album, you know, it was really fascinating. And magical as well, you know, I mean, I'd be really disappointed if, you know, if I sent out a beat tape and knew, you know, what person would pick what track, and I was right, I'd be really disappointed. So I'm glad that, you know, I mean, Danny Brown, I'm doing some more stuff with him, I've done some stuff on his album like the quirky craziness that he picks, you know. I'm always quite surprised about that. Was it tough to, when you were making the music, to keep in mind, keep enough space open for voices like that? Were you consciously trying to... No. No, you know, I mean, a lot of, you know, the beats they pick, no, I mean... It's interesting because when I first started writing stuff, I suppose I was compensating for not having any rappers and stuff, so using a lot more vocal samples and things like that. So I suppose in a way that's the only thing. I maybe won't use vocal samples. but that's it, you know. I don't leave, you know, no. I'm not going to leave room, you know. I just have fun. I don't consciously think, to be honest, when I write music. I just have fun and it sounds corny but just do what you feel, do what comes naturally. You try and force things and it just never works. When did you start making music? Was it young age? Yeah, I mean, I first started writing music when I was a kid, really. I mean, I used to play piano and guitar. I used to sing a little bit, try to listen to Nirvana and stuff and try to proper sing a song right. So that was in school, about 11, 12, I suppose. So are there any demos that we can hear someday? There's hidden tapes that no one's going to hear. No. I read that you first started making electronic music. You started making trance and happy hardcore for a moment. Yeah, yes. How long was that phase? That was a good couple of years. I mean, you know, there was drum and bass in there as well, and ambient. I mean, after I did GCSEs, I went to a place called the Brit School in London, which is very kind of, you know, performing arts kind of base, kind of college. And I met this great guy there called Nick, and we just formed a group together. We're called, like, Pure Insanity, so that kind of says a lot, basically. you know that age in your life 16 so you know experimenting with a few things so um yeah you know i mean he was amazing he was you know he he kind of really got me into electronic music you know before then i was just writing keyboards you know and guitar music you know and this guy was way ahead of his time you know i mean he knew so much about samplers and everything you know everyone else in the class was baffled and he'd sit there and just know it all so i was like i'm gonna be friends with I like that guy. And yeah, we just ended up writing loads of happy hardcore trance together. And on my own, I'd kind of write more ambient-y kind of stuff. But it was great. I mean, I like the fact that I've kind of gone through different kind of musical journeys, I suppose. Were your parents quite supportive of you going down sort of artistic? Luckily, yeah. I mean, you know, a load. you know a lot to them you know i mean even when i came back from uni you know i moved back home you know a typical story you know just to be able to do music all the time without their support of just going and just living. I was lucky I had top two rooms in the house so I had a bedroom and two attic rooms so I had a studio. They were amazing supporters. They're both music lovers. My dad used to be in a couple of bands. He played drums and harmonica. He was really supportive of that massively. He sorted out a lot of my musical education. I was kind of a bit lazy as a kid and he was just pushing me, no, keep going, do that, go to this college. You were lazy as a kid. It seems like with your work rate, something happened. I think that's why now I try and work a lot. I kind of feel, you know, some people kind of start, they get crazy on it at like 10. When I was, you know, I mean, I was just... having fun, mucking around as a kid, even through uni as well. I mean, university was kind of disappointing to be honest. I went to do music technology. I didn't learn anything really about music technology. Was that your fault or was that the school's fault? I never went into a studio once. We had kind of little workstations. I was really lucky. My A-levels I got to learn on that reel-to-reel, like a big mixing desk. So I was kind of really lucky. I kind of caught the end of it. that analog, you know, kind of work, which was brilliant. You know, I feel really lucky for that. Did you feel, though, that... When all these digital things came out, you're like, oh man, I have to learn all this stuff too. No, I think I was just excited. They're just amazing toys. It's kind of my studio is my family and my toy shop at the same time. So do you have quite a bit of analog and digital stuff in your studio? Yeah, I mean, I work mainly analog. I use drum machines. He's like an NPC. 3000 they've got like a Roland SP 606 which is loads of fun and I advise anybody to it's like 300 quid or something 400 quid and why is 606? I mean loads of people use the 303 don't they and the 404 now I'm not talking about the old TR, I'm talking about the new SP, the sample workstations. They're just so quick and easy to use, just so much fun. You've got loads of effects in there. It's weird, going back to the start, after piano and keyboards, when I first got into electronic music, it was actually just all using Pro Tools and on the screen, which is great, but I think coming from using my hands a lot... I kind of wanted to go back to just hitting things, you know. So that's when I kind of started to buy a lot of kind of analog stuff. But then I still record into Pro Tools at the end, so I kind of use a bit of both, you know. Use kind of both worlds, you know. Just use it all. Never close doors to anything, I'd say. What are your other sort of bits of gear that you're always using? You find yourself coming back to quite a bit. Mainly the MPC, the 606. What else? I have a few just kind of outboard effects stuff. I have a big 24 Spirit Soundcraft mixing desk, which is really nice. I think it's just, you know, again, there's no right or wrong at all. Everyone's got a kind of personal preference, but I just want to make sure I can use my ears first, not my eyes first. I think a lot of people now. Again, I'm not knocking anything, but you look at a screen and things can look wrong. Sometimes when I use kind of EQs on the screen, it just looks, you think, God, I shouldn't be pumping that so late. But you like the sound of it. I think that's the danger. So I just always want to use my ears first. And I try and use different bits of equipment as well because I get kind of, you know, I suppose it's just, it's all about fun for me. So I think if I just use one thing, I might get bored of it. So I've also bought recently like this Korg Electra. I've kind of was at the ESX one. I suppose just having different areas of sound that you can experiment with. Why did you buy the Electra? What was the appeal? Probably the valves. Yeah? Quite nice. Just a different way of working. I kind of like the idea of... you know being forced to work in different ways so the NPCR work one way you know the 606 I mean I mean you know you're always going to do your thing people have their own kind of ways of working but you know I suppose it's limitations you know different bits of equipment's limitations will force different bits of creativity out of you so I think I definitely like limitations because it kind of forces you to kind of think of something else I think kind of really gets your brain kind of think Too many options can cloud you and you can just get carried away with, you know, "Oh, should I do this? Should I do that? Oh my God, I've got so many." If you just have a couple, you can just... For me personally, anyway, you know. So is that part of the reason why you chose that Swedish, psych guitar guy to make? this one album? Yeah, the guy ST Macau, his music was amazing. I mean, when I heard it, I mean, I got sent over a drive full of music and the guys at Now Again were like, just pick one person and, you know, just write as much music as you can, you know, for one person and I just heard his music. it was creativity first, you know, I mean that's the same with me, creativity first, everything else. come second. So they commissioned you basically to make an album based on one guy's? On one guy's, yeah. I mean, originally it wasn't going to be an album. It was going to be just, I mean, because they've bought, they're getting quite clever, you know, so they buy the rights to a lot of music so they can sell to like TV, Sync and Adverts and stuff like that. So that was the initial idea. And then I just sat at home for three weeks. every day just you know mucked about with this one one guy and sent it over to them and I was really chuffed they really liked it and they were like you know it's a bit too weird to use for TV but we're gonna put it out as an album you know it was brilliant you've done a lot of work with library TV stuff is that right yeah I mean my dad works in TV so I've kind of grown up with that I mean he's an editor and a director so through connections with him when at like university I did a few things for like BBC 2 like kind of educational programs I did stuff for Channel 4 kind of small animation projects and kind of soundscape stuff, sound design. And it's brilliant, you know, it was great. So that taught me a lot as well, you know, kind of. I mean, for one project, I had to write every, you know, I had to write like R&B, drum and bass, garage, house, like hip hop, you know, rock, you know. I had to do the whole lot. And, you know, I'm not saying I did a good job at them all, but it was, I learned something from everything, you know time I was 18 anyway so I love the visual side of music, I love the relationship between the two. I love music as an emotion, so if you can combine the two I think it's great. A little dream I've had for years is to do a soundtrack to a whole film. Just take one of your favourite films and just do your own soundtrack to it. Either pick a film with not much music in it and write stuff around it. pick stuff with music in it and take it out and put yours in. I love that relationship. What kind of movies would you like to soundtrack? Akira, I think. That's one I've thought for years. I don't know why, I just love that. Manga, animation, Alice in Wonderland. Those two would be the first. You said that you were doing all these different genres for the library music. Were you looking at the film first and then tailoring the music that you were making towards it? Yeah, most of the time. I mean, for those, for the different genres. stuff this was for a kind of so for that project they had a drama and it's like kind of short 10 minute dramas and they had characters within the drama and then they had a website as well with kind of where all the characters live so it's basically aimed at kind of educational kids so people could watch the drama and at the end of every episode there'd be like a dilemma should Blavar go you know to so-and-so's house knowing that he just want to have sex with him or something you know And it was all to do with getting kids to talk about it, which was great. So they get to vote on what happens. So on the website, all the characters have different bedrooms. So I had to write music for all the different characters. So it was kind of like a personality, the different genre one. It wasn't like scenes. So it was good. It was good fun. It must be quite tough to write music for that, or at least a different headspace to try. to tailor it to like, I don't know, 20 second clips? Yeah, yeah, I mean... What was it that you were... I mean, I tried to kind of write songs and then take little clips from that. So if we needed 20 seconds or something, just write a three-minute song and then pick a 20-second part or something. I mean, mainly a lot of the stuff for TV is just short clips. I mean, the longest things was the credits, doing stuff for... credits but it was just really fun you know I mean the stuff for Channel 4 there were those kind of weird animations you know sometimes they do I suppose you guys wouldn't get that over here but in the in the UK anyway they kind of had these short little three minute animations before like the eight o'clock news and then there's a lot on mental health actually They had loads of little short things about mental health. I'll never forget the first one I did. It was so intense. I had to listen to this guy's three-minute speech about panic attacks and anxiety. I had to just soak that in. I was working in a basement at the time as well. I had to really represent how he felt. That was after a while. I was like, I need to get out. I'm going crazy. What kind of music do you make to represent that? That was mainly sound design, kind of weird. I don't know how to describe it. You said your dad was doing film stuff. Were you doing soundtracking, any of the things that he was involved in? Just the smaller kind of educational stuff. He doesn't do big film production. That would be amazing. I think people get to do that. That must be incredible, to really enhance a picture and really create a mood with a picture. I'd love to do it. I mean, I'd love to do the whole movie, like I just said before. What kind of art? You mentioned you were doing a degree in art as well as music. What kind of art were you doing? I don't know, I just used to really like drawing masks for some reason. It's kind of crazy faces and... Not making masks, just drawing them. Just drawing them, yeah. Yeah, I never really have a kind of... I suppose I've never really had a conscious kind of thing, I'm going to try and do this. I just kind of improvise, very spontaneous. The way I've always written music is very spontaneous. just sit there and how you're feeling and just don't overthink it too much try not to take too long on things either I think your brain can lie to you that's what I've started to realise just in life in general getting older your brain lies to you so listen to other parts of your body When is your brain lying to you? All the time, I think. Your brain can create gossip. You worry about things and we... I'm going to get a little deep now. Everything you do is based on your thoughts, isn't it? And how you think. you know so i think you overthink things you can get you know fearful insecure about certain things and kind of then your actions were based on something that isn't actually true you know so just kind of listen to your gut and i mean that's what you know i'm sure everybody loves music you know that's why we love it you know it touches somewhere else you know Tell me about your live show. You'll be performing live tonight? Yep. The live show, I mean, I wanted to try something different with the live show because, I mean, I use old drum machines at home and not really computers, so I couldn't just kind of take a laptop out. And then I couldn't take all my old drum machines out because I'd just play one track and have to stop the whole show and can you wait 10 minutes whilst I put my zip in and load a new one. So, you know, I always wanted to learn live instruments. So I was just like, okay, let's do it. Let's get a drum kit. Let's get a keyboard and let's go for it. So I use that 606. I've got my SP-606 where I kind of play like a guy called Mo Colors and we both drum and play keys and we swap around so I'll play drums and a few and he'll play keyboards and I'll drum you know we just kind of swap about and have fun and we got congas there as well and you know it's just another chance to try new things you know I think you know with different musical projects it's great to give yourself an opportunity to just try new things and expand and The live show has now given birth to a whole new load of music that I write because now I'm playing the drums and playing the keyboards a lot more. So it's expanded my mind. So it's really changed the way that you're writing music. Recently, yeah, I mean a lot of started to try and write whole, you know, I'm still very much learning but just try and play everything, you know, trying to play drums a bit, trying to play keyboards, trying to play guitar, trying to play bass, you know, kind of, again, the whole thing of kind of not overthinking. I mean, I know it can sound a bit cheesy but, you know, you just got to try, why not, you know. Life's short, music's fun, do it. Why limit yourself to anything at all, ever? What's the most sort of rich stuff? for samples for you personally that you've found is a particular style that you come back to? Probably prog rock. Yeah? You know, like, I mean, you know, some of these crazy progressive rock tracks would be like a 20-minute song within 20, you know, or like, you know, Frank Zappa or people like that or like Gong, I really like Gong. They'll just go through so many sections, you know, within one song. that you could write an album from one song. So I do constantly go back to that. But everything, I like to kind of challenge myself and again, kind of limit yourself. So just pick up a record and that's it. I've got to write something out of this. And it will force you to do something that you wouldn't normally do. And then that might suddenly give birth to a whole new project that you never would have thought of. Why do you feel like you're constantly putting limitations on yourself? Is that the only way you can work in a way? I don't know. Again, it's not really, I suppose. Yeah, I don't know. There's an answer to that. I guess it's always just been kind of creativity. kind of first and trying to push and try new things I think the thing is for me I just yeah never want to try and do kind of one thing over and over I don't really have kind of have a formula I try different things all the time and I suppose that's probably what it is I never want to kind of have a system where I always write to you know I want to kind of just try as many different things as I can and I suppose if I have too much it might just cloud me I think it's just my work ethic. I like to do stuff quite quick. I like to get a lot of stuff done. And I just know if I have too many options, then I'll fiddle around with it for too long. I mean, I mix on the go. So a lot of the stuff, everything that's been released so far has been recorded. computer left and right you know like I've just mixed it you know outboard a little bit in our mixing desk and I'll hit record and just mute you know like dub engineer you know just mix it as I'm going you know cut things in and out make the whole arrangement on the fly you know and then I like that and then it's done then I can just go to the next thing and not be trapped by always trying to tweak with something So I think that's probably where the limitation thing comes in. Did you do that before or has that always been the way that you've worked? I mean, were you a perfectionist at one point? The weird thing is I think I am a perfectionist. That's the kind of bizarre point. I think I know that I just spend too long on something. So I just kind of like to keep it. fun i think that's it i just always want to make sure it's just fun first and creativity first and what's the longest you've worked on a track um not long on like one actual track I mean, it'll never be longer than a day, ever, you know, ever. You know, most of the time, you know, a couple of hours, so. You're living in London right now, and you've mentioned in other interviews that there are a bunch of people around you that are creating music, Moe Cullors, for example. I mean, does it seem like there's something happening? happening there right now as far as what you're doing in the sounds that you're creating? Yeah, it does. For some reason, it just, I mean, I just moved into a house like a year ago and I'm there with this guy called Henry who's in a band called Sound Species. And he's got four brothers and they all play funk and Afrobeat and jazz and stuff. And then there's another guy called Wayne, I live with, who's in the band called United Vibrations. And they're mainly just straight up Afrobeat and funk. There's another guy called Robbie, he plays jazz keyboards. There's Mo Cullors, who lives around the corner. He just beats stuff and he lives with his brother called... tight face he writes beats and you know bumped into another guy I used to know from A-Levels who plays like guitar it just I don't know what's going on it definitely does feel like It feels like something should happen. It feels like we all should get together and do something. It feels like there's a lot of people kind of, you know, I suppose people have been doing it for a long time, I suppose, and people are just starting to, you know, hear about it and people are starting to get the music out, you know, at kind of the same time, which is just a weird kind of nice coincidence. So it feels like we should all kind of enhance it and embrace it and do something together sort of part of that? Like pulling together these things? Not at the moment. I mean, the guy who runs it, Alex Chase, I mean, he knows he's kind of in contact with different people, but not really, no. I mean, it's just kind of being ourselves, just kind of randomly meeting people and, you know, one person will know someone, you know, be connected to someone else and it kind of feels like now there's, you know, beat makers, you know, I mean, everybody, harpist, cello player, you know, double bass, you know, horns, saxophones, it kind of suddenly feels like, okay, actually, we should do something. I know, you know, all these instrumentalists, let's all get together and do something. I hope it happens. I hope everybody kind of gets together. Is there room in your studio for all this? No, not this. I've got about that much floor space. It's like, you know, it's a bedroom, you know, so I got my bed. I guess this is the problem with London. It's all about space. Yeah, yeah. I mean, my neighbours hate me. I mean, I got a drum kit. You can only open my door like that much, you know, and then you hit the drum kit. So, you know, my neighbours really don't like me. But I think if we all had a studio space, I think that's quite an important point. If we had a space we could all go to, I think it would happen more. Are there any nights going on in London that are playing this type of music as well? Any clubs? To be honest, I'm just a studio kind of... You don't go out much? how much no I mean I just I just love to write you know and stay in but I mean yeah there's a few things a few things going on um but there's a place called I mean I'm in Peckham now there's a place called the Bussey building which is close and I think we've talked about a few people have talked about kind of getting everybody together for that because that would be a great you know that is a great way to get people together you know at least you know every month every couple of weeks where everyone's getting together and they can exchange ideas and give each other music. That's an important point. I guess it's hard. We've talked about it, but then people get caught up and get busy with their own projects. It's kind of timing-wise, hoping that everything comes to a point together. That's hard because people are busy doing their own thing. We mentioned one-handed music. How did you get hooked up with Alex and how did he start releasing? your music? I used to work at a music college called Community Music in London Bridge and they were great. They did like technology courses, teacher training courses. I mean that inspired me a lot. to be honest, you know, working somewhere. You were teaching? No, just kind of a technician. I'd be kind of there to help out a bit with equipment when people could use the studios and stuff outside of lesson time. So, I mean, that was really inspiring for me, just to, I mean, that kick-started me a lot, just every day, just seeing other people write music all the time. By the end of the day I was just busting, like a heron at it. "I need to write music!" I was just seeing people write music all day. And a person who worked there knew my manager before I knew him. And I was always a big fan of this label called Stones Throw out in the States. And I was always talking about them. And my manager, the guy who runs One Handed, he, as I said before, he works for Stones Throw. the guy I worked with bumped into me and he was like, I've got this crazy guy at work who's always going on about Stones, you know, he writes music but he's never given me any music and I've been asking him for years. Why didn't you ever give him any music? This guy at work, weird, you know, personal, weird, you know. I hate competitiveness and all that, you know, he was a bit of a kind of competitive dude. I didn't want to go there. So I never really gave it to him. But as soon as he told me about his friend Alex, you know, I don't think he expected me to bring in any music. You know, and the next day I was there of like 30 tracks. He go, yeah, give it, you know, give it to him, give it to him. And that was it. You know, it was amazing. He called me up and said he liked the stuff and that formed a relationship with him And that kind of started me off with, you know, I was like, okay, right, something could happen, you know. So I set myself a goal of like every month do a CD of at least like 25 to 30. tracks. I mean, you know, this is, you know, kind of ideas. So, you know, there could be anything from like 30 seconds to two minutes, you know, so, you know, they're not kind of all full songs, but try and put enough ideas within the short kind of space of time that could be extended into a song. So that was a great kind of just goal for me to do every month, you know, knowing that there was someone I could send it to, you know, I suppose that was the thing. So I just did that every month to send it to him, send it to him, send it to him. So by the time we got to CD nine, he was like, okay, let's put out a single, you know, by the time that's like a diary. 30 tracks. It's great. It's like a diary of my life. I can trace my life back to different CDs. He's been amazing. I've realised the value of having a good manager and good support behind you. You need that. Why? Just for me personally, to be able to keep doing the creative stuff. Just to keep those closed doors for me where I can just keep writing music. You can do all the business side of things. I know a lot of people nowadays kind of mix too and mix them both together and it's great. It's wicked that people can have their own label. and put their own music out. I mean, I've got a younger sister and she does a lot of it on her own, you know, and it's amazing. But I just kind of like to just spend all my time just writing.

So, you know, I mean, I still love skateboarding. I was just looking at the hotel room and saw a load of skateboarders skating down the street last night.
