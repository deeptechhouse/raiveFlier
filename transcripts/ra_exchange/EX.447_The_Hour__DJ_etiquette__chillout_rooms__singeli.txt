You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour, RO's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. I'm Martha, producer of The Hour, here to guide you through this month's episode. On the show this month, Tom Faber takes us into Room 2. exploring the resurgence of the chill-out room and its relationship to ambient music. Dance music is intense, especially when it's really, really loud and it's in a club. I think that can feel quite overwhelming. I think that if there was a room for you to just have a breather every now and again, that used to happen. So what's changed? Sybil Gillespie gets to grips with DJ etiquette, the unspoken guidelines that help make navigating booth politics a little smoother. To me DJ etiquette is basically knowing how to navigate the transition between DJs. smoothly and helpfully and without being a total jerk. But first, Aaron Cool Tate recently spent some time in Tanzania to write a feature on Singeli Music. Aaron passed through the studio to share some thoughts from his trip before writing his feature for the RA website. Aaron joins me in the studio now. So Aaron, towards the end of last year, you spent some time in Tanzania. What kind of sounds were you hearing out there? Hi Martha. Yeah, that's right. I spent a week in Dar es Salaam digging into a genre called Singeli, which has become increasingly popular in Tanzania and beyond this past few years. It's a style of music that when you first hear it, it can be quite overwhelming. It's frenetic. 180 BPM plus music, often with equally fast MCs on top. The tracks are made using loops in the virtual DJ software. Its origins lie in various little micro scenes that were happening in Dar es Salaam that coalesced into this one style, and it's influenced by Tarab. which is a style of music that's popular in Zanzibar. Actually, the first Singeli tunes were essentially traditional tarab rhythms that were sped up using the virtual DJ software until they barely resembled the original music. So you've described the instrumentals. What about the lyrical content of the music? Yeah, I guess the lyrical content is mostly focused on everyday life. problems with money, problems with relationships, kind of a reflection of what's going on in the working class neighborhoods of Dar es Salaam. So some of the key artists include CISO, who is basically credited as the inventor of Singeli. He set up the CISO studio in Mubaharati in Dar es Salaam in 2013. And there's Jay Mitter, who's a really talented... producer and also met a young emcee called Doggo Janya. Doggo means young and Janya means boy. And there's another young emcee, her name is Antivirus or Antivirus and she hasn't released much yet but yeah, I sort of bumped into her a couple of times and she played. me some of her demos that she had on her phone and I think she's really great as well, someone to keep an eye on. Tell me a bit more about the scene in which this genre exists, like is there an infrastructure for the music? There isn't really much of an infrastructure to be honest, there aren't many places for this music to be performed live in Dar es Salaam. There are a couple, I went to a nightclub out near the airport. Dike and MC Zoe were scheduled to play and like the really sort of late end of a night that was mostly soundtracked by Bongo Flavor, which is basically the name for Tanzanian hip hop, which is massive in Tanzania. Beyond that, there's not much of a market for people actually buying this music. It generally gets pirated pretty quickly. There's actually a well-known market where people go and buy pirated USBs and CDs and stuff like that. And Singeli has been really hot in those markets for a little while now. And I guess the other thing... that's led to Singeli becoming more popular, at least within Tanzania, is radio coverage. There's a couple of fairly major stations in Dar es Salaam that have picked up Singeli. There's one called EFM that has like a weekly Singeli show. And I actually spent an evening hanging out at EFM and yeah, everyone was super lovely. It has brought the Singeli music to a very different audience to illustrate like the EFM studio, you know, getting there, involved going past like the French embassy, the American embassy and all this kind of stuff. So it's in that part of town where most of the artists who are actually making or performing Singeli definitely don't live or hang out. out. All right, let's hear something then. You've brought two songs along to show us. What is this first one? Well, the first one I'd like to play is called Tatitsuo Pesa, made by Jay Mitter, featuring Togo Junja. I heard it being performed maybe 10, 15 times in a row while the music video was being recorded. It sort of warmed its way into my head and hasn't really left since. We can put a link to the actual video that really does bring it to life as well when you're watching that it's these teenagers basically sort of making their way around the neighbourhood where the Siso studio is Thank you. Thank you. You're listening to The Hour from Resident Advisor and Aaron is here in the studio sharing some thoughts on his recent trip to Tanzania. So tell me a little bit more about your experience in Tanzania. Well, I spent a lot of time in two recording studios. one belonging to CISO, who is basically the godfather of Singeli, another sort of run by an artist called Duque. Generally soaking things up, I met a dozen or so artists and went to a block party actually that took place right next to CISO's studio. And that was an interesting experience. Firstly, as part of like getting the permission to do this sort of block party from the authorities, they had to have a... reason that they were throwing a party like it's kind of inconceivable that you would just throw a party for people to come and dance and have fun so they had to say it was for the birthday of CISO Records so they had to get a birthday cake basically made to sort of prove that so there was a birthday cake and the party started fairly early and it was like brought in a really big sound system and CISO was playing some music And there were loads of kids dancing basically at this stage. But unfortunately, it got shut down within a couple of hours of starting, despite the fact they had all the correct permission from the local authorities. Turned out there was a public funeral happening just a couple of streets away that was being attended by local police and councillors and stuff like that. And as soon as they caught wind of this block party happening around the corner, they shut it down pretty quickly. I actually left to go home the next morning, but they tried to have the party again the following day and actually ended up with Jay Mitter, one of the main producers in the Singeli scene, ending up in jail for the night. So it kind of, I don't know how he got arrested and why he ended up. having to go to jail, but it just shone some light on the challenges being faced if you want to throw a party in Dar es Salaam. So how is Singeli music being received in the city compared to in the rest of the world? Well, it's super popular right now in Dar es Salaam and also increasingly elsewhere in Tanzania. Artists are getting booked to play at events, mostly like sort of block parties or the odd festival here or there, which is super popular. promising um and it's also been really interesting to see the music get picked up outside of east africa singeli came onto my radar at the nge nge festival in uganda in 2017 i caught wind of this like crew of of artists that had come over from tanzania to perform um and was like told by various people don't miss their performance don't miss it and anyway there was torrential rain that night night and their slot got pushed back from like 1am to 2am to 3am. some more technical difficulties and it was 4am. Anyway, I never ended up seeing them, which was a real shame. But Nyege Nyege's label released a compilation called Sounds of Siso in 2017 as well. And that really put it on the map as a sound outside of East Africa. So yeah, Arlen Dilsizian, one of the founders of Nyege Nyege, actually went out to visit Dar es Salaam a few years ago. He had no idea. where any of these artists lived, only kind of knew their first names. There was no information about them on the internet or anywhere. So he kind of just got into a taxi and just asked the taxi driver, like, have you heard of these guys? And luckily enough, the driver was this guy called Abassi, who was super tight with the CISO. crew and basically all of the singeli artists and he's turned into a kind of artist liaison for the whole scene so when i was out there um abassi showed me around and also worked as a translator um when i was doing some interviews so that was how arlen first connected with cso um and anyway yeah since then singeli artists have been touring the world um they've been especially sort of well received in europe um I saw CISO perform at Cafe Otto in London a little while ago. They've been booked for Unsound a couple of years, running this year at CTM in Berlin. MC Zoe and Duque played at Berghain on the Friday night and apparently it went down really, really well. So you've brought along one more song for us and then people will be able to read more about your experience in Tanzania on the site soon? That's right. We'll be publishing the piece in the coming weeks. But yeah, in the meantime, I'll leave you with a track by Duque. It's from his upcoming album called Ungezaji Hewa. Excuse my pronunciation there. The album's coming out on Nego Nego Tapes in early March. And this track's called Duke Four. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks to Aaron for sharing some stories and sounds from the world of Singeli music. Look out for his full feature on the site soon. Next, Sybil Gillespie from RA's editorial team has been speaking to selectors about etiquette behind the decks. You're listening to The Hour from Resident Advisor. What is good DJ etiquette? What is DJ etiquette full stop? How should DJs treat each other in the booth? On this episode of The Hour, we'll be looking to answer these questions and get to the bottom of this nebulous term. I decided to look into this after realising that DJ etiquette is something that many people... reference or allude to in conversation but rarely actually explain and there's certainly many DJs out there who haven't got a clue. Whether it's mixing out of your B2B partner's track too soon or ending your warm-up set on a much too banging note, most DJs have experienced a DJ etiquette faux pas of some sort and probably made such an error themselves. If you're just starting out, how could you know what is and isn't the done thing? It's something you pick up with experience, sure, but perhaps awkward missteps could be avoided if everyone just knew about this in advance. I wanted to ask a range of DJs of their thoughts on this topic to share their experience and learn what advice they have for DJs starting out. You'll be hearing from Debonair, Paris, Charisma, Shirelle and Noncompliant. Fair warning, my cat, if I talk to anyone that's not him, we'll start meowing really loudly. Noncompliant is a Midwestern DJ and producer. As she has been DJing for over 20 years, I knew she'd be someone to go to to find out what's what. I gave her a Skype call to hear what she had to say. To me DJ etiquette is basically knowing how to navigate the transition between DJs smoothly and helpfully and without being a total jerk. And it just means things like don't go over your time slot. That's a big one. I used to have people who would like for their last record they would start mixing the same record back and forth for like five minutes and go over their time just to draw out their slot, don't do that. That's really, really rude and really annoying. Like I'd be standing there with my record waiting. They knew I was there. So sometimes it becomes a little bit of a power game. So don't do that. And sometimes it's real simple stuff like letting the next DJ know when you're playing your last song so they can be ready. And, you know, that's usually just the universal hand signal. one to let somebody know get ready get your drives or your records or whatever you're playing ready and you know with all the different technology to tractor or serato sometimes people are are plugging things in if there's a small booth that's not got room for a second setup so you know if you have to connect things and you couldn't get there for sound check like Obviously, if you can get there for soundcheck, do it then. And don't bother somebody while they're playing. But if you have to do it while somebody else is playing, let them know what you're doing and stay as much out of their way. Be as unobtrusive as you possibly can. Wait till they're out of a mix before you have to, you know. plug something into the back of the mixer. Be careful. Don't knock a tone arm off a record that's playing or brush the CDJ platter with your sleeve and slow it down. You know, just pay attention and don't mess up what's going on. Some of it should be obvious, I think. I remember seeing DJs step up and start to scratch the record of the last person who was on. Don't do that. Like, that's not your record. So never scratch the other DJ's record. And I've seen people be really rude and like rip a needle across the record too because they were, I don't know, mad about something or being a diva. I've seen actual almost fights happen because of that. Sometimes it's just little stuff too, like if you gotta hand them their last record, put your grubby mitts all over it, you know, hold it by the edges, gently hand them their record, hand them their USB drive so they don't forget it. You know, it's just being courteous. Did you hear the cat? He just... Oh, don't put drinks near gear. And that goes for other DJs. It also goes for audience members. If it's just a table, keep your drinks off the gear. I've had people come over and like lean over my laptop with a drink in their hand. And I like gave him the mom arm and like knocked him out of the way. I thought I was a jerk. And I'm like, no, keep. your drink away from my stuff. When I first played a gig outside of my city, I didn't own my own headphones. So I had to borrow headphones my first gig. I didn't know that you don't ask people to do that. And thankfully, the DJ, who's still a local here in Indy, John Larner, actually was very nice and let me borrow his headphones. Afterwards, the promoter, who was a friend of mine, was like, Lisa, don't borrow other DJs' headphones. You've got to get your own. But I didn't know that because I was really new. That was my first gig outside of my hometown. Hello, my name is Debra Nair. I'm a club and radio DJ specialising in the left field and avant-garde. For me, DJ etiquette is really respecting and allowing other DJs and other staff of the clubs and the kind of clubbing ecosystem to all get along with their jobs and exist pretty well together. OK, I think probably one which comes up a lot is the handover. Over time, I think this becomes easier, but it's still the time for me. where for most things can go wrong. You know, if the previous DJ, if you've just got in there and they end with a track that's really short, that can be tricky. You know, you need to get in there and maybe you're using slightly different setup to them or maybe you're going to change a mixer and that happens sometimes. And you do just want to get comfortable so you know that you can start your set. really well. I mean, I always try and give the previous DJ a bit of shine and, you know, let them have their space. You also don't want to get too involved when they're still doing their thing. So it's kind of about that cooperation and that respect to allow them to wrap it up and also enjoy hopefully the glory of what's an excellent set but also get comfortable yourself um we played together once yeah yeah on this on this topic before debbie came in i remembered that there was a time that jay and myself were playing before her at chapter 10 i was still a bit young and excited and we finished our warm-up set on a 135 140 trance track sorry Yeah. Which in hindsight, I realised probably was a bit of a bad move for Debbie starting her set. Possibly, you know, but I would say it maybe threw me a little bit of a time. But I also think I'm less bothered by that these days. I'm really happy to reset these days and just start completely on a different tip. And I think it's... It just comes with experience and time to just have the confidence to maybe completely switch up the room. And, you know, probably if there was a track. say it was you know 120s um I might have mixed into it but I very much knew what I wanted to do for my set that day obviously I'm going to reset and you know I had a great set you had a great set it all worked out pretty well um but that brings us on to something else which is whether you mix into your last DJ's set um track or not which is something where I feel like there's quite heavy debate really have you found this Yeah, I feel like some people are pretty staunchly always mix into the DJ's last track. Dance floor shouldn't know what's going on and other people are always let it play out and start with something, I don't know, that shows it's the start of your set. I think the middle ground is that you just see what the situation calls for. I totally agree. For me, yes, it's totally down to circumstance. On the whole, I like to refresh because for me, as a punter, when I'm going out, I really like to know, just as a music appreciator, what the DJ is doing. and it almost paces me through the night. If there are four DJs on, I kind of want to know where I am through the night without really checking my phone in a more kind of instinctive part of the rave way. And I'm interested in what different DJs are doing, so it's quite nice to know where you are within their set. But I do know one time I was in Ibiza playing at Space. think probably would have been either 2016 or 2017 and I did let a track run out um the previous DJs because I want to start again and people were not happy and by that I mean the club owner the previous DJs it was like you know I'd committed a murder or something They, no, I mean, they thought I didn't know what I was doing and I didn't know how to use the kit. I had to, you know, start on and, you know, get my way through the set and kind of smash it in the first half an hour for them to relax because apparently that just doesn't happen in the White Isle. You really, really have to mix into the previous DJ set or... Yeah, it's not okay. I'd never been to Ireland before, didn't know about etiquette, but learnt the hard way. Have you had any instances arise when you're playing back-to-back with people? There's a level of compromise, but obviously I don't want to play anything too weird or something's going to throw the next person. I think you've got to know them really, really well. to know that they'll be able to handle it or they'll enjoy that or they'll appreciate you taking them in that direction. But I do think there is an etiquette in basically not trying to chief the other person. Also, not being a mixer hogger. That's a big one. The worst is, you know, someone's played a track and, you know, it's your turn to go on and they're just living up and heavy noodling. And you're like, come on, mate. this is my time you know I think that's pretty important when you learn you always have those experiences where you may push things a bit too much and people have to bring it down hi my name is Dwayne but my DJ name is Paris people never really speak about maybe the etiquette of going back to back in a DJ set but it's like even if it's the first time you may be DJing with someone it's like trying to flow with them not trying to outdo them trying to keep the flow going nicely or the situations where you know I may have played with someone and they're just going a bit too heavy at the beginning and you're just like it's 11.30 the club has been open for half an hour take your time like no one's leaving in fact people are trying to come in give them time to settle And then you can bring the pace on them a little bit later. You know, especially you might be going back to back with someone for the first time. And it's trying to learn of each other and work it out in a way where, you know, it's not too much of a ride for everyone where someone's going really high and someone's going really low. It's like... find the balance and work with each other my tips for new up and coming DJs would be to be patient understand the kind of lineups they're on understand where they may sit on the lineup including set times and try and cater towards that so yeah don't just go heavy too hard too quickly learn how to read a booth learn how to read a situation in the setting understand the dynamics of the situations you're in do you have any thought on djs doing like jumping on and doing rewinds on other people's tracks like as a dj i'm not a fan of the rewinds i have maybe done two ever But I think, you know, I'm a kind of firm believer in leaving a DJ to do what they're doing and enjoying their space. And it's it's the thing about personal space. So I just think for DJs, I don't agree with it personally. Everyone is different. But for me, I just like the personal space in the booth. And I would rather somebody didn't because they may be interrupting the flow of how my set goes. So by you rewinding it. you may have broken the flow of what I'm doing and then I might find it quite hard to get back to the place where I was because you've cut it in a very abrupt manner. We were halfway through making this segment when discussion blew up online about the etiquette of rewinding another DJ's track in the wake of Sherelle's Boiler Room set. Riz Latif, another DJ playing the event, abruptly spun back her track midway through her set. Sounds of Shirelle inside, can you please make some noise? A clip of the moment of this rewind surfaced on Twitter and a heated discussion ensued. Opinions were split between those who were arguing that it was an offence to Shirelle to touch the equipment while she was playing and those who were saying a rewind is a compliment rooted in sound system culture and it's really no big deal. We decided we had to speak to Shirelle to see what she thought about all of this. Hi, my name is Sherelle. I'm a represent radio DJ and also a 160 and jungle DJ. For me, DJ etiquette is just mainly... being obviously polite to everyone around you but then at the same time just also being polite when you're actually in the booth. For me that particular boiler room situation between myself and Riz was a weird one. The whole boiler room response was like really amazing. And I was so gassed to obviously have the video go viral, essentially. And, you know, it's actually changed my career for the best. I'm all for reload culture and I'm just used to having reloads go off, usually in a gig. Boiler room situation is a weird one because obviously when you're in a club, you can see the universal sign of people spinning their hands. back and then that will show you and dictate to you that this is a reload. But to be fair, the only thing I could see was a camera, my Captain Morgan's and like various hands like flaring about and all that kind of stuff. So for me, he was probably in the middle of the room just being like, oh, everyone wants a reload. Sick, I'm going to go in. And I was just. queuing up the next track and trying to prepare the next one to go in so when I saw his little cheeky hand come in and just reload the track initially I didn't know who it was I was like what the fuck who the fuck is this because for me I was just like it's a very nerve-wracking thing doing a boiler room you know that there's loads of people watching and you just don't want to fuck up so initially I thought I did something and then but I realized obviously it was like his hand and stuff It's unfortunate, obviously, the response that he got because I thought it was pretty fucking brutal. And a lot of people saying that they want to kick his head in, all this kind of stuff, because I had a phone call with him when he deactivated his twirl just to make sure he was obviously OK. But I'm like I said, I'm from a culture that a reload is a good thing. It just means that you're doing really great. And obviously I did appreciate the reload, but at the same time, it just came as a shock and a surprise. Hence my facial expressions. One thing I will say about the Riz Latif situation, obviously, was that it did bug me that it became so... hateful towards him and what he did. I understand obviously the social aspects to the story but I think Reload culture obviously is about the fact that you're spinning someone's track. to say that they've done really well and it's got loads of history throughout sound clashing culture and all that kind of stuff so I just wish that obviously people would look at the wider thing and hopefully like see that the culture is all about kind of celebrating and supporting the music that is being played and not just kind of wanting to kick people's teeth in just because they reached over to someone's deck and stuff. I'm just not about that kind of vibe. I'm all about, you know, celebrating music. Back on our quest for DJ etiquette tips, I called up Charisma, a DJ and producer from Baltimore, who I remembered had mentioned DJ etiquette in his interview with R.A. for his Art of DJing feature back in 2016, to see what advice he could share. One of the first things, at least I do, you know, when I show up for... party. I always show up like between two hours or an hour before, just so I can hear what's going on, you know, DJ-wise and musically. And that's a respect to, you know, the other DJs that's playing. One of the things that you don't want to run into is the DJ playing, you know, your music. Because, you know, that's, I mean, sometimes they might think that that's a respect factor that they're playing it, but. Really, you know, it's just not cool to do that. One of the other things is volume wise, I hate going into a set and saying that the other DJ is in the red because that gives you no place to go to, you know, if, you know, some of your records or, you know, some of your files are lower than theirs. So it kind of leaves you no room. you know, just in case, you know, you have to go a bit higher in your volume. So those, those kinds of things are, I think, you know, things you want to look out for as a DJ. You don't want a lot of, people in the booth that you know are not your friends or you know just a lot of people hanging around that don't need to be in a dj booth and it you know makes it uncomfortable and it it's just not not cool every now and again you'll you'll get situations like this and i I don't think they mean to do it. It's just not thinking. You know, I always try to think about other people, you know, when I'm playing. When I'm finishing a set, I try to make sure that I'm at a good level and that I have a rapport with the rest of the people that are doing the party. And that's most important because it's not just you. You're actually on a team. It's like basketball. You are setting a person up for a shot. If you're a warm-up DJ, you have the hardest job of all. You gotta set the tone. But, you know, setting the tone doesn't mean you have to kill it. That puts the person playing after you in a situation. Now I have to go hard, and it's, you know, it's the early part of the party. and we got four or five more hours to go. And so once again, like being in the red, where do you go from that? You do have to get people on the floor, but there's a way to do that without playing all the hits. And, you know, my thing is usually if something happens like that. I usually either cut it off or slow it down so that I can start my thing up again, which once again, isn't necessarily good for the crowd, but it's probably necessary. The DJ etiquette is really simple. I think those three rules are enough. Be at the party early. Listen to the other DJs so you know where you're going. And you're respecting the DJs. Know people in the booth. And never leave your set with the volume in the red. If you can get those three down, you won't ever have a problem DJing or DJing with people. because they know you respect them. I'm a really simple guy, so it's a really clean cut for me. Those things I've always kind of done and it's worked for me. You know, I've had the instance of being the one getting in the way. We're back with non-compliant. Which I was using Serato for a while and the reason why I don't anymore. I mean, I always try to stay out of people's way too, but sometimes it's just like you can't get to the back of the mixer because it's like... you know, kind of set into a table or you can't get in front of it. And you know, you just got there, you couldn't get there for sound check. But I actually had a situation, I always brought a power supply because if you run turntables into a Serato box, once you turn off the computer, if you don't have a power supply, There's no sound from the turntables. So... So I... brought my own power supply so I could shut down my computer and put it away, but that it could still be going on. And so I was at, I was at SmartBar. I played right before Object and he's going to laugh if he hears this because I'm still feeling guilty about it, like five years later, where he was kind of rearranging all the plugs. He's like, don't worry, I'll take care of that. I'll plug everything. back in you know taking it out of the serato box plugging it back in right and um so i thought he had done all that already and i pulled the power and i like boom everything was quiet i was mortified and it's funny because to this day he just still laughs at me when i freak out about it he's just like it didn't do it right and i'm like who unplugged yeah be really Be careful about that stuff. If you have to unplug everything, make sure that you're not going to destroy the flow of the next DJ set. I've been that jerk, but I didn't do it on purpose in my defense. Here's Sherelle. I think when it comes to DJ etiquette, when you're a woman, you have to be kind of very aware of what's going on around you. I've gone to gigs before and sometimes people have thought I'm the friend, not necessarily the actual DJ. And then in other cases, sometimes I've felt like I've been almost pushed out of the actual booth. But I just try and... play through it and, you know, try and let the energy come through and hope for the best, really. I actually am quite used to playing more so with girls than I am with loads of guys. And I think there's just a genuine mutual respect because obviously a lot of us have had to go through things in order to, you know, even get to a certain point in our careers. And I guess it's just helping each other constantly. There's been a few female DJs. that have been DJing a lot longer than I have and they've helped me actually fix the back of a DJ deck and I don't know, just made me feel at ease when I'm in the DJ booth. Good vibes all round. It seems to be that there are definitely some golden rules everyone brought up when talking about DJ etiquette. Don't redline in your set, don't play the tracks of the DJ playing after you, don't touch the other DJ's decks and be considerate when warming up. And when playing B2B, try to think about the other person you're playing with. The bottom line seems to be just to be considerate and respectful in the booth. I particularly related to these last few words from Debonair. Are there any things that you did maybe earlier in your career when you're still learning stuff that you look back on now and cringe a bit at? I think, if I'm honest, at points I maybe took the DJ etiquette too far in the sense that, you know, I played warm-ups and was very much being very respectful of building the night. And keeping it very easy and not playing bangers when I've got the next person coming up and thinking who was on the lineup, who was headlining. And to very much lay the foundation for the night that was coming. But I think after a while, and after a while of maybe talking to other DJs. including DJs that were maybe in grime and saying, you know, there is no warm up. Come on, you know, play the set you want to play. I think over time, I learned to really take that time for myself and really show what I was made of. So I think over time, I learned how to do that and let myself shine, I guess, which I think I was very scared of letting myself do, maybe out of being a bit too polite to start off with yeah I relate a lot to that I feel it's something that it takes time to find confidence in your voice as a DJ enough to not constantly feel like you need to adapt to the setting that you've been put in often as a warm-up DJ when you're when you're starting out. I can't remember who said this now, but I've heard it said, if you don't want to be booked as the warm-up DJ, don't play like the warm-up DJ. That's exactly it, and that's what I had to learn, but it took me a long time. The idea of a chill-out room was a phenomenon in the 90s and noughties, but got lost in the evolution of clubbing. As ambient music catches the attention of more and more of us, Tom Faber has been exploring the resurgence of chill-out spaces inside clubs. You're in the club. It's 5am. The dance floor is heaving and your favourite DJ just finished their set. You're not ready to go home, but you need a time out. You could stand in the corridor while people push past you or try and chill on the concrete floor of the smoking area. Maybe it's cold outside. Maybe you don't smoke. You don't have many options. Early ravers had a solution for this. As dance music tempos got faster and ecstasy became more prevalent in the late 80s, promoters created rooms away from the dance floor where punters could sit down and drift away. Often these chill-out rooms would boast beanbags, soft lighting and even playstations, creating a womb-like environment for maximum relaxation. Around these spaces, a new breed of selector began to emerge, the chill-out DJ, who could play anything from ambient to free jazz. But over time, these spaces started to die out. Chill-out rooms became Room 2, another dance floor which would maximise drinks, dancing and profits. For around 25 years, UK clubs with chill-out spaces have been thin on the ground. But with the resurging interest in ambient music in recent years, these special spaces are making a halting return to nightlife. clubs. I wanted to find out why this is happening and who's at the forefront of this new scene. One spot trying to create a permanent chill out space is the Pickle Factory in East London. I headed down there one evening in February to find out how it was going. My name's Dan Bean. Dan Bean is part of London promoter crew Bleep 43. I found him playing a set of left field hip hop and techno in the Pickle Factory's chill out room. Over the last four or five years, we've been doing much more kind of immersive, like chill-out inspired stuff. So we've been lucky that we've got people we've been working with a long time, like a surgeon, for example, who like working with us and will come and do unusual things because they know that we'll create an unusual space. So that's kind of... That's kind of what bleep 43 is about. So tonight I'm in the second room in the pickle factory and me and my friend Crofton are just sort of playing weird random shit. I guess. So chill-out rooms kind of disappeared for quite a long time in the UK because basically they don't make a lot of money. You could put someone in a chill-out room who was going to bang out a house, you know, nothing wrong with that, and you'd sell a lot more beer and you'd be able to get a lot more people in because you wouldn't have chairs in there and all this kind of stuff. So it disappeared for a long time. I really miss that thing where you just go in Actually, it is important that there's a place like that. And I think the other thing that's helping is that lots of kind of quite established artists are starting to release a lot more kind of music that you could play in a chill-out room. I like Pariah as a good example. He's someone who's known for basically making pretty intense techno and bass music. And he's just released a really, really good whole ambient album. And I think people see that and kind of go, oh, hold on, there's actually a thing here. Really, the end of it. The chill-out rooms, I think, was ushered in by the rise of the superclubs in the 90s, places like Home or even The Complex, which is a great club, but there were huge things and they had massive overheads and they had to industrialise in order to keep afloat. And that trend has continued right through to now, even to the Burghine or wherever. They're ruthlessly well-organised. And they're very good at bringing you in and making you feel part of it. But still, it is industrialised clubbing. It's a bit like going to a rave supermarket. When it's so big and so industrialised, you just don't really... You don't really feel like an individual in it and it's too big to connect with. I just think it's just been missing from the culture for so long and people just don't really understand what they are. But, you know, even compared to like a year or two ago, like there's a lot more understanding. You know, there's a lot more interest in that kind of thing. But yeah, it's kind of a bit of an uphill struggle sometimes. Toby Wareham is the booker for the Pickle Factory. I asked him about the decision to introduce an ambient room to the club. So Pickle Factory's been open three years since last October. I mean, I joined just as the club opened. And even from those kind of early days, we always felt like the club needed some sort of extra element because, I mean, I like the simplicity of it as a space, that there's just kind of a... dance floor and a nice sound system and a little courtyard to smoke cigarettes. But if you're not really into the DJ that's playing and you don't like smoking and it's a bit chilly outside, there's not really many places to go. So I guess it was originally born out of mostly having an extra space for people to sit and relax. But I would say that only really took shape as something more towards a space where people would also be playing ambient music a year. or two ago 18 months ago I've been going to free rotation for quite a long time and I've really fallen in love with the ambient yurt that they've got there and the balance it kind of brings to the music across the weekend and it's just a nice little spot if you are feeling a little bit fragile to just go and sit and relax and listen to some nice beatless music for a while. So I kind of helped to push it through as an idea I suppose but what it is as a space is DJs playing ambient music it is a nice spot. to sit down and we do what we can with it. We do projections on one wall and we kit it out with some quite nice lighting and I wave some joystick around at the start of the evening. But I wouldn't like to pretend that it's kind of a super comfy, super cush little spot because Really, the space it is, is it used to be our cafe, which we've now expanded and knocked through a wall into the Pickle Factory smoking area to transform it into a spot that sells cocktails and also has ambient DJs playing. Okay. So what's been holding you back from making it into the space that you want it to be? Good question. I mean, without... Going too deep into the rabbit hole, I suppose what it comes down to is firstly money because it does cost quite a lot to do everything that we want to do in there which is acoustic proofing and we do have a nice sound system in there but it's lacking a little bit of bass which you'd have to proof it quite a lot to comply with the licensing regulations which which we have in there. Also, and I think this probably applies to a lot of clubs and spaces which want to go down this route, unfortunately, it's not just a club. but it's also a cafe in the daytime. We also do live music. It functions sometimes as a green room for big bands that are playing across the road at Oval Space. So it needs to be a multifunctional space and it doesn't really specialize completely in what I'd like it to do. It's kind of a bit of a jack of all trades, I suppose. I like the DIY nature of it. We definitely have done as much as we can with it, but it's not quite. where we'd like it to be and maybe this is the year I think that we're planning. to really nail it. What would be some additions that would make it into the space? At the moment it's a little bit concretey. It could just be softer and a bit more cosy in general I suppose. A bit more decorations, some more plants, a bit more balance to the sound because at the moment it is lacking a little bit of bass punch. So it just needs a few little bits and bobs, touches like that that would definitely make a huge difference. cumulatively I suppose. How are you seeing people use the space? I mean this is also it as well they come and go and it's a challenge for DJs that we have playing in there. We have some really great people who specialise in that kind of music that live locally and they do a really good job but the nature of the game I suppose of a room which also functions as kind of a feeder bar to the main space is that it is quite a transient crowd. people pop in and have an espresso martini have a sit down listen to the music and then probably you know want to go and join their mates back inside listening to the dj that they ultimately paid come and see so there's an element of transience about it which makes it a bit of a challenge what's really nice is it you do see people particularly later in the evening about 4 a.m which is peak i need to sit down for 10 minutes sort of time it's really nice to see people come and lounge in there with their pals and it does i think take a bit of a pressure off the main space it also means that people stay in the club a little bit longer think on average which is good for us from a financial perspective and from a party perspective and do you think they're kept there in a way because there's music playing or do you think it'll be different if there wasn't music there or if the music from the main room was being piped through so so that's a good question tom because we are planning also this year to cable from our amp room which is in Pickle Factory across the courtyard into there so that if we so choose we could pipe music through from the main room that's not necessarily the direction I want to take it because that would detract from the ambient room experience but it's a nice option to have and for example on the 20th of April Donato Dozzi's playing in the main room more of his kind of ambient down tempo kind of selections and then it makes sense to be able to pipe the music through so people can sit and have a nice drink and listen to him playing it definitely makes a big difference to have some kind of music in there because when we started When we first opened it, it was literally just this blank space that was too bright with no music. And you could see the jarring nature of it when people walked in half cut and were like, what? What's this? Get me back outside. So yeah, of course it makes a big difference to have some sort of music. So do you expect that this is something that we're going to see improving in the Pickle Factory and perhaps appearing at other spaces around London in the coming years? Yeah, we definitely want to improve at the Pickle Factory. I do think there's more of a thirst for it generally in London, definitely. And promoters such as Nick and Roops' Mate Me, they've started to dip their toes in it as well. And DJs like Object and Cool Super also are huge proponents of it. Last time we had Object play... He insisted that his friend Aurora came down and played ambient music back before we even had the room as sorted out as it is now. So yes, I would say we are generally moving towards a more kind of conscious way of going out and a bit more of a thoughtful take on it all, which goes beyond just going out, but actually wanting different musical experiences and everything that brings with it. so. Ben Rubin is one of the promoters behind London party Make Me, who have also tried to install an ambient room at recent events. We always had fond memories of Going to clubs like the Q Club in the 90s, the late 90s, and going to parties like Flashback and Atomic Jam, and there would always be an ambient room at those parties. And it wasn't like a side thing. It was part of the main event. You'd actually get people going specifically to sit in the ambient room. It just gives a different... pace to the party and it gives people who've been in the kind of main bit of the rave somewhere to go and you know just chill at a different tempo for a bit and for others who are less inclined to go onto the dance floor but still want to be in a club environment and listening to good music and enjoying the social aspects of the party. It just opens you up to a new audience and gives people a chance to enjoy what we do in a different way. The key to an ambient room... really is just making it as comfortable as possible. People aren't in there to dance, they're there to listen to the music, yes, but to relax in their own headspace or to spend time with their friends and enjoy that social aspect. In many ways it's like a living room. We probably have sofas, some rugs on the floor, kind of ambient. mood lighting, nothing too in your face or fast-paced. The decks will generally be on a low table on the dance floor with a sofa behind them that the DJ or DJs will sit on while they're playing. I think that the key thing that you're trying to do is to create an environment where the DJ and the crowd can have a much more personal experience with each other than you'd maybe get on a normal dance floor. And that's really just to do with the pace sounds and the music that are being played and the idea that the music is creating almost a meditative state that's shared between the crowd and all the participants and the DJs and it's a different type of joint experience. The reason why it's happened recently I guess is We've been to some European clubs. I think Berghain in particular do the ambient room in Halle very well when that room's open. And then also, Playing at Nat Digital earlier this year, there was an ambient stage there which was on all weekend and again it was a main attraction for the festival, it wasn't a side thought. You know, seeing people like Ben UFO, Leif Olegov doing ambient sets and having that kind of side to their musical. personality and us, you know, knowing those guys and having the opportunity to book them. It's just kind of a confluence of things coming together and that's how it all started. With the increased interest in ambient music, a few dedicated events have been set up that cater exclusively to the sound. One is New Atlantis, the New Age themed event held in South London's Rye Wax. I spoke to India Jordan, who runs the night with the help of Alan Wootton, aka Deadboy. I'm India. I run New Atlantis, London's premier ambient and new age music social, which is social on a record label. And I also DJ ambient and non-ambient. What would a person see if they walked into New Atlantis in full swing? They'd see lots of seats, lots of people sat on the seats drinking tea, perhaps a dog, someone's parents, a baby. There's been quite a lot of babies. Ambient music playing. and some projections in the background. People eating food, people checking out records. No one shouting. Okay. The music isn't that loud. Lots of people working and reading as well. I've prepared for two interviews at New Atlantis and got both of the jobs. So New Atlantis is the key to my career. And what kind of music would you be hearing? Yeah, mainly all ambient and new age. A lot of... stuff and all that sort of in between and if you're feeling particularly adventurous you might hear the occasional beat but it's never any faster than 120 ppm and But it's mainly always during the day and then going into the evening just to ease people out of the weekend. And starting out, did you feel that it was filling a need in London nightlife, something that wasn't there? Definitely. So I started getting into ambient music because of the radio show that I used to run, which featured quite a lot of it. And then I used to meditate quite a lot. So my introduction to ambient was through meditation. and that show. and yeah it was basically there was basically nothing else in London um that I'd heard of Alan started the night that came off the back of his Black Magic album on the collection so if you play both sort of ambient sets and dance sets what do you have to think about differently when you're selecting for an ambient set with my background in DJing I always started I started off like DJing drum and bass like eight years ago so my um Training in DJing was always fast tempo, fast mixes. So I basically had to unlearn that with Ambient and it was more about not beat matching and focusing on how to get a smooth blend. Using lots more effects on the mixer as well because I think ambient takes a lot more. You can put like an echo and a reverb on it. It doesn't just smash up all the drums because there's no drums. You can experiment with the sounds a little bit more. Tom Unlikely who runs Rewax, he did a set for us last month and he played everything at 45. slowed down to 45 with this massive reverb and it sounded like ambient but it split up to its actual tempo and it was probably like something like house okay so we can be a lot more experimental with the sounds because it's more about just a continuous drone sound rather than like fast mixes okay and it does sound like whether tangy and cheeky or not there is a connection to sort of spirituality is that something that you take to some extent seriously as well yeah i mean i think alan more than me um his album recently under JV Lightbody Shakti eyes closed yeah that's it yeah like tantric stuff and all the sort of like Chinese spiritual side of things too from his initial album he probably just explores it a lot more I got into it through meditation how I can enable myself to be more present and to work through things is to sort of connect with music and I can't really meditate without music so yeah I don't do meditation as much as I used to but when I was going through a really depressive period when I got into New Atlantis like it was the only way I could stop my anxiety so I connect with it on a spiritual level to help me get through things yeah so there's something healing in the music for sure yeah i definitely say that i have to be in the right mood for it because sometimes ambient music can also make me feel really depressed drone in particular it's just quite tense quite all-encompassing sometimes so what would you see in an ideal chill out room of a club my favorite example of what one looks like is whirligig club night it's been going for like 35 years And they have actually that room there that's got lots of projections on the wall, lots of cool things in the room to look at, like random bits of like random statues or like hangings on the wall and lots of beanbags and sofas. It's just a place that's comfortable and safe. Dance music is intense. dance especially when it's really really loud it's in a club I think that can feel quite overwhelming I think that if there was a room for you to just have a breather every now and again especially if you know things have got a little bit too much then if anything it's good for business really like you want to keep people in your club for as long as possible then give them some space to chill out because you can't sustain constantly dancing unless you're really really fit or being sustained by something else. So why Why do you think a lot of clubs have been reluctant to have that kind of space? I don't know. I think maybe it's not what people are used to anymore. So people are just kind of a little bit scared by it. I am interested in the idea that maybe you can't earn money from a chill out room. People aren't dancing. They aren't getting hot. They aren't drinking. You don't often buy drinks there. There's always something in that about not making money. But I also think that that's because like I mentioned before if you're keeping someone in the club for longer they're probably going to make more money out of them in the long run. Do you think it ties into sort of wellness culture? Perhaps. I think there's a thing about wellness culture and being intrinsically tied into capitalism and being a vehicle for being like, you can get through capitalism and how many hours we make you work if you just eat an apple and chill out and meditate every day. And go to a chill out room. yeah yeah the whirligig to mention it again they sell cakes and tea and samosas for the people that don't want to drink because it was originally um a non-alcoholic event and children could come you know if clubs are worried about losing money they could perhaps maybe sell other things other than alcohol yeah and soft drinks i wonder if having a space for um your audience to relax is a way of showing them that you care about them and i wonder if it can ever be a bad decision either emotionally or in business sense to make people think that you care about their well-being yeah and yet very few seem to yeah that's a really really good point I think also like that used to happen so what's changed what has changed I don't know I think maybe Rave culture started in non-corporate spaces and now clubbing has become mainstream. It has become corporate in a way. Clubs are businesses. I've got a friend who was really into the early 90s hardcore scene. He was chatting to me and sent me some videos of a rave that happened in 91 last night and I was checking it out and it looked absolutely incredible. But the venue promotion flyer was like, it was non-alcoholic and it had like specs. of the venue on the side and it was like clean toilets all of this lighting all this sound system like inflatables um places to get some food and drink and it was like marketed as like a full-on event rather than just like you go to a club you get smashed and drunk you go home it was a bit more holistic like that and i think that perhaps maybe in the 90s there was maybe more of a holistic view on what a clubbing experience should be rather than just to make money so not as transactional like you pay money you get eight hours of dancing of sweating is it possible that as our sort of political moment gets more uncertain and kind of horrible away and the new cycle is scarier we like have recourse to these kind of healing gentle sounds or spaces yeah for sure yeah i actually would love to see if there's anything out there in the world about um the rise of um new age and its correlation with political uncertainty um because it's definitely a thing right now Miro's Sunday music is a Slovakian DJ and co-founder of Netul Radio. He started DJing in chill-out rooms in the 90s and has been a specialist in left-field sounds ever since, with morning parties like End Us Plenty and his soothing Sunday radio show Morning Transition. Music is a... has physical impact on us. It's a vibration and it just goes through your body if you want it or not. That's why good music makes you feel better. Does it take different skills to be a dance DJ than to be a chill out DJ? I think it does. You don't have a beat you can connect people to. So you have to really find different ways how to make people to really connect with what you're doing, not just pass by or just order a drink on a bar close by the DJ. I think it requires particular skill to know how to create atmosphere with just layers of sound. It sounds almost like you can play anything. It's more about the attitude that you bring to it. Yes, it's exactly about the attitude. That's what I wanted to more say, that it's not really about the ambient music only. Ambient music is amazing for this reason, what I found out, for example, on this few after hours I did recently. It really gives the listeners some space between the party moment. and you are more able to catch them on more difficult sounds later on. And you can really layer things together. But it really requires a good sound system. The bass is very important. It's interesting because you would think that music that didn't rely on drums in the same way, that bass would not be so important. It's actually more important in this case. I actually play music which requires people to have a seat for five minutes. We are trying to bring it back and I think it's gonna happen and it's happening already. I can see that there is a will of having ambient tent on a festival, having some space for people to chill out. The task of introducing chill-out rooms to existing venues is an uphill battle. I've heard reports from friends of chill-out rooms being shut down in the middle of a party by club owners concerned that the music was dangerous. People should be dancing rather than sitting down. Elsewhere, chill-out rooms have been shut down for lack of interest, or have been merged with other areas, such as the bar. I have yet to see a chill-out room in a London club. that feels like it's everything that it should be. But a few spaces are on the way, and the fact that these are making a return shows that there is a real desire to reintroduce a sense of care and community to an increasingly corporate clubscape. I would love to see more of these spaces. They just... give you know another interesting dimension to parties and I think that if club owners want people to keep on coming to their venues then you know having interesting unusually programmed events is a good thing the economics will be a barrier to that but you know, if you find the right venues with owners and management who are really open-minded and are really passionate about the music then I can see this thing becoming more and more popular and obviously that's driven by a renewed interest and focussed on ambient music. And there's some amazing stuff coming out now. There's some amazing DJs and live performers who are doing some awesome stuff in this space. And long may that continue.
