I got myself. Hi, I'm Joe Muggs and this is a really special interview for me because it's come off the back of the book that I put together this year, Bass Mids Tops, which is a history of sound system culture and its influence on the wider culture of... the UK and during the discussion event that we had at an exhibition at Red Bull the two guests here started a very interesting conversation between the generations. Before we get into that can you introduce yourselves? My name is Jumping Jack Frost. And my name is Shy One. Between you two of my favorite DJs in any case, in any genre, extremely talented in the studio too. But one of the stories that came up in the interview, so in the book, each chapter is an interview with people. spanning a long period of UK music history and Jumping Jack Frost comes somewhere in the middle and Shy One I think is the youngest of the interviewees so in Shy's chapter She spoke about a very early experience of music, which was... Literally the earliest record that I ever remembered was Leviticus Burial off of my mum's... She had a mixtape by Chemistry and Storm. I think it was called like Thunder and... No, sorry, Thunder and Joy? Is that someone else? Thunder and Joy was a big Jungle Night. Yeah, so my mum was listening to a Thunder and Joy tape. either that or a different one anyway and that tune was my absolute favourite when it came on it was released I believe in 93 I would have been three years old but that is the earliest musical memory that I have and then I later found out that well we'll get into the rest but I also found out the sample one of the samples in it is my my friend's dad like you know basically my uncle as well So yeah, La Villica's Burial, earliest musical memory and song that I didn't get the track title for, like I didn't ID it properly until much later. But this was like the perfect illustration of this kind of whole web of influences that goes through underground music. You know, it's in trying to do this book, I was always trying to get as many voices in as possible and show how these kind of webs of connections go across the generations and how like, you know, it's not just samples that are handed down. It's like it's the knowledge and it's the understanding of. socializing and all these different things so not only was that track made by jumpy jet frost and not only did it feature your friend's uncle's studio but frost you uh have other relationships with shy which only came up afterwards i guess i mean yeah good friends with her dad you know I mean I've known him He was one of the people that inspired me when I first started going to the African Centre, Soul to Soul and Jazzy B and Trevor. So it's crazy. It just goes round in a circle. Do you know what I mean? So Sean's dad is Trevor Nelson and Jazzy is your godfather? Wow, because Jazzy is like both Jazzy and Trevor. I spoke to Beres like a... couple of days ago, do you know what I'm saying? And he wrote a part, he wrote, he's like, wrote in my book and all that, he's part of, he's in the book talking about me. About the first time when they met me and stuff, when I was like, I was a kind of like a bad kid. I was just running around crazy. And Trevor and Jazzy were two of the people that really influenced me to get into the, to do what I do now. So yeah, it's crazy. It's interwoven history. I was going out to Camden and listening to Soul to Soul. Africa set up every Sunday religiously, do you know what I'm saying? Jazzy, do you know what I mean? And then we just became good friends. They were like, "Oh, behave yourself, man." Do you know what I mean? I was just like, "Oh, just, you know, like, allow me, man." But they were like, "Come on, you gotta behave in here, man." Do you know what I mean? But, you know, we're all really cool friends now. We're really good friends, man. And what, did they actually get you involved? Because you were, like, in the carry boxes and stuff? No, no, I was just into the music and I just, like, used to go there and just talk to them and learn from them. And they were like, just, you know, they always had a lot of time for me, do you know what I'm saying? Always had a lot of time for me Do you know what I'm saying? And I just learnt a lot from them, man. Just got a lot of guidance from them. It's crazy because I was just saying to her earlier, I remember going into Hamleys a couple of years in a row with my daughter and bumping into each other. We sort of just bump into each other in Hamleys, you know. I'm saying. So, yeah, you know, we're just, we're good friends, man. We're cool. And that mix of music in 80s, late, mid-late 80s London, I mean, how would you characterise what was being played at that point, pre kind of Acid House and you getting your point? Boogie, rare groove, funk, hip-hop, you know what I mean? You've got a soul to soul. it was just that vibe that rare group vibe like larry young's fuel the meters tunes like that i mean like eddie harris i mean music like that was being played at that time you know i mean i mean they had You know, Tosca in that electric ballroom upstairs in the little room, which was like, you know what I mean, jazz central, man. People just, some fast footwork was going on in there them days there, man. Do you know what I'm saying? So that's everything from 60s to what was then the cutting edge, right? Yeah, definitely, yeah, yeah. Up to that Mantronics at that time. Yeah. That was like from the rare groove up to that. Mantronics you know what I mean and then you know Acid House kind of came in after that it's funny I've been going back to Mantronics and realising how important he specifically was for British music at that time oh yeah definitely because I've been listening to like Naila Cherry's album then and the Slip and Mighty stuff from then which was kind of the cutting edge of UK music and it's remember like remember like remember like the Yellow Magic Orchestra that's like Crazy shit. You understand what I'm saying? That's like one of the first electronic records I ever bought. the Yellow Magic Orchestra, do you know what I'm saying? I recently got put onto them. Huh? I recently got put onto them. That's crazy. How did you get put onto them, man? You know what? It's actually my partner. My partner's not even from here. Like, my partner's Canadian into like East Asian jazz, funk and R&B and pop, like, and put me onto, yeah. Amazing. Like, it blows my mind to hear that that was, did you say it was the first record you bought? That was the first electronic record I bought. Electronic record you bought, yeah. Like, to hear that you were raving. I had the Space Invaders shit on it. that you're talking about? Yeah. The Space Invaders one. That's like the first electronic record I ever bought. See, it's nuts because I never, the fact that you were raving with my dad and my godfather to the music that I associate them with, yeah. Those two, those two played that record too. Yeah. Yeah. Your dad played that, your dad played that tune. Your uncle played that tune, the Yellow Magic Orchestra, Space Invaders tune. That was groundbreaking in its day. I was about to say, I don't know about music now. Oh, come on, man. That's nuts. I mean, right, I'm just going to link back into the book here because there's multiple connections, okay? I mean, this is what it's all about, really. So number one, you mentioned chemistry and Storm. So DJ Storm's in my book. You know, she's a vital part of the history. She kind of joins that. Acid Era to Goldie to all of these things but also like even Yellow Magic Orchestra have got a UK sound system connection because Dennis Bavell who's the first interviewee in the book did a record with Uchi Sakamoto from Yellow Magic Orchestra produced Riot in Lagos, which is like a classic 80s electronic boogie funk record. So straight away, you kind of have got these links in and out of, you know, Dennis Bavell, who's a Barbadian British dub producer, Japanese electro, and it's all there in the 80s. I mean, the reason I asked Frost about... that kind of mixture is because like you're involved with touching base now. Yeah. And it's almost like something's come full circle to the same mixture that was there in the 80s, which is. jazz, R&B, Latin, kind of spiritual jazz, electro, and UK bass music, and yet you're making new combinations out of it. Does that make sense? Yeah, I'm playing all of it on, like, Touching Bass is a perfect example. I've never thought to kind of compare Touching Bass to, like, what they were doing. as in that mix of sounds. But for real, I suppose it probably is a similar kind of vibe where, yeah, we'll play some Sunrun and we'll play like some Acid House and we'll play like some classic 90s house stuff and then like some funk and some Mary J. Blige or something and all under one roof, yeah. That's good. In one night. And I'll sample some of these, as you know, and put them in a grind beat or something. I mean, because what happened was Acid House took everything over, as I'm sure you'll agree with us. So in 1988, everything changed. In 1988, everything changed, man. Acid House is an explosion. It's like a cultural explosion. Do you know what I mean? People from different backgrounds who would never have met. all coming together under one roof. Do you know what I mean? I think it was more than a musical revolution. It was a definite cultural revolution in terms of just the eclectic mix of people from different cultures all coming together under this crazy banner called Acid House that was just so groundbreaking. Do you know what I mean? Because, I mean, within the story of the book, I've concentrated obviously in the kind of reggae and hip hop side as people came into it. So you see one side of Acid House. But for everyone, there was a different story about 1988. You know, I mean, you know, I'm of an age where it was my older, my friends' older brothers and sisters kind of thing. But I lived in a white countryside town. And then suddenly these people were coming back going, you know, we've been to that London. We've been to London, you see all sorts there. And, you know, they were seeing things that they'd never seen before in their life because they normally go to a barn dance or something. And then suddenly they're around gay people and people of all different races and whatever. And then they're all, the same people are all in an aircraft hangar in Luton the next, like the next weekend with an extra 10,000 people. And, you know, it was... transformational. But then, you know, we kind of, within Resident Advisor world, we all know the story of what happened then. You have hardcore, you have jungle. Yeah. And then these constant evolutions of different forms of techno and then dubstep and then grime. Which is beautiful. You know what I mean? Because you've got to remember, UK music at that time wasn't exporting anything to the world. We were just importing everything. But now you have all these exports of this beautiful bass music in all different kind of forms, played by, started off from kind of our generation, and now you've got young, talented people like... Shire here, that's taking it to another level. Do you know what I'm saying? So, it's just a beautiful thing. I remember being at university and someone saying to me, this is the first ever British working class music, which blew me away. I was like, well, really? What about, no, but... Wait, and punk? But punk was American really first, and, you know, and, you know, the Beatles were really just doing American R&B, whatever, but, like, hardcore and then jungle were the first British sounds. And so, you know, it did turn into something unique at that moment. I mean, Shai, if your memories start at jungle, you kind of... had your whole lifelong immersion in that. Yeah, that's why I suppose... It's funny, like, that was the starting point, but it's maybe taken how many years for me now to get to a point where only now, today, in tunes, am I actually playing with breaks and stuff. it takes a while sometimes to get there, you know, you've got to go full circle. But Jungle was definitely the, it was the beginning, but it's probably the genre that I have the least amount of in my collection, the least amount of knowledge. For instance, I only find I use Leviticus just by chance because I read a chapter from your book, I think it was, which I still need to get the rest of. But Jungle, I suppose it's, consciously always been like uh my approach I think like with it being bass driven even the way that I mix tunes like going and mixing my tunes down with other people and realizing the way that I the sounds that I prioritize or I think it's from yeah from kind of first uh falling in love with electronic music through jungle but when you started like the first things you did were grime Yeah. And were you aware of the Jungle Connections? Because, you know, obviously all of the first generation of grime MCs kind of got their schooling on Deja Vu and Rinse in the jungle years, in the sort of late jungle years. Did you know that? Did you kind of... grasping your head that that's where they come from through them referencing it in like lyrics like dizzy literally saying in lyrics that he used to buy a jungle records from target or something but it wasn't something where i kind of transitioned with them like oh i i listened to and collect jungle now i'm gonna move to grime next or garage and then grime it um because i was too young like even though i was kind of ahead and doing this from young i was still too young so i was like seven you know when it was Jungle me and mum are listening to and then when it's Garage a little bit after that and then it's only I literally just came of age I suppose when it was you grew up with the whole thing yeah but the age when I was like I'm going to be in my room and listen to this pirate and I had the timetable like I clocked the timetable of who I want to listen to at the age where I was kind of more interested in curating what I listened to and collected, I think, was when they had switched, the grind people had switched over. So I wasn't aware that they had also come from there because I wasn't kind of paying attention. But as you took DJing more seriously and production more seriously, did you sort of think about where... grime and what you were doing fit within the bigger picture or was it just that you were doing the thing that was... Nah, not at all man. It was just, it was literally just expression. It was like this... The only way I can try and describe it, I think of like genres or sounds or whatever. as to like the context of the era or something and I just felt like I was living in that soundtrack. And so it only made sense as I kind of reached my limit with how much I could get involved, like collecting, listening, DJing and stuff. But no, we are talking about DJing, not producing, innit? Right, one thing I want to get a picture of from both of you is how what you do fit into an international context. I mean, for us, right? When you started, Acid was coming from the States. Yeah. And you were getting these German and Belgian records and stuff. I was playing in Germany. I was playing in Holland. I was playing in Belgium. And, you know, these records, you had labels like Lower East Side from Amsterdam. You had, like, One Car from Belgium. You had R&S from Belgium. And you had this techno, like, underground resistance, Mike Banks and that lot from Detroit. It was, you know what I mean? It was very techno. It was crazy those days, man. Crazy. So this is... this is like 1991 now so you're that yeah this is 91 man 88 and 89 acid yeah it's acid and then it just started going you know the techno was always there but the US techno was always there underground resistance do you know what I mean they're like one of my favourites ever man I love underground resistance obviously you've got Derek May Juan Atkins Kevin Saunderson the pioneers of techno do you know what I mean Carl Craig You've got people like Marshall Jefferson in the house. Do you know what I mean? He's a good friend of mine. Big shout to Marshall. He's just got this world of talent and knowledge that came from the States that we picked up on here and we kind of flipped it. And then, you know, Europe became like the biggest kind of exponents of the Rave Cup. culture do you know what I mean that was started in America but we just took it on another level here I mean it's funny how a lot of the British producers would hear just that one certain thing in a American or Belgian techno record so it's you hear a record like Strings of Life it's eternal it's eternal Derek May it's just eternal. That record goes... Strings of Life is one of those records that's like out there on its own, but something like Just Another Chance, Reese, you know, the Reese bass. It's like the British producers heard that bass tone, just that one single tone, and ran with it. Ran. Ran with it. Ran. I'm sure they're still using it now. Yeah. Yeah. And you've got, you know, you've got Kevin Saunders and Tunes Records, like, Tr early breakbeat, jungle kind of sound, but it had that Detroit feel to it still. Do you know what I'm saying? And Carl Craig as well. Carl Craig's a genius. Do you know what I'm saying? And Bug in the Bass Bin was getting... played by hardcore and jungle DJs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Did you feel like you guys were kind of accepted within a wider global scene? Because obviously when... No, because when we first started off, obviously we wasn't because, you know, people must have thought, who are these guys? But, you know, it takes years. you got to do your apprenticeship. Do you know what I mean? And we've done ours. We've done our apprenticeship and people started taking us more seriously. And then, you know, people started looking at us as their peers and their equals. Do you know what I mean? And you get that through hard work. You don't get that shit overnight. You have to work hard. You have to really work hard. your craft. I mean, Shai, grime obviously is another example of something that took a while to go international. Where dubstep, for example, did quite quickly. That was pretty quick. Since then, like post-dubstep in quotes, which is really where a lot of your records land roughly because, you know, you kind of, you're between genres as almost everyone is, I guess, since 2010. Like, how do you feel about British sound fitting into an international context? I think British sound is... It's not even fitting into international context. It's kind of dictating a lot of... like we're quite the rest of the world is looking to us a lot you have like and i'm not talking about like the music we're into or we can't like but just one of the biggest artists right now is drake and he is got his eyes locked to london like he's looking at what they used to do and he's taking flows from like kids who live in lewisham and stuff which is amazing and it's not just so like just to show you that's like one of the biggest pop stars taken from underground music here um so of course like as you go further down and you explore different sounds and stuff like i think the uk is london especially but the uk um has a very big part to play in the musical landscape of the world right now. I think so, I believe that. Yeah, like, whenever you... I meet some artist or someone who's connected to some other bigger artist, Solange or whatever, some person who especially is, like, known for doing something new right now, the whole reason that they're, like... I don't know, making refreshing music is because they're working with people from the UK or they're taking influence from it or they're coming in and they're hanging out for a bit. Because there was a while when the... I'm doing the finger quotes again the post dubstep thing people just got kind of swept to Berlin and Berlin for me Berlin is one of the most creative cities in the world right now you go to Berlin it's packed wall to wall with all kind of artists musical artists painters graffiti it's just a melting pot of art Creativity Berlin is one of the most wonderful cities right now. It's crazy. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, they can survive there. They can actually earn a living and pay their rent. Yeah, it's true. It's for real. Is drum and bass accepted there? I mean, I remember one of my friends saying that the most intense rave experience he's had in a long time, and this is an old raver who's kind of a bit jaded, was seeing D-Bridge in a Yep. I played Berlin quite a lot. I've done it three times last year. Do you know what I mean? This year, sorry. I'm trying to wish you this year. Yeah, let's do it here. Yeah, Berlin's a wonderful place. Love it. I was actually there when the war came down, you know? Yeah, I was DJing there the night the war came down. Wow, in 89. Yeah, it's in the book. It's in my book, man. I was there the night the war came down. I've still got a piece of it at home. I remember giving it to my mum. My mum said, move it from me, the evil. She said, She said, move it, man. She said she could feel the energy on it. I was like, what the fuck, man? You know what I'm saying? But, Shai, on this topic of, like, how London's music is seen, I mean, that's, it's really encouraging because always, you know, everyone's got a different opinion of these things and a lot of people are naturally jaded. They'll always say, scene's not in walls and, you know, there's no one thing that people recognise. you reckon that even though there is no like one sound that is the London sound now as it were there's no there's no jungle there's no grime in the sense there was before that it's people are still like able to kind of look at London and go there is an identifying underground club yeah vibe and sound there's different sounds I think right now our biggest sound or maybe one that's that's um Taking up most people's attention is like the whole Afro beat, Afro swing, I think they're calling it. Kind of R&B, dance or influence, Afro beat influence kind of pop music. Afro bashment. Yeah. Yeah. I can't keep up with the sub genres. But they, I think right now that's kind of, that's really influential. But then. Like someone was playing me some music from a guy from years ago from Belgium. So I'm not sure how much of that is from here and actually maybe influenced by, yeah, like Berlin and other cities. I think, yeah, there's no real, there's no real sound, but people still know that you can, I think there's no real sound because there's so many different sounds. Yeah. Because people know that they can. Doesn't matter what influence you want or what direction you're going into, you can just come here and you can tap into a particular scene or community and they'll have something really fresh and exciting going on. But I don't think there is a particular sound right now, no. Because maybe there's so much. Yeah. I mean, again, potentially, potentially, that is the return to that rare groove vibe where, you know, it is down to the skills of the DJs and the collectives to bring all of those things together, like the right people. Definitely, which probably makes it a lot easier for people like me who don't just play one genre because it's more of like a vibe. I mean, can you talk a bit more about the other collectives that you're involved with? Because there's a few. Yeah. So I'm also, I'm in Touching Bass, as you mentioned before, a collective dance, though, is label, kind of pioneering black music, more on the jazzy side and stuff. And then I'm also in another collective, this Babes. Started out as a club night, but now also kind of about curation and events. And we're also DJs. But also like more so about prioritising the experience of and I think work of queer black people and people of colour. So those are, yeah. Also still affiliated with the co-op Selectors Assemble gang. Music coming out, I think, next year. Which is kind of the perfect meeting point between you two because that broken beat is kind of the exact midpoint and one of the most undersung parts of London history in the last 20 years or so, that broken beat, because it really joins drum and bass to the kind of... jazzier and more experimental and more electronica kind of scenes. I mean first in the 80s like talking of these different kind of collectives that bring different groups of people together you To get house music, like before Acid, you know, there was the gay scene, there was jazz dance scene, there was the electro kind of things, there was the soul to soul things. I mean, did you like spread yourself around differently? Yeah, I was everywhere, man. I looked everywhere. I mean, I looked everywhere. I loved going to gay clubs that played disco and stuff like that. I love going to, I just love everything, everywhere there's music. Some of the gay nightclubs, some of the clubs in the gay scene, the energy and just the music, some of the music selectors that play there are just some of the best in the world. Do you know what I'm saying? So I love going to gay clubs. I love going to... Heavens was really good. Yeah, I mean, what people don't realise is that... Yeah, he never was Heavens. Yeah, man, I'm playing there next week, Rage, the return of Rage, yeah, next week. Rage was like the archetypal hardcore club. Rage is like the mecca of this scene, you know what I mean? And they're having a reunion. next Sunday on the 8th. Do you know what I'm saying? You should come down, man. You should come down. And what people don't realise is that when Fabio and Groove Rider were playing and kind of hardcore was being invented week by week and then Jungle was being invented week by week. Week by week. And we didn't even know it. We were just going with the flow. We were just going with the flow. And this thing was being invented right in front of our eyes. Do you know what I mean? Crazy. The thing that, you know, I really wanted to, like, make the focus of this conversation is history and how that history is passed down. Frost, you talked about how Soul to Soul and all of the other sound systems and the clubs you would go to would play a mix of music across the decades. Across, yeah. you didn't have like people from underground music writing their biographies like you have. I know, but I think, you know, times have changed now. You've got the internet. People want to know. Before, you just, now, people want to connect. They want to know about you. You know what I'm saying? and I was blessed enough and lucky enough to be offered the opportunity to do that. Do you know what I'm saying? But back then, how did you learn? How did you find out about Music Past and about the old breakbeats? I come from a musical family, man. My uncles and that went into like, you know what I mean? My uncles and that went into like James Brown, Parliament. Jimi Hendrix, George Clinton, Miles Davis. I got a massive picture of Miles Davis. As soon as you walk in my house, turn left, you see Miles is looking at you, man. That is shit. Yeah, so Miles is like one of my heroes, Miles Davis. Do you know what I mean? And yeah, Marvin Gaye. Do you know what I mean? That shit, do you know what I'm saying? it's a good school to come from. You know what I mean? I mean, this is one of the things that's come through to me loud and clear from doing this book is the importance of mass family. culture yes in the sense of barbecues parties where you get a lot of generations together hearing music together um errol from touching bass who shy you work with we we did a talk at um we out here festival and you know errol was talking about how more than anything he values just his home life as his musical education This isn't necessarily just a Caribbean culture thing. It's like as I was talking about sound system culture to friends, people from Irish and Spanish backgrounds kind of recognized it because they recognized the value of the family party as the source for where music and rave culture comes from, obviously with your family. you had plenty of musical absorption. It's funny that, and I always have to, I think I did this on the panel, I always have to, not correct, but just let people know that they assume because my dad is Trevor Nelson, DJ, that I absorbed everything from him. But it was your mum. It's my mum. My mum was a raver. and she also collected records and I lived with her. I was raised with my mum, not with my dad. And it's her, it's also Jazzy. Jazzy is my godfather through my, that my dad chose him, but my mum was like, she's best friends with Jazzy. So I used to go around his house like every weekend and he would give me doubles. He would like play me stuff, show me his equipment or whatever. I'd ask him about it. But most of it was from my mum. It's from a raver's point of view, a fan, more so than a DJ. Yeah, and I think that's super valuable. It's like one of the other younger interviewees in the book is barely legal and her mum was a garage raver in Birmingham, you know, and that's what, you know, she just had those mixtapes in the car. in the background and so it's completely absorbed into it. It's like folk culture, you know. We're getting some badges made for the book that say, base culture is folk culture because... that's what it's about. It's how it's handed down. But how did you seek out information? I mean, because you grew up in the internet age. Yeah. See, this is what's really odd because even last night I was on Discogs, as I always am, and I came across this tune. You're all going to know it. And I was like, oh my days, this, first I was like, this is a banger. And now I've realized that any tune that resonates with me, it's because I've heard it. It's like triggering some old memory. And that's how I dig, I realize it's just old. old tracks but um back like it's not until recent years when i've used like discogs and like checking the credits and i've just figured out that like so many of you guys from back in the day had loads of aliases it's that so it's only in recent years using discogs like um wanting to keep track of my collection and seek out more stuff by similar people that i've actually this is where I've started to consciously research and like look into what studio it's done at, the other aides of the person, what label. start tracking it back yeah and you just get lost in it but that's to be honest it's now that I'm really seeking things out like that like consciously I think before things were just there ready they were in the house or I would come across them in record shops but it's only actually now that I'm really like consciously going back and I I I I mean, I know this feeling all too well. I just wrote a piece for The Wire on, they asked me to pick out a favourite record sleeve and I was just rifling through my shelves and I pulled out Hardcore by Wellard. Wellard. Which is a beautiful record. I mean, this is from when I was 17. It's like Proto Jungle, 1992. And it's got this amazing dub bass line in it and this weird voice just going, hardcore, hardcore. And I always assume, because it's on the same label, that it was an alias of Future Sound of London because it's on Jumpin' and Pumpin', which was the label they were on. And they used to put out... They had about 90 different aliases that they put out rave tunes on. And it turns out, no, it's this guy DJ Reckless. And I started Googling him. And this is the beauty of the modern age. Within about half an hour. I'd found video of him as a teenager doing the Scratching DMC Championships in 1990. Then I found another video of him, like, scratching up Afrobeats now. And then I found out he made loads of garage tunes. I found all his aliases. Then I found his email address, and I dropped him a line saying, I'm writing this article, what are you up to? He's like, oh, I'm making a album next year. and now we're in touch and it's like wow you know this whole life history yeah seriously i mean the the the routine he did it's like this 1990 uk yeah and he's mixing up swing b and bashman and old reggae tunes just proper with you know mixing with his hand under his leg and everything Exactly, absolutely proper. But you know, it was a beautiful moment. It was like suddenly all that history is available, but it's not just history, it's a person on the end of the email as well. But do you ever feel swamped by all of that? Every day. I'm swamped by the desire to acquire the information because that's going to be ridiculous. It's not achievable. There's way too much. It's overwhelming, but it's also really exciting. Even now, at the back of this convo, I was like, I was going to go studio afterwards, and now I'm just going to go home and go on Discogs. and go through like some, I've picked up some world records, some house records this last couple of days as well. I'm just going to go through them and just continue. I mean, I've got this kind of vague theory that in the 2000s, it was like, I remember as a journalist, people kept talking about the iPod generation. It's like everything's available all at once and mashups were the thing, you know. And it could seem like a complete mess. You'd get this whole new rave was kind of the aesthetic. You know, it's like everything slammed in and it was like Pete Doherty next to Lethal Bizzle. to some disco record. And I had it all on my iPod. You're fully right. It was... You know, I realise, sorry now, just to answer your question properly, the one you just asked. At the time, because we were so overwhelmed by having access to all this music and we could download it so easily, illegally, for free, via Kazaa and all these other things, that it was just collecting. So those years is when I built up loads of... an iTunes library or whatever that I have gone on to like actually buy physical copies or buy like good quality digi to support the people and stuff but I think we were just so like overwhelmed by how much music we had access to and you could just download a gig you could download someone's discography with one click so but you would it would take years for you to get around to coming back to it so I think A lot of us weren't researching and we were just hoarding music. We were just downloading stuff that we still didn't even unzip five years later, seven years later. And now is when you're sifting through or like I'll find a track that I downloaded seven years ago. It's a banger that I've never heard. And then I'll look into the person and then I'll research. I think at first it was just actually just like. Grabbing everything. It was like next sale on Boxing Day or something. What I was going to say, my vague theory is that people are finally getting to the point where they're finding their own aesthetics within that, you know, rather than slamming everything together and just kind of using it as a grab bag. It's like... people have now are handing down that understanding of how to navigate, I guess, through that music. Are you hopeful for what's next? Musically? UK, London? Yeah, UK. Do you feel like... The lineage that has come to you through Sound Systems and Jungle and Soul to Soul and all of those other things that are there like titans in the background, do you feel like that's being passed down or is it kind of being dissipated? It's being passed down because it's people like me doing our thing, so technically it is. as long as I'm still doing it and a few others but I think I don't think a lot of it is being continued a lot of like their approach or the kind of ethos the morals the the like respect for it and the love like people have different love and passions for it but I think that coming from that lineage I think it's getting a bit lost a bit fizzled out. There's a few of us, you know, pioneering for it and stuff. But people will come back around there. I mean, there are people like, you know, when Mala goes to do his weekend with Dub Chasm in Bristol and they get Congo Natty and old reggae sound systems and stuff together and they're really trying to bring it together. I mean, does it work if it's kind of... like people are going this is this is all part of one lineage or does it have to grow naturally i think it's really important to i think you can't i think it's important to touch base with like the foundations with the legends with the with the the creators every now and then um but like to pay homage respect to also check in and like guidance and stuff and to I don't know. I think it's really important. I think you're not going to be able to progress unless you... I just think a respect thing. I don't know. Again, because I came up under Jazzy and my dad. Two people that probably gave me the most DJ or three people that gave me all my DJ tips and stuff. uh guidance was like jazzy b h b and dj blakey um he just taught me like the basics but them not taught me about like warming up people and stuff like that and a lot of that my generation don't acknowledge like yesterday someone was posting on twitter but the deep you responded as well warm up djs man and a lot of them that have that so i've got this like old like respect elders thing with the art form with the elders themselves I said that was bad advice it was terrible advice terrible advice you'll see the tweet terrible advice what was the advice it was like it was like I can't remember but it was just so disrespectful unicorn it was if you're the warm up DJ you should just smash it out but this was from DJ Carnage right yeah He's a hard style DJ though. He's an EDM DJ, isn't he? He's like a Guatemalan hard style DJ. He's from one of those scenes where people are just like 150 BPM pounders from beginning to end of the night. But just seeing the thread, just seeing other people interacting with it and then people doing like taking the piss, having their little tweets afterwards, you still got the idea like... But those of us who, I was, I think I was an odd one out being a young person who was like, nah, man, you can still, you need to respect the warm-up slot. You need to not step on their toes or blah. it's a different game now. Not everyone has, the values haven't been passed down, basically. But the conversation is happening and that is, you know, that I thought, I thought it was a really interesting illustration of the differences and links between different scenes and stuff. You could actually map it out if you were to trace that whole conversation. there were different people from different genres that cross-interacting you don't usually get that a lot because people kind of interact with people in their own scene but that kind of hit everyone everyone because I saw it I was like what the fuck is this and I just went in you were like the first comment I saw back to it and I was looking for people yeah yeah yeah I was like what the fuck is this I'd never heard of that dude before I was like what the fuck is this someone commented I was like what the fuck fuck? And I was like, nah man, that's terrible advice. And it's actually a bit dumb as well, like, what the fuck? You gave very diplomatic response. Yeah, do you know what I'm saying? I tried my best. I was like, fuck. You know what I mean? But Frost, I mean, same question to you. Do you feel optimistic in the sense that, because you've always remained within drum and bass, like as opposed to Shai, who kind of exists within these various, you know, scanned across these different worlds. But do you feel like what's happening in drum and bass now is respectful to the past, is handing on values? Yeah, I think it totally is. I think it totally is because the jungle, jungle is so strong. Do you know what I mean? It is so strong. No matter what genre of drum and bass comes out, it always gets dominated by jungle. Always. And people, even the people coming up now. they've learnt the basic respect values of the jungle scene and people live by that. You can always get the odd idiot, you know what I mean? But people, by and large, live by the code. And, I mean, your sets completely contain that as well. I mean, you know, I saw you play for the first time in a while the other weekend and... Just talking of structuring DJ sets and, you know, not pounding it out for pounding it out's sake, you know, you took it up, you took it down, you had soul, you had dance, all those elements in there. I like to take it on the journey because people, you bang them out, people just, you know, you can't, you've got to take it easy on them sometimes. and just kind of get a breather and then go back up again. And that's all I like to do. Do you know what I mean? But were you conscious about sort of wanting to represent all of those elements that make it up? I'm kind of conscious about it, but only if the record's good. You know what I mean? The content has got to be right. Do you know what I mean? If the content's not right, I'm not representing Jack. Do you know what I'm saying? I'm representing good content, good music made with integrity. You understand what I'm saying? People making good music. I don't give a fuck if you're famous, if you're not. Some famous people are making shit, right? They think, oh, mate, you've lost it. Do you hear? And I just have to fucking let you go until you come back on track. Do you know what I'm saying? It happens. Do you know what I mean? For me, it's all about the content. Yeah. I mean, it was, as Michael Reilly said in the intro to Bass Mids Tops, you know, when reggae sound systems first kind of started adopting soul and hip hop. in the 80s, which is what became that kind of, that soul-to-soul thing. You know, the decisions, ultimately, he, he as a roots reggae guy was really concerned about this. He was like, these guys are selling out, they're trying to be American. And then he realized, no, this is sound system values. What matters is, does this sound good on my sound system? That's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. Cool. Well, the future's, I don't know about bright, because the world is burning, but you know. The future's bright, because music will heal us. Yeah. What have you two guys got coming up? I know, Frost, you've got a record coming out, which is not a regular occurrence. I've got a record called Miss Jones coming out. It's just like fucking a monster. It's telling the story of a monster at the moment. I'm working on that album at the moment. When's that happening? It should be ready by June, I reckon. Do you know what I mean? And Shai? I have got a bunch of tunes coming out on compilations next year and a collaboration with Yeji coming out on her mixtape as well. I will have a solo project for next year as well and hopefully get some of the unreleased material I'm sitting on with Victoria Sin out there as well. Wicked. And the Spoons EP, as we're reaching end of 2019, we have to flag up as one of the highlights. Because a lot of what I've been writing about is how the British character emerges from the traditions of sound system culture. And you can't get more British than an EP about Weatherspoons. And for real, just thinking about it, I haven't listened to it in ages. But just like... I suppose this combo, it's a shameless plug, but check it out if you found this conversation interesting because I feel like that EP really tied together all of my history and where I came from. Web of Spoons, yeah? Yeah, man. It was like a grimy EP conjured in Web of Spoons, sampling armors. Jamal talking about police brutality in London and yeah it's a mixture of everything we've just been chatting about yeah in this day and age super well look I think we've tied an awful lot of threads together tangled threads but you know we got there so thank you so much for your time both of you peace everyone man ♪ ♪ Real body.
