Welcome to reality. Hey, my name is Gabriel Sutton I'm a contributor to Resident Advisor. And for this edition of The Exchange, I'll be chatting over the phone with Grimes. Grimes might not need a lot of introduction at this stage. She's a standout, not just for owning an original sound and being an outspoken champion of outsider art, but a rare case of a committed techno geek who doubles up as a household name. There's a good deal of surface noise that clouds what Grimes does and who she is, so this conversation is a way to cut through that a little bit and hear directly from the artist. Over the next hour, Grimes will talk about her evolving relationship to electronic music, give some clarified thoughts about the future of live performance, hint towards a Lost Nightcore album, and explain It's been a love of burial that you might have just heard reading about in the news lately. Grimes is coming up next. It looks like you've been finding different ways to get your voice heard recently. You've done podcasts on science, you've got a Radio 1 residency. We're going to have this chat now specifically about dance music and web cultures. Do you feel like you want to re-situate yourself or re-establish a connection to certain things that have got lost along the way? Oh yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I feel like I'm kind of constantly, you know, I don't know if it's a gendered thing or just that like, the press is primed to go for controversy but it's um you know i feel like i'm like constantly kind of fighting this battle against like a weird narrative um you know or like a few weird narratives that i i mean it's probably i mean it's more exciting to focus on like you know the dramas of my personal life and whatnot i suppose but but um it's like annoying because it's like i uh, that's not really, I don't really seek that stuff out. That just, that just sort of happens to me. Um, you know, so it's just kind of like, I'm trying to be an artist out here, but it, it is definitely, but yeah, that's kind of why I'm trying to pursue things that are more, um, geared towards an audience that is more into deep listening and that kind of thing. Yeah. I do kind of do both. So it is in this weird uncanny valley that I think is very confusing to people. You know, like I just, I always sort of like gets, you know, I know I bring this up a lot, but like I'm constantly referred to as a. as a singer like oh the singer grimes um and i you know that really just rubs me the wrong way because i feel like singing is sort of my least developed skill of like everything that i do it's just sort of like uh i just don't really identify as like a singer but it's like no matter what you do that's kind of like what the headlines say so it's just sort of like a But yeah, no, it is weird. I mean, I don't know if you know Caroline Polachek, who used to be, but like she said something once where it's like, if you're a singer, it's like people like really, really struggle to see you as like a producer and that kind of thing. And I think that's definitely true. Or like. at least with female artists. Yeah. Which is funny in her case as well, because she has all these amazing records of ambient and field recordings under CEP, and she does all this wonderful stuff on the side, and yet it's the singer from Chairlift, or it's the... Yeah, and it's, yeah, I can see where you're coming from. Let's go into granular... detail about the electronic music that you like today that you liked in the past how it makes its way to you what catches your ear and also how you um interact with that after it's left an imprint on you whether there's a decision to fold it into your oeuvre to try your hand at making different kinds of electronic music or if you just kind of add it all up and ball it into something down the line cool um i don't know i mean For me, I just don't, I started making electronic music almost out of convenience because I don't play instruments. And as I said, I'm like not a good singer. And I really believe in like studio magic. Like I really, like I'm like, why would I practice the violin for like seven years when I could just, you know. play a little bit play some notes and comp them together and like auto-tune them and like make them sound pretty and you know like cheat essentially although I don't see it as cheating because like it's it's a different kind of um knowledge that is required to you know take someone who's a terrible violin player and make them sound good But yeah, for me, electronic music is just really the world of infinite possibilities. Like sound design is a huge part of how I compose. Like, you know, I think people sort of undervalue the tools that anyone has at their disposal at any given time when they're like making stuff. It's like, you know, Mozart is very defined by the tools that like Mozart had. or whatever you know and so it's just like yeah and the other thing is electronic music there's like all these people it like all these weird engineers and rooms making like weird plugins and stuff like it's so cool like you know to just like the the way the kind of culture around it um is developing and like there's kind of like always new weird stuff that you can get And it's fun when you find out some weird new plugin and you're like, ooh, it just sort of creates chaos. And you can use it to make a bit of chaos and sculpt that into something that sounds more recognizable music. There's just a lot of possibility. You know, there's something that seems to be a... dominant theme within the history of electronic music and especially within rave culture is that the human voice is often the least essential element it gets depersonalized and treated like flubber stretched and broken down it's rarely allowed to leave but you were someone that um your voice into the front of the music that you make as well as creating these kind of ethereal bedrocks of sound you have to use your voice so how do you kind of make that dialogue work for you well I feel like well first of all I kind of want to like challenge your first point like I even though that like there's sort of this um like there is this weird sort of vocal anonymity, I can never say that word, in electronic music that I've often thought about. I've often been like, why doesn't it matter who the vocalists are? Like, why don't I know who's singing this song? Like, you know, like, but at the same time, I still feel like a lot of electronic music, like the vocals are really important. um it's just it it's this weird egoless kind of uh it just doesn't function like pop music which which is like interesting and i don't necessarily know why that's the case but like if you look at something like burial for example who's like one of my all-time favorite artists like the vocals and burials music are like super super important and just because they're like sampled or warped or displaced i don't think makes them less uh crucial to what that music is it's just it's just a different format um you know and it's almost like like i was thinking about this the other day with like meme culture like how like no one knows who's who like every time I get a meme, I'm like, I don't know who fucking made this meme. Like, it's just like, it's like this weird art form that like does not have authorship at the core of it. Like it's just, which is unusual. Like in today's, in the current society that we live in, like it's like people just are obsessed with authorship. Like we're a very like ego, like individualist driven society. And so I think it's like really cool whenever that like doesn't exist it's sort of like an interesting it's almost more similar to like has always been like it's like you know like when we see like like I don't know ancient art and stuff like we don't know who made any of this art you know it's just human art and there's something kind of like interesting about removed authorship you know, and a lot of times when you hear like a pop song, like the person singing didn't write the song anyway, like the person who's credited with the song, like it's, I don't know. It's like authorship is sort of like an interesting thing. And I, I think like in the last, like. However, since contemporary pop culture has been a thing, we've come to be like, oh yes, this song by this person. But that's not really how art has been historically. And I don't think it needs to be that way. And I think there's a lot of vocals and electronic music that are sort of anonymous. even in dance music i typically prefer vocals to no vocals um you know or you and you like it's rare not rare but it's like there's usually like even like some vocals even if it's just like you know extremely minimal like yeah I don't know it's like I actually I love dance music and I probably like relate to dance music producers the most but it is I guess I don't actually make music that sounds like that very much and vocals are very central and ego is very central to my music obviously so it like Burial was a really interesting point that you brought up because obviously you know he's in a a whole other plane of genius but what seemed to be the thing that he latched on to was the importance of the siren song quote-unquote vocals that are used in rave music and that as you say, it doesn't necessarily, you don't need to know who the singer is, but when a swooping vocal comes in at the peak of a rave and puts everyone's hairs on their arms up, that's the most essential part of that. The cresting point of the DJ set. And you don't need to know who that singer is or what they look like, even if they're real or if that's modulated or sample, but that is. the DJ or the producer dropping like a weapon of peace that vaporizes everyone's minds. And it's funny that you said authorship is more transient in dance music. It's not something I'd really considered, but it's both central and not, and it's essential, but also de-essentialized in the person who's actually there. It's quite interesting. Yeah, no, and it's also, yeah, no, that's true. It's like in, when you're like. out and like you haven't heard vocals in half an hour and then suddenly someone drops something that is like really vocally oriented like it is incredible like and it's sort of interesting how the absence of that is used to like build up the narrative of a set or something or like create this like awesome moment at like at some point when when you finally do get something and and yeah I don't know. Like most of my favorite dance songs are like, do have kind of like a. vocal like i like i guess it's probably kind of an old song now but like the the song stay with me by chris lake i like it's just like a perfect like to me that's one of the best songs ever created and because it's in this like weird zone where it's like it's just like a truly incredible pop song or like an enya kind of thing and it has just like the craziest drop Like it just feels like I don't know that that song just feels like right in the middle of so many things to me. And it's like a lot of it is because of the vocal. I saw that you DJed in February at a club called Ronda, I think, just before Going Out was shut down. And I think you played that Chris Lake song. And you also played the Tiesto remix of Delirium, which is another really good example of big... Am I right or am I wrong on that? No, you're right. I'm just embarrassed by it. Or not embarrassed. Oh, okay, that's it. I mean, whatever. Anyway, yeah. And the Solwax edit of Mary Davidson, these are all really good examples. You know, these are like full fat rave tunes, but have a vocal at the heart of them. And I guess that gives it its humanity as well as its pulse. Yes. I actually found out from Errol Alkin that I think he said you closed with a Gummy Bears theme tune at that DJ set before he came on. Is that right? No, I closed with The Hamster Dance. Which is like a really underrated song. The Hamster Dance is really fucking good. Like, it's an incredible song, actually. But yes. I quite like looking at shards and fragments of what people picked up that was in that feature set. You've had stuff like... Bio, obviously, who's one of your collaborators, and Hannah, but also Mugrav and Sharda and Asquith, and these pretty credible, big contemporary rave tunes. And then kind of meme culture dance music overlaps, like the Hamster Dance. I guess you don't really have... I guess your perceptions of like what is quote unquote credible or not are completely skewed compared to what most people would like to dictate is cool or not. And that gives you like a different edge. Yes. Well, I do feel like my DJ set kind of like, I sort of have nothing left to lose. Like after that, what happened? Oh yeah. The boiler room incident. Yeah, like after the Boiler Room incident, I mean, I do love being in a situation where there's really nothing left to lose. I don't necessarily have a lot of dignity as a DJ. I do actually love doing just like a really hard techno set, but Grams fans do not react well to that. And every time I try, it's like people just seem stressed out. So I sort of give up on that. I mean, the thing is that there are just always songs that just people like will always love, even in the snobbiest situation. And like, even when they like say they're going to be mad about it or think they're going to be mad about it, like they still enjoy the hamster dance. So it's sort of like a, I don't know. I actually do love snobbery and dance music, but I also, I like trolling it because it like, it's some of the maddest people have ever been at me is like, if like playing pop music in the wrong club, like, oh damn. I actually worked at Boiler Room for five years just after you'd done your stint in Ibiza. And constantly, every single month, people were constantly asking us to... uploads the set and to like what's going on with it and can we see part of it and it was like this it built into this myth as if it was like the godhead of trolling in dance culture and it really people really were like desperate to see just how bad it was or just how like how hard just just how hard you were sticking your finger in the eye of dance culture and it was He's just having fun. Yeah, I know. The thing that's funny is, like, I just didn't think it was that serious. Like, I was so at the time, I barely knew what Boiler Room was. I hadn't, Richie was just like, hey, do you want to DJ tomorrow? I was like, sure, I'll, like, figure out, like, I'll, like, put some songs in a playlist right now that I like. Like, and I had no idea while I was it was a troll or that like it would be upsetting to people i was literally just like it's a beach party like it's a nice day like yay like i had no i was extremely shocked by the response but maybe we should release it one day. I don't know. There was a DJ that played two years ago loads of Christmas songs at the height of July at a festival and everyone was like, oh, so shocking, so transgressive, you're so clever, who possibly could pull this off? And in the back of my mind I was like, hmm. already and it didn't go down so well for her. I remember I think it was DJ Snake who did "All I Want for Christmas is You" by Mariah Carey and I was like, "I did that first." But also that song is fucking incredible and everybody loves it no matter what time of year. I feel like there was a similar reaction to when you started talking about the beloved genre of Nightcore and you put out a Nightcore edit of We Appreciate Your Power and you boosted some Nightcore edits of Art Angel. And I felt like people's reception to that was maybe similar, that some people felt like it was tongue-in-cheek and that you were doing it to be transgressive or confrontational somehow, and maybe just couldn't wrap themselves around your perspective and felt like it was a parlor game if you're trying to stunt on people by being clever, but it just seemed like that stuff... that you enjoyed and wanted to get to more eardrums. Well, yeah, no, I actually think Nightcore is, I love Nightcore. And I actually have like problems if I spend too much time listening to Nightcore where I like can't return to regular music. It's like a weird, it's like actually like literally like at moments a problem. Like, especially when I'm making music and I'm just like, but if I pitched everything up and sped it up, it'll sound better. And then I'm like, ugh. I can't just be releasing. I have a whole Nightcore album that I made. Oh my God. We're we've like considered releasing, but then I keep being like, like, would it be a huge problem if I released a Nightcore album? But what was I going to say? Yeah. don't like nightcore like i just love nightcore like i just honestly think it's extremely euphoric um yeah i i think it's a great uh genre um you know with with with the new album i actually expected it to be more um in line with the fringe taste that you have because the some of the collaborations that you've done over the years, like Bring Me The Horizon and putting out Nightcore Edits and speaking up these pretty out-there genres. I was quite surprised that you didn't lean into that super hard and that the album came out quite dark and quite intense and quite restrained, but not like... sounding quick or really, really like chipped and distorted. And it's interesting that you say that you had to kind of stop yourself from going too hard into that because normal music, quote unquote, would feel... flat somehow if you spent too long dancing around in the euphoric tropes um do you find that happens a lot do you spend a lot of time digging into one sound and then kind of putting it on the shelf or leaving it on the cutting room floor yeah definitely i definitely i i i get in like a weird mood and then do like go heavy into a certain energy and then i like react really like right now I'm in this zone where I'm like I never want to touch a fucking guitar ever again like which is crazy like I feel like a few months ago I was just or sort of like a few years ago I was just like I was like I'm done with synths I'll never touch another synthesizer like you know I was just like oh like I couldn't stand it like the idea of making anything like you know, more proper electronic music at all was just like, I was just like, never again, you know? And, but then I just like went too far with guitars and stuff. And now I'm just like, just like, I cannot listen to any guitar music. I'm like super, I guess that's just. I don't know. I just get too... I go too far down rabbit holes, I guess. You know. But, I mean, I just didn't want to make... I don't, I feel like it's very easy to be like, Grime should be more PC music. And I was like, oh, like I could follow this route, but I feel like I should react against PC music right now because that's like the least expected thing probably. So I think that was kind of like, that's not like why I did that, but you know. I was just sort of like, what can I do that will be subversive to the expectation, I guess. Not that, I mean, here I am saying I don't always do things to be subversive to the expectation, but I guess I do. I don't know. I don't know what I'm saying. I actually saw a quote that came out. kind of flippant from CharlieXCX saying that you would work like on a techno slammer with her and then one of you two was like wait hold on shouldn't we make a pop song instead and that you kind of have to juggle these expectations of what you should quote unquote or shouldn't do and it's like expectation management within the micro of your career and the macro of the world outside it's more Well, yes, no, actually, that does totally make sense. But it's more that me and Charlie could, we could create a really obtuse, like, extremely experimental song that's kind of hard to listen to. but it would be fun to just, I mean, we have a concept. We just have a concept for a pop song. That's like an incredible concept. I guess I don't want to spend too long on the flexibility of taste, but I do find it really interesting. You can kind of swerve between lanes without really minding about it so much. the most recent Radio 1 show that you did a few days ago. You had the KLF and you had Traversable Wormhole, which is an Adam X project. And then you also had Semisonic and Kim.com, the Mega Upload founder. And I think that kind of track list is pretty much impossible for any other DJ on Radio 1 to ever get away with in its history. But for you, you put it all in the bracket of time-related music and it worked. And that's quite endearing to be able to have that freedom. But is it actually, like people, I feel like people just make constraints in their mind. You know what I mean? Everyone's like, oh, but who else can get away with it? It's like, well, anyone can get away with it because anyone can do anything because free will, we have free will. well, that's an arguable statement, but you know what I mean? It's like, it's like taking risks is creatively is almost always rewarded. And sometimes in the short term, it is not rewarded, but it is almost always rewarded in the longterm. And, you know, I think people get stressed because of the potential short-term repercussions, but it's like most artists that are truly great take risks all the time. Yeah, there's I think a guy called Matt Dryhurst, whose partner is Holly Herndon. he terms it metadata so our musical preferences and social habits form this cartoon brain cloud above our heads that trails us and tells others from a distance who we are is that what you were getting at yeah yeah yeah no exactly that's an interesting way of putting it um i like that that's cool yeah no i just want like brand like everyone has their you know that's much less a much less fun way to say it but it's like everyone has their personal brand and it's like can't do this and can't break the brand and like blah blah blah that kind of stuff I don't know I just think it's important to not get too wrapped up in your identity because that's kind of I almost feel like that's sort of like what's wrong with the world right now is everyone gets so wrapped up in their identity that they're, you know, it's like more important to like, like this thing equals good, this thing equals bad. And therefore I will like, without thinking, like fight for certain things and discard nuance. And I think that's a dangerous place to be. One thing that I've noticed on the Misanthropocene album cycle is an extension of giving parts of yourself away. In the past, you boosted bedroom remixes that people have sent you, and you released a sample pack a few years ago. But now you've done something similar for art so that people can make their own renders and avatars and DIY videos. Do you go out of your way to put the tools in other people's hands? Oh, yeah. I mean, I'm just like, I'm so into sampling. And I just think it's so, I hate like the lawsuit with the blurred lines and like all this stuff. Like I hate how it's like been changing music. Like, you know, I just think sampling, although. I guess there's a lot of incredible music being made that like, because people are reticent to sample at the moment, I don't know that it is making some cool stuff, but like, I just like. I don't know. Again, going back to Burial or something, it's just so much my favorite music is sample-oriented. Anytime anyone's ever illegally used my music, I've not tried to get money from them or followed up. I'm just like, whatever, sample my music. I don't care. It's cool. I think it's weird for people to think they own art. you know, I think art is, I think patents, copyright, all this stuff is like not great for like the overall conversation. It is like shitty when someone like makes something and then just gets totally robbed though. Like, and like dies poor. Like that's. fucked up so it's like i don't know it's like a tricky conversation um but i just like personally i think people should just use my art however they want like i know my label takes stuff down sometimes like i personally think people should i don't know i'm honored if anyone ever uses anything i made um you know and like yeah I don't know I kind of just want to release like all the stems ever and like kind of thing like I really don't care um I really believe like sampling and stuff and like so many like me getting stems from other people you know ostensibly to like I'll be like oh I'll remix the song when I'm like yes got the stems and then I like never remix the song just because I love their stems or whatever but But, you know, it's like we find really good samples in like other people's stuff, too. And like, you know, I don't know. I just think art should be more free. And also I do get like an excessive amount of incredible like fan art, I guess. I don't I feel like the word fan is sort of a weird demeaning term, like because it sort of like makes it. like it's even like fan art makes it sort of seem like less legitimate or something somehow so like I don't want to like use that word necessarily but for lack of a better word um and so I was just like you know like people just make so much good stuff like there's only the video team me and my video team is only there's only three of us it's me and my brother Mac and our friend Neil. And it's like, like delete forever was like a month of insane work. And we're like, okay, like we shot all these green screen stuff. Like we're not going to do this. Like we might as well just like put it out for people. Like it's like, you know, I don't like, it'll be like a year and a half from now by the time we've done all these videos. So. You just touched on something that I found quite interesting that it was like a month or for one song or for one thing. And yet some people come up with a bounce down remix of one of your songs or a piece of fan art or a twist of your video and do it in half an hour and it stand up just as well. I wonder if you have any kind of... ceiling that you put on the amount of work you put into one thing i think you remember you had like 40 or 50 layers of drums on kill versus main which seems excessive um i went way too far out with that song way too do you ever give yourself time out is there is there ever a point where you get your limb and you go i just can't keep pushing over that well just the kind of you said in the very early days that you kind of were ADD in your process. I wonder if that means you never really have that edge and you can constantly run off the edge of the universe and pull yourself back from it. Stuff where I don't go crazy is just sometimes I go crazy. It just depends on what the project is. Kill V. Mame was this unwieldy mess that I knew it could be great. I was like, I know this can be great. It just depends on the song. Some songs... It's when you're doing something new. I feel like 4AM on my new album was kind of similar. Like it's like when it's something that just like there isn't a good template in the culture, like there isn't a good song where I'm like, oh, I can mix to that song or something. That's when it can kind of start taking a really long time because I'm like, there's no when I don't have a good sonic reference point, then it just starts getting crazy because then you're just kind of like. battling yourself i guess uh whereas like like a song that like where i'm like oh this sounds kind of similar to this song like then i can kind of like mix it a bit you know i'm like okay like those kinds of drums tend to work like whatever you know it's a bit easier it's much easier or you know like sometimes you just throw something together in an hour like the song with io violence like literally i just sat down made the demo and in like an hour and then we just put that out you know it's like if you feel like you're creating a world that has no precedent that's when you start driving yourself to the edge because you feel like it's on you to create that world is that kind of what you're saying yeah yeah like when you're just doing yeah when you're making something with no precedent then you're um yeah you're just you don't know well and you just you it's an unclear when to stop too because you know like with kill the meme like there were points where i was like well this is good but it's not quite like, I just want it to still be like a banger. And that was kind of like where I was like, I still need to like, if I want this to be like a banger, I need to like, and also like, I mean, guitars, when you try to add guitars, like that's just a whole other ball game, especially because guitars and female vocals are like. You know, electric guitar and female vocals are in a very similar range of like where they feel good. Like, you know, and they're really fighting each other. Like that's just an engineering nightmare, I guess, specifically. And then you want to add like kind of like dance drums and stuff under it. Then it just starts getting like. Never again. Never again will I go back. Well, that's not true. You have total control over your material in the studio and live and the aesthetic. you are like a single world builder and obviously everything stems from you. Does that require the need to have like absolute trust in your visions? Let's say, do you ever get a co-pilot or is it all 100% gut feeling and an understanding of when to give and go? have like a weird hubris for some reason uh i i just don't question it really um i i don't know i just don't feel artistically self-conscious i guess like i i I was thinking about this the other day. I don't know why. I just don't feel, I don't know. I feel like reasonably confident. Like I just don't question. I don't know. I don't know. It's odd. That's interesting. Cause I've seen you, I've seen you say that. to pull up an example, the original reality was, oh, it was poorly recorded and it was a mess and it was never meant to be heard by anyone. Or you've even got a caveat on the Radio 1 show apologising for your lisp. But that, to me, doesn't sound like hubris. That sounds like you're being very considerate and polite. It doesn't sound hubristic at all to me. I might feel underconfident about things like... after the fact, but when I'm making stuff, I feel very confident, I guess. Like if I'm just like, yeah, when I'm like in the studio, I'm not like, oh no, do I need help with this? I'm just kind of like, okay. Like, I don't know. I just sort of like know what to do. I mean. Which is definitely contradictory to how I behave because I definitely get nervous at times around other people. I don't know. But I do want to start working with more people, though. Part of the reason I've been working alone mostly was being on an independent label and stuff. It's like, why would you go spend a bunch of money making an album? And then because there's a very finite amount of resources, like when you can make an album on your own. I mean, I'm always it's always the interplay with the music videos. I'm like, I'm like, let's just save the whole budget for the music videos. And I'll just do all the all the music on my own. And then that way we can like have like more kind of like major label level music videos, I guess. Because I really, I love making music videos and that's like a huge part of the whole game for me. So that's been like a huge motivator for not having collaborators. I'd like to ask about physical experiences. You know, you've been a touring musician for 10 years plus in all kinds of settings. art spaces, up to festivals, and you're more at peace with the supersized crowds and supersized audacity of EDM, you can more or less walk into any setting of your choosing. So what does the idea look like to you? Honestly, DJing anonymously is the way to go. Like when you DJ, like when people know it's me, then like there's always a bunch of... people who come and sort of stare and don't dance and it's like uncomfortable and sort of, I honestly, I just like going to things anonymously or like DJing anonymously. Like it's, it's fun to not be grimes. Like, because when you're, when you're like performing, performing, like if people know you're there, like it is just more, you know. And like there can be like pictures and like, like my favorite experiences in the live realm are just like straight up being just a fan or DJing, but like not DJing as anything anyone knows or whatever. Like, or just DJing for my friends, parties with my friends or whatever. Is that partly why the concept of Burning Man is appealing? Because it kind of depersonalizes everyone. And it's so big that you can really be... Because sometimes you go out and people will realize you're there and then that's a thing. But at Burning Man, you can just disappear. It is really incredible. It's like if stuff gets weird somewhere, you just bike for an hour and then be somewhere else. I really like that. I really like the lack of any corporate... stuff it's also kind of the best sci-fi environment the just the scale of it is so like beautiful like wait like like you can just bike for hours and hours and hours and it never ends like it's just like really does sort of feel like a science fiction city or something like it's just like It's kind of like a real life MMORPG. Yeah, yeah. It's like a weird video game. I'm like, oh, this is like what the world could be like. I don't know what the world could actually be like. But, you know, you really start to notice. I'm like, man, like you really notice like sound restrictions and lighting restrictions in cities when you're in a place that is functionally a city that doesn't have any of those things. Society could definitely be less repressed aesthetically. It's really annoying that you can't just like... Anyway, I'm not going to go on about like sound restrictions in urban areas. But yeah. Yeah, I mean, you've mentioned countless interviews about the world trending towards a more photoshopped, polished, hemmed in, homogenous version of itself. I guess... Burning Man is a big stab to the heart of that. Whether you kind of consider it cool or not, it does basically upend. society's norms and rules and top them on on its head and then you kind of go from there and reshape it in your own way which is quite interesting it's an experiment of how things could be as you say i like where society's going to that like i do think there's but i don't think it's all bad like i don't say i don't say that necessarily that stuff necessarily in a critical way it's more of just an observational way you know i i think it's always destructive the kind of like quote unquote the kids these days argument is like never the kids are probably onto the right thing you know you know what i mean like it's like just because something feels potentially destructive or like is it bad that everyone's living as their idealized self on like instagram and stuff like is it bad that they're using facetune or is that like helping people overcome anxieties. I don't know. Like, I'm not, like, I'm not saying one way or the other, but I just, like, things that people might point out and be like, that's definitely bad. Like, I don't know if that's necessarily true. Like, it's like, what's the difference between that and, like, living as an avatar in a video game and like, you know, like living as an avatar in a video game, like allows you to overcome like the things that in the physical world might be a hindrance. Like it's dumb, but it's like things in the physical world are like, like hinder people like socially and emotionally and like make people like isolated and stuff. It's like, if you like, don't look right or something or. I don't know, like, it's like people, like, treat you badly. And it's like, maybe, I don't know, maybe living in a hyper digitized space allows people to just, like, you see, there's so much stuff that you like the masked singer or like the voice or like. blind blind what's that show on Netflix like blind love or something where they're like they they date but they don't ever see each other then they have to get married and it's like people are obviously really obsessed with like not having to look how they look you know like people obviously feel like incredible tension about like how we judge people based on how they look so like maybe like a super digitally distorted photoshopped or completely digital avatar future is actually a good thing that will like democratize, allow people to just be who they are, like without having to, you know, they'll be able to surpass how they were born, I guess. Like, I don't know. I'm going on a real tangent here. No, you know, it's been on everyone's minds in the last. uh gosh month month or two we're pretty much all confined to our homes at this point in time in the middle of a pandemic and we're all living through our screens and human contact has kind of been put on ice and put into a cryogenic deep freeze right now so if ever there was a time to truly explore that possibility and see what happens it's now because we can't really go outside and see other people at the moment um this is the time when we are kind of getting sucked into or subliminally creating avatars for ourselves for the next three six nine months it's hard to say this is like that in action. Nine months. God, let it not go on. Yeah, you know, I'm talking from a UK perspective. We're not doing so well. But yeah, you know, who knows? We might have to not see each other do Thanksgiving or Christmas. And if so, then we are living as avatars on the internet and we are kind of constructing our... augmented reality of ourselves for 2020 that's going to be the year where we all moved out of the physical realm potentially it could be it really could be you know the album this year is a play on misanthropy as a concept um would you find the world more palatable if there was more of a shift towards living partially through our screens or partially in real life. It's kind of always hard to understand where you personally, outside of what purely interests you or kind of what tickles the curiosity of how things could be, what your personal stance on this is and where you would feel most comfortable. People like... People are always trying to be like, oh, this is what she means. And my vibe is more like, I'm pretty open-minded. I'll change my opinion on something 50 times. I'll be like, yeah, we all need to live in the Ready Player One future. And then I'll decide, no, actually, the internet is the scourge of modernity. And we should all live in the real world only. And then I'll like... end up somewhere in between. I don't know if I have an opinion per se, or like my opinion is definitely extremely fluid. I feel like my art is very amoral, but people think that it's very moralizing, which is fine. You know, it's like people can interpret my art however they want to. But, yeah, I'm definitely not necessarily trying to propose a worldview necessarily. You know what I mean? Like, it's like, it's more that I'm observing, I guess, you know, like, especially something like climate change. It's as a mainstream concept, it's kind of new. Like, obviously, it's been around for like, people are have been aware of it for a while. But as something that like. people are starting to actively care about in their everyday life. Like that's like a newer thing. And, or like any of the things I like topics I broach in the, in the album, like I think it's sort of like interesting to approach something that has so much moralizing around it from an amoral perspective. you know, like, I think that's sort of like always a worthwhile task to like abstract something from the emotion of its current state. Like I'll have, it's not that I'm without opinions, but it's, but my opinions are too fluid for me to say like, this is what I feel like forever and ever. Amen. Kind of thing. Just that kind of. get exposed harshly with the debate last year about your views at the time on the obsolescence of live music or the timeline of where we shift out of the touring realm. Is that something that's changed or is that something that was taken? fragmented conversation and blown up. That was definitely a kind of like a semi-joke that got taken a bit too far. I was definitely just kind of like... I don't know, I was just sort of like making an offhand comment that was more just kind of like, I don't know, I guess I was just being cheeky, I guess. And like, you know, I like, I had never, live music might, and I don't know, maybe now it seems maybe foreshadowing of the current situation, but I don't know. I mean, we might get to, I mean, I don't think this will be the worst pandemic we deal with. in the next even, like, 10 or 20 years. I mean, this isn't even terrorism. This is just natural. Like, we are very close to people being able to download and synthesize viruses. Shit could definitely be way crazier. Like, we could definitely get into a situation where we are quarantined for, like... much longer and much more strictly i don't know it's it's interesting i don't know if live stuff will ever be obsolete i think people love people um you know uh there is obviously a magic like i was actually just watching the marshmallow fortnight concert last night because i'd never seen it and i was like man i wonder what the marshmallow fortnight concert is like and i was like cool and ridiculous like will concerts change over to this i doubt it um but also like the coronavirus thing is really exposing the fragility of civilization it's like maybe like gatherings in the way that we've been doing them like could become obsolete that's not like totally out of the question Yeah. You know, so, yeah. I think we will become maybe more acclimatized to deriving a thrill from what we find kind of uncommon at the moment. Like, to take an example, when I saw you on the Art Angels tour at Glastonbury. the audience enjoyment was tied to the um the empathy of watching you do it all yourself you know watching a person be a person play the synth sing lead the dances you were kind of a whirlwind of activity and if you weren't there that spark would be lost. But then you go and see a Patsune Miku thing. And that spark comes from a different place. One of intrigue that the performer is not physical, but they're being beamed in from another realm. And it's kind of hard to say which of those two is the best because they're both. different experiences that are kind of awe-inspiring in their own way. And as you say, maybe things will shift in five to 10 years where we'll be a bit more in between those two things rather than one being the norm and one being an outlier. Yeah, well, I mean, I think technology will make things that aren't technically live a lot more palatable too. Like Hatsune Miku is like really well done. Um, and like, I, you know, I think all that stuff, like the next 10 or 15 years, it'll become more common and it'll, it'll get better. You know, it's like the thing with technology is it always gets better. And like, you know, like, like things that seem crazy can, you know, 10 or 10 years later become like incredible and normal. You know, like we all. have computers on our phones now, which, you know, like 15 years ago would have seemed, seemed like weird science fiction. I mean, I just don't think art is rankable. Like when people are doing like, Oh, year end list or this or that, or like the Grammys or whatever. I'm like, it's not like any of this is quantifiable. Like it's not, and it's not like something being popular and something being makes, makes it better. Or it's not like. something being, I don't know, like, it's just, these are just, like, the whims of, like, small groups of people, like, you know, like, ranking art, I think, is basically impossible. Like, it's not, it's just, like, weird, a weird subjective thing. It's not in any way even close. to objective to do that because it's like the way we respond to art it's like an emotional response it's like a neurobiological or like hormonal response or whatever it is it that's probably based in like thousands of years of evolution so you know it's like it's like it's ultimately like it's like weird like mating calls and stuff like it's not actually science or math or something where it's like you can be like oh yes this person got 98% on the test that's like not you know a lot of the art that people love is like wildly imperfect it's been 10 years now in 2020 since you first began accruing a catalog and becoming more aware to people I wonder where you place yourself in a wider lineage of electronic music, where you situate yourself and who maybe comes off you and who are the descendants of Grimes and how you see yourself in the kind of the wider sphere of things. No, I feel like I, it would be. too like audacious to assume, presume anyone is a descendant of Grimes. I feel like I'm a descendant of like, like burial and apex twin and stuff like that. Like that, like, and maybe like animal collective. There was something about the, the Rick, the homemade feeling of like animal collective and burial and stuff. that made me feel like they don't feel musically trained and I might be wrong about that I haven't googled this or anything like they just felt like and they it's very emotional electronic music and so like that's where I feel like I come from but I would not presume to say who like comes out because I don't know if people would feel like, I don't, I don't, I don't know if I would be correct. You don't want to attach your own metadata to someone against their will. Yeah. And I also like, I feel like there's all these things that like I realize were influences on me over time that like I didn't realize at the time, you know, it's like. like you're, we're constantly absorbing information, even if we like, don't realize it. And so it's like, Like even like I think like I feel like Arcade Fire just by virtue of being in Montreal and stuff are like probably like a huge influence on me. Like even though I don't sound like that at all or you know I just feel like there's all these things that are like like probably people that might see themselves as like important in my career or like important artists in my career that like I don't even know like yeah. think a lot of people might have expected you to say oh i'm in the same family tree as 100 gex or whatever but you're aligning with three of the biggest names in modern independent music and like you say rk5 700 members and a horn section are a world away from what you do as grimes but in a way it cycles back to what you're saying at the very start about seeing music more through the lens of energy and expression and base humanity rather than genre, which makes it a pretty good place to wrap up, I reckon. Thanks so much for your time, doing this in strange and unusual circumstances, and best of luck with the family. You know, thank you for such thoughtful questions and everything. I really appreciate it. Got to have it anyway I think I might regret it now Telling my feet to the rocks and down If you don't bleed, then you don't die Cross my heart and hope to fly If you like it, then don't make it out alive
