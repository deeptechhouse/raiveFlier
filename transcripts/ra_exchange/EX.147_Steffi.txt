Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch, and I'm the Associate Editor of Resident Advisor. Steffi Doms, or Steffi as you might know her, has a very enviable position in house music. She's a resident DJ at Panorama Bar in Berlin. This put her on the radar a few years ago, and eventually paved the way for her first official mix CD, which is called comes out this month on Oscutone. But it's by no means a whole story. By the time she got the job seven years ago, she'd already had more than a decade of experience, not only as a DJ, but as a producer and label manager as well. She's seen a lot of change in club music over the years, and today possesses a very frank kind of wisdom. Chatting over tea a couple of days after a mixed release party, she gave us a glimpse of the world as Steffi sees it So you've been a resident of Panorama Bar for how long? few years? Officially since 2007. It was the first time I was 2005 when I played there but when I moved to Berlin in 2007 I was an official resident since then. So at this point I imagine you really you know you couldn't be more familiar with the club in a way. How does that affect playing there versus playing somewhere else, playing somewhere you're so familiar with? Well, you know, I think... I think one thing that I would like to point out that's very important to me is that I take every gig as serious as I do when I play at Panorama. Every gig has the same importance for me because I take DJing very serious. So it's a very serious thing for me. So I approach the gigs. in the same way but I think if a club offers you a place like they did for me like a platform, a home base where you can play every month or sometimes more than once a month you connect yourself to the people who work there and That includes the entire staff, basically, you know. And there's a lot of familiar faces after a long time, so you feel like you're definitely part of something. And that gives you a supportive feeling, definitely. I mean, somebody who puts you up for so many years every month and gives you the opportunity to do your thing, not even with the club, also with the label. That's very precious, you know. So I want to do the best I can for every gig, but I also want to, you know, for the... club I want to give my best you know if it's if it's releasing on the label or playing it club I just want to make sure that you know they get the most out of me because that's that's the way I feel that I get from them as well so yeah yeah and um you said they you know Panorama kind of gave you a home as a DJ but would you say they also kind of gave you an international presence at the same time It helped a lot. I mean, I would absolutely lie if I... if I would say that that wasn't the main influence. But for me, the most important thing to be able to move to Berlin was because of the residency. It was never the other way around. I never moved to Berlin because I wanted to live in Berlin, but because of the residency. And when I started to play there, I was able to give up my... freelance job as a graphic designer and concentrate on on making music and also concentrate on DJing You know much more than I did when I was still living in Amsterdam because I had to work during the week and it's a different kind of balance between doing your day job and being somewhere on the road on the weekend. I've played abroad before I moved to Berlin but when I made that step that was definitely internationally very useful for me, absolutely. Do you like traveling a lot, playing abroad? I like to travel a lot, but I don't like to play too many gigs a week because I feel that it should be something balanced in your life. And I think for me, it's important that I select my gigs pretty. pretty good not take everything that they offer you and I have to manage my time I need some time off to do other stuff concentrate on making music but also concentrate on my private life and I had some months where I played like every weekend three times and I instinctively said to myself like, this is not right. It doesn't feel good. I need to do less. So coming back to your question, I like to be on the road, but I don't like to overdo it and take everything I can get and play like 15 off. 14, 15 times a month. I think that's way too much. Way too much. You're becoming more like a robot. And I think that's a bit of a dangerous vibe, you know. Do you think that's kind of easy to slip into? Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. I think, like, I mean, I think the more demand there is, you know, the more you can work, basically. The more you can play. And there must be people that take everything they get on their plate. enough I mean if that's what your vibe is all about then that's good and and and I think it's easy to turn from okay, have I got enough gigs these months to make a living if DJing was your main income? And if all of a sudden you see that there's more demand, like, oh, I can make more money, that's a way of approaching it, definitely. But I think it's, as I said before, I think you should concentrate on... on the places where you want to be and the amount of gigs that you physically want to do as well. So your original connection to Panorama Bar was Andy Baumecker, right? Yeah. How did that happen exactly? Like he kind of hooked you up with the residency? Yeah, we met in Frankfurt the first time when he asked me to play. in Robert Johnson and he told me I was moving to Berlin and was starting to work for the club and he invited me to play a couple of months later and I wasn't really familiar with the club to be honest when I told a couple of friends they were more enthusiastic about it because they knew about it I didn't know about it to be very honest and and and we haven't We've only had contact through email for a longer period of time before I met him in Frankfurt, so it was a quite spontaneous thing, but it matched really well. So I ended up playing, at the end of 2005, I ended up playing in Panorama Bar with him. I kind of started from there and we were in touch like really, really often like via iChat or whatever and exchanged music and thoughts and crazy, funny shit. And yeah. Somehow I seem to be there more often in Berlin, like extended stays. And I think I play there. Every three months before I finally moved to Berlin in 2007, permanently. He had a big influence on me moving to Berlin. Not only because of the club, but more about the friendship and the vibe, really. It was quite a hectic time at the moment. We were on a fun journey, you could say. It was good. I imagine that was kind of a major turning point in your life, taking that Panorama residency. Yes. Also for my liver. I wasn't really used to drink so much schnapps. I think a lot of people who know me a little bit longer. have a couple of nice stories to tell. I was quite shocked about the German schnapps culture, basically. So I was a bit messy the first couple of months getting... Getting used to drinking schnapps after every second beer was quite hardcore, but good fun. How did you like moving to the city overall, coming from Amsterdam? Well, the thing is, when I moved... Amsterdam was kind of, for me, like being there already 10 years, basically played in every club, did my own parties, organized a lot of things, running the club nights, always active in the scene, doing the label, etc., etc. I was kind of sitting around and thinking, there's not much that I can... do that I haven't done in terms of bringing new things onto the scene. Not like, oh God, I've seen it all because that's ridiculous to say, but more like the achievement of doing new things, reaching new people. And it was a bit of a dead vibe for me for a while. That kind of made Berlin, made it so interesting because I was already 10 years in Amsterdam. And as I said, I wasn't really into Berlin. I mean, the first time when I went to Berlin was 1990, four months after the wall had opened up. And the second time was 15 years later. So I was like, that wasn't really something that was occupying my mind, basically. So it was interesting. So I moved and it was exploring a whole new place, basically. So that was very exciting in the beginning, definitely. It's kind of funny to imagine that as a DJ, there was a time when... Berlin didn't have that much of an obvious draw. You hadn't heard of Panorama Bar. Yeah, things are very different now. Yeah, that's really weird, actually. That is, no, that's actually true. Because when Andy was telling me this, I was like, yeah, cool, man, whatever. But I was not aware. of what he was doing and why he was so enthusiastic about Panorama Bar, you know. When he invited me there, when I walked into the club, I was like, hey, this reminds me of when I was young and when I went to Amsterdam and, you know, in the whole early 90s warehouse kind of vibe that they had. going on in Amsterdam, it's like, it was a lot of resemblance. So for me, that was kind of... oh, that's nice, you know. I was kind of stuck in Amsterdam and then this was the new thing that was pretty vibrant. So it was really good for me. Did you find the parties like especially good when you first got there? Well, I suppose it's a natural thing when things are new, they always feel different than the 20th, after the 20th time, basically. So, of course, yeah. You know, kid in a candy store effect when you walk in there, definitely. And Berlin as a city also. you know, you're new and you don't know your way. So you're finding new things. So everything that's, everything's interesting, basically. I think that's happening to everybody who moves into a different country, basically. Becoming a, you know, sort of professional DJ or full-time, I should say, and being a resident in Panorama Bar. Was there anything, were there any kind of like new pressures or new complications that arose from that that you, you know, weren't used to? Well, I think if you reach a point where you play a lot of international gigs, there's more attention. And especially with these new media possibilities like, I mean, like your website, obviously, has reached a lot of people lately, like a lot of people. Facebook, Twitter, any kind of new media. So basically, it's harder to... do something without people noticing what you're doing. And I'm from an, I mean, I'm going to be 40 next year, so I'm not used to growing up with a mobile phone. And I also got hooked on the whole having a mobile phone in my back kind of vibe, you know, but it's not something that I had when I was 16. So that's... For me, I see a line in life where people really switched onto... smartphones and all that sort of stuff. So I know that whenever you do something the chances of the event being registered is very big. The chances of people recording your sets, you know, talking about it on whatever kind of platform, sharing their experiences on YouTube, that's a big thing. So yeah, you are under surveillance you could say basically. And it makes it kind of, it makes it new. It's hard not to let it in. It's very hard. In the beginning, I was trying to get people out of my way who were requesting songs on their iPhone, making pictures. I'm a person that doesn't like... to have my photo taken. I was never, also not in my private life. But, you know, that's a new thing that happens to you when you play at a lot of gigs these days, you know. And that's kind of tough sometimes to communicate that it's more about the music than actually capturing certain moments, you know. And there's been some discussions going on online. People posting like, come on, guys, you know, let's let's live in the moment. Let's not always try to look through the lens or check check out your your smartphone, how your party was last night kind of vibe. I think as a DJ, coming back to your question, there's more pressure on your shoulders because you know that people are follow you, you know, and it's not a bad thing. because you take advantage of it by promoting yourself on Facebook in whatever kind of way. Everybody's different in that, you know. People, you know, like to be very, very minimized about it and some people like to do other stuff, you know. But basically, anyway, yeah, I think there's more pressure on your shoulder, definitely. But I tend to, like, I try to keep it about the music, but I notice that that bothers me sometimes. But I'm trying to find the right way not to let it overwhelm me too much. And I'm not talking about people who are following me, but more like... You know, the fact that your ass can be online after you pressed out your fart, basically, you know what I mean? That's a thing, definitely. Yeah, also I'd imagine that... you know, kind of becoming like a known name or something is, you know, affects people's expectations. Yes. They see Steffi on a lineup and they think that'll mean a certain kind of music at that time. Yeah. And she also has a headache sometimes or a bad period and maybe doesn't feel so well, but still, you know, that's true actually. But, you know, on the other hand, I think. It's fair to say that there are days that your fingers are stiff, your mixes are sloppy and you're not feeling... For some reason you're just not feeling. And the funny thing is when you leave home you... pack your bag and like most of my sets are 90% vinyl unless my bag doesn't show up. I've got my backup plan with stick and CD and sometimes I mix it in a little bit but basically I pack my sets around vinyl so I definitely have a lot of prep. to do before I go on the road, you know, so I take every gig serious, but it can absolutely happen that you rock up and you're like, oh God, I... I feel like shit, but I have to go on tonight, you know. And there's a lot of people buy a ticket for you for their favorite event or whatever the reason is, or for you, or, you know, because they like the party or the promoter. And somebody gets on and just doesn't do the job. And that will pop up in the net and people will say, yeah, she was shit when she played there. And maybe I was shit, yeah. But, you know, this whole discussion about like, you know, somehow it does get to you. So you have to be extra sharp for some reason. But, you know, you can only do the best you can. And I said it before in another interview, if I get sloppy or I don't feel like I should be out there anymore playing, I would quit anyway because that's a promise. I make with myself. So I just have to listen to myself and stay sharp. That's the only thing I need to do. And not, you know, not to forget that if I don't enjoy the music anymore, then it's over anyway, you know? When you're having one of those bad nights and you're walking into the club and you know that you're not really feeling it. what can you do or what do you do to try to make the best of the situation? Well, I think there's always a couple of records that you've got in your bag that are new that you would like to try out. And I think if like, it's fair to say that these days I try to select the gigs as good as possible in terms of who plays with me. That's a very important factor for me, whether I would take. a gig, yes or no? What does the rest of the lineup look like? It's not that I don't want to be everywhere in the world or anything, but it's just that some music just doesn't match what I do. So I try to prevent. myself from having a bad night not knowing what sort of party I'm at, you know. And of course it can happen that the vibe's very bad. I just try to concentrate on making nice mixes and telling my story and still be able to somehow... try to bring the flow across, you know, that's also, that's a very important thing, basically. And yeah, you win some, you lose some. You have nights where it's just not matching between you and the crowd or the equipment's not good or you're having a rough day or whatever, but I'm just trying to keep the flow and see if I can make the best. set out of it I think so your production has really kicked up in the past few years when was your first tracks that was it the one on Thomas Sumo's Panorama mix was that your first yeah there was a there was a remix that actually came out on Soul Rock on a Dutch label for Sam Popper and Steven Paven who's a one two three as well. I did a remix for them that came on on vinyl shortly before the track on Thomas' mix CD but it's fair to say that Thomas Mixed CD was the main kick in my ass to open up and actually start releasing the music because I was already making music since 2002 but there was just no need or maybe not the confidence yet to bring it out on the market because I am very critical so I just didn't really show anybody the music until the opportunity to send her some stuff for the Mixody and I was like, yeah, you know, and then... And she was one of the... people said like, you need to get that out because you need to, you need to show people what you're doing. It's, it's, it's good. So. She would kick me. Yeah, you made the track in 24 hours or something like that. Is that right? Yeah, but that was not an old track. That's actually what I did in 24 hours when I initially canceled the CD. And then she said to me, like, you know, I'll give you 24 hours and you just make a strong pot of coffee and work and you'll make it. So I had to fly to Holland. and then I was able to push that back one more day and I had 24 hours and then I just finished it. But, you know, you have to finish it no sleep and it kind of gave me a, I don't know, gave me something to set the other leg to the other side as well instead of always saying, like, oh, I don't need to release anything or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know. Did you start on spending more time in the city? studio like once your name was out there as a producer? Less, less actually like I think these my DJ career expanding internationally kind of run parallel with me releasing more records so the more more I was on the road the less time I had to to spend time in the studio before I was I was working a lot of more on music because I wasn't playing so much. So that's a bit of a thing at the moment. But I've cleaned my summer a little bit so I can be in the studio more and start working on the second album. That's a big goal. So I took time off. in summer to concentrate on that and just really kick off and you know get the ball rolling yeah i'd imagine that once um once people know you as a producer just that alone would would sort of um you know inspire you to try to get more stuff out there I don't know, it's not something that I necessarily need to do to release music because people know my music. It's just something like as soon as you kind of like, it's like something breaks open and it just pours out, you know, basically. And my kickstart after Tamas CD had so much influence on me being so productive. that I want to make music because I feel good about making music and I like making music. I like to be in the studio, but not necessarily to release something because there's so many, so many sketches that never saw daylight. And it's fine for me. That's totally fine. I mean, if I release it to Alvin, and I haven't, I mean, I haven't, I mean, I haven't released that much music anyway, you know. And if I do another 12-inch, I might maybe like eight sketches and only use two tracks or something. So it's not necessary to get it out. and be there and make another record. And if it's the time to do another record, I'll do another record, you know. It just needs to come naturally. That's very important. Otherwise, it's just your heart's not in it, you know. But in general, it seems like it's kind of a challenge. A lot of people agree on just balancing the DJ gigs with the proper amount of studio time, you know, to make music that you're happy with. Totally, yes. Yes, I would like it to be a bit more equal, to be honest. I wouldn't mind if I would have a little bit more time to spend in the studio. But that will come. That's just a juggle for yourself to find your flow, to listen to your own body and like, okay, what... How much can I do and how much time do I miss? Because that will show, you know, if you're too tired because you're on the road, then you just know that you have to slow down a little bit. How much time do you put into DJing aside from when you're playing, like finding new music and stuff like that? Do you still put a lot of effort into digging and whatnot? Yeah, that's a constant thing that never stops. That still excites me so much. And it's a natural thing. It's not like, oh God, I have to go to the record shop and get new stuff or see what's out there because I have to have new records. I'm just very interested and I'm still very interested in vinyl, whether that's dance music. or any kind of other music, whether that's new music or old music, new releases or secondhand, it doesn't really matter for me. It has never changed, really. It's just a constant thing. It's been the same all these years. It's just a curiosity that cannot be stopped somehow. I mean, you've got the term vinyl freak or record collector or whatever. I just, I don't know, I just enjoy it so much. Also, going from one shop to the other, get home, listen to what you... found sit down with it you know what did I find like something something old and valuable or something new that really inspires me or or you know it's it's that whole vibe around it that that's just something that doesn't stop So just walking into a record shop, that's still your main method of finding music? Oh, totally. Yes. And thank God for the fact that Berlin has a lot of record shops, you know, although I do have to say I order records as well, but I find it a bit harder to shop. online for records than being in a shop physically and the fun thing about being in a shop is that you can just like oh let's let's go through some more backstock see if there's something I missed or something interesting that they maybe just got back in or something like this what do you think about when you're listening to a record in a shop like do you do you picture like would I play this or do you just listen to it and see how it strikes you. That last, I don't really mind if I would play it or not. Like if it's good and I like it, I buy it. It doesn't matter what genre. I mean, it would be a bit unlikely me buying a progressive house record, but if it's a good one, then... for some reason you would be able to play it at home. But let's just say if I would go through a pile of records, I would not be picky about the fact that it would be 90 BPM or 140 BPM if it would be really hard or really soft. or something that would feel danceable, or something ambient and relaxed. I don't mind, because it's not my goal to only shop records to use on the dance floor. So let's talk about the mix CD. How exactly did this idea come about? Whose idea was it? It's basically Osku Tone, who... asked me if I would be interested in releasing a second album in 2013. Or doing a mix CD. And I like the thought of doing a mix CD. And I wasn't ready for a second album anyway. And for some reason, I was also more in the mood for a mix CD. So I choose the opportunity to do a mix CD. How is the, I mean, obviously you've done podcasts, you've mixed in clubs countless times. What was kind of unique about the process of putting together a mixity or what was new about it? The fact that it's a product, it's not a file, it's on CD and it has artwork and it's something that will last forever because it's a physical product. A podcast is a file, so it has a different kind of meaning in terms of you have it on your computer. It has no physical presence, you know, and the CD has artwork and it's still a very fun medium, basically. And that was so, so different than doing a podcast. And the second thing, of course, is that you have to license the tracks. You don't have the freedom like you have in a podcast of. Just mixing anything together, which that's a good thing about a podcast that you don't have to license and it's for promotion only. And the CD is you have to pick out in 70 minutes or 74 minutes. You have to pick your tracks. Not easy, I have to say. Is it hard to think like, do you have this thing in your head like... what the CD would have sounded like if you didn't have to worry about any of that? Oh my God, yeah. I would have done a four-pack, four CDs. Continues like flow, flow, flow. 70 minutes was really tough. I asked Nick and he was laughing when I said like, can I do a double-pack? Is that possible? But it's so expensive, you know, because, you know, you're going to put the tracks on the... On the CD you have to pay some kind of advance because it's a pain in the ass to deal with the royalties after the sales. And to be fair, not a lot of people are buying CDs anymore these days. So you have to give something to the labels that present the tracks on the CD. And yeah, I don't know. It's quite a process, actually, to be honest. Yeah, I guess it hadn't occurred to me that since sales are obviously lower across the board, but... A lot lower. I guess that would make it harder to afford royalties. Yeah, absolutely. Because I think you might be lucky if you break even. You know what I mean? Like it's not like 10 or 15 years ago where somebody would sell like 20,000 mix CDs. Totally not. Like that's gone because the download generation doesn't care about it so much. So I think it's more like a fun project that represents something rather than something you make money with, because I can assure you that that's definitely not the case. And I think it's, you know, Fabric does it as well. And I've seen a Rex CD, if I'm not mistaken. So a couple of clubs do it. I like it because it's something that you can keep as a memory, you know? Like, oh yeah, you know, like in 10 years, I've had that Panorama about CD. That's where I used to go out when I was younger or when I was still going out a lot. You know, they did these series of CDs. That's something you can say in 10 or 15 years. That's something you can't say about a file, you know? I think that's a major difference. Yeah, and also this method, I guess you could say, of having all the panoramic bar and barricade mixes have these exclusive tracks. So you get to kind of represent new material by your friends and stuff like that. Yeah, totally. Or you can feature people that you respect or feature people that you would... always wanted to work with if they were up for it as well, of course. I think that's a nice opportunity also to meet new people and to bring people together that haven't been together. And that was... And something that was so nice to see when we had dinner before we had the release party, that there was actually a lot of people that were on the CD sitting at dinner. And you just, you know, you're having your food and having a drink and just chatting away about different kinds of things. And you're just meeting people from all over the world and with so many different kinds of experiences, like different ways of working, different mentality. It was also a really fun social thing, to be honest. to get people into the club that haven't played or get people on the CD that weren't on the label before, people like Big Strick. He was not on the label. He came from Detroit to play at the party, had such a good time with him, you know, lovely guy. And it was just, it was really fun to bring him over because he hadn't been, you know, and I think that's it. that's a good aspect about the whole project as well. So how do you choose those? How do you sort out those exclusive tracks? Like, do you have a list of artists that you just say, like, I would love to have this guy in my mix and then they send you some things or how does it work exactly? Well, I made a list of people that I respect and appreciate as a producer and I just wrote them an email and explained what I was going to do and whoever was up for a contribution, whether it was an exclusive track or something that was already out on another label. something that was gonna come out on another label that was not really important but you know whatever they wanted to give me I would listen to it and see if it would fit It was a quite big selection. I have to say I was really overwhelmed by the people that actually replied back because so many people sent me stuff. And that kind of makes it harder because you have to squeeze all these things in and basically you have to reduce it to like around between 14 and 18 tracks. Very hard, very tough. So did you go through like a few different kind of versions of the mix? Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. I made many mixes for hours and hours. Tried different combinations. You know, like, let's go into that direction. Let's do something completely different for a change. Next day, nah, maybe I was a bit too enthusiastic about that. Let's try this. Let's try that. It's funny how you, after a couple of weeks of mixing and trying the new tracks and trying old tracks and see what possibly, you know, what the line could possibly look like, you're like, I'm never going to make this. I think I just have to call them up. and say that I'm going to cancel the project because I don't think, you know, because there's no light on the end of the tunnel because there's so much material to choose from, you know. Then there's a point where you just have to make up your mind and say, okay, this is the stuff that I'm going to be putting on the CD. And I choose to have a lot of... contemporary artist on the CD and have unreleased material and also material from the last couple of years. There's only one old track from 1992 on there. I didn't want to go into the past too much and I do something old school or you know what I mean? Just get crazy classics that people are waiting for or something. I was just, for me, it was. more about like representing this period of time. that we're in now at the moment you know i guess that's what a mix ends up being later on it's like a snapshot of you know that time yeah exactly exactly and maybe some mixes that have more like a classic vibe maybe they last longer or not i don't know it's hard to say it's it's a it was a conscious decision for me to to have it all about this this group of artists and and and let it be about this period of time. And also representing my idea of what could be played at Panorama Bar, you know, which could basically be anything, but, you know, it is a Panorama Bar mix CD. So I at least try to stick a flow into it, how I would see a beginning, a middle, and an ending, you know? So you mix it at home? Yeah. How do you get yourself in the zone, in the mindset to do the mix? You just have to mix a lot. You just have to go through the same mix over and over again. I mix it with turntables. I didn't use any computer or anything, so I just had to do the same mix 20,000 times. And just a lot of swearing. And a lot of, you know, starting over and, oh, fuck, fuck that mix up, okay? And when is it good enough? But it was, in the end, it captured the best mix for me and then put it on CD. You're happy with how it turned out? I don't know. I can't say this. It's up to the guys and girls who buy the CD. I don't know. I'm happy with the whole thing. And I'm satisfied with the mix. And I hope that the people who buy the mix, that they have a lot of fun with it. That's all I can say, really. We hardly talked about your labels, but that's something you've been involved in for a long time, too. Klaxon before Dolly. Yeah, Klaxon is 2000 and Dolly is 2010, actually. Yeah, 2010. You said that's, you know, you have a lot of fun with it. What's, you know, what does that offer that you don't get from DJing and producing? Oh, it's just, it's so, so much fun to... to bring new artists onto the label for starters. That's always been really good fun to work with people that either haven't had anything out there or Not a lot of people know them and to see what the response is to new music, that's a lot of fun. I'd rather release a record by somebody who hasn't released anything than a huge name, just to be able to bring something new to the world. And basically also, it's something that when somebody released your tracks... they brought you into the world basically and it's a nice rotating vibe if you can work with new people that you can give back to you know that's somebody that gave it to you basically I really, I really enjoy that. And also finding the making, you know, compiling the perfect 12 inch. If you have more material to choose from and then file, okay, we're going to put that track together. And that sounds with that nice with that. I think they call it A&R or something. I don't know, you know, selecting the tracks and, and, and actually putting the whole 12, 12 together. Okay. These are the four tracks that are in harmony with each other. And this is like okay we can do a remix on this one who can we ask like who has impressed me with with their stuff or who is actually doing something completely different than could do a completely different interpretation of the track also. And then, and what's the result of that? It's really exciting. You know, it's all about the music. It's not so much about like trying to make the label as big as possible, because to be fair, I think in the genres that I'm. floating, you're never going to get rich anyway. So we're not in it for the money anyway. So there's a lot of freedom because you don't have the pressure of, oh God, it needs to sell and otherwise I've put so much money into it. Because I don't do any promo. I don't send out any files. I don't send out any 12 inches. People that come by my house and they want to take a record home, that's completely fine. or I would occasionally bring some or occasionally forget it. You know, so it's not about, there's not a lot of marketing strategy behind it that I have to worry about and that makes it so much fun. I'm not occupied with, oh my God, I need to send all these people and I need to make sure that I have a showcase at some kind of festival. I can just, you know, operate at home and just do. whatever I like and that freedom is for me so important for me I I think that's that's so much fun of having a record label that doesn't have to live up to anything that's out there you know yeah in a way and the way you're describing it it sounds like kind of an interesting you know, it's like on the opposite end of what you were saying earlier is, you know, kind of the new age of DJing where people are expecting certain things and people are aware of everything you're doing, blah, blah, blah. If you do a label, it can kind of be sort of under the radar. You can do whatever you want. Yeah, I don't know if it necessarily needs to be under the radar, but there's a huge difference between a major label that has money. for a promotion campaign, for a photo shoot, for an album cover. And, you know, these days, major labels don't even have that amount of money, unfortunately, to pick up an artist and to say, OK, let's make this person into something big. You know, like we all know that there's hardly... any money in music through sales. It's more the gigs that even the bigger artists collect their money through playing a lot of gigs. So it's not about that I have to hang under the radar. I mean, I'm happy to be somewhere. I don't know. What is the radar? You know, where is the radar anyway? But you know what I mean? It's nice to be out there and whoever picks it up. I'm very grateful, you know, it's just that I don't have the pressure of promoting the music because I made this decision when I started Dolly, for example, I made the decision, okay, I'm not going to do a promo pool. to thousands of males like you have been selected because we think you are a very important figure in the scene that should have this track and it's only been sent to 20 people and la la la la la la it's a sort of like if you like the record you buy the record and if you're a DJ or you or you play at home or you want to give it as a gift to somebody. It doesn't really matter for me because I think, you know, there are so many great DJs out there. For starters, as it might be a little bit off topic, but they never get to see the daylight anyway. You know what I mean? I'm not really fussed if big DJs play the record because the small DJs at home, they could be a more badass DJ than the big DJs. I don't care. Just buy the record. So that's the reason why I decided not to send it to anybody anymore. You know? Yeah, and I guess if you don't send it out... the people that find it um it's kind of more interesting in a way yeah totally yeah and they and they're happy about it because it's a a conscious choice because it's i mean i do yeah no it's nice to see if they they pick it up and i what was what i was going to say i do i do occasionally um do the top 10 and of course i i i i wouldn't i would lie if i would not put it in there, you know, but that's as far as it goes. And sometimes at the clone website, you can see if somebody else had picked it up. So I think that's about the only, that's how far it gets. And of course you would announce it on Facebook. There's a new release. Yay. You know, boom. But other than that, I have no stress and it doesn't cost me any time. And I think it's good the way it is. Would you ever do anything else aside from 12 inches? Like would you ever do an album or anything like that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Yeah. That's definitely in the making. Yeah, I'm working with some artists at the moment that are collecting more than four tracks for a possible EP. So we're definitely going to do some albums. But that's the end of this year. Hopefully, I hope to do that before 2014. But that's more money involved in terms of pressing and get it out there. But that's definitely in the pipeline. So I guess your next thing is, next big thing on the horizon is your album, second album. Yes. In general, I mean, you're in kind of an interesting spot. You've got the Panorama Residency. You play internationally fairly often. You've got your productions, et cetera, et cetera. What else do you want? Or where would you like to go from here, I guess? I would like to also put more, I don't know if I would say more energy into the label. but I would definitely keep on doing what I'm doing with the label, with the Dolly label. That's a very active label at the moment, and I have the new series, the Dolly Dubs. It's not really a sub-label like it was quoted here and there, but it's a series of... different kind of tracks than I normally release on Dolly label itself. And I want to keep on doing that because it's a lot of fun. I really enjoy where that's going and kind of... slowly activating Klaxon which is the first label that I've grounded and that's definitely going to be interesting to do a couple of exclusive releases on that and that's a big focus for me as well and to be able to maintain the quality of the label the way it is now I'm happy and I want to see if I can you know, keep on going with that for a very long time. And I have a lot of thoughts that I want to try out in a studio. Might not even be for the next album, might be something completely different. I don't know, I have a lot of ideas musically that I'd like. waiting to get out, because I haven't done a lot and I'm just gonna set up my new studio and do some serious work. So basically those are the two main things that I want to be focusing on. Apart from, you know, my sets and my DJ gigs and stuff. Thank you. Thank you.
