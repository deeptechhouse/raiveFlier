Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors. A series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. In Excavation, Bobby Kirillich, a.k.a. The Hacksome Cloak, has delivered one of the year's most striking electronic albums. The English producer's triangle debut is certainly body music. but you're not likely to hear it in a nightclub. Stark, pitch black, and profoundly heavy, it doesn't coax you to move so much as it rattles you to your core and sets you vibrating. His live set was one of the highlights of this year's Club to Club Festival in Turin, and a few hours before his performance, we sat down with him. in front of a live audience to chat about punishing DBs, pitch-shifting violins, and how he's not sure anyone, save his mother, listens to his music while doing the washing up. I wanted to start out by asking you about your live show. We were talking about it a little bit before. You're playing live here at the festival later tonight. What is in store for everyone? I mean the live show, the live show is pretty much a more expansive version of the record so I'm not really a fan of playing straight up tracks live and for a long time I never played anything live that I'd released. I just did like, you know, I wanted it to be pretty much improv. And I guess I kind of realized that people were paying attention to the record that I didn't really expect that would happen. So I felt like I had an interesting platform to be able to present works that had been released already. I guess with the live show it's just, you know, it's kind of a turbo version of the record really, like everything's kind of cranked and it's really intense and yeah, it's very really kind of bass heavy and dark and moody and visceral I want to, I guess. That's what I imagine it would be anyway. You said when we were talking before that you are very specific with the venues that you play in about exactly what kind of a PA system they're going to have. Tell me a little bit about your rider. It sounds like it's an interesting one. Well, I mean, for me, you know, if I'm going to play, then... I have a very distinct idea of what it is in my mind that the audience should experience. And I feel like from my perspective, I've kind of done all that I can to ensure that that is there. So the tech writer basically states that, you know, there's frequencies in extremes of 30 hertz all the way up to, you know, 16 kilohertz. They should be 120 dB at all times without any audible distortion. So that's quite a mean feat for any venue to undertake. It's a pretty difficult thing to get right, but we're trying. In terms of the actual setup that you're playing on, how are you playing this music live? So the main kind of workhorse for the live show is an Octatrack, which is made by this amazing Swedish company called Electron. And I've got a lot of their gear. So this is like an 8-track sequencer and sampler. And feeding into that, I've got a 404 going into a looper, going into a delay, and that's actually going into the Octatrack. So I'm sampling live and then kind of sequencing everything. Yeah, without going too deep. That's kind of the bare bones of it. What you were saying about like this full frequency response that you like to have when you play live, 30 hertz all the way up to 16 hertz, 120 decibels, I mean this is pretty extreme. And the music that you make, the two albums that you've put out, The Hacks and Cloak and Excavation, I would say that this is in no way background music. I mean, this is pretty full-on music. And it kind of makes you wonder about what is the right situation to listen to this music in. Do you think this live show that you do is kind of the best way of presenting this? Yeah, I mean, that's a pretty accurate observation, I would say, because I think you only really learn about, well, for me personally, I really learned about my own music by taking it out and actually playing it for people. Because as much as I've got really great monitors at home and really nice headphones and whatever else. When you hear your music amplified at that volume, you really realize what's there, or specifically what could be there. So I think, yeah, it's funny. I talk to my mom about it, and she kind of says, oh, you know, I really like doing the washing up and listening to it or something like that. I don't think many people would share that opinion, hopefully. So I think definitely the live experience is the best. And it's funny because I don't listen to my own music that much, but I actually went back and listened to the record the other day and just thought it sounded so weak comparatively with the live show. Yeah, hopefully people will echo that. It's pretty heavy stuff. It's interesting what you were saying about playing the music for other people and how you kind of get their perception that you've learned a lot about your own music from doing that. There's this kind of the kind of the line on your music is that it's exploring this this darker side of this unknown side of being a human like what happens when you die. I wondered how much of that kind of came from other people's reactions to the record. Did you? kind of realize how sort of unsettling your music was until you played it for other people? I mean, it's funny. Like, I'm not really one to Google myself or, you know, know what other people think. But from bits and pieces that people have said to me, it seems that, you know, like... different tweets that I've seen and stuff like being like oh you know this is the gateway to hell and you know like this is the scariest thing I've ever heard and it's not really the way that I think about it and it's certainly not like it wouldn't necessarily be the main intention for it to be scary although I can appreciate that it's intense But from my perspective, it's almost cathartic. It forces me to think about things and put myself in situations that you otherwise wouldn't be in or would shy away from, I guess. And there's definitely a time and a place to do that. But that's kind of my main thing. I think you can learn a lot about yourself from taking yourself out of your comfort zone and putting yourself somewhere that's uncomfortable. I think I read that you said about the first album that you had composed all of the music and then afterward it was like you sort of found this narrative and started putting it together that way. The second album, Excavation, has sort of been at least presented in the press as kind of being a continuation of that story. With this album, did you compose it? with this idea in mind, with this narrative in mind? And how did that change the process for you? Yeah, I mean, it just seemed like a logical step. So I knew even before the first note of this record was written, like exactly the path it was going to take. So yeah, it just, it actually freed up the writing process a great deal, actually. Like I felt... Because one thing that's really difficult for me when you're making something is I don't like to make something just for the sake of it. I like to kind of have something to say or like something to present to people. So with this, like that was already done. So it was just a matter of experimenting. And I already had certain scenes. in mind that I wanted to create audibly, as corny as that might sound, but it's true. So, you know, I felt like half the job was already done. It was just a matter of, you know, crafting what I could see in my head. And crafting things in the computer seems like one of the big differences between the new record and the first record. The first one was nearly all acoustic instruments. And the new one is sort of the opposite. It's nearly all... electronic instruments? It's not entirely true. So the main difference is the first record was kind of more about me as like a performer. So it was all acoustic instruments and it was, you know, I was trying to get really good takes of everything because I played it all myself. And the second one... it's not, it's more electronic, but it's more about kind of sound design, I guess, because it would probably surprise a lot of people to discover what elements on the record are electronic and what aren't, because a lot of it was done with like, um, I got access to like a huge, uh, library of like orchestral instruments and stuff. So I was like taking a lot, I spent like a week in the studio taking loads of recordings and then I took them home and kind of took them apart and, you know, basically like put a magnifying glass on them and took out all these really interesting frequencies. And that's where a lot of the things on the record actually come from. So there's not that much electronic instruments on there really. But the production process itself is very... electronic. You compared it to sound design. You've done all this work with performing instruments and also a lot of work with sound design. I'm interested in your musical background. How you came into production. And that really started at university. Like, I went to the University of Brighton in England and I did a music and visual arts degree, which was pretty much fine art, but with a focus on sound, really. And during the last year of that, I was doing some experiments about, like... the sort of physicality of sound and frequencies and all that kind of stuff that you kind of start learning about when you're at university. And I was just running these experiments, running different sign tones through speakers and putting different objects on top of the speakers and seeing how they reacted to different things. And it just, you know, as silly as it sounds, I'd never really... thought of sound as like a physical presence before and particularly you know it becomes to get really physical when you start delving into you know like the sub bass frequencies and that's kind of where it all stemmed from you know and learning about people like sono and and earth and people like that and lamont young and you know all those people and i just kind of yeah wanted to put my own take on on that really. Your music, you were talking about how this, it was really enlightening learning about the physicality of sound. Your music is both really physical and also highly narrative. It's kind of the stuff that you're telling a story with. Where, you kind of explained where you learned about the physicality of sound. Where did you really learn about the narrative qualities of sound? I don't really think... I don't think you... The only person that can teach you that is yourself. I think it's either a sensibility that you've got or you don't have. The way that I make music is very labor-intensive. I'll sit for literally six or seven hours and listen to maybe three loops of stuff over and over again. When you expose yourself to those kinds of conditions, then it starts to present different things. different images, different stories. I kind of like to sit with things and just have them playing and just see what manifests. I think that's where the narrative element of my music comes from really. I don't think that's something you can teach to someone. I think it's just either there or it isn't. You've told me that you log really, really long hours in the studio. You like to start in the morning, end in the evening, really put that time in. Tell me a little bit about what happens during that time. What's your creative process? I mean, it's difficult. to kind of assess that really. I mean, I can talk about when I was making the record and that process was definitely one of the most intense periods that I've ever had in terms of making music. For one thing, because I had a label behind me and I knew that I had people to kind of answer to in a way, but also because, you know, I really wanted to do it. I felt like I had a really good platform to be able to present something to people. And I really wanted to kind of prove something to myself about like... what I was able to produce. So, you know, I'd generally start work around 8.30 in the morning and, you know, get a strong coffee. But a lot of it comes from, you know, I'll have certain things in mind. So for this, like, you know, I had a very distinct narrative that I kind of wanted to portray. So I would Google image, search things and look through stuff and read a lot of books. Um, So not all of it's like making music, but like this album was like very research heavy as well in terms of just even things for like the track titles, you know, they all came from like books that I'd read and different films and stuff. So it's just like amassing a lot of information and then seeing what you can do with that and how that manifests itself musically. You said as well that you had a label behind you for this one. Triangle, which is a label with a really strong aesthetic, whatever that may be. You kind of know it without being able to put it into words necessarily. You knew that this was coming out on Triangle before you wrote it. So did that influence the record at all? I mean, this is a very electronic label. There are a lot of electronic textures on this record, but is there kind of a deeper... influence there? It didn't influence the sound of the record in any way. For one thing, I couldn't... really get my head around why a label like Triangle wanted to work with me. It just didn't seem to make any sense at all. And then, you know, having, like, I had so many chats with Robin, the label head, about it before I said yes, you know, because I really wanted to kind of suss out his vision for the record and see how he thought it fitting on the roster because, you know, as much as he seemed like... a really nice guy and I really loved the music that up till that point Triangle had released I just couldn't see myself on there but then you know once we got chatting and I found out like his sort of history and all that all the different things that he's into is you know there was a lot of uh a lot of mirrored things there that we that we both like uh agreed on and Yeah, you know, I was slightly tentative because of the reputation that Triangle had had before that point, but I could really see that Robin's curatorial view of the label was so much... wider than what people are giving him credit for at that point so it was it became a no-brainer and a really exciting prospect you've had two albums out now um and they've kind of formed one narrative arc more or less it's kind of decay i guess human decay specifically um and then whatever happens after that process is over um you know i guess you die and you kind of go through all of that. Do you think there's more to tell with that story? Are you thinking about a third part or are you excited to move on from this particular moment in your creativity? I think... It's one of those unanswerable questions. I think there's always more to say on that subject because it's so ambiguous and it's the great unanswered question. So there's always many, many attempts that you can have at answering that. But in terms of another record, I'm definitely not desperate to make one at the moment. However, it would be a form of a continuation of those themes. Yeah, like I'm not finished with it yet. Yeah, I wonder if it's like less about continuing like a specific theme and more about continuing like this particular mood. I know that, you know, so much... your music up into this point has really evoked a particular darkness or something along those lines. Do you want to continue working in that vein? I mean, you know, you can't really, you can't deny like your sensibilities, but at the same time, I feel like, I feel like with the second record that that was a big departure from the first. And although it's, although it's dark, it's a very different record. And I think, you know, I ran the risk of alienating however few fans there were of the first one. I did. run the risk of alienating those people with this record and I knew that a lot of people wouldn't understand the transition and you know that's something I want to keep doing and not just for the for like whatever audience there may be but from a personal perspective if you're not challenging yourself and you're not stepping out of your comfort zone continuously as a musician then I don't really see the point in continuing like I could do another record exactly the same as that like no problem and I'm sure it would I would have a lot of, or at least the same amount of fans that this one has got, but I'm not really interested in that. It's really interesting what you say about how this record, you went electric or something, and there's the potential to alienate some of the fans of your more, I guess, acoustic music during that process. You've obviously taken on a lot of new fans with this one. though as a more electronic leaning record do you listen to much electronic music what are your listening habits I mean you know They're really varied. I mean, I really enjoy the new Nine Inch Nails record. I think that's really good. I just recently, I mean, I'm really bad at picking stuff up. Like I'm not one of these people that's constantly on the internet, like knowing like what's coming out and what people are talking about. And essentially, I am the kind of person whereby if all my friends are talking about a record, I'm the kind of person that won't listen to it because everyone's talking about it. So, I mean, recently, I only just got turned on to that Silent Servant record. I kind of thought I'd give that a few months before I got into it. But it's really, really great. I've always been into anything that Dominic Furnow does. I think he's incredible and Mika Vainio. I guess that's kind of the leaning of music that I'm listening to currently, but it's really broad. I listen to a lot of classical music and a lot of old music and a lot of pop music. I'm just interested in interesting sounds and good music. There's no real genre-defining. Yeah, I guess I wonder if that's like one of the things with with with triangle with being on that label and maybe being some somewhat of an outlier potentially on the label is Kind of winding up getting getting booked to play shows where you're kind of like not not the average guy in the lineup or getting pigeonholed as an electronic artist when you really don't think that you are. I mean, is that something that you've had sort of a struggle with as the bookings have got bigger? I mean, I don't see it as a struggle, to be honest. I kind of, I welcome that. Like, I welcome being part of bills where, like, people in the audience don't know what to make of it because... you know, it's the easiest ego boost in the world to play to a room full of people that are really into what you're doing and they know it song for song and, you know, they're going to know exactly what to expect. But it's the best thing, to be honest, when you play with a bunch of people you would never be aligned with and there's still people left at the end of the set. Like that's really, really amazing for me. That's even better than playing to, you know, a room full of fans in a way. You said at the beginning of the interview that you used to play live, like only things that you hadn't released. And that now you're finding yourself playing more of your album material. In that live set, is there still a fair amount of new material that pops up or even improvised? material? It's improvised in the sense that the songs are structured very differently and the sonic qualities of them are very different to the record but there's no new material in there that people haven't heard it's just like the songs are kind of morphed but they're morphed in a way where people will still be able to identify them with the record because that's really the intention of the show. Are you mostly in the studio now, mostly working in the box on your computer? Yeah, I mean, I'm not a huge gear fiend, but I've got a few things. I mean, I like to go out and take recordings. I like to go and walk around and listen for interesting things and take a recorder out and that kind of thing. And also, I like to run things through equipment. So I'll run things through the Octatrack and I've got a machine drum and an OP-1 and a few compressors that I like to run things through. But predominantly, it's in the computer. the way that I grew up making music. I mean, well, aside from being a guitar player, which is kind of my main instrument, the way that I was, the way that I really learned to assemble music was digitally. So it just kind of makes, I find it easier to deconstruct things and reconstruct things in that way. Yeah. And on the first album, when you were... recording so much of the music acoustically. Were you... had you composed this stuff before you were playing it? And I guess then, when now you're working mostly sort of starting in the computer, ending in the computer, does that change the composition process? In answer to the first question, that was quite an interesting question because with that record, I knew that I was really, really interested. strings and listening to a lot of classical music and I'm a classically trained guitarist but apart from apart from that I don't have any other training in any instruments so I just went out and I bought a cello and I bought a violin and I kind of very crudely taught myself how to play them and it was incredibly frustrating because I knew that I didn't want to get anybody else to do it because I just wanted like selfishly I wanted it to be me So what I would do, I would compose melodies in the computer and then work out how to play them. So I'd do it just via MIDI with just like a sign. or something and then listen to it and then work out how to play those on the cello and violin. Did you get a sense of how, I guess, conventionally good you had gotten at these instruments? Part of what makes that first record so kind of eerie is the fact that it's these very familiar instruments that are played with this kind of creepy... quality to them. I'm not saying that you're a poor cellist or something, but I think it really adds to the mystique of the record. When did you feel like you were ready to play this music on those instruments? I mean, to be honest, I didn't. I never really felt comfortable with the sounds of it. But then I learned to kind of embrace the mistakes and also embrace the recording environment. That record was made at my parents' house in the countryside in a sort of shed slash office in the garden. So if you listen carefully to that record, you can hear traffic, you can hear birds, you can hear wind and all sorts of stuff. I just got to a point where I was like, this is the environment that it's made in. It has to inform the recordings and the fact that it's there. It's just all part of the sensibilities of the record, really. And in terms of playing... I think it serves the music well, but I think anybody who's in any way competent on those instruments would be able to tear it apart pretty quickly. Have you had that happen? Have you spoken with some classical cellist who's given you a hard time about the playing on the record or something? Well, there was one time, yeah, I was with a woman who plays in the London Symphony, and she was asking me about what I did, and I was like, oh, I've got some music, do you want to listen to it? And she was like, yeah, sure. And she was like, what's that played on? And I was like, oh, it's a violin. She was like, that's interesting. How did you get that low A flower ever on a violin? And I had to kind of own up to pitch shifting some things. That's great. Are you playing any instruments now? Have you picked up anything else that you're excited about at the moment? Not really. I mean, you know, there's... There's still a lot to kind of explore with what I've got really. I mean, I'd relish the opportunity to go to the place where I recorded for the second record and get more to grips with like timpani and glockenspiels and all that kind of stuff. When we were talking earlier, you also mentioned that you do some work now as a producer for other bands, other groups. Tell me a little bit about that process, how you got into it and what kind of work you're doing in that realm. I mean, I got into it pretty organically. the last thing I did was a record for a band called The Body who are I think they're based in Portland but I could be wrong they're a two piece kind of sludge metal kind of outfit and they've got a new record coming out on Revenge. And they just contacted me out of the blue and said that they were doing a new record and would I like to be involved. And, you know, I've really wanted to get into specifically band production for a long time and be able to put my stamp on that. So I went out to New York to work in a studio and, yeah. I just got presented with all these really kind of well-made, really interesting stems that I was then able to take apart and make my own, really. And this is a metal record, kind of, right? Yeah, I wonder what sort of a Hax and Cloak metal record... would sound like? I mean, you know, it's not, I would say it's kind of a blur between, you know, the two records that I've done really. I mean, I would hope that there's still identifiable metal signifiers in excavation because like that, that world informs such a huge part of what it is that I do.
