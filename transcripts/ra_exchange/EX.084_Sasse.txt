Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. As the head of mood music, Sasa has forged an enviable reputation in the house and techno world. The DJ and producer got his start in Turku, Finland, but soon made his way from that small outpost to Frankfurt, Germany, where he became one of the regular DJs at Robert Johnson in its first few years. Sasa moved to Berlin in the early aughts and has continued his label and rigorous touring schedule in earnest. He shares a studio with Ewan Pearson and Martin Dawson these days, and also makes music under the name Freestyle Man when the mood strikes. We recently caught up with the atypically upbeat and loquacious Finn earlier this month to explore his history in the scene. So I brought you in here because we haven't had someone from Finland yet on the exchange, I think. I thought it was about time for someone to rep for the Turku scene. Okay, Turku. I'm, you know, flattered, of course, and that's very nice. And you have to say Turku before Helsinki because, yeah. Because for me also Turku is the... you know capital in that sense for the underground at least electronic music in finland really yeah i mean because if you look at the the the end of 80s you know i was a kid back then you know but early 90s when i started to dj There was so much happening in Turku, and it was all underground, and Helsinki was more like a commercial city. Motivated sound back then was awful. Was it more of a house or a techno city? It was basically both. There was no difference. So when, for example, the Sacker guys, Tommy and Mika and Ilbo, when they DJed, they played like a dance mania, and they played like a... you know, new Panasonic record and then they played like a Vincent Floyd. But it was all like, you know, the underground sound, US pressings. If you had a UK pressing in one of these parties, it was like, you were kind of like looked down at, you know. It wasn't that cool, you know. And we kind of got lucky because we had one good record shop which delivered the records directly. from the US called Groovy Beat Records in Turku and good friends of mine, Marko Laine and Jovi Kuusinen who started it and they brought straight from New York and from Chicago, Detroit, you know, the records. So we also got some records which you couldn't maybe have had, which you didn't have in continental Europe. Which is good fun now, you know, because you see that the prices of those rare destroyed records are insane on Discogs and stuff. But you had no idea at the time. Well, nobody had. You know, we just bought good music, basically. We didn't have, like, the choice was like... to buy like an early mood to swing or buy like something from Blake Baxter. Not like that you had like any UK big names, you know, like some perfecto records or something like this, which was like in every other record shop also like present. We didn't have that. So, so I think in that sense, it will be a lucky, of course you couldn't buy any, you know, everything, but you know, At least you heard the records back then and now you can try to find them. Some of those which you missed, you can try to find them cheaply because there's a lot of... I still think there's a lot of classics from that time which hasn't gotten that. status yet people maybe don't know or it's not a producer which is yeah which you know it's not mad mike let's say like this i find it really interesting you mentioned that the record shop and the fact that they brought in records from a certain place can absolutely define a city in a way back then yeah especially you know if you had a record shop then had a great distribution network that changed everything, changed the sound of the city. Could, you know, if people were buying it and playing it, of course. In one sense, yes, but I think before even the record shop was there, I think Tommy Groenlund was a big influence for all of us, you know, kids back then, you know, because he traveled already. He was in, you know, he had, you know, been everywhere in New York, Berlin. And he brought the records. He played the first Dance Manias to us, you know. Also, like, Mika Vainio, when he played some records back then, you know, he had, like, it's a very strange mixture of, like, you know, rockabilly to techno, but... That kind of like was the opener, you know, eye-opener in a sense. For us, you know, we went to the parties and then we like heard somebody play and, you know, the mixing wasn't like a question because the guys didn't mix back then. It was more like just like playing good records almost from the start to the end, which I still also respect because I like that, that when you have a really good record, you just play it from the start. Play till the end, then you play the next one. I can't imagine Mika as a DJ. No, he's not. But sometimes he puts a record on, or two on, you know. What were sort of the first parties that you were going to? Was there a party, or was it just something happening? Well, it was... Actually, there was a big kind of rave, rave kind of thing, you know, going on when we started to, like, travel. I used to live in a city back then where my parents lived and we drove in a car. We just went in the evening, went to these raves and drove back. But the raves were like techno parties back then. So it was a warehouse, you know, and then we had, like, you know, there was a big sound system. We also did a few, back in the days, and it was a lot of work, and then you had like 150 people. It was like really small. And then like everybody, you know, did their dance, and you know, listened to the music, and they were wondering what's going on here. There was a few in Helsinki, there was an organization called Metal Bass, you know, which did Helsinki parties, and also in another city near Turku called Rauma, and those friends, they did... more the techno sound and Tommy and the guys from Sacker they did like the more the housey Chicago sound but it was all mixed anyway you could play anything you know play it from you know 118 bpm 115 bpm to 140 were the police ever a problem yeah they started to stop them at some point because obviously it was illegal parties so I remember a few few nights when we drove two hours with a car And then we went to the party and then, you know, police just stopped it. And then there wasn't anything else, you know. Then you could go to another normal disco in the city or you could drive home. So, yeah. But at some point the warehouse parties ended. And then it was like more like nights, you know, you did in bars. Because there wasn't really clubs. So you had a nice bar where people like put the sound system on. And then you played music and people danced or whatever, sat in a corner and looked at each other, you know, grim, Finnish style, you know. But still, you know, people came for the music. It wasn't like anything to do with nowadays trends or anything else, you know. Is that stereotype true, the Finnish? In a sense, yes. I think it has to do something with the melancholic side of the Finns, you know. It's Friday, you know, or Saturday, people go out and, you know, it's a shit life up there, you know, probably. You know, that's how they think, you know, I don't know. But I have the feeling. I was never like, I don't know, I probably, that's why I'm probably also now living abroad. Because I chose at some point to say like, okay Turned into one of these guys sitting in a corner with a beer in front of me and just not getting anything done. In 92, at least in your bio, you helped open one of the first house clubs? Yeah, we did this night called Just Right. at a university, you know, bar, kind of like venue. And, yeah, that was basically the first time when we really said like, okay, it's only house music. For at least for, you know, Detroit house, New York house. Of course, there was clubs already in Helsinki playing like some different kind of house, you know, from Holland, you know, from European sound. But we wanted to play the US sound and, you know, and that's basically... Basically, I think we did the first one, I moved to 92, yeah, I moved 92 to Turku for studies. So that's when we started it. First small, you know, parties, then we had some bigger ones, and then it also turned into, like, something which had already a house floor and a techno floor, which I wasn't anymore involved in, but that was my friends, you know, who did the parties, who I did the parties with. And that was great because we had like, we had a great, you know, small community. And, you know, there was a few DJs and, you know, we all played. There was no guests, you know, basically. There wasn't this guest, you know, the DJs came. They didn't have any budgets. We just did put a sound system on and, you know, invited some friends. And if we got lucky, we could play, like, you know, till four o'clock in the morning. Then the bar closed and the bartenders came to us and, you know, threw us almost out of the decks, you know. That's the Finnish way. That's how it was. So it wasn't really like that glamorous clubbing, you know. But we had a crowd, you know. I think it was great times. And some of those parties are still legendary, at least in my town. How many people were going to these things? It was 300-400 maximum. That was like if you have 400 people in a city like Turku. was massive. And that was then like really big. Usually like, yeah, 250, 300, 400 people. You mentioned, again, the US house as being the thing. When you started your label, I read an interview where you said you like copied the... print out through a fax machine a couple of times to make it more like a US house release? Yeah, we were kind of like worried that the first mood music release wasn't... The sound was very US influenced. So we also wanted to have the pressing to be really like... tracks records are like you know and the labels you know the printers in in in germany and where we pressed the records they were too fine so we thought okay let's let's fuck it up you know so we faxed it eight times through and then then the guys was the graphic designer who decided this and said like that's gonna be great like faxing and copying and it was like the end it was great you know and now when you look at an old the mood music number one and two you know they look pretty Pretty near an old Chicago record. That was the whole idea of the record. What got you into production in the first place? You were just DJing in the early 90s? Yeah. End of 80s, I had a friend who was very much into Depeche Mode and all this. Yeah, 80s pop, you know, basically. A bit like, not everything really poppy, but a bit more like nine-inch nails and stuff like this. And he had a sampler, I think, Ensoniq Mirage. And he gave it to me for a few days, and then basically it stayed. And I had a MS-DOS, I had a computer, so we tried to get a sequencer. And my first, you know, tapes, what I tried to do on a normal C cassette, you know, were just like, I had no clue what I was doing. So, you know, I basically started quite early, you know, also to try it with production, but I had no idea because I wasn't a musician. I had no idea of notes. I just heard samples and stuff, you know. So I think it was always there, but before I then realized, okay, actually, you know, I could... I could do something. Then I got my own samplers, I got my own speakers, mixer, you know, stuff like this. It took like five years. It was a bit, you know, more, you had to invest a bit more money and time back then. It wasn't just buy a MacBook, you know, and start. But did you even know at the beginning that it was something you wanted to pursue? Yeah, definitely, yeah. I think it had to do with the fact that, you know, I read a lot of, you know, music magazines, and there was always, like, stories about somebody like Bomb the Bass, you know, whatever. There wasn't really... Of course, there were stories of the Chicago guys, but they were like, that was so far away. But Bomb the Bass was a guy who sampled, like, records, and I was like, what is this guy doing, you know? Cold cut, you know, all this. So I think that influenced me when I was like, you know when I was younger, and also said, like, that's cool, I want to do that, you know. And I think it was maybe just a dream, you know. How were you sampling? I actually built my own sampler from an electronic kit. I got it for Christmas. Really? So I got, like, the stuff and, you know, all the parts, and I had to build it. And it worked from the first moment on. So I used to DJ with that actually at the raves. I had a custom console with a sampler in front. So I could take a loop from the record, sample it, and then take the record off, take another one and trigger the other sample. It was pretty cool. The sampler was meant for like speech, like a recorder, basically. In an electronic magazine, I found it. And it was very interesting to use that in my DJing. It was quite a bit cheaper than a normal sampler. Well, the thing is that normal samplers were like musician samplers. Then you have a keyboard and stuff. So there was no other choices for a DJ back then, basically. And this somehow came up to my mind here. That would be a cool toy, you know. And I still have it at my parents' place, I think. I fired it up a few years ago and it was working. It was 20 years ago. I built it up. And, you know... Did it still have a sample in it? No, no, no. Sorry, no memory on it. It's only RAM, so it was gone. So I used to do, like, mixtape with that, and I think I actually used it in some productions. There was a loop function that was sampling a loop and then playing something on it. You know, I can't remember how I was using it in the productions because there was no sync, no MIDI. It was just, like, to But somehow, you know, and then it was a loop button, I can remember that, so it played the whole. Were there a lot of DJs using that thing? No, I didn't. You were just doing it. I did it because I was a bit of an electronic freak. At some point you have this, you want to build something on your own. So I had this thing and then I built it up and then slowly the DJ interest came and then I thought, why don't I use this for, I can take a sound. 15 kilohertz, like, sounding really crap, but, you know, it sounded good on a big PA, you know. So then I used it. I don't know where the idea came from, and there was no plan about it. And after using this sampler, I knew exactly what I wanted to have, and that was like a Akai, you know, S1000 or a... And I got a Casio then at the end, because it had better filters. So then I used a Casio FZ1 for And still I listen to those old tapes and they still sound like raw. But you know, good. But then I could actually play chromatic things and I could actually sample some. and play the keys and filter and envelopes and stuff. So that was like the start of the real production stuff. Did you find yourself sampling certain things quite a bit in the early days that you were really into? I think, you know, of course you wanted to create this one sound. You had your, like I said, Mr. Fingers and stuff. So maybe it took like a kick drum of them, you know, from vinyl. Sure. So it had like a certain sound. Then it took a hi-hat from a Victor Simonelli record from New York because it was always very pushy, you know. And that mixture maybe, you know, I still have those samples in my studio and they sound pretty raw. You know, it's pretty funny to listen to those today. So yeah, I think using those back then, because you only had like 20 diskettes, there was no hard drives. So you had those like my drums, my chords, my bass sounds. So it was very basic, but I think also using that basic equipment and those basic sounds made also the first records to sound like how they sound. Why did you start a label? I tried to send demos. I sent one to Guidance and sent one to a few other labels. And my friend of mine, Tuomas Salmela, phonogenic, who was... One of the guys who started back then also do music, he got a release on Guidance very early on. And I was like, okay, I want to also get to a US label. And, you know, I got some interest from Peace Frog at some point. Then it just died out, the interest, I think, or we didn't get a release done. Then I just said, like, listen, I have all this music, this music is there. I had this friend of mine who did a record shop and he was helping me to build, you know, to start up the label. So I thought like, okay, let's do it. The music has to come out. I was feeling the urge to release it, to also be a DJ with a record, you know. what I mean. You knew someone, though, who had started a label before. You had people that you knew. I had this friend of mine, Mark O'Leary, who did the Groovy Beat Records back in the days, and then he had a new record shop called Mind Records. He helped me find contacts in Germany, distribution. So I went, you know, talked to Noit on music, and then we started. They pressed it up here. Otherwise, you know, I could have no idea how to do a record. So we were isolated, you know, in a sense. There wasn't that much information, you know. You could buy DJ Magazine and you know how much information you get there. You eventually moved from Finland. Yeah. End of 90s, I had this urge to... Exactly what I told you before, this urge to get a different view on life, you know. You were still in Turkey. I was in Turkey, yeah. I had my studio there. I worked in a music shop, you know, selling, you know... selling music equipment, like studio stuff. And it was pretty easy going. I was studying a bit. Still had my papers in the university, but studying was like zero. You were biochemistry? I did biochemistry only like for a season, but I was actually process chemistry for a few years. Okay. Which wasn't my thing, you know. But I had to do something, you know, because in Finland you get money from the state when you study. So the money was running and I was in the universities, you know. So that's how it was, you know. You have to do something. I was working in a music shop, you know, doing some kicks and then working in a studio for three days, you know. Life was wonderful. You really took to the studio once you had one. Yeah. That was the first thing I wanted to have, like an own... Since that, you know, I didn't have a studio back home. When I moved to Berlin, then years later, I had it for a few years, I had a studio at home. But, you know, I love to go to a place where you just open the door, close the door. it's mine you know nobody can come and say like listen you know can you do this can you do that so studio is like really it's kind of like a holy place for me sounds ridiculous but you know Has a sort of magic and it's my spot, you know. Before you... You didn't take the normal, quote-unquote, normal route of international DJ moving to Germany. It seems, at least today, you moved to Frankfurt first. I think back then, you know, I think back then, looking at the... Was it normal? It was the normal thing. I think a lot of the distributions, they were either in Hamburg and Frankfurt. Sure. You know, there was Intergroove, Neuton, you know, and a lot of friends who I knew in Germany, they weren't, you know, from Berlin. I came years later to Berlin to play, a few years later. I think Ata and Heiko MSO and all this like Playhouse and also Robert Johnson was like my main people. In Frankfurt, so it was basically easy to come, and, you know, come to a city where you actually knew already that you had some people who liked your music and who could like, you know, basically, who thought in the same way. Then Atta started Robert Johnson in the year when I came. And I came, you know, to a new city, and I found this club, you know, which is considered now one of the nicest clubs in the world, and spent my first four years there, you know. Literally, I was living like two blocks away from the club. So you were right on the river. Yeah. There's a bunch of studios right around there. We built a studio back in the days into one of these. I wasn't at the Noiton house. That was a big house where Noiton distribution was. There were studios where Marco Carolla and some other guys were keeping the studios. We had another spot, but it was really near, like three blocks, two blocks. So, you know, it was like working on music the whole week and then Friday came, then I had dinner and then we went to the club. So it's like really like being at home, you know. So in that sense also Frankfurt was a better choice for me. I didn't know anybody from Berlin. So moving then to Berlin in 2003 was also for me a totally new ground. But it was also saying then, OK, I had enough of Frankfurt in a sense, you know. I know all this, you know, it was super nice. Nothing to say about that, but it was just for me to see something new, you know. Sure. And, you know, I got married, you know, a year before, so we wanted to see something else with my wife, you know. Tell me a little bit more about Frankfurt, though. Robert Johnson, when it started, have you played recently there? I played... I mean, how has it changed in the past 10, 11 years? You... you know, when you, in the early years when you used to go there every weekend, you used to know everybody and every corner and, you know, basically knew, you know, everything. And nowadays it's just like, it's like going to a place which, of course, you know, it hasn't changed much, you know. The sound is still the same, you know, and the place, of course. But some people who work there, you know, there's younger people working, you get older. So you look at it differently. And also the parties, you know. Because I think the core crew of the Robert Johnson people who started back then kept very, you know, it was very... concentrated for the first four years, five years maybe. And then obviously when we left Frankfurt, I kind of wasn't anymore in that crew. I wasn't visiting the city that much. I played maybe a few times a year. Nowadays I do maybe one or two gigs a year there. I still enjoy it. I still have a great time. I still love when I see the people there, see Ata and Sebastian, you know, from the club. But of course, you have a distance. I guess, though, what you said earlier, that... It makes sense. It's actually not a club that can change that much. It's just a room. Yeah, it's a room. Yeah, you can't really... It's not like new lights which you can put there. Or if you put a sound system in there, it's just going to get worse. Because it is, for me, for that room, the best sound system you can have. It's been tweaked 13 years now. So it should be pretty optimal. Did it feel special when it started? Of course. But that's also the thing that, as it was the home club of all of us, we thought it's normal. Sure. So then when you went somewhere else DJing and it wasn't like, you know, the sound system wasn't there, you know, there wasn't three turntables with a rotary mixer, you were like, what's going on here? Where's my, like, where's my rain, you know? So obviously, you know, it's very high standard, what people built there, and also the music and the crowd was very... and was very educated. So I think... Yeah, we got a bit spoiled. When you moved to Berlin, you moved because you wanted to see something different. How have you liked it? I can't complain. No, of course, that was... The moving was basically... There was a lot of people already moving. You know, 2003 was like... probably the high, you know, it was the year when most DJs who I know came to Berlin. So obviously there was like a lot of new fresh people here. A lot of DJs, everybody was very happy and, you know, very new city, you know. Everybody was like, you know, okay, we're all like coming from a smaller city, now we're in a big city, let's have some fun. So it was pretty great times, you know. And then there was a few clubs, you know, started, you know, and had their, like, you know, best time, you know, weekend club started. And, you know, Watergate was already there. Berghain was, I mean, Ostkult was already there. there and then broke and started at some point you know it was it was like fresh you know times and now it's like 10 years later and you know the clubs are still there and it's but if you go to those clubs you know you have a bit different feeling sure and not to complain about anything but say like you've seen it you've experienced it so many times and it's like You look at it differently, of course, because of the age, because of the... Familiarity breeds contempt. Exactly. And it's not that contempt. Yeah, exactly. And if you need to go there, let's say if you need to go every Sunday out to hear this DJ, it's a question you have to ask yourself after. you know, 10 years of being able to go there. And, you know, and I have to say myself, you know, personally, I haven't, on Monday morning, I like to go to the studio, be there at nine in the morning and just put my machines on and just jam because you're still like, either you're a bit fucked up from the weekend, you know, tired at least, you know, and then you still have this, you can... still take something out of what you got while you DJed. So Mondays are very important for me. So, you know, that's something if I would go out on a Sunday, let's say, there's great DJs on Sundays at Berghain, for example, like Panorama Bar. But if I go there, you know, I'm not able to move, you know, before Tuesday morning. So I'd rather not go. I'd rather go do music. So it's like where you want to channel your energy into. You have a studio in Berlin. Yeah, we have a nice spot on Prenzlau Allee. And you share it? We have a three-room. kind of studio office space with Ewan Pearson and Martin Dawson. And in front we have the office of Compact. The Berlin office is there. So we have like two big rooms. Me and Ewan have our own rooms and Martin has a small, kind of like a smaller room, but still a nice studio. Then we have a big office space where we can like, you know, have coffees and, you know, and the guys try to work, you know, while we talk on the phone. When did that happen? We found a spot in 2005. And it was basically an old drum school. And, you know, it's located very near Alexanderplatz, so it's like we got really lucky. So it was already soundproof, double-glazed windows, had a bit of acoustic, you know, but we did something, you know. And it's just a great spot. And, you know, it's middle of Berlin, still good price, you know, been at there now like seven years, so pretty... Lockwood, pretty happy to be there. Do you work with you on things? Yeah, we work on things. We have this project called Hot Lunch where we DJ back to back and we are trying to get more than one record done. We did an edit record a year ago. It's good fun, just like a session. But yeah, we actually work. I helped to mix you on one track for this album he was mixing for Vision Quest. The good thing with us is that we both trust each other's ears. So when he's having something, he's mixing something, he's coming to my room. When I mix something, I go to his room and then we just discuss things. I like this kind of open... Even if the music isn't always... What I'm doing is maybe not his favorite. He can always say mix-wise, do this, do that. And I'm saying the same thing to him. And also we have two rooms and they're both tuned. And we have different speakers. So it's nice to hear something in a good room where you can actually relate to the... to the quality of the mixing, you know. So it's pretty important. What does he bring to the table that you don't? And what do you bring to the table that he doesn't in your mind? I think if you look at it frequency-wise, I'm the bass man and Ewan is the... let's say everything from, from highs to middles, like also like he's so musical and I'm more like the groove guy. So, you know, sometimes, you know, I'm complaining about his bass and sometimes he's saying like, put more mids, which is usually it is the, it's happening very often. And of course I respect his, like his opinion and everything. And I think he does. as well you know respect my opinion but usually it's like thing i'm more concerned on the bass things and and he's like low end is my thing and and he's more on into the general vibe and musicality and and also arrangement and stuff like this You have numerous aliases, but you're not recording under a lot of them right now, I suppose, over the years you have. Would you say Freestyle Man and Sasser are your two major projects at the moment? Yeah, I think so. I think I have stopped using those strange names. It was part of the Chicago thing also back then, because, you know, if you look at my real name, Klaas Lindblad, it doesn't sound that Chicago. So that's where all these names like Maurice Brown, Vincent Fletcher, all these things came to my mind, you know, let's use those. It sounds more American. So it was still back then, you know, it was all about trying to be part of that scene, you know. So I think when I grew up older and I did more records, I just decided, okay, Freestyle Man is what it is and Sasa is what it is. What are they? Well, that's a good question. It's just how it fits to the vibe. Is it when you finish a track or is it when you start a track? I don't look at it. I think I look at it differently. When I try to compile an EP or an album, I try to find a... I don't really just work on music for one project at a time. I'm trying to do multitasking in a sense. If I work on one project too continuously, I get too lost in it, and then I don't know what I want to do. So I'd rather work two days on my album, for example, and then... a day on something else. And a day on something else can be that I do a techno track just because I need to get out of that vibe, what I'm working on on the other side. So in that sense, I always, when I compile the EPs or I compile an album, that's when I have maybe 20 tracks and I see what's actually, where's actually the red line in there. Do you have trouble doing that? Exactly, totally. I hate doing that, you know. And also say, what is this? What artist is this now? So if I would look at now things, I would probably release everything under my real name and just, you know, be very versatile in a musical way. Do you think having two names that are, I would say, are equally as strong in the world, do you think that's hurt or helped? I probably heard in some senses that people, you know, at least earlier on they didn't know who was who. At least that's what my booker told me. But for me, it was also like just easy to have a shield. Because if I would have done music only on my own name, probably it would be then, you know, there would be no other choice. Then I would have to start a band to do something else, you know. Now I can just make another or, you know, if something is like a bit out of the... you know, normal sassy sound, I can call it freestyle man, and the other way around. Or I can still, you know, invent a new name. I like the kind of the anonymous, you know, way of doing the, being a producer and not being such a like a front man of something. Do you do a lot of production for other people? I do. In the last years, I've been mixing and mastering a lot of stuff. You know, people, obviously, from the label side of things, of course, but also for other people. Now people come to me and say, like, you know, they want to have a mix, which I enjoy a lot. Because, I mean, I have to say that being an artist is lovely. I'm such a tech freak, and being in a studio is even more nicer. So if you don't have to think about always the... the artistic aspect of things, and you just think about the technical aspects. It's also nice to go to the studio and just work on a project which has to be sounding good, you know, you don't have to think if the bass line is okay, because it's not my bass line. So it's a different, you know, way of working, and I need, also I need that sometimes, you know, because if you get too lost in your own music, look at some artists, you know, they only do mixing Well, usually when I mix also, I try to explain people, you know, if there's something which really doesn't fit, I tell them, like, listen, maybe we put that down, like, because the sound is not really that good. But then again, if it's artists from my label or something, I usually, you know, I sign them because they're good. So, you know, then it's usually it's good music and I don't have to like say, tell them anything. And I just enjoy when, when they, when they don't have the possibility to mix it, you know, at home, but they do great music and still they put out a record, which sounds, you know, super fat in a club. You know, it's, I'm happy for that. Do you think you'll continue to DJ and make music? Oh, well, I think I will continue doing music. I will continue keeping the studio. I don't know about the DJing. I mean, obviously it's good fun. Nowadays I have a family, you know, two kids and stuff. So the traveling is like more or less a big pain in the ass, you know. So I don't know really. I have to say, I mean, I enjoy going, you know, off for a week and, you know, when it's like when I play three gigs. Yeah. And then it's like three gigs, you know, you just don't think. You just go to the next gig, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But if it's like one gig and then there's two you're just basically tired. But if you do it in one row, it's great. Then you come home and then you can just be another seven days in the studio. That's awesome. So I can't really say. I just wish to do it as long as my ears are saying okay. I try to DJ. Are your ears saying? Yeah, this is the first spring when I realized that I probably have an allergy. That my sinus is stuffed. My ears are bleeping into different directions. So, yeah, I have to see. That's another thing I can't really say. And that's also the flying. My ears are a bit sensitive. So long-distance flights are not really optimal. Do you use earplugs all the time? No, I can't, unfortunately. I can't mix on earplugs. That's the one thing which I kind of should have started earlier to get used to it, but I have them on, and then at some point I take them off, and that's even worse than being in a club, you know, without earplugs from the start. So that's not really an option. And that's also why I'm thinking, like, how long can I DJ, actually, without losing my... I think it's something that's kind of under-reported, under-covered, that so many DJs and producers are frightened of tinnitus. Exactly. Yeah, but that's exactly what happened to my wife, for example, this winter. She got a bad flu, and then she got an ear infection into the inner ear. And what happened? They had to pierce the ear, so she got a tinnitus, you know, and she got a really bad one. She had to go to hospital and stuff and got like, you know. got injections and stuff. So that, you know, that's the thing. It can happen in a club, but it can just happen at the same time, you know, you have a bad flu and it fucks up your ear. And then, you know, if it would have happened to me, I would have been like four months off, you know, music. Because it needs to, you know, it needs to heal, you know, you can't go to clubs and stuff. So, I don't know, there who are deaf who still play good drums they know how to do it so I trust my DJ skills even if I'm deaf you know Thank you. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ you
