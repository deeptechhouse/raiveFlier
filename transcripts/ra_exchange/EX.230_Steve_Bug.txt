you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Club trends come and go, but Steve Bugg has been a constant in dance music over the last two decades. His Poker Flat label has been a key source of crisp, pared-down tech house since its launch in 1999. It started with a bang. The first EP featured Steve Bugg's "Loverboy," a slinky house track that would help define the label's sound and in time become one of its hits. That record came during a turning point in Bugg's life: his move from Hamburg to Berlin, the slowing down of his productions, and the beginning of a successful run as the head of three labels. With Pokerflat's 15th anniversary celebrations winding down, We invited Bug by our Berlin office and found him in an especially talkative mood. He took us through his formative experiences at Hamburg's Front Club, his days as a hairdresser, and the changes he's seen over the years in the dance music business. Steve, we're coming up on the very end of the year, the end of 2014. Tell me a little bit about your year as a DJ. Yeah, it started in January, of course, and it started more or less at the BPM Festival, I think. That was the first thing maybe I've been doing since most of the years, in the last years I've been going to. Mexico and play some some gigs in the warms instead of staying in the cold and then I had a break for skiing vacations and then after afterwards I've been doing quite a lot of work in the studio and be traveling very much I just came back from the States and was the second or third tour in the States this year and before Japan and some other European gigs of course and it's been a bit stressful but I really enjoyed this year much better than last year last year I had a bit of a struggling with myself with the you know traveling got a bit really hard for me I don't know this year was amazing but last year I don't know I just maybe I played too many gigs in too many different countries I kind of couldn't keep up with traveling anymore and jet lags and and so this year was was great I really enjoyed it did you scale back at all or do you think it was more an attitude adjustment or making some little changes in your life I mean yeah maybe doing some changes in my life I didn't really drink that much this year that I used to do the years before I always took a break off for like a month or two sometimes last for three months so this was the first year where after the four months I didn't really want it to go back I didn't feel like drinking. I mean, when I was in Japan now, that was the first time I was drinking mostly every second day. Same on the US tour. At least when I was playing, I was drinking a little bit. But still, the amount was way less. I think that helped to stay more focused. And the travel didn't really get to me so much as it used to be before. Because traveling when you're drunk is... just terrible it gets uh way worse for your body and uh so that definitely helps and i think also Last year I got a bit fed up with what the business turned into and I think I got over it at the end of last year and so now I don't care about it so much anymore. And I think, again, I found my own space in the business and found a lot of new, interesting artists that are doing mostly vinyl-only labels and stuff like this and that also helped me to, you know, like... come back with a good energy and to see there's something else going on then apart from, you know, the major, the major few DJs that everyone raves about. So you're talking about the industry sort of generally, the music industry, the dance music industry. Yeah, exactly. What do you think it was that was, that was getting to you about it? I mean, in general, I think, uh, looking at the social media, how, how, people present themselves and how even young DJs come up with a press agent. with the management and you barely speak to anyone in person anymore if you want to remix even from a friend from someone you really know well you have to go through the management to get the remix and I'm kind of I don't I've never been like this I mean I I've been in business for so many years and if someone asks me to do a remix and I and he's a friend of mine and I like what he's doing and I'm going to reply myself. I don't want anyone else. And I don't get, you know, why people still ask for a lot of money for a remix because these days you barely make money with selling music. So I don't get the whole attitude of a lot of people. And also, again, saying, you know, about the young guys, why they come into the business. And it seems like most of them. get into the business because they see it as a business model and they come with a whole business plan instead of, you know, just doing it for the love of the music, the way that we got into the business. And then it turned out to become a business even without, you know, in the beginning we'd never thought of it. as a business. It was just, you know, something, it was our hobby and we finally started to make a living out of it. But for a lot of years we were all struggling, I think. And so nowadays everyone wants, you know, in the very beginning they already want, you know, four-star hotels and they already know where they want to be in five years and they have someone to help them with it and sometimes even... want to reach it in two years and they make it and I don't blame them you know it's it's fine it's a different it's a different way but for me it's just like not the not the way and it's not really the type of people I really want to work with in a way because I feel like there's some some warmth and heart feeling missing. It must be a little alien to you in a way. I mean, when you got into this, there was no internet. There wasn't this level of professionalism, probably. I mean, does this feel at all like the same industry that you were originally wanting to get into, wanting to become a DJ in? Yeah, I mean... In general, that's a question I asked myself a few years ago. If I would be 18 right now and if I would go out the first time to a club where they play electronic music... if I would still feel the need to go on buying music and, you know, at the end, try mixing at home and maybe even become a DJ at the end, because I've been mixing at home for three years before I even thought of becoming a DJ. because I was enjoying being on the dance floor so much I never wanted to be on the other side. It is definitely a different business, but parts of it are still the same. And the reasons why I got into it, they still move me and they still keep me doing what I'm doing. And I think that's what's most important, you know, and that's what I... finally figured that that i don't really have to care about the others i just have to keep on doing what i really do and don't really care about what the others do and uh and there's always going to be a place you know for you in the business and uh yeah that's so it's fine You sort of talked about what is a lot different and then you said there are some things that are the same. What are some of those things that have stayed the same? For example, when you dig for music and there's still like so much music out there that you can find, you know, by digging the record shops or like the internet or, you know, wherever you want to find it. As I was saying, there was a lot of vinyl only stuff. You just have to keep your ears open to find this stuff. And the feeling you have when you discover something that is, for example, still the same or like the way there's still some people you started working with and they are the same, you know, that people used to be back in the days. They're really happy to be a part of a family and release their music and they produce great music. And also, you know, like what else? the same the whole kind of you know the the way of setting up the artwork for the label that never really changed and the idea is still the same and finding artists is probably still the same as well in most cases so these are these are the things that i still think are worse keeping doing it So you were originally from Bremen. Yeah. And Bremen is not necessarily one of the German cities that would be most closely associated with house or techno. But it's produced, you know, one of Germany's biggest sort of house fanatics. I mean, how does that happen? How did you get into dance music? Yeah, I mean, in 87, some friends asked me to join them to go to the Klaper in Hamburg called... Front Club and where Boris Lugosch and at the time I don't even know if Boris was already playing Klaus Stockhausen was playing at the time and they told me this club and they're gonna play this type of house music and I'm like what you know what is this and then I went to a record shop to find it out and I bought two compilations something was like Chicago House Tracks Volume 2 or something like it. And the other one was another one with a lot of other artists, but mainly probably also from Chicago. I don't even remember, exactly remember that one. And so I listened to the records at home and I was like, wow, actually, I kind of like it. And then I went to the club and the first time I discovered like someone mixing music together instead of playing track by track. Yeah, I was on the dance floor all night and I mean, I used to dance a lot before, but suddenly there was no breaks in between and it didn't really matter if you liked the track or not, because in general, I liked the genre and so I just kept on dancing, you know. That's how I got into it. And then from there on, I kept on buying records every week. I've been a lot in Hamburg to buy records. I mean, in Bremen, we had a few stores that were selling like major signings, you know, like some stuff has been signed to speaker labels already at these days. But mostly I've been shopping in Hamburg at the time at Container Record Store. They've been having a lot of the imports coming in. You said you were dancing before you discovered house music. What were you dancing to before that? Anything that would play in the clubs and that I liked. I was listening to a lot of funk stuff. Rather, the commercial was played in the Bremen discotheques at the time and some black music, of course, in general. I don't even remember was as it just before that or afterwards. Sometimes you mix up things after all the years. And, you know, some Prince, Michael Jackson, whatever, all of these. And then even some pop music, of course, would have been played in some of the clubs. But in general, I like to move my body at the time. Well, for a lot of people who become very attracted to DJing, I mean, they sort of see what's going on in the booth and they immediately want to do that. But it kind of sounds like for you, you figured out what was going on in the booth and thought as someone who liked the music as a dancer, like, oh, I like that. This just lets me dance better. I mean, would you say that was true? The club I was going to, they had actually the DJ was behind. blue glass so that you could barely see him playing i kind of still like the idea of you know because you don't concentrate on the dj also as a dj i like it the other way around because you have a better communication with the crowd you feel better what's going on out out there but then again sometimes it's good if you play just for yourself and people enjoy what you're doing And it's a different enjoyment on the dance floor, I think, because you don't really have, you don't really look to the DJ because, you know, you won't see him anyways. And so you just concentrate on the music and rather close your eyes and just go for it. Maybe that was one of the reasons. But I think in general, I just simply wanted to enjoy myself instead of, you know, being there and being responsible to make everyone else enjoying themselves. But that changed in about 91 when we decided to start doing our own parties because at the time Bremen, as you've been saying, they didn't really have house clubs or there were a few parties where Matthias Heilbronn... He also released a record on our label and he used to work with Deep Dish and he's living in New York since a long time. And Jan Helmerding, who's still in Bremen and still a DJ, but he was more like, I think he's more now into the radio stuff and I don't know exactly what he's doing. But these were the two only ones who were like doing house parties already at the time, rather New York house and then something. something else and some asset house also later on so yeah in 91 we decided we wanted to do something we wanted to do at least a party once a month and that's what I started doing with a friend of mine and then after a few parties they were so successful that the club we were doing the parties at where I used to be bartending they actually asked me if I wanted to become like one of the residents for the Friday night with one of the other guys that was playing rather black music at the time and then R&B and you know So then finally we had a club night going on since 91. It was only about like house and techno. So the reception in Bremen to this was quite good then. People got into the house. Yeah, there was a need for it, you know, and I read about it because it was already like, you know, in 91, it was already there. And in Hamburg, there used to be like the first techno clubs with Unit Club, with Gary D, my label partner, Tobias Lampe. henry stammer johan at the time and they were doing big raves and i think it was even was it the first year of mayday 91 or was it 90 already i don't know but love parade you know they so it's like really took off at the time and and uh even bremen is a small town 600 000 people it needed a place for people to go out to this kind of music And yeah, it was successful for a while. And I don't know if there's something still happening nowadays, but I mean, in general. At the time, people really needed this kind of music. It was a very good time. They also had a lot of English people stationed because of the army. So we had a lot of English ravers with white gloves, you know. And my partner Jens Malstedt, he was playing a lot of the English breakbeat stuff. He always had, you know, like an eye on the English market. And so it was quite an interesting time. I love hearing about what DJs did before they sort of went full-on professional. And you sort of have a great day job that you were doing before that. You were working as a hairdresser, right? Exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah. Was that something you really liked doing or were you just hoping to get out of it? Did you really want to DJ professionally? No. To be honest, I really enjoyed my job. And the only other thing that I wanted to do was something, was had to do something with fashion. The only way to do it for me was to go to learn how to become a tailor, then go to another school and learn more about it. The tailors at the time used to earn 90 euro a month in the first year. Per month? Per month. So there was actually no way to make a living. And since I moved out of my parents' house when I was 17 already. It was actually more or less impossible to survive with this kind of money. So I always knew I wanted to do something creative and I wanted to do something with people. And so I decided, you know, I try hairdressing. In Germany, you have to learn for three years before you can actually do something. You only have to cut for people you bring to the shop. instead of customers. The three years went by pretty fast. As I was saying at the end, I was already bartending at the club, enjoying my weekends and sometimes coming to the salon with a big hangover on Saturdays, of course, with my boss not being very happy about it. I even missed some Saturdays. which actually turned out to be very, they've been very angry with me and sent me home when I arrived at 12 o'clock, one hour before the shop was closing. I put myself together for the final years and then I made it. And then I started working at other shops when I finally had been finished with learning. And I did it, I think, for another four years. And every year I took a break in the summer to go to party in Ibiza. First year was for three months. I think then it was getting less every year, but I always took a break for a few months in the summertime. And every time afterwards I reduced the day I was working. The only problem with it was that if you... If you only work three days a week as a hairdresser, so you're not available for your customers all the week. And if you take a break in the summer, if it's for three months, you're going to lose all customers because they're going to come back three times. And then at the end, I was still working at the same shop, almost making the same money than I used to make when I was working five days because my boss, she really liked me and having me in the shop. But I barely had customers and I got really bored of sitting around waiting for people who walk for walk-ins, right? And then you have to build up. And then before you have built like a new followers of customers, then you're already going on the next vacation time. And then I was like, okay, this is not going to happen. And the same. summer the club owner changed where I used to play and they offered me a job as a regular DJ with even more money which I at the point I finally could have you know survived from because before the money we got to come back to your point before We actually spent even more than that on records. So it was not a job that you could make a living off. It was something you could do to pay off your records, but then you still had to put some more money in to buy all the records that you wanted at the time. And then finally this opportunity came up with a change of the club owners. Unfortunately, the guy hasn't really done anything of what he was promising about the changes in the club. And, uh, So they closed for one month and everyone, when they came back in, saw it was just repainted. And in the months in between, there was another small club opening up, which was actually, for the time, I think the better place for a small town like Bremen. So they lost pretty much all their regulars, even though they'd made some changes on the bar. and all the bartenders and also the DJs we all decided at one point to just quit because this guy was a total uh I don't want to say any bad words but yeah we we all decided to leave and at that time then I finally moved to Hamburg and started working at my nowadays partner uh Superstition Recordings and started doing parties over there in Hamburg It would seem on the surface maybe that being a hairdresser and being a DJ are completely different. But I do wonder if there are some things you might learn from the one that transcends. for over to the other, maybe not necessarily with how to spin records and the physical skills, but having to be sort of personable, making good conversation. I would imagine that these things would serve you well when you start DJing all over the world. Yeah, of course. Like, you know, like being around people you don't know and still like making them feel comfortable or, you know, like make yourself feel comfortable around them. That's definitely something that comes with the first job and is in both jobs, you know, is quite important. The creativity in itself, I think, you know, to find your way of doing things instead of, you know, copying others. Or I think that's another thing that comes with it and which was maybe helpful to do it. Funny enough, there's quite a lot of DJs that used to be hairdressers, though. So there must be a connection for some reason. I don't know what it is, but I try to figure it out, but I can't. And I even spoke to some... others but they all they they all don't know why or what it's it's probably you know as i was saying before you're getting into it because you wanted to do something creative and then you know like making music or like djing is also can have a certain type of creativity uh if you want to put it into doesn't have to So you finally get to Hamburg, which is this music scene that you had in a way been kind of experiencing from afar all along. How did you find it once you got there, once you were actually sort of in the heart of it? I mean, at the time it was already, it has changed already quite a lot. I mean, in the very late 80s, when I started to go out, the front club was mostly, it was a gay club. So it was like 95% gay people, 3% lesbian girls and 2% straight people. So, I mean, in general, the way the party was quite different to any other parties afterwards in the techno world. The whole techno movement in the 90s in Hamburg was more built around, you know, a different scene also about like the... how you say the prostitutes and their pimps those would come out to Hamburg clubs on the Ripper because most clubs used to be on the Ripperbahn and so in the mornings after they finished their usual jobs they would come to the clubs and So it was a completely different scene over there and it was attracting way different people at the time, the music in itself. And the front, I think at the time, Boris was kind of still the resident playing rather. New York kind of vocal house, you know, strictorism kind of stuff. And so that was something I didn't really follow that much. I picked some of the records, but in general, it wasn't really my music to play all night. And I've been always open up to different or various styles instead of, you know, just playing one kind of genre. So it was rather techno-ish these days. And the parties we were doing, we were doing it at the front club, but we were doing it Friday nights and they were... They were open to normal crowds as well. It used to be very hard on a Saturday to get in for straight people. And I've been one of the only lucky ones. And also Martin Lansky, actually, because it's very funny. And another guy who was working at our office. We've all been there at the time at the club without knowing each other or meeting each other at the time. Our parties were more focused on techno, but still like some Chicago house and some minimal stuff already. I think there was a time when I was doing the minimal funk series when we started Raw Elements kind of more or less. Also the second room we would play like some drum and bass and like kind of wall of sound and, you know, this kind of trip-hop. whatever you want to call it. The chill-out room stuff. Yeah, but still danceable, but still with a groove. So yeah, it was quite fun to do both floors at the time. Yeah, you mentioned raw elements. And when you describe the sort of music that you were interested in playing at that time, I mean, that is the sound of that label. Tell me about starting that label. I used to release my records on Superstition. I never felt like it was the perfect home base for my music. I mean, as it was rather techno label with a trancy touch to it. And I mean, I've been a part of the label for a while. it's better for me to place myself in, you know, some, some other, uh, with around some other artists. And, uh, I already understood at the time that it's kind of important to have, you know, some other people that are similar thinking or making similar music around you instead of, you know, just releasing music randomly on some label. So I've been talking to Tobias and telling him that I want to send my stuff to other labels and actually... Or, you know, like, I didn't really feel like this was my real home base or this was like worse releasing on my music in the future. And also some behavior of some artists at the time already I didn't really understood and I don't want to be a part of it at some label parties. So then we kind of talked about it for quite some time and I think it was even him coming up with the idea of, you know, like setting up, building a label around, you know, like the music that I liked. And I gave it a very short thought and then we started Raw Elements. I mean, I came up with the name and all the other stuff, all the artistic side was always on my page. the label was born and then I started releasing my music over there and looking for this label and we started looking for other people to have similar minds or interesting music for us to release that would fit our intention of what we had for the label. You've always released quite a lot of your own music and been relatively prolific in the studio. What was your process like at that time with production? At that time I had a bedroom. studio I had a small room in Hamburg I think it was 12 square meters where I had my mattress my little stack of closes and where i had also like my um i think at the time i was using just a jd800 a small meki 1604 and a akai s950 very cheap alternative to the akai s1000 which i couldn't afford at the time so yeah that was pretty much my setup and since it was my My living room, I was mostly making music all the time. That was the only thing I was doing. Yeah, it seems like quite a sort of monk-like existence. You have this little cell of a room. It's like your mattress, your clothes. your equipment, I mean, there's not room for anything else. Yeah, that's the minimal way of living. And I try to keep it up until today, but unfortunately the record collection got so big that it's one of the biggest things I have to carry around when I ever move. Of course, you know, there are in all the years you earn some more furniture or things like this but in general I kind of like to keep things simple and I think that always reflect in my music try to keep to keep it as simple as possible but still like put enough into the so it's not like super minimal or I mean there's definitely way more minimal stuff than what I'm doing and it was at the time as well when I stopped working at the superstition office I was pretty much spent all the time on working on music and going out and enjoying myself and playing some shows and but I remember that it was even sometimes it was hard to even survive making a living in this small to pay my rent for this room and if my mother wouldn't have support me for a few years, I think would have probably had to stop or find another day job to, you know, make a living. But in general, I think that's at one point for an artist, you have to make a decision. You know, I mean, I've been talking to so many artists and they've been frustrated about, you know, like their situation and they don't play enough gigs to make a living and blah, blah. And I'm telling them. I've been doing jobs for so many years before it finally happened. And I had very small expenses and I've been living on pasta with ketchup for weeks just, you know, to keep on doing what I was doing. And I think a lot of young artists don't understand that they see how, you know, like artists that are around for a longer time, how they make a living. of it and or even like some younger artists that have a business plan or they have been more lucky than them or whatever you know they look at them and think like you know they make ton of money they already fly around the world and i'm still sitting here and it's just you have to wait for it and and most people i think they do the mistake of changing their sound into something more generous people understand it easier or you know, they kind of lose their personality in their music. to try to make it happen for them. And I think it's a bit of a shame because that's what really keeps it interesting, you know, like the personality of someone brought into their tracks. So instead of, you know, trying to make a living as fast as possible, I think it's more important to keep on doing what you really want to do and focus on it. And I think... At the end, it's going to pay off way more than, you know, if you become a popular artist in like a few years, because then the fall is going to be much earlier and it's going to be harder because you never have, you know. He didn't make a lot of friends on the way up. And also, I think another thing which is very difficult for young artists is to be thrown in a big room after you made like three big records. And then you've been thrown in a big room for like 3,000 people. And before you've been probably playing bars for 30 people or 50 people. then you have to entertain them. And of course you're nervous. And a lot of clubs won't book you again if you fail, you know. And it's a shame that they don't even have the chance to, you know, grow on this kind of things. And then after two years they disappear and you never see them again. So it's a combination really of patience, you know, being willing to eat pasta with ketchup and play little bars for a while. But then also perseverance, being willing to stay with what you really believe in, whether or not it's particularly trendy at any given moment. I mean, that really strikes me as sort of being your secret to success over all of these years, is you've really stuck with what you believe in. Yeah, more or less. I mean, in general, I think that today it still works, even though a lot of people come up with a bit. business plan as we have been saying before and it works for them as well it's a different way of of getting into the business but in general I think the way you make more honest fans and if you if you care about what you're doing and if you really want to express yourself instead of you know becoming just a big name DJ you have to eat the pasta for a few months or for a few years and keep on doing what you do and try to make it. And some people may not make it, but this is, in general, this is a problem of artists. It's always hard to survive and to make it. Because, I mean, these days it's definitely harder than it used to be because there's way more people trying to get into the market. But, again, the market is also... much bigger than it used to be. And once people pick up what you're doing, the support through social media can be surprisingly fast-growing without you doing anything at all. And so I think patience is very important. There was sort of one big shift in your sound that I can think of. That's sort of between raw elements and poker flat. But really the big difference was that the music seemed to slow down a lot. Was that something that was sort of in the ether? Was that something that was just a personal preference of yours? I mean, thinking about some of the early raw elements. tracks compared to Loverboy, things definitely got a little slower, a little slinkier. What was going on there? I mean, Loverboy produced in 99. And at the time, you had like two types of music in most clubs. It was especially in Germany, maybe even in the rest of Europe. It was either hard techno called Trance at the time or it was cheesy French filter house kind of disco-ish sound. So at the time I would find myself playing either too slow and too soft or not commercial enough. I remember playing like a house track with full vocals and someone was asking me if I could play some vocal tracks. I'm like, this is a full vocal track, so I don't really... I got the point. But in general, I was kind of fed up with the techno scene because it attracted way more people I don't want to see myself around with. I always kind of got into this. also one of the reasons to get away from normality or you know like the kind of uh i always try to find you know the niche like that where i would find uh people that i really wanted to be around with and uh instead of you know like trying to find the biggest market or something like it and in the 90s there was a lot of techno music especially in germany was attracting a lot of uh people that were just in into the scene because it was kind of they read about it in the magazines and They thought it's hip to do it and they have to do drugs because it's written in the magazine that techno is similar with ecstasy and it all gets together and whatever. In general, I think they didn't really feel the music. They didn't really feel or understood the music at all. They've just been there and they've been a part of the party. Okay. And you're always going to have people. they're gonna come out to the party and not understanding it but being a part of it, it's fine. It's totally important to have a mixed crowd. But at the time it was a lot of people that only came for this reason. It was also losing a lot of the girls and the gays and missing kind of the color in the music movement, in the harder techno stuff that I was playing at the time. So I decided to go rather into some slower and deeper stuff. And I think also at the time in Hamburg, we were playing at a smaller place called The Lounge. And we used to play like Thursday nights and playing like rather, you know, deeper house tracks. And that was kind of one of the influences. I think the tempo just in general got slower, at least with the stuff that I was playing. And then, you know, like, of course, you lower your speed. I mean, coming in the 90s from there was even Gary D at the time. I think you called himself Gary 145 BPM or D or something like this or 145 D. And then he slowed down to 133. still fast but it's incredibly slow for the moment yeah but i mean in general the 90s speeded up quite much and then at the end they slowed down again luckily and uh in the 2000s A lot of the big clubs had closed and then it went all back to smaller clubs and a lot of people who were in it for the love of the music opened clubs and it was a good time for Germany after 1999. I think 1999 was really a big point of change. It was like one of my toughest years in the DJ life because there was no floor where I was really fitting apart from maybe in Hamburg we still had some amazing underground parties happening over there. I remember when I played Loverboy the first time and Audistributor they were like kind of yeah we don't know you know it was a track and the first time I played it out and of course from vinyl because you didn't have anything else to play it off at the time. And then the whole club went nuts. And then they were like, oh man, maybe he's right. Maybe it is a big record. And yeah, that was a good change. But in general, even the track it sold took quite some years to really sell it. It wasn't an instant hit or something. It really took, maybe because it was too early for the time out there. Because as I was saying, people were playing different stuff. That sound that you ended up sort of coming into, this slower, sort of sexier, more minimal sound, was not sort of just limited to what you were doing in the little scene you were part of. I mean, it spread sort of over the course of the next number of years. I mean, when did you get the sense? that what you were playing was sort of part of this maybe larger movement? I don't know. I mean, if you will look at the Cologne style, like before Compact, the Profan and Studio One series, and they already were kind of also on this kind of move, you know, like at the end of the Royal Amidst stuff, they're kind of, you know, doing this kind of... tracks and kind of minimal funky there. they were more German than our stuff, but also, you know, cabinet records at the time and they were getting it. And on the compilations that I did, the minimal funk, I think that kind of shows a lot like the music that I was playing and the labels that were around at the time and doing kind of the stuff that we were doing already. There were some, I remember like minimal funk records. So there were a lot of people. already doing it and then it got more and more as you've been saying and it the sound grew and then people would start to call it minimal at one point and and then it became super popular and I remember at the time again I felt like everyone's doing what we are doing and I would have to find something else because I don't want it to do what everyone else was doing And luckily the hype shifted pretty fast to a rather functional, loopy, lots of effects and just drums. drum kind of tracks or rather again to like back to kind of a techno-ish version of it even though the original idea of minimal was even I wouldn't even say like we came up with the idea because I mean before there was Robert Hood with minimal nation and it was more techno of course but the minimal idea was around from the very beginning in general techno and house music is minimal i mean it has some drums a bass line maybe a vocal and sometimes a synthesizer and that's it it's definitely not that much happening so we never really saw this minimal label even though we like the term of minimal funk for a while because it kind of described the music that it was at the time but Yeah, that's it. I mean, in your mind, how were you sort of thinking about the poker flat sound? Like if you ideally could put it in one section at a record store, where would it go? To be honest, I don't care. In the 15 years we were filed under minimal... We've been filed under tech house, we've been filed under electro, we've been filed under techno, so deep house. It's from impersonal, the music definitely is changing over the years and it's progressing and it's a good thing. What's still important to me is that... that I kind of hear a bit of the roots of the early days of house and techno. And I think it's very important for me personally, at least, that these roots are in the music and that it's not gone too far away from it. Because that's what got me into it. And that's what I'm still feeling. And that's what I'm about. And that's what the label is about, I think, in general. kind of needs to have this connection with the roots of the early days. And then whatever you want to file it under, it's fine for me. I mean, these days, especially with the digital stores, the filing is just, I don't know, if the genre boosts up, then people are going to release everything under that genre. I mean, now look at... look at some of the stores releasing uh afichi tracks or whatever on the deep house you know and then it doesn't really make sense it's not deep house at all and the term loses its meaning yeah totally and i mean and that's very difficult for a lot of labels that still doing deep house for example but yeah i don't i don't blame anyone or i don't i don't really care about it I think in general, it's about music that you like or you don't like and you have to look for it. Nowadays, maybe even more than it used to be because you can't think that people would file it for you because it's not happening anymore. So you have to dig. That idea of deciding what you like and you don't like, like sort of as the head of a label, as an A&R. that kind of becomes your job in a way. And when you did like something, there were sort of three categories of that because you were running three labels at the same time. There was Pokerflat, but also Desus and Audiomatique. How have you kind of divvied up music over the years? Yeah, to divide them easily is... This was definitely the rather deep house, a classic deep house kind of vibe. Then again, Pokerflat would probably rather be like a techno-ish, tech house kind of vibe with, you know, like, as I said, like with an eye on the roots or with an ear on the roots or with a touch to the roots. Audemars Piguet is rather modern kind of sounding, sometimes even, you know, like the very clean kind of crisp sound, where Pokerflat is rather analog kind of sounding, a bit rough and dirty. Yeah, first of all, if I listen to a demo, I don't file it. I just try to understand what it is. see if I like it or if you know if it if it touches me in general I think that's that's the point music has to touch me I don't there's music I like but and I play out but I don't really have any you know attachment to it I don't I don't feel it really but it does its job and it's great to play between like two tracks that for me are big tracks to you know like get from here to there from A to B but For the labels it was always important that it has some sort of soul or some feeling to it that I can really get lost in the sound. And if I really like it, then I decide on which label it goes. Sometimes you hear it from the first beat, if you like it, then this is going to be a Dissu record or a Polka Flat record. Sometimes it's hard, of course, because genres cross and sounds is crossing. But I think lately I've been doing a much better job than I used to do for some time a few years back because then it was even more difficult because no one was really doing Deep House at all. And then it suddenly came back from, you know, the Drunk With community suddenly was rising up. a compost black label was a compost black label yeah yeah compost black so suddenly i was like damn there's people out there they're doing this kind of music why are we not getting the demos right so i had to start digging and uh kind of acquire artists for the label and uh but i mean in general the sound changed and then of course we got a lot of demos again at the time and What I understood over the years is that even as a, or maybe that's a major job these days as an A&R, to really keep your ears open and look for yourself instead of waiting for demos to come to you. Because most demos that have been sent to you have been sent to 5,000 other labels. they don't even care if it's the sound that you're releasing and it's you probably won't find anything interesting enough to release on thousand cds or a thousand demo links or whatever so you rather have to look for you know some artist that just has been releasing one or two releases and then ask them if they want to do something for the label and i found it a much better way to find artists that release great music and that are worth releasing as well because sometimes you discover someone that hasn't released anything and no one really cares about it it's quite sad I mean You sign something and you really believe in it and you're putting it out there and then no one picks it up and maybe you did a remix and then people only pick up the remix and the rest just lies there and no one really plays it and it's great music. you keep on doing this for three four releases and then i don't know it's i think in general for people who haven't released yet i found maybe it's better for them to release on a label that is smaller and grow with a community of friends of them or something like it was back in the days and then being discovered as a whole group or as a you know as a whole like a label whatever and And then maybe go from there to like the bigger labels. But because I think the major problem is that a lot of the people who dig for music, for them, if you're around for 15 years, you're not to dig for anymore because you're obviously releasing something and they think everyone picks it up anyways because you're a big label or whatever. But it's not like this anymore. It's just that in the understanding of a lot of people who still dig for music is that they don't have to look at big labels because everyone else is playing it. But unfortunately, it's not true. So how do you keep things fresh then? If you've been doing a label for 15 years, there are going to be some people who have a preconceived notion at this point of what the label is about. How do you keep people looking at your label? How do you stay fresh? As I said, like trying to look for a new artist, you know, that come up from, you know, like somewhere in the underground, have already this small little following and, you know, like... and release music of theirs and also keep the eyes open for what's going on out there without following trends. We've never been about that and we always wanted to rather do our own kind of sound instead of... that's actually the biggest question that we are asking ourselves how can we you know reach out to the people that we I don't want to say lost but that not really would probably dig for our label or search for our label what we are doing And it's a question unanswered for us. And if you have a solution, I think in general that these are the questions that a lot of labels that have been out there for a long time have to ask themselves. How it's possible to still reach people that haven't heard of the label or they think the label is too popular or something like this. I think some of these people, you will never ever win back, no matter what you do. There's no way. But I think our solution for now is that we keep on doing what we're doing because we do it for the love of it. We hope that people understand it and that there's always going to be great music to find on the labels. And if they like it, they can pick it up. And if they don't, it's fine. But it's definitely worth checking out. I think there's always, you know. quality music and at the end it's all a question of personal taste and people in general shouldn't just look out for the newest shit or you know for the hippest thing on the other end and there's always good music out there and it should be about that and people should look for good music but it's hard to communicate of course in this digital world with people Over the last 15 years with Poker Flat, I mean, there must have been some definite highlights. I'm sure you've been thinking about those a lot over the course of the year. Could you tell us about some of them? The first release of Poker Flat, the Loverboy double action EP, was definitely a very well start for the label because it was selling over the years. Yeah, it's still a big track though, but to set a starting point, it was perfect, even though we couldn't know it was such a big success, of course. And then, of course, a very obvious one is the Trent Muller album that we had a few years back, because it has a very big crossover potential and we sold a lot of... CDs and digital downloads as well. And also got very good feedbacks from, you know, big magazines that would never pick up our usual dance stuff. It was just the right album at the right time. And Anders at the time, he was, you know, just a highly respected artist. He's been doing remixes for Madonna at the time and stuff like this. that was right before he started going into the band stuff that he's doing right now. Yeah, that was a super big one for us. I think we even got a silver CD for Germany and a gold one in Denmark. And I think even major labels would have been probably happy to have this as a part of their releases. The Last Resort was definitely a little bit different from other things that you released on the label. I mean, Trent Muller was definitely in your orbit, but this was a very different sound for Poker Flat. Were you worried about that at all? Totally. I remember when we first... heard it and then I was like I was calling my partner and was like man I love this this is great but do you think we can handle this this is like completely different you know it's not it's kind of working with the sound of the label if you look at it now it's kind of you know it's a bit more crossover in a way through the vocals and you know the arrangements but then again even his dance stuff was already having way more going on than most of our stuff in the arrangements. And yeah, we were a bit worried. We weren't that worried, actually. We were just worried if we can handle it, you know, and if we can get it to the right people, because we knew it was a great album. But we weren't sure if we can handle the amounts because also the hype that was around him at the time. And then I remember when the people requesting for more copies and the problem with the digital CD market, you had to put out a lot of CDs to get into the stores. And the way it works is if they don't sell it, they're going to send it back to you and you have to give them the money back. So they were asking for another 10,000 copies. And then we were like, okay, let's do five, you know, and see how it goes. Then the next week was that we need another 10,000 copies. copies added up and we were at the point where we were thinking if this ever comes back to us then we're so bankrupt well luckily it didn't and it all worked out at the end and so yeah that was a quite of a shaky moment for us but it all turned out very well uh yeah for a young uh well not a young but for for a small independent label this is the dream to have a big hit but then when you realize what that actually means it's probably been scary right i mean nowadays where like the cd is mostly non-existent in the market it's it doesn't care you you put it up there and uh in the digital stores and you know you don't have any more you the only thing you can lose is the amount of money that you put into the the the press you know but in the marketing but with the cds you know knowing that if the stuff gonna come back you have to pay for it you're never gonna get the money for it that's uh that's a tough one yeah You sort of made a clean break with Raw Elements back in the day, going into Poker Flat. Do you ever think about making a clean break again and starting fresh? I did have a small thought five years ago when we were turning 10 years and we had exactly 100 releases. I'm kind of like the magic of numbers in a way. And I thought one label, 10 years, 100 releases is a good point to stop. And I had a conversation with my partner about it. And we've been saying that it could make sense to, you know, leave it as it is and start something new. But then we were asking ourselves, what would we do differently? so what would be because doing the same thing just under a different name doesn't really make sense yeah then we figured out that we would probably not change anything apart from maybe the artwork and the name but funny enough we changed a lot of the artists afterwards and even the sound changed a little bit because of the change of artists But in general, the major idea why we're doing the label is still the same. And so for us, then it was fine to keep on doing it. And also we had created the brand and why not, you know, like living with it. And even though we knew we're not going to win people back who come to like the label because they just discovered it as a new thing or something like it. Yeah, we decided to keep on doing it this way. And so I think until this idea doesn't change, and it probably won't change in the next 15 years, we might keep up doing this if we still find enough. people doing this kind of music, finding enough demos to release it and still finding enough support from the people to keep on doing this as well, of course. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you
