Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Scott Monteith is one of the world's foremost purveyors of dub techno, an artist devoted both to its roots and to its future. Growing up in Toronto's rave scene in the mid-90s, though, Monteith had many of the same touchstones as a lot of kids back then, namely Plastic Man and Drum and Bass. Once the city quieted down, Monteith moved on to Montreal, where he found himself amid one of the most creative hubs of electronic music in the world at the time. Alongside Akifin, he's one of the most important local producers associated with the city's Mutech Festival. Nowadays, however, he makes his home in Berlin, where he says the city has inspired him to make more dancefloor-orientated music. until his most recent album, Drawn and Quartered, put lie to that by sounding like one of his most ambient releases yet. Clearly some explanation was necessary. So I sat down with Monteith earlier this month to talk about all of that and more. So tell me about the rave scene in Toronto in the mid 90s. What was it like? I mean, I guess I started getting involved in things. I went to my first party in 93, I think. And I'm not really, really aware of what was going on. here at the time but I mean to my knowledge as far as certainly as far as drum and bass is concerned it was the biggest scene outside of London and there and in terms of the size of the parties and the scope of what was going on I mean you had multiple events of several thousand people going on every weekend for several years and And whether it be, well, there was sort of a focus, I guess, on drum and bass and jungle. And then on the other side, trance and horrible happy hardcore parties and things like this going on. There were also people like Alien Visitation and Transcendence that were doing really, really good parties more in line with techno and I guess what became to be known as minimal and more experimental things. It was crazy, really. It was such a... For a city so removed from Europe geographically, the fact that it was so vibrant and there was so much going on is really quite amazing in retrospect. Why do you think that it became so vibrant, so much going on? I think that there was a lot of, I mean, the guys from some of the main players that were doing parties, like the guys who were running the Pleasure Forest parties and the Dose parties, there were quite a few UK expats that sort of brought the whole jungle and hardcore sound with them and also saw an opportunity where you had a city that had a lot of industrial space, a lot of space generally. I mean, Toronto is, even though the population I don't think is, if it's 5 million, it may be 5 million now, I'm not sure, but... It's a massive, massive, massive city. I mean, the urban sprawl is incredible. So there were a lot of empty spaces, industrial spaces, to do these sorts of events. And it was really, I mean, I suppose as it was everywhere, I mean, there was the, in terms of interference from the authorities and things like this to begin with, they had no idea what was going on. It was really, you know, there was nothing, they had nothing, no reference point. with which to deal with these things. I guess I was 16 when I started. Were you sneaking out of the house to go to these parties? No, nothing quite so dramatic. I mean, I'd been already for a couple of years playing in a band with friends of mine where we used to go and spend a lot of the time. at the guitarist house and be like okay i'm gonna go over to dave's for the night whatever so it wasn't really uh um yeah there wasn't there wasn't uh too much line involved you know like that my parents knew i was going to toronto to to do these things and i whether they knew what that what the context of that was is uh is questionable but What kind of band were you in? It was a band called Lucidity, and it was a really super stoner rock, acid rock, like whatever. I mean, I guess prior to that, listening to a lot of stuff coming out of Seattle at the time and things like this. Yeah, it was just a bunch of guys doing drugs and making, yeah. Had you gotten into industrial and stuff by that time, or was that before? That was sort of kind of in between. Like, it was the... I met up with some people in Kitchener at the time who were very much into COIL and Nurse with Wound and Psychic TV and all these sorts of things. And there was not a big scene for that, but sort of a small and quite tight community and some guys involved in making stuff. in that ilk sort of thing, or of that ilk. And that was really when the band thing all of a sudden became very uninteresting. Listening to that stuff and not having any idea where, how the sounds were being generated and how they were putting the things together was really, really amazing to me. So that was really, all of that realm of things was really my sort of jumping off point in terms of electronic music and more, I guess, experimental music in general. You seem to have a similar experience to Public Enemy as well in saying that you... couldn't figure out how they'd gotten the sound. Absolutely. I mean, I remember getting Public Enemy, I think Public Enemy, A Nation of Millions, I think was the third or the fourth tape that I bought. You know, I bought when I was like 12 or something like this. um run dmc raising hell probably because it said raising hell you know and it was really but uh yeah i mean nation of millions was really that again was like i mean at that age really being like wow what what is this you know and really yeah i suppose raising how was even slightly had more meaning in your household um considering your father was a minister yeah i mean my father's uh He's a minister with the United Church in Canada, which is if Christianity was engaged in a political spectrum, they're definitely the socialists. They ordain gay and lesbian ministers. As far as that, at least socially and ethically. I guess they're as nice as Christians can be. You definitely referred to them in a previous interview as hippies, your parents. Yeah, yeah. I mean, definitely in terms of their outlook on life and in terms of their... interaction with society and their and their whatever political views and things like this and and and i mean the fact that they um i was involved um at a really really young age with um with the whole um what what was born out of the whole sort of like a peace movement in in in rural quebec and and they did um events called youth forums that were sort of weekend long get togethers for teenagers between the age of like 12 and 12 and 18 to discuss the environment and just You grew up between Kitchener and rural Quebec, correct? Were you at all affected by the Quebec situation? stuff or did that come later when you eventually moved to Montreal? Were you even affected by it? Well, I was, I mean, personally, but whatever, psychologically quite affected by it in that, I mean, I grew up, we moved to Quebec when I was eight or something like this and moved to a small village basically called Richmond, which used to be In the 60s and 70s had some industry, like whatever, shoe manufacturing industry, which had long since departed. It's also in an area in the eastern townships which is sort of the kind of last enclave of English-speaking community there. So it was a pretty... pretty dire and depressing place to be. I mean, I made some really, really great friends when I was there. But in general, it didn't present a lot of opportunity outside of playing sports at school and listening to Guns N' Roses and Metallica and drinking beer, you know? Do you think that's why music became such a... Absolutely, completely. I mean, there was really... I think sort of to begin with, because of the, I mean, the only sort of alternative culture within that community was hippie stuff, because it was, this was the, whatever, alternative culture that was offered by the parents of kids who were sort of outsiders within the community. So whatever, the Grateful Dead and all of this kind of stuff, Led Zeppelin and all of this kind of stuff was... the alternative to Guns N' Roses and Metallica and Scorpions and all of this crap. But yeah, I mean, later, I think, as a result of this sort of alienation and isolationism, both culturally and also really, really struggling when I moved there with the language. Because growing up in, with rare exception, growing up in the rest of Canada, even though French is the official second language. you'll find a vast majority of Canadians that don't speak a word of it. And in my case, didn't even start learning French until grade... five or something like this um so that too was a real real struggle um but yeah i mean going back to the the music thing uh as a result of the alienation of that um environment i did spend a lot of time whatever ordering ordering tapes from columbia music club and things like and whatever, discovered the charlatans and the whole sort of like, variety of different things that really sort of whatever piqued my interest in music. When you first started going to raves in Toronto, then was that sort of your first experience with a mass movement of people all sort of liking the same music as you do? Absolutely. Because I mean, with the, as I say, I mean, the first prior to that with the whole sort of industrial thing. I was really, really into it and went to, there were events going on with this small sort of community of people in Kitchener. But the thing is that those events were populated by people that were 10 years my senior and really there was no scene associated with that. I mean, all of that stuff happened, that stuff started happening before I was born. You know, there was nothing. nothing really to, to whatever sink your teeth into, um, for me anyway. Um, and yeah, I mean, absolutely. The, the going to the rave scene, the first going to the first raves in Toronto and the first events also, I mean, also in Kitchener in London and Detroit. And, um, that was totally mind blowing for me. It was really, that was, yeah, definitely there. a major turning point. At a certain point during a rave, I guess, you heard Dub Tech now. In Toronto, I believe. Yeah, it was actually the first time. He may have done it before, but to my knowledge, I think it's the first time that Richie ever played Plastic Man live. And it was for a party thrown by this group of people under the name Transcendence. And it was called Plastic Man, Red Plastic Flyers. And they actually had the, I think the other DJs that night were Jeff Milligan was playing under his algorithm alias at that point. A guy called Murat and another guy called a place called Bliss. And it was his set that he played. It was probably Quadrant Dub or one of the early Basic Channel tracks, but I specifically remember being totally transfixed and really being like, okay, this is really something different. so But at the same time, Richie was the draw to that one. Totally. I mean, we were, yeah, we were devote plastic man heads. I mean, we followed him around all over the place, Toronto, London, Detroit, Chicago, out to the even further party that the drop base guys were doing in Milwaukee. Like we really, yeah, we were totally. What was so special and different about what he was doing at the time? Well, I think, um, I don't think that because of, because there was so much of the acid stuff going on, um, whatever, again, with the drop base guys, with Woody McBride, with, uh, with, lots of people at the time even Damon Wilde and a lot of people out of New York that acid was really like a a pretty central focus stylistically at that point and I don't think I think that his was so much more spacious than everything else that was going on and so much more patient. But I think that there's also, and I mean, in some ways you can say it's something that's carried through all the way up to now with him, is there's also a certain, I don't know. cultishness with the whole with the whole plastic band phenomenon you know and and that was that was present um from the very very beginning you know there was there was a there was a uh i think an incredible devotion um from people that were into that stuff uh right from the very very beginning i mean he was traveling around even when he was playing in toronto or elsewhere there were five foot tall girls from Detroit who were like right with heads in the speaker, you know, for absolutely at every show. And it didn't matter where you went to go see him play. Those girls were there with their heads in the speaker at the very, very front. Were you with your head in the speaker as well? Yeah, totally. Absolutely. I mean, Mike Shannon and I spent a good deal of time with our heads in the speaker together. You started DJing at some point. mostly ambient. And then Dub Techno. The first time that I ever DJed was at Mike Shannon's house, actually. There was a good friend of ours, Neil Ramsey, who was pretty instrumental in terms of that. He's originally from Glasgow. And in terms of the scene in Kitchener was a real instrumental force in terms of bringing all of that music to that, to our group of friends. And yeah, at his house one day he dumped a crate of ambient records on me. He was like, well, why don't you go upstairs and play? And I did so. And yeah, it's all very different after that. Were you mostly, it's beatless stuff, just mixing kind of Mixmaster Morris style? Totally. New London School of Electronics, whatever, Future Sound in London, all of that stuff. I mean, to begin with, it was really just incredibly, I didn't know what the hell I was doing. It was really just a fascinating process of putting sounds together and being able to... build something, so to speak. You were playing in chill-out rooms, which are kind of lost to the ages these days. Yeah, which is really, really sad, actually. In fact, the first events that I ever did myself were ambient parties. And I had Matthew Houghton up to play one time. mostly dealing with a couple of guys. A guy named, probably the real name is actually Eric Downer, and he was the sort of go-to ambient DJ guy from Toronto for a long time. Another guy by the name of Dave Bodrick, who's done a lot of work under the name Dub Gnostic and a variety of other things who I connected with because he was a total... 23 obsessed psychic tv obsessed kind of uh came from that whole industrial scene and was involved with uh did a lot of weird uh ritual parties with uh nevec ogre from skinny puppy and but uh yeah i mean to begin with it was the that was the that was the stuff um that that that i connected to the most deeply, I guess, and always really enjoyed at the bigger parties in Toronto. I mean, they all had proper ambient rooms and spent a lot of time just completely tripping out in the ambient rooms a lot of the time. You said you were throwing ambient parties as well. Yeah. What did those look like? and how long were they running? They were really small. I think I only did four of them. And there was a cafe in Kitchener, which I think was talked about in the interview with Mike and Eddie called the Enchanted Forest. That was a real magnet for maniacs like us. It has the name. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. And yeah, I mean, that was, even though it was on a small scale and maybe you could have maybe fit 100 people in there, if that, those first actions of being, whatever, totally able to transform and control an environment was really, really inspiring. When did you decide that making music was something that you wanted to do? I think I started making music when I moved up to Montreal after I'd been there for about a year. And it was really quite by accident, really. I mean, there wasn't really... I wasn't working very much, I had a lot of time on my hands. My first roommate there was the first person I knew that had a high speed internet connection. And spent a lot of time online and finding out about tracker software and Rebirth eventually when it came out. this whole sort of environment of acid and Plastic Man and everything was a total revelation, you know, like it was making tapes and tapes and tapes of sound-alike Plastic Man tracks. You moved to Montreal when? Just before I turned 18. So that would have been in... 96 I guess yeah, and you were making some music and hanging out soaking up the local scene Yeah, it was basically I mean I am I basically needed to I Kind of lost the plot in Toronto a little bit by that point and gotten really really wrapped up in more of the hard drug scene that was going on there at the time. The whole, I mean, many people would say that the whole scene in Toronto, one of the reasons that it's collapsed was because of crystal meth and how that changed, obviously changed the vibe of the parties for the worse, but also... Yeah, changed the economics of that game quite a lot. And I know quite a few people who had their kind of lost the plot at that point. And it was, as I say, it was important for me at that point to really... break out and start fresh. As I'd been in growing up and spent some time in Quebec before, I had a lot of friends who were had moved up to Montreal and it was a really logical, it was an easy decision to do that. What was going on at the time in Montreal? It seemed like Toronto was quite vibrant, as you said, although it was maybe on the downward slope. Well, I mean, Montreal also has had a very, I mean, in many ways you can say that Montreal's had a... that the scene in Montreal has been running even longer than in Toronto because there was such a, I mean going back even to the 70s, there was a huge, huge disco scene and always a big two-hour scene within the gay community there. And I think, I mean at that point, this is just after, probably around a few years before. Tiga started throwing parties, eventually opened what was definitely the best after-hours club probably ever in Montreal called Sona. And there was a... But there was a more... I guess less sort of perfectly niched out and scenes in Montreal than there were in Toronto. I mean, in Toronto you could really sort of tell which tiny thread of electronic music people went into based on the width of their pants and the color of the chain. You know, like it was really... And the scene in Montreal just seemed a lot freer. You know, like there was Sona, as I say, the club, I mean, they would have the bar, which opened to start with, that opened at 11 or 12 or something like this, playing house music. The basement was hip-hop and drum and bass. And the main room was techno. And there seemed to be a lot more willingness with people in Montreal generally to just sort of go out and have a good time and not worry so much about which camp they were repping. Which camp were you repping when you got to Montreal? When I got to Montreal, I was really... I had actually... I was super, super into drum and bass. Like, I was really... I'd always been interested. I mean, it... techno was always sort of the base for me. And I'd always been, always liked jungle and went to a lot of jungle parties, a lot of German bass parties. But it was right around the time, I think, that the first V recordings, records, things like Warhead, I crossed the early Ed Russian optical stuff. whatever, FOTEC, all of this. This was the point where that started to draw my interest more, just because from the techno side of things, that was right around the time when it became this total loop-based, percussive, whatever, techno, which was, got really good. You know, it was really, I mean, to go and just get absolutely battered by the same shit for hours and hours and hours. Yeah, it became really boring. And I think in terms of the sound and in terms of experimentation and everything like this, at that point, what was going on in Drum and Bass was much more interesting to me. Around that same time, perhaps, there were parties going on that led up to Mutech. So there were people coming in to... town that you were seeing yeah i mean the first i guess i think the first if i'm not mistaken i think the first uh event that went under the mutec name was uh at the um a space called excentris where um alain mangeau who's the director of mutec was doing um some curation and also he at that point was um curating the audio and some video aspects of the FCMM Festival, which is the Festival de Nouveau Cinéma et Média. And I think the first event under Mutech banner was with David Christian, Neotropic and Pole. And I had met Alain and Eric, another guy who was involved with Mutech previously, at one of the parties that we were throwing. We had brought Jeff Milligan and Mike up to play, and they showed up to sort of check things out. as a result, ended up going to see this concert with, at Exxon Tris, and it was, yeah, it was a pretty, pretty important jumping off point. It was really... What did you make of Alain when you first met him? What did I make of Alain when I first... Well, he's, I mean, he's... Shit, that's difficult. I think he can come off as kind of cold to people to begin with. Cool and calculated, perhaps. But yeah, he's a tough egg to crack, but a fast friend once you do. And... I guess it was striking that here's this guy who's bringing in some of these artists that you're familiar with and enjoying. Obviously, he clearly was on the same wavelength. Totally. I mean, the really mind-blowing point for me, I mean... I didn't know, I actually didn't know Pole at all when I didn't, Neotropic I knew a little bit. I knew because Ninja Tune has their North American office there. So they really, really had pretty good exposure in Montreal and were doing really, really good parties at that point actually. But the really, I guess the really mind-blowing event for me was during, as part of SCMN, they did a chain reaction night and brought Porter Rix and Monolike and Rene and Pete and Sion to DJ and totally blew my head off. I mean, this was stuff. that I'd been following for quite a few years at that point. And this being sort of not pre-internet, but like really with very little, there was one website called zirconium.de that had some... of whatever sketchy information about who some of these people were and where they were from and things like this. But beyond that there was nothing. There was really nothing to be had except the records. Just the very idea of actually seeing some of these guys in person was really, really, really mind-blowing. Tell me about the first Mutech. I mean, it seems like for a lot of people it was kind of a milestone moment in a way in what was going on in Montreal because you had the Montreal smoked meat thing that came out maybe a year after it. Yeah. Well, I mean, for me, it was really, I played my first live set ever at Mutech. The first record that I ever did came out after Mutech, or just before Mutech, I'm not sure which. I met Mark Ackufan for the first time. He had just moved back from Windsor. Yeah, and started to get to know LA and a lot of the, who have become the sort of Mutech. team. And outside of even just the sort of local what has become family stuff, I mean, again, another mind-blowing situation to have people like Vladislav Dele and Kit Clayton and Seth Sutak and all of the guys coming up from San Francisco and Thomas Brinkman seeing all of these guys in the flesh. was uh and when i mean when the lineup first came out it was really like are they serious like they're really going to bring all these weirdos in from from all over the place um and it was really yeah completely completely incredible on all levels in terms of making connections um with the local and also the international community um And the, I mean, the other thing, I mean, thinking back to it now, it was really small too. And, you know, it's like, it's really, it was, I think there was, uh, the biggest, the biggest night was maybe with, with, uh, with Brinkman and, and, and Riley Reinhold, um, maybe 300 people or something like this. It was a really, really, really small, very, very intimate event. Um, You say that it was very helpful in making international connections, obviously, that people were coming in. Did it feel like something was happening locally, though? Like that you guys were on par with the people that were coming in? I think that the... I mean, as I say, I only met Mark for the first time at the festival. I think after the festival, particularly with the first two OTEC records that Martin Dumais put out, my first record, and... second record of Mark's, also that Eric Mattson, who was curating the festival at the time, the first oral record of Mark's, the first acuvane record that came out. When, I mean, with Mark's stuff, you can say that it was primarily Thomas Brinkman went back and said, hey, this guy we need to listen to, you know. And the compact guys got on board with distribution and things like this and that. That recognition. And some of his first records came out on Trapez, right? That was afterwards, yeah. That was a couple of years afterwards. Riley's. Exactly. But yeah, I mean, another direct connection that you can draw from that first mutech. The following year, Mark and I and Vincent Lemieux all went, came to Europe for the first time and stayed at Riley's house in Cologne, you know, and played for Zip here in Berlin at the old, old Panorama Bar. Yeah, so, but I mean, back to the original question, I mean, that was, it was just slightly after the festival that when that recognition from abroad started to arrive, that we were like, oh, okay, well, maybe we do have something going on here, you know. Did it translate to things going on in the city after the festival, or was the festival sort of like the one time? year that everything came together. At that point, for the first couple of years, there were quite a lot of events that ran smaller. I mean, never anything huge. There was a sense, I think, in the sort of whatever, hipster, sinster, cool kid. scene as a whole that at that point, like whatever, okay, techno, minimal, this is, this stuff's cool, you know, so there were events going on. That's petered out over time. But yeah, I mean, at least even outside of the whatever, any sort of regular club nights or regular, um, whatever parties or anything like this, there was definitely a group of us that, that solidified quite strongly. And, and whether there was an event going on or not, we were sitting around and getting wasted and listening to each other's music. Was this, uh, was that I vaguely remember in an interview you saying there was a sort of a formal group that got together and listened to tracks and sort of critiqued each other's work. Yeah. Dominate or dom something. No, this was what you're talking about. This is after, that's a little bit later after, not so much, but when John Barry moved to... moved the Mill Plateau and Foursink office up from New York to Montreal. And we had our demolition nights. Demolition. Yeah. sitting around and tearing each other's stuff and other people's stuff to shreds. It seems like John moving up there is actually also a pretty important thing in terms of the international reach of what was going on. Absolutely. I mean, you can, I mean, although there was like a little bit of buzz about things previous to that. The Montreal Smoke Meat compilation really gave whatever international focus to that thing as a whole. There are some people that say, and might not be wrong, that he came up to begin with as well to head on Mark a little bit. And I think, whatever, obviously my way both for Mark and for the scene as a whole was a real major, major turning point and really shot things up to a whole other level. It came out about six months a year after Montreal Smoked Meat? I think something like that. I think it was 2002, I think it came out. Something like this. Did you think Mark had that in him, that record? Yeah, I mean, there was no... I mean, he was really... I mean, that whole period leading up to the record with the psychometry series for Trapez and... The amount of remixes and everything that he was, I mean he was really on fire. He was really producing so, so much music and just not missing, you know? Like there was never, he just couldn't make a wrong step. What about your own work around that time? You released a record before Mutech, you said, maybe just before. Yeah, the first one, which was on Otech, which is now long gone. After that, I did a record for Jeff Milligan's label for Revolver that he was running at the time. And then later on for Background, which was run by Andy Vaz, who now does Your Records. and he was doing a lot of, he did a record with Mark, one with Sue Tech, one with Kit Clayton, and was sort of cherry-picking a lot of stuff from that whole scene, that sort of laptop, whatever, glitchy techno business. Where did your sound fit into that? I don't know. I think I was... To begin with, I don't think I was really... I was just so excited to be involved with this thing that was happening and the energy around the whole scene in Montreal that I don't think I was really all that concerned with crafting. sound, so to speak. I was just shooting things out there and seeing what happened. Do you think you have a sound now? Totally. Yeah, of course. What is that sound? And when do you think you got it? Was there a record that things clicked? I think that the... I think that the whole kind of, I mean, there's always been this sort of whatever echoed washy dubby crap, whatever in, in, in all the records, you know, but I think that the point when, um, that became a sort of, um, focused working processor or set of parameters was, um, the first, um, micro mute tech event that happened, I think in, I think also in 2002 when, um, Alain brought over the Scion guys with Tiki Men and asked me to play before. And... This is just before I was working on some material to send to Stefan for Scape and just kind of pounded out a set really fast over. I was like, okay, well, this is more kind of W stuff. Let's see what happens. Let's try this out. And in the end, the material that I played that night ended up being... coming wildlife documentaries by and large. I mean, there was some other stuff with it as well. And I think that, I mean, it's quite typical of Alain as well to sort of, I mean, one of the things outside of just throwing the festival and everything that he's been a very sort of positive influence in a lot of our lives is just kind of dropping suggestions or slowly kind of like just kind of pushing your boat in a direction, but without any real force, you know, just saying, okay, well, what about going down this direction, you know? And more often than not, those little nudges bear fruit. And that's definitely... In that particular case, it was something that was really very strongly true for me. Did he say something to you about the set? Or was it just the very fact that he booked you as the opening person in front of them? No, he never said anything specifically. It was really just the... I guess the sort of act of saying beyond saying it wasn't just like, oh, maybe you can do that. It was sort of like, so we're booking these guys for this, which you know very well and you know the context of. I think it would be really great if you opened for them, you know. And with all of the weight of everything else that's unsaid behind that statement, you know, being like, oh, okay, holy shit, okay, what am I going to do here, you know? So when you put together this set and you performed it, you felt like, wow, this is, I'm onto something here. Well, yeah, I mean, it played quite a few times. Not that many times, but quite a few times in Montreal at that point. And always got kind of positive feedback. And people were like, oh, thanks. You know, like, good job, whatever. Who's the next DJ? And that was the first one that people were really like, okay, holy shit. Great. Good job. You know, like, that was amazing. Yeah, so I think that feedback was really, yeah, made me realize that I was, that my ship had been pushed in the right direction, I guess. I think in an interview you called that chapter two of your artistic, your music. What chapter are we on now? Good question. I have no idea. Maybe, yeah, I don't know. Four or five, something like that. Yeah, I really don't know where... I don't think it's... I think it's busted out of the... I don't think it's got a linear cover-to-cover trajectory anymore. I think it's gone... diagonal or vertical or something. It does seem like you're generally in the same sphere, but every album since then has been kind of like, okay, I'm going to explore this idea really blatantly and see what I can get out of this. Yeah. And I mean, whatever, for better or worse, you know, there's... Sometimes the... What's been worse? Journeyman's Annual was a very difficult album for a lot of people. It was a very difficult album for me to deal with afterwards or to deal with the response to. it was written at a difficult point in my life and also at a point where the electronic music scene in Montreal had totally bottomed out and there was really nothing going on. And, um, this was like, Oh, six or seven. Yeah. Something like that. And, um, I started, I was doing, I just recently started doing a reggae and dub night with my friend Moss. And so the whatever sort of regular weekly outlet that I had for music and where I was taking in music was in this more kind of like a dance hall context. And as a result of that, I think that really had a major influence on the record, obviously. Whether that... I think the thing is that that one... I've always, I think I've always sort of struggled because I'm not even sure myself what kind of, which team I'm playing for, so to speak. Like, I don't know which, like, I like to make, I like techno. I want to make dance floor tracks. I like to make listening tracks and I like to sit and listen to music quite deeply. Always just sort of try and find a happy medium between all of that stuff. And that one, I think, I don't know if a lot of people would agree that the happy medium was found. You know, like it was really, if you don't like, dancehall's pretty. pretty simplistic and pretty, pretty poke you in the forehead, um, rhythm structures and, and, and everything. And if, uh, if you're not into that sort of first principle, then that, that record, um, probably isn't going to be for you. This was coming at a time, though, that you were clearly exploring that stuff in a deeper way. You've always said that you went backwards almost. from the dub techno stuff to the origins. Yeah, no, totally. I mean, starting the reggae night with Moss goes by the name of Mossman as a producer and a DJ. And it's safe to say that he's probably the most devout... archivist of Jamaican music in Canada. He's definitely got the biggest collection. He's really, he's a total encyclopedia for the most obscure tracks, sevens and everything that you're going to find. And that, I mean, particularly in the context of, as I say, the sort of electronic music thing not being cool anymore and there being less and less sort of events within that realm of things, it was really, really important to meet him and to have this whole other world of music to explore. I mean, that one is, it's really, I mean, there's a lot of techno records out there, but there are... absolutely infinite number of reggae records, you know, and it's really... Had you not explored that stuff that much before that? I mean, I think I had this sort of precursor Smokeweed 2 of King Tubby compilations and maybe whatever, whatever, The Wailers, Burning Spear, that kind of thing, but nothing... Nothing too major. What made you want to run this night with him? I mean, was it... educational as much as it was fun. I think at the time, I mean, he ran the night, um, for many, many years. Um, I think even starting into the, the, the late nineties, um, and then just sort of got tired of it and kind of bitter with the whole thing in general. And I mean, running a weekly, it, it takes, it takes it out of here. It's really, it's a very, very tiring experience. Um, And as I was starting to kind of independently explore the more sort of roots and whatever Jamaican end of the dub spectrum, his name kept coming up with friends within Montreal and everybody. He just kept saying, oh, you've got to meet Moss. You've got to meet Moss. So I really actively went and sought him out. And as I say, I mean, at the time he was kind of done with doing the weekly and was just kind of sitting at home and being a bit of a bitter bastard, you know. So I was like, hey, you know, let's start doing this thing again. we did and and uh i really got the had a really really good run of it for for A year and a bit, a couple of years even. What was some of the stuff that he brought to your attention that you hadn't really heard before that you were surprised by, that you really enjoyed? I think most strongest one, the biggest influence was a lot of the dance hall, digital dance hall stuff that like I was really totally, totally unaware of. And again, I mean, as I was saying about that, whatever the journeyman, journeyman's annual album, I mean that it's, it's, it's interesting because it's so. polarizing dancehall that like people really really love it or or absolutely hate it you know um and uh i mean i think like with everything there's there's there's good stuff within that realm of things and bad stuff and i mean i think with uh with a lot of uh jamaican music in general from or a lot of whatever reggae in general There's just so much that's been made. You do have to wade through a lot more chaff to find the gems than you might with some other kinds of music. Around that time you left after the night, I guess, wound up? With him? Yeah, it was still sort of going on. There was... He sort of... I had last time, I was starting to come over to Europe more and more to play, which was nice. He too sort of got, again, got... kind of tired with that just the whole running the weekly thing and dealing with that sort of local politics and things like this. and was passing it off more and more to other DJs. He also started to travel a lot more. He got involved as the music director for a film that just came out, I think last year now, called About Rocksteady. And he was the sort of executive producer on the music end of things with that. But yeah, there was the combination of... divorce and the fact that I was spending so much more time coming across the pond anyway just sort of made the move to Berlin a kind of logical choice. It seems like from all the Canadians that I talked to you know you hear the European they're coming over more and more but every single one of them has like uh also a personal life like moment where they're like and that was the moment in which i could like go over totally do it yeah no completely um so what's changed i think there's probably a lot of divorces when i think about it it's really yeah uh what's changed then for you since you've been to Berlin in terms of your music, the way you make it, and what's come out, what you've been interested in? I mean, what does Berlin give you? I think that to begin with, there was definitely, I started to focus more on dance floor stuff simply because I was in a place where I could actually go and hang out on dance floors quite a few nights a week and was not... Yeah, I mean, the good parties in Montreal were happening kind of fairly few and far between for the last stage of being there. So yeah, being able to go out and listen to more techno in-house and things like this definitely propelled me kind of back in that direction rhythmically. Financially and professionally, it was a great move to make. It's nice to be able to pay the bills and nice to be able to travel so much. without having to go fly for seven hours every weekend. As far as the new label goes, you mentioned, obviously, that Scape closing was a big reason that you decided to open it up. What... Can we expect, is it only going to be your own stuff? To begin with, it's going to be just my stuff. And whatever for special projects, I mean, I think that we'll probably, Steve and I are really eager to do more Krakow stuff again, whether that comes out of Black Arts, I'm not sure. I mean, it's sort of like if nobody else wants it, then it will come out there. Yeah, so to begin with, it's just going to be for my stuff and for kind of special collaborative projects and that sort of thing. But yeah, I'm 100% open to releasing other people's stuff as time goes on as well. It's not just going to be a dub techno label? Totally no. No, no, 100%. Speaking of which, the Radio Rothko mix I wanted to talk a little bit about. Why do you think the... I mean, you mentioned in the interview that it seemed like that stuff was coming around again at the time that you did it. why do you think that stuff was coming around again at that time? And why do you think it was worth bringing, you know, some of this old stuff and mixing it with new stuff? I think it's pretty clear that, I mean, in my mind, it's quite clear that... around that time as dubstep sort of started its meteoric rise there was this strain of things with Martin and Scuba and 2562 and these sorts of guys that people were whatever pigeonholing is involved in this sort of Berlin, whatever London access, this sort of like techno meets dubstep thing. Whether that was in actual fact, whether there was any truth to that in terms of interactions between people or people working together or anything is pretty... flaky, I think, but they, in the end, think that the journalistic conclusion drawing probably led a lot of people to be like, okay, well, what's this dub techno end of things that people are talking about? What is this stylistically? What are people referring to here? Do you think it was dub techno? I always got the... that it was dubstep and techno and the techno that was being banied about didn't really have much to do with dubtech now. Yeah. I mean, I think that the, I think that the, that sort of, uh, kind of wispy, uh, darker end of the more experimental end of the, of, of dubstep at the, at the time or more techno end of stuff at the time, um, aesthetically, um, has a lot to do with, um, more dub techno stuff, you know? So I think that that surge of things, um, probably brought, um, people that were into things from, from more of the dubstep perspective, um, over to the techno camp as well, you know? And I mean, I think, yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure if, if, um, I don't know. It's a strange one. Like, I think that in some ways, I think that I always felt that that connection that was being written about so much and that was being so concentrated on was quite tenuous, you know, that there are... Why these things ebb and flow and why some things sort of bubble to the surface at different times, I'm not really 100% sure. You know, there's... I mean, I think that in some ways... I think you could also, it may be that this sort of resurgence, not just in dub techno, but in house and also the more sort of harder strains of techno and everything are kind of a backlash against that whole minimal explosion of a few years ago, you know, that people were really like, okay. we need something else, you know, and to go forward in many situations, you have to look backward. I think Dub Techno gets a bad name in a lot of journalists' minds as being stuck in a rut in some ways. Well, I think for journalists that have been around the block a few times, I mean, this is sort of, in many ways, you could sort of see this as the third wave of that stuff. That there was the first one being with the first Basic Channel Records and Chain Reaction and all of this thing, which spawned... a million imitators uh and then crashed and burned and and went back down under the sea so to speak um then a few appropriate metaphor exactly exactly and uh then uh a few years later with um i don't know with that sort of micro house scene and that sort of sub sub sub genre of that and the influence, that influence again sort of coming up with the first Luomo record and a lot of the stuff that was coming out on Mill Plateau and Forest Tracks and things like this that was sort of like dub house. end of things, which again spawned a million imitators and then crashed and burned and sunk back out of the sea. And now there's this, whatever, this kind of third wave of things that have happened. And I guess outside of the whole where, what new interests the whole dubstep scene may have... United in that. I think there's a lot to be said too, for, for some of the people who have just sort of been soldiering along, like Kenneth Christensen from Echo Court has just been caning the hell out of this stuff for, for ages. You know, he's at, he's at release 50 now, you know, and whatever with, with some of the, with the Styrax, with that, with a lot of the labels that have a real sort of devotion to this, the sound of things Yeah, regardless, as I say, regardless of whatever other influence, I guess it's important to say that I think that the people who have been kind of soldiering along and then championing this stuff for so long definitely deserve some of the credit or blame or what have you for where it's at. I think for me, specifically that like Echo Chords and a really interesting label because In the abstract, I'm like, oh, all that stuff sort of sounds the same. But when I actually listen to every release, I'm like, oh, that's kind of a nice twist. That's kind of a different take on it. I mean, you've released on Echo Chord, and Mike Denner is doing some things for that. There's obviously quite a different... A lot of different perspectives. Completely. And I think that you get there. I mean, I think you get people in, although it's all sort of like tenuously linked to this whole kind of dub techno idea, you do get people sort of pushed out of their comfort zones in that you get, I mean, Kenneth is such a, like a creatively so open to everything. And so. If he's like, yeah, I want to do a record, you send him stuff, the likelihood that he's going to say, well, I don't like the hi-hats in this one are zero. He's pretty very free curatorially and saying, do what you want to do. I do think, though, that your work has definitely... I mean, there is this nameless bunch of producers who are basic channel clones, but I don't think your work has ever really fallen into that in any way. Yeah, no, I don't think... In the same way, I mean, when we were talking about the whole sort of Plastic Man thing and then my first experience with software synthesizers and spending hours and hours making Plastic Man clones on Rebirth, before I released anything, I spent hours and hours making basic channel clones, you know? And I think there's, I mean, maybe some kind of salaryman. aesthetic or aligned to this way of thinking, you know, but like I don't really have so much interest in I think once I think once you've sort of coded certain formulas, they lose they lose interest, for me anyway once I've sort of decoded how something is put together, it starts to lose interest. And I think, yeah, it's more interesting for me to sort of push things in new directions. You know, and I don't really have that. Don't take any personal gratification, don't take any sort of creative energy from it. Just sort of reach right in the same path.
