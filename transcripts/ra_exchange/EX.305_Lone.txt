Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Carlos Hawthorne and I'm a staff writer at Resident Advisor. This week's guest is Lone, or Matt Cutler as he's known to his friends. Cutler's music possesses that rare quality, you know it as soon as you hear it. He makes dreamy, uplifting electronic records with a hint of melancholia and has released six albums on labels like Actresses, Work Discs and R&S. His partnership with the latter has been particularly successful and you can see why. A big part of Lone's thing is presenting fresh takes on 90s UK dance music, from ambient and electronica to jungle and rave indebted club bangers. We discussed his love for that era and unpacked the methods behind his singular sound when he dropped by our London office recently. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Lone is up next. spots walk past you that's how it all comes down to good it all comes down to I noticed you'd tweeted a couple of things in honour of Prince's passing and one of them you called him a total genius and I just wanted to know why you thought that I mean what was it about him as an artist that made him so special? I don't know where you start with I mean yeah you mentioned that tweet I went back and listened to his first album I was reading the like notes on the back or whatever and it was just the list of everything that he played and he wrote everything, produced everything, sang everything and like the list of instruments is just crazy. And like he's, he's like the best guitarist ever and that's just like not his main thing, it's just, he just happens to be, you know. But I mean, I'm by no stretch like a super, super Prince fan but I'm just, you know, some of his music is like some of my favourite music ever, definitely, so. Yeah, undeniably a genius, I think. I mean, more broadly speaking, what is it that makes a musical genius, in your opinion? I'm not sure. I think it's just kind of, I guess, just like a talent that appears to come from nowhere, really. I suppose it's the same in any sort of, not necessarily just musical genius, but any kind of where it's just kind of not been taught at all, maybe. And it's just kind of... I don't know, just seems to beam out of somebody, you know, like an unstoppable sort of force, I think, generally, is how I... understand it. Yeah, I agree, I think. So Prince made 39 albums and you're on your sixth, is that right? Yeah, I mean, I've released six, but I've done about, I've done, yeah, I've done way more than that. I've done like 20 odd, but they're just all sitting in a room somewhere that no one's heard. I read that you much prefer the kind of album making process, taking longer with a project and really getting into that headspace. Can you tell us a little bit about that? Yeah, it's just the way I've always worked, so I think that's why I prefer it that way. When I was younger and making tunes just at home, I would kind of imagine that they would come out as albums, you know. I'd draw front covers to them and stuff like that, so I would always just put together albums, like work with that in mind. I was always working towards... an album of tracks. So I've just always worked like that. I've not just made tracks for the sake of it. I've always been with the idea of sitting next to other tracks and forming a complete piece of work. So yeah, it's just what I know best, basically. And I feel like I can get what I'm trying to say across much better with a bunch of tracks that form an album rather than anything else. So yeah, it's just the best way for me, I think. Yeah, totally. I think when you're younger, you form such strong intimate relationships with albums. And, you know, the dance floor isn't so much of a concern because you're not going out, you're not going clubbing, you're just listening to things as kind of fully formed pieces of music and the tracks just isn't so much of a concern. Yeah, definitely. I mean, like there's certain albums that I just worshipped really when I was younger, like just know inside out and just kind of would listen to every day. Just trying to, yeah, constantly trying to make something that would, you know, that is as good as that, basically, if that makes any sense. Like as good, maybe as good to another person or just for myself, just. if I can make something that I can sort of objectively see that it might be possibly as good as one of those records that I was obsessed with. So, yeah, you announced the album, I mean, it was literally yesterday. It's called Levitate. And what's next for you in the album release process? There's a video that's been made to one of the tracks. We're looking forward to putting that out. Yeah, some live shows, a new live show with a drummer and new visuals and new material. And yeah, then the album will be out. And then I guess touring will be the sort of what the rest of the year would look like, I guess. So you're going to tour mostly live? Yeah, yeah, totally. I mean, I'm well up for doing, I'm well up for DJing a bunch this year as well, though, to be fair. But, well, with the last album, I toured a ridiculous amount. And with this one, it won't be as much, I think. We went to so many places and it's like there's certain places that maybe didn't hit as hard or maybe, I don't know, it would make more sense to just go to the key places or I don't know, less is more maybe, but we'll see. I mean, I might end up just touring more. Yeah, I'm not sure. So do you generally construct a new live show around every new album? Sort of, yeah. I mean, for this time, definitely. But it's kind of just grown gradually over the course of all of it. Like each time it's just got a bit more towards something resembling a proper live set, really. Because I'm still always DJing as well. So just like I say, it's gradually getting to that point basically. So what's involved in the live show? Yeah, it's going to be me, a drummer and Tom who's been doing visuals for me for the last couple of tours. So yeah, especially with this new music as well because the majority of it... it's like 150 BPM or whatever, so it's kind of like jungle, so with live drums as well, it's going to be pretty full on, so I mean, it's not going to be like that the whole, we're not just going to play that, we're going to play some old stuff as well, but. Those tunes are definitely going to be pretty interesting live, I think, definitely. So the first single, Backtail, was heavy. In order to listen to it, you had to dial a rave hotline, which was one of the more innovative promo ideas in an era of innovative promo ideas. Whose idea was that? Andy at R&S suggested that we put out a phone number when we met up talking about how we're going to go about doing everything. And the original idea was to give directions to a rave that didn't exist, but then we saw it. as funny as that would be some people might actually go and try and find it and it might just get a bit confusing so yeah we just had over a couple of beers we kind of just talked about it and just thought actually like a pirate radio station kind of makes sense and get Normski to do it which we could actually make that happen and so we did and yeah it was just a laugh really I mean that was like not to be taken seriously at all it was just a funny way of kind of letting people know there's some new material out coming soon you know so Does it feel very different promoting a record in 2016 than it has before? Yeah it does actually yeah slightly different I mean It certainly does from the one before that, which is 2012. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. And I'm kind of into it, to be honest. I quite like the idea of getting creative with how you're going to put something out. And I just see it as another way of being creative and having fun with it. So I'm quite into like working within the sort of boundaries of 2016. how people consume music, you know, how short people's attention spans are and stuff. I even thought about that with the actual writing process of the record. It's like, I want to make something that's just a slap in the face that you don't want to skip at all. And it's not, you know, it's really, really short. Someone can just put it on and it can kind of hold their attention, you know, for that like 35 minutes or whatever. yeah even the campaign everything to be kind of snappy like that so yeah I mean just looking at the mainstream the way artists are kind of being tied exclusively to different streaming platforms and obviously just trying to find a way to get this record out and for it to be the only you can only listen to it in just one way and yeah I'm not so much into that to be honest So what records influence this new album? Yeah, there's a bunch. The main one that springs to mind is music. Mike Paradinas, an album he did in 97 called Lunatic Harness. It's one of the first albums I ever owned. And it's kind of like from that era of like him and Apex Twin and Luke Vibert and Squarepusher kind of. making like jungle music essentially, but like completely mental jungle music with real nice attention to like melodies and chords and stuff, which is something I've took from them the whole way across. Yeah, that record is especially melodic and colourful, but it has like... were all really fast and just crazy drum programming and stuff. When I was in my teens and stuff I was making like music like that the whole time I was making like jungle sort of electronica stuff and since I've been releasing tracks myself as Lone I've not had a go at doing anything like that since so it's been like over 10 years since I've worked with breakbeats in that way kind of thing so I wanted to see if I could still do it basically so that's kind of that was my thinking behind it so listen to records like that music thing and Apex Twin Richard D James album yeah just real melodic mad music basically so the jungle thing is i mean it's not completely new but it feels fresher whereas the the hardcore and the rave thing are definitely two sounds that you've visited before and i was listening to your interview with boiler room and you said that you were done with hardcore and rave i mean what changed it's just i just needed a break it's just that it's like um it's just like this one i've got i was after doing that last I was bored of making like 4-4 tunes. That was literally it. That was my motivation. I was like, right, I'll just... see if I can still do shit with breakbeats, basically, see if I can still actually do that. And that gave me a complete buzz, and that gave me a complete boost to do this project, basically. I mean, there are ravey, hardcore moments on this, but it's more about just the beats are kind of taken from that kind of sound, really. The melodies and stuff are kind of, I'm trying to be quite honest with them and stuff, and I don't want it to be a throwback But it has like, in terms of the beats, it definitely has that sound, but... what goes on top of the beats is totally totally me I think I mean is it the case that when you're you know when you're in a healthy period or an ambient period or whatever it may be that you will just make music in that vein you know you're quite a prolific producer so I mean is that just the way it works yeah that's exactly it I mean like literally like I started writing a couple of like new tunes in this last couple of weeks since finishing that the new album and they're all house tunes so it's like yeah I just run with something and then get bored of it and want to just react like do the complete opposite so like yeah I want to put out some just house tunes next I think you know it's just kind of whatever I'm into at the time literally that's what sort of motivates me So it could be that you just hear a particularly good house record and it just puts you back into that mindset? Yeah, or with whatever genre, basically. But yeah, just hanging around with my mates. And we just relaunched our label Magic Wire. And yeah, just getting into listening to loads of house tunes that my mates are playing me and stuff. Just kind of, it goes like that, really. When you DJ, do you DJ quite across the board? I do, yeah, but I mean, I like to DJ house and techno mainly, but I mean, like, if I can play hip-hop... or disco or like 80s sort of like boogie stuff then I'm pretty happy so across the board all that stuff really yeah if I can get get away with it I'll get like ravey towards the end but yeah yeah I guess it's pretty across the board yeah so you said that for the new album part of the inspiration came from an ill and bedridden trip to the US I mean, it sounds like the album literally came to you in a dream. Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure if it's kind of like, I don't know if you've ever had a fever that's pretty bad that you're kind of, I don't know, it's almost like tripping. Yeah, it's almost like hallucinating kind of delirious kind of vibes. It's really horrible. And I've been touring in America for the last album and then it's pretty relentless until we got to New York I just got to New York and got to my hotel and just got in bed and that was it. I was like, I couldn't move for like four days. I was completely done. And I can remember having a sort of dream or kind of hallucination or just like, it's kind of like when you're lying there suffering and kind of, there's just so much information going through your head because you're so ill and kind of, I don't know, it's just horrible. I was like just dreaming up all these kind of like jungle beats. But I remember sort of dreaming about like, like ice cream Van Tones, you know, like when you when you were younger hearing that kind of weird. sort of like wind up melody sort of thing from an ice cream van that over break beats and I was like shit that's kind of a good idea when I get home I'm gonna have a go at that so um I mean the ice cream van tones never actually made it to levitate but I did try I tried quite hard to get it to get it sound like that yeah and it didn't wasn't wasn't really working but you know without that kind of initial thing I guess that was the very first spark as to what I was going to do next, bizarrely. And at the same time, you were listening to this Mike Paradinas album? Well, that made me think of it. And then I kind of thought, shit. From New York, we ended up in LA. And a friend of ours took us out for the day and was driving us around. And he had all these unreleased Jungle and Hardcore edits by... two quite heavyweight electronic producers and it was just like we were just driving around la blasting and this stuff out and um that was it i was like yeah i'm definitely gonna go home and try and write something like fast with broke beats however it will sound, you know, that's definitely what I'm going to try and do. So, yeah, that was when I knew really. When I got home, I was just going to work on a jungle record sort of thing. Was there a part of you that wanted to induce yourself back into that feverish state? Not at all. But yeah, I see what you mean, but no, definitely not. I've not been that ill since either, so. Yeah, hopefully it will never happen again. It's awful. Right, because a similar thing happened with reality testing where, I mean, you explain it, but that kind of came to you in a dream as well. Yeah, I mean, this is the thing with my stuff. I feel like I'm banging on about dreams and stuff all the time, but it really does, I do really find it as just an endless sort of pool of inspiration, really. Yeah, it's really hard to explain, but just trying to sort of, I find through music is a good way of trying to get to those sort of atmospheres and those sort of emotions that you can't kind of put your finger on. Yeah, music is a great one for that. And those emotions kind of come... to me in dreams as well and it's kind of about yeah just trying to sort of get back to these weird states and trying to soundtrack them or trying to make some sort of sense out of it all really so yeah it's a constant yeah constant source of inspiration for me so you said that the record has a new theme and so that would be the return to jungle then i guess so yeah i mean but yeah like i say when just driving around la listening to these tunes with the perfect blue sky. I just wanted something that, like, my version of what we were listening to, if we just put that on in the car and drove around LA, you know, that would be the perfect thing. So it was just more of like a colour palette in a sort of weird sense as well. Just, that's what I was imagining when I was working on these tunes. trying to soundtrack a scene and that was the scene really and it just grows and sort of snowballs on its own from there I guess. Right, because you said you had a creative slump after reality testing. Yeah, for sure. I do after every album it turns out really but this one was particularly bad. It was kind of really depressing, this one. I mean, I didn't really know where to start at all. I mean, how does that manifest? manifest itself yeah i've just literally have no ideas at all and every time it happens i feel like that's it that's just done now that's it every time and someone will say to me my girlfriend will say whatever i do you said this last time and then it happened you always end up being all right eventually but i can't see that at the time i'm like no shit i think this is really it it's really done now and then uh yeah get another idea and it's fine again but it's touch and go for a bit so the thought of the well running dry really scares you yeah definitely yeah so i mean it's a case of just sitting in front of the computer and nothing's coming out yeah totally and then because like yeah nothing will come so i won't have anything to do that day so i'll just kind of watch some like netflix or watch a film i just start feeling really guilty like Oh man, what am I doing with my life? But then it comes back though and then, you know, I'm working every day and it's like I feel like I've got a purpose again. So yeah, it's kind of scary if it runs out. I don't have much of a purpose. So did this period last particularly long? Yeah, I guess. I mean, probably not that long. actually, but it felt like years, but it's probably a few months where I really couldn't do anything. But then there's a few months of even having the ideas and starting and then stopping again. And it just kind of like, I know what I want to do, but I'm not really getting it. And then you make one track and you're like, oh shit, that's it. And then the rest snowball from there. So yeah, you'll tour this record. I mean, how long until you start thinking about the next record usually? There's kind of been roughly gaps of two years. Yeah, yeah. So I mean, technically it'd be like if I spent the rest of this year touring and stuff. Early next year, I'd start the next one, I guess. It's important for you for there to be a stylistic shift from record to record? Yeah, no, definitely, yeah. Just because, yeah, I need to keep myself interested, really, before I think about anything else. And if I do the same thing, then I just know I won't be happy with it and I'll be kidding myself, so... So thinking about Jungle, Raven, Hardcore, when did your relationship with those musics start? Really early on, when I was about nine or ten, I sort of overheard that stuff. It would have been around 1994, so Jungle was really happening. But I was hearing hardcore, which was kind of... I don't know, I was hearing tunes that were probably about two years old by this point, and it was kind of out. But I was getting my hands on these tapes just through friends of my sister's or friends of... Some of my mates' dads were into rave and stuff, so I'd get these tapes and just sort of... I got well into alternating prodigy and stuff like that. and then just managed to get my hands on recordings from raves and stuff, then track down what these tracks were, who the DJs were and stuff. hardcore and jungle was like my introduction to music like full stop really before that i'd i didn't like anything that i'd heard because all i'd heard was like whitney houston or luther vandross was the nice stuff my mum was listening to but you didn't like any of that i like luther vandross now definitely but uh yeah not at the time not when i was nine i thought it was like i'd know i thought i was never going to be into music i thought i don't get this really but then i heard jungle and stuff and that made complete sense so can you articulate what it is about those records those sounds that feeling that kind of captured your imagination it's music that just constantly changes you listen to like trip to the moon part two by asian which is like my favorite hardcore tune It's got about like 10 mad different sections to it. You know, it's like, I can't believe that was music that was played in clubs at that time, you know, like it's just so mad, so inventive and like. exciting there's no nothing more exciting than that music still to me so right it's like as hyperactive as yeah yeah exactly yeah no no attention span whatsoever yeah it totally makes sense if you think of like people always get into the louder brash genres first and then work their way yeah yeah refining their tastes totally yeah i mean rave jungle hardcore definitely some of the musics that are kind of most readily associated with your sound but if you had to choose two others it'd be hip-hop and ambient um i wonder if you could just draw us a kind of rough timeline of when you got into those musics and and how you engage with them i guess like just through my teenage years really with hip-hop i got into skateboarding when i was about 14 or 15 and then Yeah, me and a little group of friends got into skateboarding and then we just sort of like through watching skate videos and stuff, we heard like Wu-Tang and that was our like introduction to hip-hop. Yeah, and then from there I was kind of obsessed and just eventually kind of, yeah, through Wu-Tang just checked out every sort of all hip-hop basically. until I got to Madlib and Dilla when I was in my late teens, early 20s, and that stuff was like, right, this is exactly what I've been looking for the whole time kind of thing. With Ambient and Electronica, that's kind of that stuff that's pretty early on as well. I got into Apex Twin when I was really young. When I was about 13, I think I got my first Apex album. So just through listening to Warped Records and stuff like that, I guess don't get into boards or attacker and stuff. that's kind of like through them you kind of hear ambient stuff as well. So I guess that's always been there as well. So it's just always stuff that I've grown up with really that all just kind of melds together into what I do now really. Really amazing music taste for a generation. But you know what, it's kind of like, I remember I used to listen to, like John Peel was on and stuff and Marianne Hobbs would do the Breeze Block. If any sort of kid was exposed to that stuff and they happened to kind of like some of it, if you listen to like John Peel or Marion Hobbs at the time, they'll just totally sort you out. You know what I mean? They literally put me onto so much amazing music. It's just like, I owe a hell of a lot to people like that as well, you know? So you're making music from really early, like 10 years old? Yeah, but it was kind of like just a tape recorder and a keyboard. Oh, I mean, you're 10 years old. Yeah, yeah. I've got some of it still on tape, but I don't dare listen to it. And have you kind of been making music ever since? I guess I have, yeah, in some way or another. And then when I was about 15, I got a computer. I got FL Studio and yeah, since then I took it really... Before that actually it was like music for the PlayStation. It's just a game that you could build tunes on. But yeah, it wasn't until I got the computer that I started taking it a bit more seriously really. And you grew up in Nottingham? Yeah. I mean, were you going out at all? Not until kind of later on really, not until I was like... 18 or 19 or something like that. I was a bit of a nerd really because I grew up on the outskirts of Nottingham in a little town so I didn't go to the city that much until I was older and then I moved out and lived there and went to a lot of hip-hop nights, a lot of techno nights and stuff like that. Yeah, it was decent. If we can just go back to reality testing for a second. I mean, one of the things that cropped up again and again reading reviews about it is that it was your kind of easiest listen, kind of most accessible record. I just wondered if you agreed and how you felt about that. Yeah, I do. I mean, it wasn't intentional, really. It was just kind of like every album has a bit of a storyline, kind of, or a bit of a theme. And the one for that was kind of like a hazy sort of New York backdrop or something, like some skate video type vibe to it. So I guess that is quite easygoing. And it's, you know, it's always going to be kind of easygoing. But this one is the hardest, for sure. So, again, it's just a reaction. Yeah, they're kind of increasingly faster and more pumping. Yeah. That's just because I'm reacting to the last one again, which I'll always do. The next one will probably be even more mellow than reality testing. I don't know. I seem to react to... I get bored and want to react to whatever I've done before, basically. I was really interested to read that you enjoy listening to your own music. I think you're one of the few artists who have said that. People usually have a kind of complicated relationship with it, whether that's through some kind of self-loathing or whether they're just... totally sick of their records yeah yeah definitely but yeah i really like what you said because you just you know this is music custom built for you and you're not saying that it's the best music you know out there you're just saying that it's music that you have made and who's going to enjoy it more than you you know yeah exactly yeah i don't really don't understand how you wouldn't see it like that i mean because the only the only motivation for doing it is making music i want to hear so like I'm literally making music for myself to listen to. That's the only point of doing it. So of course I'm going to listen to it. The major goal of finishing an album is I just can't wait to have the whole thing to listen to. Because it is for me before it's for anyone else. But you must listen to the track so many times. Yeah, true. But again, once you've got an album together... all the tracks once they're arranged in the right order they kind of take on a different life and it's like a different context for each tune so it kind of um it feels fresh again once you've finished it but you know i've not listened to levitate for a while now i'm completely done with that so i need to go make some more stuff so that's kind of how it works basically how long did it take you to make the album on and off just over a year, I think. There's a couple of false starts, but it really came together massively in the last few months before I handed it in. I think I made like six tunes in like a month and a half. Before then, I was taking months to write one. So it was a pretty weird process. I mean, does it tend to happen like that? A really slow start and then... I think so, yeah. I mean, with the one before, it was more kind of evenly spread. Because I think I probably had more of a clear vision from the start of what I wanted to do with the last one. This one, yeah, gathered momentum over time. A month before I handed it in, I nailed most of it, really. It was pretty mad. I mean, having put out a record as successful as Reality Testing, are you not at all nervous about putting out an album that's, you know, in a completely different direction? Well, no, yeah. I mean, I'm not really nervous about this one, but I probably should be a bit more than I am. But yeah, this one's definitely harder. You know, I think the easiest thing for me to have done would have been to make another album in the same vein as the last one and push that forward. And I could have got probably, you know, it could have been more commercial and I could have got further career-wise and all that kind of stuff. I'm too kind of set on this idea of being like an artist, I guess. I want to make something that I know, if I was a fan, if I was a teenager or something that was into it. you know, I was into Lone and he came out with a Jungle record after this one. I'd just be so hyped. I'd be like, that is the coolest thing you could have done. So that excites me to do it for myself. So that was my only sort of thinking. I was like, right, that's what I'm going to do then. There's a vision of an artist there as someone who's constantly challenging themselves, constantly taking left turns. Yeah, definitely. Like my favourite artists do, you that you visualise your tracks as kind of sonic landscapes. Sort of, yeah. I mean, it's kind of like, I don't know if it's synesthesia or not. I've never been like tested or I don't know how you would be, but maybe like a mild form of it, I think. But I definitely, yeah, see sounds as colours and shapes that move in and out of time to the music. Like they completely, perfectly, perfectly represent how things sound. So, and it's always been like that. So I'm not sure if any of it's How much of it is just happening without me having a say in it at all? It's a weird one, but I definitely know it's made making music without any sort of training or anything like that a lot easier, just to be able to always visualise it. Every time I hear a song, I'll visualise it in the exact same way, and it's like I'm not trying to do that. It just looks the same as it sounds every time. So it makes me wonder that, you know, it might be synesthesia or it's kind of, yeah. You touched on the label earlier on, Magic Choir, which you've kind of relaunched recently. And I mean, what, did it ever really go away? No, it was just kind of put on hold, I guess. It was just kind of too busy to kind of give it the time it needed. It's now kind of we're working with R&S with the label as well. So we brought in a good friend of ours, Sammy, who's a DJ. He's with Gabriola. We do the Magic Wire NTS show together. And yeah, he's kind of taken the reins a bit more and we've kind of relaunched it. yeah signed a bunch of new people so it's kind of yeah it's all go with it really and um that's kind of what i'm getting inspired by at the moment with my own tracks is listening to the people that we're kind of putting out and like um Yeah, a lot of really cool house music, basically. Yeah, that Project Pablo EP was really nice. And yeah, thinking about it, that mood hut, that summery Vancouver, you know, outdoor party vibe is a really nice fit with your sound, you know, with your aesthetic. Yeah, definitely. You mentioned your NTS show there. How's that been going? Yeah. great i think it's i think it might be gathering you know slowly but surely gathering a bit of steam and we're just really enjoying doing it it's just a right laugh basically just have a few beers and then just go and play some tunes and because we've got so much stuff coming out well we have like quite a lot of stuff coming through from the label we've got a lot of stuff to play and yeah it's great fun man so um yeah like i say that's definitely seems to be inspiring what I do as a loan as well quite a lot so so you signed to R&S with Galaxy Garden and the album before that you'd put out on Magic Wire I mean what were the key differences the key shifts and with working with a label like R&S I definitely felt the pressure when I first signed I did an EP for them when I first signed called Echo Locations Yeah, it was kind of scary, actually. And I think maybe on reflection, the first tracks that I was handing into them, I sort of felt like I should be making a sort of homage to R&S a little bit. After that EP, I kind of thought, actually, no, I just need to do my own thing. And kind of, I think Galaxy God, it maybe had a bit of that kind of, I'm trying to sort of like... give a nod to R&S because I'm so happy to be on the label and that kind of thing. But after that, I kind of felt more confident in myself, really. It's kind of irrelevant in a sense. As much as I love the label, it was just kind of about making the best music I can, really. The most original music I can. Yeah, I suppose the last thing a label like R&S wants to be doing is putting out. you know, similar sounding stuff. It's really interesting seeing labels like R&S and Warp. just, you know, trying to stay with the times and keep up with things and the decisions they make. And, you know, they have these incredible reputations to uphold. It's an interesting journey. Totally. So what's it like working with the label day to day? It's great. Yeah, it's really cool. They give me tons of freedom. When I started making the last one, Reality Testing, yeah, we just kind of like, it'd been a while since. the one before that so their idea was like it'd be good to put out a sort of standalone single which ended up being the Air Glow Fires tune and yeah it was just really helpful with just like if you want to put out a tune that's you know like a standalone tune it needs to be a big a big tune and kind of Just kind of me sending them loads of tunes and going no, this is almost there, but it's kind of you know And then that one was like my last attempt. I was like, I don't yeah. What about this one? I thought it was shit and they're like no no that's the one trust me. That's the one. It was yeah really cool and then after I did the album that was all good and then with this album they just kind of left me alone really just like yeah, we're kind of cool and just yeah being supportive when they need to be so it's great fun so the first time they heard the project was when it was done uh not exactly i just sent a few bits across and i took a completely told and i'd like every time i'd meet up with them i'd explain to them my thinking and stuff so they they're expecting a jungle record right so during the process you kind of have meetings? Yeah definitely I mean I'm kind of friends with those guys as well you know so yeah we see quite a bit of them. When you're making music do you do you ask for any second opinions do you show it to anyone? Yeah I mean I play it to like friends and stuff yeah I mean unless it's really bad then people are just generally quite supportive so either that or they just tell me what I want to hear so. Yeah, I mean, the other main takeaway from your music is that it's kind of overwhelmingly positive, uplifting, summery. And I was just wondering what that was a reflection of. It's a weird one because it's kind of like, it's not intentionally that way. I think it's like... It's kind of almost like therapy a little bit for me, I think, because I'm not like that as a person generally at all. Yeah, I do have bouts of like kind of depression and stuff like that. And yeah, so when I make music, it kind of that's the thing that cheers me up more than anything. So like, I guess making kind of really bright and up music kind of takes me out of certain things, like certain kind of like bad phases or whatever. I think that's why it's so positive, really. It's kind of, yeah, like I say, it's kind of like therapy in a weird way. And that totally ties in with you listening back to it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, completely. I mean, do you listen to dark, melancholic music? Sometimes, yeah. But it's probably, yeah, it's probably not my favourite, favourite stuff. I mean, generally, I'm always just chasing that kind of, when a tune makes you kind of gives you the shivers and that can come from anything really but generally that comes from nice chords and good melodies that's the main sort of so I'm kind of I'm chasing music like that generally but I did listen to some Penderecki this morning, actually. That's probably the scariest music ever. Yeah, because thinking about that music, Jungle in particular, hardcore is maybe more uplifting, but a lot of that music is dark. So it's just interesting to approach that music and then to kind of extract all the positivity from it and focus. only on that but it's kind of like the dark sort of elements of like hardcore and stuff they always i kind of always thought of them as more just like energy like uh the sort of more like aggressive moments i just thought thought of that as just like really exciting energy in a track just give the give track so much like i don't know yeah so much energy i never thought it was being dark necessarily i just thought of it as just like being powerful more than anything i think What are your general listening habits day to day? It depends if I'm kind of working on tunes and it's like listening to what I'm working on generally or messing about making stuff. But generally, yeah, if I'm doing anything else, I've generally got music on in the background, kind of listening to music most of the time, really, I think. Yeah, I don't know, it's kind of all over the place, really. I mean, do you go through phases where you're only listening to, like, specific records? I mean, those phases, I remember, are definitely a lot stronger when you're younger. Yeah, I mean... I think mainly when I'm travelling for gigs and stuff, that's a great time to listen through stuff, I think. That would be like listening through things I'm sent to play out or just really getting really deep into an album I'm into or whatever and listening to it all the way through. Because, yeah, generally when I'm at home, I'm kind of working, so I'm listening to what I'm working on or listening to what I have been working on. And then, yeah, I guess I listen to tunes at night. But it's kind of, yeah, it's my own stuff more than anything, really. But when I'm travelling, that's when I really delve into other people's stuff and get fixated on certain albums or certain tunes or whatever. Do you enjoy revisiting old favourites a lot? Yeah, I do go through phases of listening to certain things from my childhood or whatever. When I was making this album, I listened to a lot of the hardcore tunes that I really loved back then and listened to those over and over again. or the album before, I was, like, only listening to, like, hip-hop tunes and kind of certain Detroit things. And, yeah, at the moment, I'm kind of, yeah... main stuff i'm well into is just the stuff we're being sent for magic wire and um the stuff i'm working on really do you feel like when you're younger you're kind of directly trying to copy certain tracks or albums yeah definitely oh absolutely yeah there's like certain stuff from when i'm like in my teens it's just like a comp like track for track i'll make an album that's track for track like trying to be like a early or tech album or something But, you know, eventually over time it's like you sack off all those things and you do end up with something that's your own. So it's kind of, it's good fun. Yeah, I really like that you said also you treat albums as kind of, you know, as a way of documenting your life in the way that you would with a photo album or with a written diary. And I wonder if we just take an album at random from your career, say Lemuria, I mean, what does it transport you back I guess I was making, half of that was made when I was still, the last sort of year I was living at my mum's place. The last bit of it was done when I moved out into the town, into Nottingham with my friends. So just a lot of hanging out with friends and kind of, I don't know, I remember there was a really good summer that year and it was like 2007, 2008. And it takes me back to, like, just kind of, like, getting into other people that were making, like, instrumental beats music, like, hip-hop stuff. Like, I remember hearing Hudson Mohawk and Rusty and Flying Lotus. It was, like, the MySpace time, so, like, there just seemed to be, like... I think Jay Dilla had just passed as well, so it was kind of, like, there was an explosion of people, like, myself included, I'd say. obsessed with making like hip-hop tunes like instrumental hip-hop stuff but it was called wonky at the time It's the worst name ever. But like, yeah, that takes me back to just hearing loads of really interesting music from different bedroom producers around the world through Myspace, I think. Yeah, it was a good time, that, definitely. What about reality testing? Yeah, just thinking about that now just makes me think about touring and moving to London and kind of, yeah, the best time, really, just the kind of like... The album got a lot of love. Do you know what I mean? It's really satisfying to get that response to it. Are you someone that reads every review? Not every review, but, like, there's certain ones that I'm kind of interested. Just because I was a nerd when I was growing up, like, I would collect all the music magazines and kind of... Because that was just before the internet, so, like, I would get, like... What was it? Like Select Magazine and NME and kind of like this one Jockey Slut I used to get. It was amazing. And Mix Mag, DJ Mag. yeah i'd be completely obsessed and read all the reviews you know i'd take a lot of it for kind of that would would actually have an impact on me so yeah i do i still do you know i take take it into account so yeah i mean i find it hard to imagine that you know as an artist if you've made the record just kind of trusting a writer's judgment enough to kind of yeah exactly yeah it's got totally offended but it definitely but you know like I think there's a quote from the guy, might have been Johnny from Radiohead, I remember saying something like, you read a hundred... good reviews and one bad review and that one just means way more than all the good ones put together, you know? And that kind of rings true a bit. I don't know what that says, but a negative comment really does hit a lot harder than a positive one. If we imagine, you know, a time five years into the future... and you are kind of reminiscing over Levitate. I mean, what will your memories be? That's interesting. I'm not sure. I mean, the making of the record was done in a kind of, in my last flat when I first moved to London. It's basically like a little pod at the top of the third floor. It's like a secret room with another set of stairs that went up, and I just put my gear in there and just... Yeah, it being summer and trying to make jungle tunes with the window open, boiling in this room, this tiny little sweatbox. So I don't know what's going to happen once the album comes out. I'll probably be attached to those memories. But for now, it's just, yeah, sitting in that little room trying to make jungle music. Thank you. Thank you.
