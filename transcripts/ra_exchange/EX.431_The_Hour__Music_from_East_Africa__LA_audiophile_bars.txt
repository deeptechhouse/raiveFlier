You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour, RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews and lots of other things besides. I'm Martha, producer of The Hour, here to guide you through this month's episode. Coming up, we have highlights from a panel discussion held at Unsound Festival 2018 about East African music and its wider context. And Matt McDermott is in LA uncovering the world of listening bars. But first, I want to introduce you to Pink Noise. Pink Noise is a zine which aims to welcome women into the dance music world. If you felt curious about navigating a pair of CDJs, ever wondered where your nearest Ableton workshop is, or wanted to know the logistics of putting on a club night, this is the place for you. zine has you covered. With insightful interviews from the likes of Umfang and Object Blue and a strong aesthetic, founders Moira and Anastasia have been shipping the zine across the globe. Orders have been placed in Texas, Brazil, Amsterdam and Australia. I went to meet the girls to find out more about their zine and why bringing this sort of information to the surface is so important to them. you My name is Moira Lethby and I'm the creative director of Pink Noise Zine. I design the zine and I also play a huge role in the curation of the content within the zine. My name is Anastasia and I help with a large part of the curation of the content in the zine. I helped with the editor's notes, I wrote an opinion piece in the zine, I accumulated... I updated a lot of the interviews and I wrote up a lot of the articles. And I wrote the manifesto too. We both did actually. Here at Pink Noise, we declare that all women be given an equal opportunity. Long gone are the days where we will be booked based on our appearance, heckled on the decks or undermined of our skills. We will no longer be taken advantage of and are here to stay. Watch out world, we're going to fucking wallop you. Fake Noisine is a magazine for women predominantly interested in electronic music and production. We like to talk a lot about the clubbing scene and the environment and just dance music in general. I started it off three years ago. It's like a fun educational way of like introducing electronic music to people who maybe have no idea where to start and are a bit lost or intimidated by the scene. And then it's also for people who are well into the scene as well and like want to develop. Talk me through your process so far for collecting and eliminating content for the zine. We kind of met up together. and we discussed what we'd want to see in the zine. For example, one of the things we featured was how to put on your own club night. Like a lot of zines are just full of pictures and pictures and pictures and pictures, which is great. But we wanted something that would add actually inform people and be useful. The nice thing about what we do is like we both personally are at the start of our journeys in terms of like learning how to use Ableton sort of like make my own music and Anastasia's learning to mix at the moment. It's nice that we're on the same sort of journey as the people that are reading it. There's so many things that people do and others peer in from the outside and wonder how the hell are you doing that and it's It's not always stuff you can Google. Pink Noise, it's kind of like a sort of one stop for women who are interested in DJing and production in a way. Tell me about what it was like where you grew up in terms of the music scene. Where did you fit in or did you not fit in? So Ashbourne, it's not, did we fit in? No. There's no clubbing scene. This place is like pop world. If I wanted to go out growing up and I wanted to go to any sort of dance music night, I'd have to get an hour's bus to Nottingham and go to Stealth. It just doesn't exist. If you go out in Derby City, at the moment there's nothing there. And in Ashbourne, you go to the pub. from I don't want to slag it off but I do have to go in a little bit when I talk about Ashbourne because it's not the most kind of cultured place but yeah I don't want to slag it off I do have a lot of hope for where we come from I think that Derby the nearest city to where we're from is just waiting for something to hit it music wise like it's just waiting for someone to open up that club it's kind of like when you turn 18 you're about to hit town for the first time the city and you go out and you're like oh my god i'm 18 it's gonna be amazing and then you get there and it's just a letdown it's just a really big anti-climax. When you hear about how the whole Manchester scene started, that happened because Manchester used to have absolutely nothing and then suddenly there was an explosion and it was amazing. Derby could really do with that. I can't wait for the day that happens. There is someone who's just started a club night, though. I don't know his name, but the night's called Primary Colours, and it's an acid house night, and it looks great. So I wish him a lot of luck with that. How do you think you got into electronic music then, if there wasn't really, like, a scene around town? Before I came to London, I used to listen to people like... Gold Panda and like Joy Orbison and like classic people and then when I moved to London like three years ago and I started going out realised that all these DJs were like on my doorstep I remember like the first like proper like really sick night I went to is I saw Jeremy Underground at Phonics I was like oh my god this is amazing and then from there like discovering like loads of new artists and like meeting those people that have their own labels and like make their own music but like the reason why I started off Pink Noise is because I used to go out in that sort of scene in London and like I was like the only girl at the front it seemed that way I mean obviously there was other girls there but I just felt really alone the scene is not inclusive or friendly like The amount of stuff I've seen or had done to me in the club space, it's just... It's not inviting. Like, you go out and you're being groped left, right and centre and, like, security being rude to you and, like, I was just like, this is not fair. Like, why is it like this? Like, I like this music. Why should I go out and have to...? experience this but um yeah I think mostly through my mates they started listening to it and I remember the first like proper like sort of dance music festival I went to was like Parklife in 2014-15 and like I went completely sober like didn't even drink and um I loved it like it was just so sick to see these people play and I got really involved in it from then, I think. I have loved electronic music from a very young age. Luckily, my parents... have really, really great music taste. My dad, he introduced me to the Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy. It kind of made me want to do filmmaking because I would listen to the songs and I'd get ideas for music videos and I'd just get so wrapped up in that world. Okay, let's talk about some key pieces of content that you've already put out. What's been standing out to you in particular? I was really proud of our workshop directory. I think it's dead useful. I mean, obviously there's not exact times and dates at these places, but if someone wants to learn how to make music, it's a massive list of all the collectives in the UK. I came up with the name Pink Pages because I wanted it to be like Yellow Pages, but for women in electronic music. A lot of the workshops are quite London-centric. So, like, we kind of, like... Cos we're from Ashbourne, like, a little town in Derbyshire. So we liked to sort of, like... steer away from like the London centric thing and like because there's a massive scene in places like Glasgow and like Newcastle Manchester like humongous Bristol try not to focus on like the London scene in terms of content like that was the thing that I was really proud of my favorite would probably have to be the how to put on your own club night guide Because I just think it's one of those things that like everyone who loves dance music kind of dreams of doing. It's like putting on their own rave. What we did to get the information for that was there was a Disc Woman night in Manchester. And there was a guy called Robbie Bloomer who's a member of a collective called High Hoops. And he always puts on insane nights in Manchester. I asked him if he would kindly kind of let me shadow him. During the whole process of putting it on, he told me all the ins and outs of how to book them and timings and what to do, what not to do. I also asked another girl called Sophia Raisin from Bloom Collective. And she, again, was so, so, so informative. given me so much information so that there was I like to think there was nothing left uncovered when it comes to that guide so yeah I'm really proud of that guide okay let's talk about the future what topics are you looking to cover over the next edition of the zine the next issue is all about speaking your mind and it's like a more of like a opinion piece based one there's still going to be like the educational side which we kind of pride ourselves on but um yeah we want it to be a lot more sort of hard-hitting and controversial kind of like more vocal i would say um so like you were saying, more opinion pieces and more of a political kind of tone to it. Let's talk quickly about the electronic music scene and where you guys see it and what changes do you want to see? There's a few changes. I think that there should be a safe drugs policy. At the end of the day, people are going to be taking them. I just think that there needs to be drug testing. kits and stuff available I don't think it's working the way it is at the moment so like I think that needs to change for sure in terms of the clubbing scene I would like To see people go mental dancing more, people are perhaps a little bit more conscious. It's a lot more kind of like constrained in a way. The dance music industry is really judgmental at the moment. Like, I think that that's one thing that really pisses me off and is always... I feel like there's a constant need for people to prove themselves and to prove how much they know about it. I think the whole point of dance music is for people to have fun. I don't think there should be, like, an elitism about it. Like, I think people should just be able to, like, go out and have fun and listen to the music that they want to listen to. Like, I know a lot... And, like, there's a massive, like... judgment on like say if you listen to like you couldn't listen to like Drake and Disc Woman at the same time I remember one thing that used to really irritate me growing up and like I remember a lot of boys that I was friends with used to always quiz me and say if I liked an artist, they'd be like, oh my God, name your favourite five songs. And it's like, why should I have to prove that to you? I know a lot of people that like electronic music, but they don't necessarily know who they're listening to. And I know a lot of people... that like electronic music and they know exactly who they're listening to and I think both is fine I think if you're having fun and you're listening to what you want to listen to that's fine and also another thing that I would like to change I just thought of is The really expensive ticket prices. I can't afford to pay £25 to go to Oval Space and I like all the people that play there. I think it should be more accessible. I just think it's crazy. But yeah, they're the things I would change. What are your aspirations and visions for Pink Noise? It's been crazy in the last year. I started this off three years ago. was literally emailing a ton of people on a fluke. The main one, which was amazing for me at that time, was a Disc Woman one. because I was like, that's crazy, as if they're giving me an interview. Yeah, I think the aspirations of Pink Noise are just to keep delivering great content that helps people, that inspires people, that is useful to people, that is an example to people. Japan's culture of audiophile music spaces is inspiring a new wave of venues across the globe. This month, Matt McDermott stopped by two listening bars that have recently opened in Los Angeles. Listening bar culture has spread from Tokyo's back streets to cities around the world. DJs are bringing what were previously considered to be home listening records into bars and clubs kitted out with audiophile systems. There's Spiritland and Brilliant Corners in London, Hassoy in Stockholm, and La Mila Grossa in New York. This fall, listening bars came to L.A. Within a couple weeks of each other, Incheap's Clothing opened in the Arts District, and Goldline opened over in the rapidly gentrifying Highland Park neighborhood. They're two very different venues dedicated to vinyl and good sound, and they demonstrate the divergent approaches to audiophile bars, as well as the changing club culture that's allowed for their proliferation. We started out in the Arts District at In Cheap's Clothing, a visually stunning bar hidden behind a pizza parlor. We stopped in on a quiet Sunday morning. Wood, brushed leather booths, and Japanese whiskey fit into a tan and brown color scheme that make the room feel like the inside of a Klipsch loudspeaker. The bar's creative director is Zach Howey, a DJ, former record label employee, and music supervisor, who was recently nominated for a Grammy for his work on the Netflix show Master of None. Mostly, he's a vinyl and hi-fi nerd. *door slams* Japanese listening bars, they're supposed to feel like many things in Japan, like kind of like a secret that you kind of wander into. When did you learn about that culture or experience it? I would say that's a bit of a misconception to call it a secret because it's, from my experience, just a part of the culture. And there are so many of them. Which is hilarious being here because we get, every night, there's like five people being like, JBS, JBS, JBS. And I just go, what other ones have you been to? And people are like, there's more? I was like, there's like five on that street. It kind of came on my radar from audio, not records. Hi-fi and vintage hi-fi. I became very enamored with Gerard 301. turntables and when I was doing like image searches on them most of that content is from these bars I was more interested in the way these places sounded versus like what records they had there. Yeah, it's more than an obsession at this point. A good system is a magnifying glass. You know, if somebody half-assed a mix, half-assed a mastering job, half-assed a pressing, you and everybody in that space is going to know about it pretty quick. What are some listening bars that inspired you specifically? My favorite, I mean, it's probably my favorite place I've ever listened to music is a place called The Lion in Shibuya. And they don't allow... photos of any type, but there's some sneaky ones online if you do an image search. And they are almost entirely classical music. And it's sort of programmed where you show up. I mean, it's all in Japanese, but, you know, it was explained to me. They give you this little menu and it actually is saying which pieces will be played that day. And they play. the classical record in full, A and B side, then somebody goes up to a little, like, almost karaoke mic and announces what the next record's gonna be when they play it. And that place is, like, pretty much just no talking. It may have been a church. It's very set up like that, where it's a bunch of pews facing this amazing entire, like, floor-to-ceiling custom. speaker stack and it's two floors too and on both floors you're listening to the same stack of speakers but that place was everything to me and we took a lot of inspiration on the way our wall looks from their speaker stack Zach talked me through the bespoke sound system at Incheap's Clothing, as well as the record collection stored above the bar. Most of your listeners know what a Klipsch horn is. It's the Klipsch giant loudspeaker made very famous by David Mancuso. The speakers have no back. so they have to be in perfect corners and they use the corner of the room to kind of complete the base bin. So the angles on our walls are sort of dictated by what the speaker needs, but just how we kind of paneled it is sort of emulating the way the stacks look at Lion. The decor here is very minimal. You know, I want what we're listening to to be the star here. We have two collections. There's one for the daytime that's a lot mellower. It's sort of what I listen to at home. A lot of ambient records, a lot of new age records, some classical, some modern classical. And then the nighttime collection. There's a lot of jazz here, but we're by no means a jazz bar. kind of just what sounds best in here, the more space around the musicians, the better it's going to sound in this place. Because the imaging that our system is capable of really... can put you into a studio with the musicians. And so for the hi-fi nerds out there, can you walk me through the actual system? I thought you'd never ask. So the heart of this system are two Gerard 301 turntables that I sourced. I had them restored by a guy in Idaho called, his company's name is Wood Song Audio. They're in custom oversized plinths done by a guy named Martin, whose company called Vinylista in Germany. Then they have Thomas Schick 12-inch tone arms. It's another German guy. The cartridges we use are custom modifications that Thomas Schick made. They're moving magnet. I personally am a moving coil guy at home, but for the kind of usability of this system, because we're playing records. It's, you know, 12 hours a day. It made more sense to kind of go with a moving magnet. You can also back cue on it, which is nice. Then we've got a Condessa Carmen rotary mixer from our friends Condessa in Australia. That sends a signal up to an AudioNote M5 preamplifier. It's Audio Note UK, and that sends out two signals. One goes to an Audio Note Jinro Sochu amplifier. It's a single-ended triode powered by a 211 tube. It's about 16 watts a channel. And that is what fuels the Klipshorns. The Klipshorns are 73s. They were my personal speaker in my house for about 10 years. And they've got a bunch of modifications that I did. So they are far from stock at this point. And the other signal that that preamplifier emits goes to a line magnetic 218 amplifier. It's another... single-ended triode, 211 tube, and that powers a pair of Klipsch Heresies that are behind the bar, and those have been fully Frankensteined by me and sort of ripped into two pieces. If you see there, the high-mid-range drivers are above the bar with the crossovers and all that's in that cabinet. is the woofer. Can you tell me about In Cheap's Clothing's motto, how that reflects a general philosophy behind the bar, and how that's been going? It's, our phrase is to hear more, say less, which kind of says it all. You know, if you're here to listen to the music, don't talk so much. We're having a tough time on the weekends here, because we're... As much as we sort of brief our guests about what happens in here, we lose them every Friday and Saturday night. And we're having a debate right now if we should just acknowledge that and give up. we need to start like kind of being dicks about it. So we're coming up with a few point plan to see if we can pull this off without just like walking up and shushing people. A lot of people just want to rage and we're trying to let them know politely that this isn't the spot. After speaking with Zach, Incheap's Clothing opened its doors for the day. A few customers wandered in to read or drink tea while Laurie Spiegel's minimalist classic, The Expanding Universe, played. A week later, Incheap's Clothing hosted a night dedicated to the Vanguard jazz, electronic, and classical label ECM. Though Incheap's clothing can get noisy on the weekends, Callie hopes the bar will serve as a place to listen to deep records on a world-class sound system in contemplative silence. Gold Line, on the other hand, feels more like a house party, with DJs pulling from an extraordinary in-house record collection. Its co-founder is Peanut Butter Wolf, the DJ and vinyl obsessive who has been running the legendary Stone's Throw records out of an office upstairs from the bar for nearly two decades. As the founder of Stone's Throw, he's put out music from the likes of Madlib, J Dilla, Dame Funk, and Gifted and Blessed. The 7,500 records he's stocked the bar with are appropriately diverse. I just set up a bunch of crates of records from floor to ceiling and I had my friend's DJ with it and it was really fun and I wanted to do a bar with something like that but I didn't know that the Japanese bars existed that were already doing that. When I found out then I'm like well then we can do it now. people understand it more or whatever. Why do you think LA's crowd seems primed for this right now? I mean, there's a lot of good bars that are music-focused, Anza Bar and Echo Plex. I mean, I'm just thinking, I guess, more on the east side, like where I live. But ours is a different experience, and it's a lot smaller than those places. I feel that it's just more... or a hangout, we're not really saying, "Okay, this person's DJing this day or that day." It's just kind of like, come by when you can and hopefully you'll enjoy the music. Just seeing the support of the people who are there and getting a lot of positive feedback and stuff so far. Can you explain the music policy? It's pretty simple, yeah, no bringing records in, no computers, you know. It's really straightforward, just use what's there. And most DJs are really receptive to that because they haven't done that before. You know, like 7,000 records there for people to choose from. So, yeah, the concept was just to see different people's interpretation given the same template, the same records, you know. Honestly, I've been buying a lot of records this year. with the bar in mind as well. The collection in there is, everything is chosen by myself, but some of it I've had since it came out in the 80s, or, you know, mostly music from the 60s. to the late 90s, I guess. But a lot of the stuff I've found over the past year and a half, maybe, I would buy it for the bar and put it in a box, basically not hear it till the bar. So now I'm like, well, what is this? I don't know. I like that. It's been fun kind of seeing who does what. Egyptian Lover came by. We went to lunch, and then he was still around at 5, and he DJed just an hour, One thing that stands out about Gold Line is that there isn't really a crazy collector vibe around the records. The vinyl isn't treated with this insane reverence. You're letting DJs you trust play them, and that seems to stand out as being different from the way it goes in Japan, where only bartenders can play the records. Yeah, my understanding of the Japanese bars is that the bartender DJs primarily. I just know so many DJs and I just like seeing what they play. So far, everyone who's DJed has really been cool with records. Nothing's getting ruined. If you're a Discogs person, like a record collector... the stuff that's VG plus is going to become like a G plus or something like over the years. But my girlfriend, cause I've been buying records for so long, like she like teases me that I have enough where I don't even have the time to listen to them all. And you know, she's like, it'd be one thing if you're listening to them like all the time, but I don't see you listening to them. I see you buying more. And so this was my way to like show her Other people could listen to them and I can still go out and buy more, I guess. Colleen Cosmo Murphy was about a decade ahead of the current listening bar trend. A regular DJ at David Mancuso's The Loft, she took the late legend's sound system principles to heart and started up the Lost Sister Party in London, Lucky Cloud. About a decade ago, she launched Classic Album Sundays, a daytime event centered around playing a cherished LP in full. We asked her how she went from DJing the loft to playing classic albums from beginning to end at Mellow's Sunday Afternoon Set. I had really felt that our listening habits had really drastically changed in the 21st century. I won't be ashamed to say I was a kid in the 70s and a teenager in the 80s. And I worked in record shops and I would have friends over listening to records in my bedroom, you know, and we'd listen together, listen to the entire album. And we might chit-chat a bit, but we were really quiet. focused on the music and sharing it. It wasn't a headphone/earphone experience. It was shared. It was a communal experience. That was one of the reasons why I started Classic Albums Sunday is because I wanted to share this experience, the communal experience of listening to music together. to kind of carve out a space and time to show our appreciation of music, to experience music fully and not be multitasking. So we tell the stories behind it and then play it in full on an exquisite hi-fi where people can really immerse themselves into the recording and hear things they haven't heard before and share it with other people. So it was a multifaceted reason why I started. Classic Album Sundays. It ticked a lot of different boxes. People realized that music was being taken for granted. We came out of an era of the MP3 and shuffle culture and music really being treated like oral wallpaper as opposed to something to focus all of our senses upon. And classic album Sundays kind of reminded people why they loved music as opposed to just having it as some kind of oral backdrop or some kind of soundtrack, you know, some kind of score to the rest of our life. It became a focal point. We put it front and center in front of people. Music is one of the most important mediums of communication for human beings, really, I think. And if you can enhance that experience in any way, it's going to really touch people and transform people. And if you can do it in a collective way in public, it has a lot more gravitas, I think. I mean, I love listening to music on my own and blasting it and just zoning out. That's one thing, and it is great. And I'm not saying listening to music together is more important or better. It's just we have stopped doing that as a culture. We weren't sitting in a room together enjoying an album. I think that's one of the reasons people got inspired by classic album Sundays. And then in terms of audio equipment, with the 80s, audio equipment and formats just went downhill. The visual medium became more defined. You'd have high definition television, film and video became more and more defined, whereas audio formats became less and less defined. And I think all of a sudden, when we spotlighted it and people... realized how different it could sound and how they're having these transformative experiences and hearing things they hadn't heard. Back at Incheap's Clothing, I wanted to know Zach's thoughts on why more listening bars are popping up in L.A. You know, I think it's definitely not a fluke. In America, we're even late. You know, these things have been showing up in the U.K. and around Europe the past 10 years or so, and obviously Japan has had them for like 80 years. And, you know, I think about this a lot, and I think there's a few things to it. The first thing that comes to mind is just we're all getting older. I spent all of my 20s and early 30s in clubs, DJing, partying, warehouses. I still love it. But my personal taste, you know, what me and my friends call home listening, has just changed so much. But what I don't want to let go of is that communal experience. You know, I love sharing records with people. The stuff I want to share now happens to be on the Mellow Tip. So a place like this makes perfect sense. I think there's also something to the fact that most sound has gotten so bad. And it's just a weird phenomenon. A ton of my friends have started to... take sound more seriously, and we're working together on it, teaching each other, learning from each other. I think it's a lot like, you know, if you're raised on junk food, you have your first healthy meal, you never want junk food again. So once you start hearing good sound, it's almost unbearable to be in places that don't have it. Me and all my friends, we just want a place that we can still hang out, but not have to rage. And this seems to be making a lot of sense to people. So why are people ready for the idea of a listening bar? Here's Cosmo Murphy. I think our lives are so insanely crazy and hectic and we're all looking to take a bit of a break, number one. And I think that's a big part of it. You know, we are completely bombarded all the time with emails and texts and social media and advertising. We are expected to... to 20 things at once at all times and to always be available. And I think that's one of the main reasons, actually, why we are so ready to say, you know what? I'm turning myself off for an hour and I'm just giving myself over to the music. I think that's a big part of it. I think a lot of it is social and psychological. Then there's the musical side, as I said before, on the musical side, sharing music, changing how we listen to music, you know, changing our listening habits in the 21st century to kind of reflect more of what we did in the 60s, 70s and 80s or listening to music collectively and communally. You know, people started to have very isolated listening experiences, walking around with headphones or just being, you know, hooked into their laptop. It's just them with the music in the background. With everything at our fingertips, it just becomes a bit disposable and cheap. And it's not that kind of refined, emotional experience that we are really kind of craving. In many ways, L.A.'s listening bars feel like a bizarro version of the city's club scene. The late-night crowd parties in warehouses, swills cheap beer from makeshift bars, and listens to house and techno through Function One systems. installed just for the night. Listening bars, on the other hand, offer high-end cocktails and air out ambient jazz and post-punk rarities through audiophile turntables and cliff speakers. But despite the superficial differences, we're after the same thing when we turn up to clubs or listening bars, a shared transcendent experience through music. From Tokyo to L.A., each listening bar takes a different approach towards a universal goal. At last month's Unsound Festival in Krakow, RA's Aaron Kulte hosted a discussion about East African music and its wider context. The panellists were Arlen Desizian, co-founder of Nyenge Nyenge Festival, and Kampaya Bahana, a DJ, writer, activist and core member of the Nyenge Nyenge crew. Here are some highlights from the chat. I guess I'd like to talk about the origins of... about how it became to be a party first it was the boutique electronic thing that started it all is that right it was kind of a trying to connect two separate things i mean both me and derek come from let's say you know free party scenes in europe and and raves as well and it always felt like in africa somehow there was a bit of a discrepancy between a lot of amazing electronic music being produced throughout the continent that was very ravey to some extent and the parties that went with it. And so the focus was to start space within Kampala where we could play a lot more of these sounds, invite DJs and just have parties that could last all night in the right setting where we were free to do what we wanted. There was no controls, etc. So yeah, these just developed over time and through that we started meeting a lot more producers that started coming out of the cracks. They were kind of interested to get exposed to a wider range of music and themselves were making interesting stuff that there weren't so many traditional platforms to perform. When it comes to the role of the promoter, in Europe there's been a long tradition and culture of promoters taking risks and doing things DIY. In Africa, a lot of times the promoter is quite cutthroat, there's not a lot of money to play with. You traditionally don't want to take a lot of risks. Couple that with the fact that most traditional sponsorship channels for events are also quite conservative and want to just attract the numbers. So just look at big Jamaican dancehall artists and local pop stars. So, yeah, we're just trying to create that space. Now, it's changed a lot in the last few years. Much more commercial events are also like booking GoMartist or bringing artists from Angola and West Africa. It started like that, and then as we found more and more young producers eager to try different things out, we started a community studio in Kampala. And then out of that, we also felt that there wasn't really a platform to showcase all these interesting sounds. So that's how the idea of the label came out. So paint us a picture of what Kampala was like as a city, as a musical city, when you guys started putting on parties. Hollywood, for example, Campiore, where you started playing, sounds like a pretty interesting spot, fun spot back then. in the day? Yeah, I mean, I think I missed the first few parties. People are always like, oh, did you go to that party in Jinja at the office? And I never went to that one, which I still have FOMO for. But Kampala... You know, people really like to dance and really like to go out. It has a bit of a reputation in East Africa for being a party city. So people are accustomed to the idea of, like, partying all night, but the music tended to be quite mainstream. You know, a lot of American R&B, Jamaican dancehall, Nigerian afro beats, and then the Ugandan popular versions of that. And, you know, good to dance to. When I first moved back to Kampala, I danced for like a good five years to that music. But then I started hanging out with Derek and Darlene and Arlen and, you know, started hearing that there's all kinds of weirder sounds that are being made locally and that there's a real appetite. among DJs but also an audience to hear something different. So I think that now to Nyege Nyege, but also like a few other festivals and events and parties, it's really become like much more common to hear different sounds, different. electronic music being booked. And you mentioned that you first played at Hollywood with a playlist of tunes that you wanted to share. What kind of stuff was on that playlist? There was a lot of Baraka Som Systema and M.I.A. People like Blinky Bill, who's a Kenyan artist who, in Kenya, they sort of pioneered electronic music sound and engaging with the internet with their band, which was called Just a Band. And he's still making fantastic music and has a new album coming out, like Ero Magnello, but also a lot of older songs from the 60s. like some good soukous that my dad used to listen to in the car, some Franco. And I was really blown away by the way that people responded and it's led to me DJing ever since. And what kind of crowd were you pulling to those early boutique electronic parties? Yeah, again, a lot of young producers, a lot of people in the art scene, a big Pan-African crowd as well. Kampala is a very Pan-African city. There's a big community of South Sudanese, Ethiopians, Kenyans, Tanzanians, Congolese. So they would start coming to the parties, they could hear some of the music from their countries there. The parties got popular with the LGBT scene as well. Yeah, quite a diverse... Some older expats that were also living in Uganda that kind of got to hear more, kind of reminded them of parties back in Europe maybe, more like ravey stuff. Yeah, and because they tend to be in sometimes slightly grimier places, you get much more of a cross-section of Kampala and society because it's becoming more and more economically stratified, some of these events where you pay. you know, the equivalent of like 30 US dollars, but that's vastly out of reach for most Ugandans. So I think one of the cool things is that like... Sometimes you'll be at a niggah-niggah party and someone who was working in the kitchen will just dance for the next three hours. You can see that they've heard something completely mind-opening that night. The parties were always free as well. That was a very important thing. Has the nightlife seen it? evolved in those past few years since you started out? Are there more venues? Are there fewer? Yeah, a lot more promoters willing to put on like, again, like more Afro house and just, yeah, a whole range of kind of like, there's just much more of an awareness, I think, throughout the continent of the range of. underground African electronic music and people connecting with that and willing to promote it and it's becoming more popular, it's attracting audiences so quite a few more commercial traditional promoters like Blankets of Wine are now booking again some of our acts that would have been unfathomable a few years back. It would have been too risky. Dance floor clearers. And Kempira, I mean, you're obviously touring all over the place now, but what's it like life as a DJ in Kampala, Uganda, East Africa? Is there like a network of parties now that you could play at and make a living out of? Yeah, I don't think anyone's making a living out of it. Unless you have maybe a radio gig. But even in Europe, there are very few DJs who are just DJs. Just in the past three years I've been DJing, I've seen so many more DJs, so many more women DJs, so many more events. And more of booking DJs in a different way. Major Lazer had their second performance in Uganda this week and it was like a massive show and you'd never have seen something like that. for someone who's like, you know, a DJ, basically. So, yeah, I feel like things are moving, definitely. We're also, I mean, yeah, moving a lot more around the continent and getting booked for shows in like Réunion or South Africa and Burkina Faso. Kenya. So, and yeah, there's just a lot more, a lot more of all that happening. So we'll pivot now to a boutique studio. Talk us through some of your experiences there and some of the people that have, have come to collaborate. experiment with music there. So the idea behind Boutique Studios was again to create a space that dealing with a couple of the like structural issues, access to hardware, etc, etc. Have a place where your studio time can be, it's free and you can have the space to kind of work longer hours. We run a basically, it's a big villa that can house up to 15 artists and has a studio there um so it was a combination of local young producers coming in and getting mentoring from some uh older producers we've also had a lot of people been circling from europe coming down we've you know in the beginning we had some issues with kind of like how to create that engagement and that notion of collaboration that was fair and fruitful. So in the beginning, a lot of people wanted to come and just sample. It's a big story in and of itself, the history of sampling between Western underground music and African musicians. But over the years, yeah, we emphasized just strong collaborations, ones that usually are live projects that can also tour. Yeah, I mean, we had Ridlaw. He's a member of Project Bloat. He was also the head of the Black Panther chapter in Orange County. He was one of our first residents about four years ago. He made an album that was one of our first releases, Afro Mutations. Since then, yeah, there's been Nihiloxica, which is a PQ and Spooky J, a percussionist and synth player from the UK. They came down and stayed for a few months and they're still there now after a year and a half. They never left, but they did a collaboration with a traditional Bagandan percussion troupe that's done very well. We think very carefully about trying to pair musicians and have a conversation that usually lasts many months on both sides of how it can work and how you see these kind of sounds combining. Yeah, you mentioned the sort of idea of a fair and even collaboration, I guess, is a long and not particularly distinguished history of like uneven collaborations. What is an example of how not to do this as like someone coming in from outside East Africa to work with local musicians in your studio? What's the way not to do that? I mean... I mean, sampling is interesting because so much music, contemporary music, I mean, so much music traditionally has been made through, you know, sampling. And a lot of, like, great African music is made through sampling. You know, Kuduros, you know, was based on, like, soca and rhythms from the Caribbean being mixed with, like, kind of African percussion. You know, now that's being sampled back in St. Lucia, where you have, like, Dembe and, you know, what Angolan kuduros, Afro house was initially based on sampling a lot of Chicago house. There's obviously a circulation that's fruitful and important. At the same time, just taking a drum rhythm recording and then just using it to make a house track or a techno track that leaves the African artist out of the process. and doesn't have much of his agency in that music and the final creative output is something that had been happening for years that's a bit more problematic. Again, one thing is the politics of it and what happens to the musicians. The other thing is... the act of sampling can still lead to great music even if the local artist doesn't benefit so it's a double edged sword Herbie Hancock's Watermelon Man is based on a Hindewu, it's a flute rhythm, a pygmy flute rhythm it was recorded in 1967 in Congo, I think that album came out in 72, it's one of the most popular jazz tracks They were never really credited for it, but it's still a great track. Are you saying that if the music that comes out of it is good, then it's fine? No, no, I'm just saying that it's a very complex... No, of course it's not fine. It's very complex. Where do you draw the line? I feel like no one else is going to say this to... say this out loud, but if you're a European or Western artist and you have some idea of self-aggrandizement or coming to, I don't know, help the people who are there, leave all that. behind just don't do it. Stay in Europe and make white people music. Like, you're not going to add anything to the process. You're not going to... Like, people in Uganda have plenty of knowledge about music. They have their own struggles. They have better understanding of the struggles that they face. So you're not going to come with any solutions. And if you're just there out of your own ego, then please stay away. And Kempira, did you use the studio when you were teaching yourself how to DJ? Or where did you get access to the controller? Yeah, I'm still trying to figure out how to see DJs, but that's going to happen. But people have been very generous. I think Traktor and Native Instruments have collaborated with us and given young producers and DJs like myself access to equipment that we wouldn't have been able to afford otherwise. And it's just like a very fertile place. musically, obviously, but just socially, to hang out with other young Ugandans, young Africans, who are interested in the same things that you are, and really doing it out of passion, because no one's making any money. In terms of the wider creative scene in Kampala, not just music... I guess one thing that springs to mind is Wakaliwood, because you have collaborated with those guys, right? Yeah, I mean, it's just one other example of, you know, a very, like, DIY scene, making the most, you know, trying to make your dreams get realized. So Wakaliwood is basically a ghetto-based film collective. They live in a really, yeah, a really shitty ghetto. Nothing... glamorous about it. And yeah, they just started making these action movies on $300, $400 budgets, $150 budgets. It's, again, a bit of a double-edged sword because... the movies have this extreme lo-fi kind of aesthetic to them that westerners got very attracted to because I mean one you can admire what they're doing on the other hand it's kind of like laughing like oh look how lo-fi this is and it's kind of like funny well they were always dead serious about it they weren't playing on that to rise to fame, but it's just testament, whether it's in the music scene or, and yeah, there's a couple of other localized, like microfilm scenes throughout the continent where just people just do crazy shit with basically nothing. I mean, Singeli, you know, is, you know, they're performing here on Friday and Saturday, two different acts. Most of that music is made on virtual DJ, but just reinterpreted, reused as a sampler and recorded in live takes. Just on a laptop, just no hardware or expensive software whatsoever. The list is endless. A lot of Kuduro stuff was made in similar ways in the late 90s in Angola. People do a lot of stuff. Kids in Africa make their own toys. They don't buy toys. It starts from right. very early on, trying to have to do the most with very little. Yeah, and you've touched on that and the sort of technological side of things. I mean, I guess Kenya has a very fast internet. What's internet quality like in Uganda and how has that kind of helped or hindered the music discovery process? Yeah, for you, Kempire. Shit. It's terrible. It's really expensive. I was on Reddit at some point and there was some American who was like, I'm moving to Uganda and I'm used to gaming and I was wondering where I can get like a 100 Mbps connection. And I had to be like... If you get two megabytes per second, like, you're really excited about it. But just next door in Kenya, the Internet is fantastic. But it's shit. It's expensive. They just made it more expensive by taxing social media. So, you know, Facebook, WhatsApp, Tinder, like Uber, even you have to pay it. 200 shilling tax, which is negligible in European money. It's like 0.05. But considering that internet access is out of reach for the majority of people, you've just made it even more expensive. It's worrisome. I was talking to a producer in Geneva who's of Eritrean descent, and he goes back every few years, and he was like, there's no music scene because there's no... internet, like getting on WhatsApp is difficult. And I think that SoundCloud, Pretty Loops, Ableton, those are the things that have really enabled young people to make interesting forward-thinking music that is in conversation with what's happening globally. Yeah, and a lot of African governments are also copying this social media tax thing. It's worrisome. You should definitely get involved if you're looking for a cause. I think still the notion of digging on the internet is something that's quite... still far removed from a lot of lower income groups, generally within the continent, definitely in Uganda and Congo. Internet, in most cases, just means WhatsApp and Facebook, and that's Facebook Lite. It's Facebook's version for the third world, basically, global south, where internet connectivity is poor. You can't watch videos on Facebook Lite, just like text. basically and a lot of people in Uganda actually rely on that it's not the full version of Facebook so your experience even engaging with Facebook is very different. And it still remains like the biggest prohibitive factor. You can't create these thick networks. I mean, when they happen, it's magical. When sounds from the Caribbean reached Angola or... It's no coincidence that Afro House started just when the trade embargoes stopped in South Africa. So around 1991, you started getting the first Afro House tracks. Yeah, so the sanctions were removed from South Africa for apartheid. and you start getting the first records coming out of Chicago and stuff like that through South African diaspora networks reaching there. So just testament to good stuff is made when people can communicate. Campyre, when you're preparing for a DJ set or searching for new music, where exactly are you looking and how? How do you get access to that? Yeah, I mean, lots of SoundCloud, Bandcamp, but, you know, through Nyega Nyega getting involved with and meeting lots of cool artists, Gafachi and Bright in Ghana. Like Fat Stokki and the people who do Pussy Party and Joe Berg. Just getting connected with those networks and having people... It's amazing. SoundCloud is amazing because sometimes you'll message a producer and be like, oh, I think your music is amazing. You should come to Uganda. And he'll be like, yeah, as soon as I turn 18. Yeah, so, you know, those connections, it's really great when I receive a message from, like, Colombia, and they're like, we're listening to your mixes. It's amazing. We've been quite focused on Kampala and Uganda so far, understandably, because that's where you guys live, but what other cities or regions across East Africa are exciting you now when it comes to their music scenes or the music they're creating? Definitely Dar es Salaam, which has had a long history of kind of interesting electronic music since the late 80s. Yeah, that's got a really thriving scene, a lot of different micro genres coming out. So, I mean, there's a distinction, I think, in East Africa between the metropoles or the main, yeah, the big main cities where there's obviously a lot more mixing and stuff going on. And then smaller towns and villages throughout the countries where these kind of interesting micro scenes developing. So, you know, one thing that's been happening is a lot of younger producers in more rural areas have been reinterpreting their traditional music electronically through Fruity Loops and stuff like that. So Gulu, which is a town in northern Uganda. of the Acholi tribe. There's that dynamics been happening there with traditional Acholi music's been electrified and that's been happening throughout Uganda. There are 55 tribes. The language changes every 50 kilometers. So yeah, there's that diversity in experimentation somehow like spontaneous or vernacular experimentation. happening outside of the main cities as well. And, you know, something like Electro-Acholi or like electronic versions of Cardodi that now, you know, no one in Kampala would have heard that. They don't really move even internally within the country. Things can be extremely localized sometimes. Again, a testament within a national scale, which also replicates itself on the continental scale of... How many blocks there were of sound just moving around that's, again, luckily changing leaps and bounds in the last five, six years. And how about you, Kempere? In terms of where your travels have taken you throughout the region? Um... Yeah, I've been lucky enough to travel to Burkina Faso, which is in West Africa. It's Francophone. It's a place I never thought I'd be able to go, but they have a really cool festival there called Africa Basque Culture. and they're making fantastic music as well. People like Joey Lesolda and Art Melody, you should definitely look up. Nairobi is also super cool. It's like... close enough to Kampala, but it's a bigger economy, there's more stuff happening, so it's a good place to go and get inspired. A lot of the hippie kids are making really wavy trap music and electronica. And then you have people like the Bengatronics crew. who are carrying forward the tradition of Venga music which is traditionally like a rural music. It's like Kenyan sukhus almost. But, you know, live musicians who are just doing fantastic, inspirational things, I think. I guess let's stay focused on Dar es Salaam, like you mentioned, Arlan, and the Singeli music there. How did you come across that form of music and could you try to describe it? to everyone here for people who haven't heard it. Singeli music probably is a very fast-paced music of kind of like interlocked beats, usually with an MC to accompany the producer who they often play live. It probably fits into a trajectory of kind of some youth protest music. similar to kuduros that kind of you know came out of the the brutal civil war in angola and you know suddenly you had all these like uh slums where the population like tripled within the space of a few years and like dire living conditions and uh the same thing in tanzania you know this youth unemployment is a huge problem so it's a music that started out of two specific ghettos on the peripheries of Dar es Salaam. A lot of the songs are about youth challenges. I mean, a lot of the song titles have names like We're Broke or Life's Hard or Misery. Likely the music isn't as dark as the titles suggest. But it was a music that was... It's been around for quite a while, like 10 years. I mean, a lot of these vernacular electronic forms in Africa have existed for much longer before they were discovered. Gum music's been around for 10 years. It's only been about two years or three years that it's gained wider exposure in Europe. So Singeli's been around for about 10 years. And interestingly enough... It's a form of music that was kind of avoided by middle-class Tanzanians, but suddenly it's like broken into the mainstream now. For a music that's, you know, it's not exactly the most accessible kind of music at first listen. It's kind of conquered the whole country now. So what do you mean by that? Is it something that you'd hear and sort of... You know, on a radio, in a taxi, in Dar es Salaam. Yeah, you'd hear it in bus stops and bus stations. And you released a compilation from the CISO crew, and there's been people from that crew kind of, you know, played at this festival, have toured throughout Europe. How has... that sound travelled outside of Tanzania? Yeah, very well. It has, you know, like a lot of journalists have written about it, it has kind of associations to Gabber and kind of Makina and Happy Hardcore. So, yeah, it's got, you know, it's just a really, like, rave-y feel to it. So I think it works really well on European dance floors. I saw some footage from an event in... Glasgow where it seemed to go down particularly well were you there? yeah yeah that was a good one yeah where else have those guys gone? they played in Cafe Otto in London, they played in Berghain they played in Macau and Milan, they played a lot of places. Yeah, Reunion, Toulouse, like everywhere so far. But they just did a boiler room at Nyege Nyege. I think it's on Facebook, but you should definitely watch it. One of the things that's interesting to me about Zengeli, the scene is that Tanzania also has this like... similar problem to Uganda of like moralizing it's either like Christian or Islamic fundamentalist moralizing so I seem like Singeli which if you let alone the music the dancing it's literally like fast twerking for like four hours but like when you think about you know that contrast between a country's public image and what actually happens within that sort of fight within a country. That's the aspect that grabs my attention. Yeah, definitely. I mean, having a woman... with a kind of chador, like twerking. Yeah, it's not an image you associate with like, yeah. Anywhere. Yeah, anywhere, let alone Dar es Salaam. I mean, what's interesting about Singeli is also that a lot of African electronic music is still social. It's about dancing with someone else or a partner. And Singeli is kind of like, when they have these kind of block parties in the ghettos in Dar es Salaam, everyone's kind of in their zone and kind of, at first glance, it feels like there's a lot more, like, connection to kind of, like, European rave dance floor kind of feel. Yeah, maybe a bit like Gom as well, like, from Durban, which, again, is interesting enough, you know, it's quite dark for kind of African electronic music, but again, kind of testament to the fact that Durban's also kind of de-industrializing city. with a lot of issues and also one of the main trafficking points for drugs into sub-Saharan Africa and South Africa. So all these things have connected to create a scene that's, you know, in some ways starts building a lot more connections with kind of dance. floor dynamics in Europe, in the underground. Yeah, I mean, hopefully the fact that music like Gom and Singeli are becoming popular means that people are more open to things that don't sound like your stereotype of African music, like it's not all just world music, quote unquote. To sort of touch on Electro Echoli as well, Autumn Alph. and Leo performed at this festival last year, that is kind of like the electronic update on a style of traditional music was born through necessity, is that right? It was a cheaper option for people? Yeah, so weddings are a very important part of traditional Acholi culture. Traditionally, the music associated with weddings was performed by troops as large as 15 members. Northern Uganda went through a very brutal period of unrest and civil war that had a massive negative impact that still carries on to this day amongst the population. So there was a few enterprising musicians that thought, well... After the war, people had much less disposable income to book these 15 band troops to their weddings. So they kind of just electrified it. And it would be one person would go, just press play back, sing. Usually you'd have a camera crew with him to kind of... filmed the whole event as well. And yeah, so it's exactly, it's born out of necessity by some enterprising producers to kind of make it more affordable. Are there other examples of traditional styles of music being given a contemporary twist? I mean, you mentioned Kododi. Is that... Yeah, so Kododi is a music performed during a circumcision ritual for... adolescent boys moving into manhood in eastern Uganda, traditionally performed by a troupe of four to eight percussionists. That's also, yeah, recently young producers have been, yeah, electrifying that. And it's actually just within that area of Mbale where this music comes from. It's actually moved into nightclubs now. Yeah, it's kind of like moved away from its traditional purpose of working young boys into a... a trance before they get circumcised to actually work, yeah, being performed at weddings and functions and political rallies and clubs as well. It's also as exciting, maybe more exciting to hear like young producers in the region who are making stuff that sounds like nothing else really. I think maybe Boutique Studios has helped a few young artists kind of start to blossom. Slickback, I think, is one example. You guys started a whole new sub-label offshoot of Nyaga Nyaga Tapes for this contemporary club music coming out of East Africa. Tell me about some of the other artists that you're excited about. Yeah, just to contextualize a bit more, I think there's this very important transition happening now within the continent where before it was always this kind of like, again, vernacular electronic kind of styles that would kind of be discovered and people thought, you know, these like little pockets of creativity that happened in like kind of isolated islands, you know, whether it was Shanghan Electro or... The list is endless, but from Kuduros to... Kuduros was part of a bigger cycle of music circulation between Angola and Lusophone South America. But now what's happening is that as more of these sounds are moving around and you're just getting producers on just exactly what's happening in Europe. Bedroom producers listening to stuff from all around the world, absorbing sounds and having a wider palette of influences and just going for it, not kind of bound by, let's say, cultural restrictions within which people still made amazing stuff. No Singeli artist has ever heard Gabba or techno music. Again, it was kind of this weird coincidence of people speeding up traditional Tarab music from Zanzibar and over the course of 15 years, through different iterations, ending up as Singeli. So yeah, just now we have a guy called Ray Sapiens from Eastern Congo. He's also been listening to a lot more stuff. Following festivals like Unsound, looking at the lineup, discovering new artists where they can't download. We also share a lot of music with producers in the region. And yeah, just thinking, oh, well, that's cool. Let me try that and let me try that and let me try that. And also like actually getting to meet them, like coming to the studio, artists who come to the studio and collaborate and show each other techniques. Recently Ganga, who's like a Brussels-based Moroccan producer who makes fantastic music, he was really excited by his time in the studio and I think there was a lot of back and forth, you know, producers making tracks for some of the rappers who are associated with the studio, really great rappers like Black Bandana, Slickback, MC Ala. um so lots lots happening the the label is called hakuna kulala and it's a digital sub-label of negatapes yeah i've really loved um what's come out there so far i mean another person who feels like maybe a bit of an unsung hero of boutique studios is zilla um could you tell me about his story and he yeah how he's kind of progressed his own music and also helped others? Yeah, another young producer who just was really eager to learn and came to us and said, you know, I want to try different stuff out. At that point, we had a lot of space still in the studio. We'd just started. He moved in. Started managing the studio as well. And, yeah, in the space of a year and a half, I think he's got his first few tracks coming out on a... on Pan. He's got his first EP also coming out in a few months. Again, it's the kind of normalization of electronic music production. It can just be like other producers around the world, just getting influences and just doing their own thing. Considering the success of a lot of the artists and sort of, you know, yourself and orbiting the Nyagai Nyagai crew, Where do you see things going from here? Who's going to be sort of headlining Unsound in 2020? 20. We've talked about Tim Alpha and him and Leo they're heroes I've never seen a bad show of theirs and like every show it like evolves into something more exciting and if you ever if you haven't seen them yet if you ever get a chance to see them definitely go see them but I would also be really excited to see you know other Atrolytronics acts tour and to see really Rather than Nyege being some tiny little island in East Africa or being upheld as some sort of paragon or a voice for the voiceless or whatever, I hope it creates more interest in East Africa generally and we see a rise in other artists. being profiled and heard. Yeah, I mean, I think it's very unpredictable because you're at a phase right now where 80% of the population is under the age of 27. People graduate from university. There's not readily available jobs. I mean, it's true that people have a hard time making a living, but more and more people can make supplementary income through DJing at the moment in Kampala as well. And that can go a long way as well. People are really seeing that, hey, I can give this a shot now. The barriers to kind of entering... have fallen massively. There's electronic events everywhere. It's not like it's just Njega Njega or the parties we do. Even Singeli is just morphing all the time. So I think there's still that kind of vernacular electronic music, but at the same time you have millions of bedroom producers about to spring up, just like you've had in Europe. for over 20 years. And obviously anyone who's a DJ and digs and stuff, nowadays the reaction is common. I just can't keep up. There's so much stuff happening all the time. And yeah, I think Africa is going to be a very big part of that process as well in coming years. So it's hard to predict. I think the only thing that one, you can really feel is that it's on the verge of a tipping point and it's going to be just, yeah, I mean, it's going to be like one out of every two DJs in the world is probably going to be from Africa in the coming 20 years. Yeah, I mean, rather than like booking some white dude who's playing Ethiopian house, like actually book an Ethiopian producer because he's out there. Thanks for listening and a massive thanks to Arlan and Kempire. Thank you. Thanks to all our contributors on this month's edition of The Hour and thank you for listening. We're back next time with a blend of documentaries, discussion and interviews.
