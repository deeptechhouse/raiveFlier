The ♪ ♪ Thank you. . Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Mark Smith, and I'm the tech editor of Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Pauline Oliveros. She's one of modern music's most important figures, precisely because her work transcends music itself. She was a founding member of the San Francisco Tape Music Center in the 60s and devised a musical practice called deep listening, which examines the crucial difference between hearing and listening. She's inspired everyone from John Cage to Morphosis to tune into their surroundings. At this year's CDM Festival in Berlin, we got to know a woman who's been steadily innovating for over 50 years. You can hear our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Pauline Oliveros is up next. you Hello everybody and thanks for coming. You know it's kind of difficult to introduce Pauline because she means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Some might come into her work as a musician, as an activist, or as an academic, a writer. And you know we could go through the biographical dot points of her various achievements but um... I think one way to sum it up is just to say that culture is still maybe catching up to the implications of what her work have opened. This is in fields of music, obviously listening, technology, community building, and even being in itself in some way. But I guess the way I wanted to begin this was that... I guess a lot of the reason why you're here is that you've recently released a record with Iron on Robbie Biani's label, Morphine. And I was just wondering how that relationship began because... From the outside, it was perhaps a little bit surprising. Okay. Well, Iona and I, Iona's here in the audience, performed in a festival in New York called Live Ideas New York. It was curated by Laurie Anderson. So we did this piece, the piece that... What is it called? I forgot. Fire Above Sky. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. Fire Above Sky Below Now. Iona and I have been performing together for many, many years as a duo all over different places. We had got a really nice recording. of that performance and I have no idea now how we got in contact with Ravi maybe he wrote to me I'm not sure But as it turns out, I have other friends from Beirut. They have a very beautiful festival there. every year and so many of these are friends and I think they talk to each other. And as a matter of fact, I'm going to play with Mazen Kirbash this evening who is one of the friends from Beirut. So he and Robbie know each other, and I think they all somehow talk to one another, and that's how it happened. In any case, we sent the recording to Robbie and he liked it. And so he decided to release it. And we love having a release on vinyl from Morphine Records. That sounds really good. So that's, I guess, how it happened. Yeah, because I guess you've made something of a habit throughout your career of being able to cultivate cross-cultural, cross-generational... relationships with people from you know disparate parts of the world who all come from different musical backgrounds and i wonder if you can speak to what it is about your approach to music that makes you such a malleable uh substance when you come into contact with all these different types of people well i suppose long ago it became very clear to me that we needed to have a way of including people in musical activity or sound. It was possible to work with all kinds of people from all kinds of places. But there had to be a way of listening to one another and responding to one another rather than having a closed culture. that would not be able to absorb any kind of new input. And for me, that meant that I started to compose a bunch of work which was called Sonic Meditation. That was in the 70s that I started that work. And it was probably prompted by my teaching at the time at the University of California in San Diego. And we had a very large course for the general student. So there were students who had no musical background necessarily. But we made it possible for them to participate in creating music. performing it. And that was the era of tape music. So we would give the students a tape that had a lot of different sounds on it. And then they would learn how to cut and splice the tape and put it back together and make a piece out of it. So that was one way. I mean today you can do that on the computer very, very easily, but then it was more analog physical activity to do that. Then we got students to improvise with objects and instruments that were easy to activate. So that there would be a session where they would play together and record and then listen back and discuss. So that they got to be able to improvise. We asked them to draw a graphic and then interpret it after they had learned to improvise and work with tape and so on. So by the end of the semester, the students were all composing and performing and improvising. And so that has carried through my work for a long time. But that way, it was an inclusive kind of activity. You didn't have to be a skilled, trained musician to do this. And so my definition of a virtuoso musician today is someone who can play with anyone. Anywhere, anytime. This background ties into the deep listening. But could you perhaps start with some sort of workable definition of deep listening? But I'm more interested in talking about how it came to be in terms of a social community organization. Okay. Well, let's back... up a little bit. In, let's see, when was it? 1988. My friend and colleague and we performed together for so many years, Stuart Dempster, who plays trombone and didgeridoo. There is a special place. not too far from Seattle in a place called Port Townsend. And it's Fort Warden. It was an army base. And there on the army base is a cistern, which was the container for the water supply for the army, about 160 million gallons. capacity, about 60 feet in diameter and 14 feet underground. And it has a very special sound. The reverberation time in this cistern is 45 seconds. And so Stuart had wanted me to come and hear this. And I happened to be going in that direction. And so we went to the cistern with Pani Oti. the other person who went, there were three of us. And as an afterthought, we took a recording engineer with us. And so we went down into the cistern. This meant climbing down a ladder. from a manhole-sized opening. That was the only entrance to the cistern. Had to take our instruments down. And so we started to play. We had no discussion. Stuart tuned some of his didgeridoo pipes to my instrument. And we started playing. And five hours later, we came out of the cistern. We had a lot of tape. And we listened to it and decided that, oh, I think we have an album here. And so New Albion Records released it in 1989. And of course, we had to have a title. for the album. And so I thought of Deep Listening because, you know, we were 14 feet underground, right? And so we called it Deep Listening and then we called ourselves the Deep Listening Band. This is because we were jokers and punsters. And we thought it was really funny to have it called deep listening since it was coming from underground, that 14 feet underground. So that was the beginning of what was to develop into a practice. And now it has climbed from 14 feet underground to higher education. Just like that. Well, it's taken since 1989. taken from then until now. I teach at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the United States. We now have a center for deep listening there at Rensselaer. We are creating a new curriculum for a new kind of music program. which includes deep listening. So that's why I'm saying it's now higher education. You wanted a definition, huh? At your leisure. Well, the thing is that 45-second reverberation time... is a long time for something to be sounding after you play it, right? So we had to listen in a new way down in that cistern in order to play. And the album, Deep Listening, is still out, still available, because it really sounds different. And we were playing, I was playing accordion. Stuart was playing trombone and didgeridoo. He could play his trombone, put it down, pick up his didgeridoo, and the trombone would still be sounding, so he could play a duet with himself, right? And so it was simply voice, accordion, trombone didgeridoo, entirely acoustic. Entirely acoustic. People still think it's electronic. But it was this way of listening, and that's what I described in the album notes. and called it deep listening of course and so as time went on I organized a retreat in 1991 and called it a deep listening retreat and so 20 people came to the retreat and we spent the week Engaging in various kinds of listening exercises. And so I have continued and established deep listening retreats that went for 20 years. myself teaching. Ione was teaching listening in dreams. People don't think about sound in dreams as often as they could. And then we had Eloise Gold who was listening through the body. She has a book called Deeply Listening Body. Deep Listening, a Composer's Sound Practice book. Ione has a book called Listening in Dreams. So we have articulated a practice which I call an investigation. And I have given recently a TED Talk called The Difference Between Hearing and Listening. The thing is we confuse those terms, hearing and listening, because the ear hears, but it can't interpret. It simply transmits the audio waves to the brain, which is where listening takes place. And incidentally, in music programs, there are courses which are called ear training. And I'm saying, well, you can't really train the ear. The ear just does its job, right? What you have to train is the mind. And then if you're training the mind, you're training pattern. So I think there has to be a new way of regarding hearing and listening. And that listening is more mysterious. I mean, hearing you can measure scientifically and know. all the different parts of what's happening in the ear. But listening, nobody really knows what goes on. If you're listening, you may be listening in all the different ways that people... do that, right? It's because of their experience, their understanding, their interpretation, and so on. So to me, deep listening is not something that you can just define. Fair enough. So what are the... implications for musical performance for somebody who is cultivating their listening muscle for lack of a better term Well, as I said, the deep listening band formed from that experience in the cistern. And then we continued over all these many years to play and to release maybe seven or eight recordings. We always wished for a way to bring the cistern into a venue, to bring the acoustics of the cistern with us. And it really wasn't possible. I mean, people think about reverberation, they call it reverb. And you can play with a variety of reverberations, but not the experience of being. in that space surrounded by the sound and with the sound being sustained and traveling around you. I have a colleague at Rensselaer Polytechnic. He's an acoustician and teaches in a program called Sonic Architecture. And so we took Jonas, Jonas Brasch, we took him to the cistern. We took him there and he took an impulse response, which is what acousticians do when they're trying to measure a space. And he brought this material back to... to Rensselaer and with his graduate students they created finally a simulation of the cistern and so that was for my 80th birthday and on the stage we in this really magnificent experimental media and performing arts center that we have at RPI, we've had an audience of 600 people, and they were all in the cistern with us. And it was an amazing experience. People were... kind of really blown away. It was a really beautiful birthday present to be able to play in the simulated cistern. And so now we've been able to do that and we also released a recording, the 25th anniversary of the Deep Listening Band in the simulated cistern. But how about for somebody who is, say, enrolled at the Deep Listening Institute or is learning deep listening, whether it's in an academic context or at a retreat, some of the exercises that you have people do, you know, for instance, having two instrumentalists on a piano. a stage and they don't make a sound until it appears to them through the act of listening. I'm just wondering how... one gets to the other and how people can apply that into their day-to-day lives, basically. I like to think of myself as listening to the world as music. So whenever I'm anywhere, I'm always giving attention to what I call inclusive listening. In other words, I hear the movement out there. I hear the cough. I hear everything that's going on in the audience. And at the same time, I'm focused. on speaking these words that I'm speaking which are also sounds and sometimes I listen to speech as sound instead of listening to speech as to be interpreted or intelligence I mean the intelligence then turns into sound And then the sound turns back into another kind of intelligence. But at the same time, I try to have my inclusive awareness of listening as well. So there's two forms of listening. Focus and global. There's some nice little sounds. So it's a nice kind of accompaniment to speaking in this way. So that's part of my day today. It sounds quite busy, though. Something that you were just saying then is that it seems like there's some sort of connection between the act of listening and a way of being and a way of relating to people around you. That's right. And I just wonder if you can perhaps shine a bit of a light on the connection between one and the other. Have you ever been in the presence of someone who is very focused on conversation and you would like to be included, perhaps, but that person is so focused on the conversation that nothing else exists? So the person is completely taken in, taken up with that focus, focal attention. So there's no attention to anything outside of that. Have you felt that? Plenty of times. Yeah. Well, so what I'm proposing is that you can focus on what you're doing and what you're saying, but at the same time you can have awareness of others so that there is a kind of inclusiveness and a feeling that you're present, even though it may not be. not be able to give you the focal attention that you need. I can give you the inclusive or global attention so that you don't feel left out. I'm sure everyone feels very included right now. How can you cultivate this sort of dual level of awareness? Are there techniques or exercises perhaps? Yeah, I don't like the word technique. I think of it as practice. You practice these kinds of things and you notice, you take notice of how you are and what your attention is doing, where you're engaged, how you're engaged. Are you engaged in your own mental space, taken up and focused on the thoughts that you're having? Nothing wrong with that, but are you doing that? And if so, is there room for anything else? So the first practice is to simply listen and start to expand your attention to include everything that you can possibly hear. And without judgment of it, Ione has a nice thing that she says, lift off judgment. She calls it L-O-J. Lift off judgment. Don't criticize the sound. Don't try to analyze the sound. Simply include it in what's going on. That's what your environment is, is what's happening. This is not meant to... If you're being threatened or it's... dangerous, don't be silly. But you'll become a lot more aware of what is going on in your own daily context. Rather than simply narrowing your attention down to just what it is that you're trying to accomplish and not noticing anything else. That's a practice. And it's where to start. Yeah, obviously vocabulary is quite important in talking about these things. And sometimes it seems like we have a lot of words for things to do with sight, but not so much to do with sound. And that we find ourselves using the same old adjectives to do with hearing, which don't really perhaps... account for this expanded type of listening that you're talking about? Well, we talk about imagination and that means, I mean, imagination is about imaging and I talk about auralization so that I'm able to hear. to hear sounds. And so I ask questions often of people who are not necessarily musicians, but one question would be something like this. What sound reminds you of home? Can you hear that sound in your own mental space? So different questions that bring up aural alization is a practice also to begin to balance our seeing with our hearing. It wasn't too long ago I was talking to Tony Conrad and he was saying that This came with many pinches of salt, but he said that he considered it kind of remarkable that people seem to be more open-minded to listening to sound as sound in more recent times, whether through certain types of electronic music or... noise and things like that and I wonder if you agree with that sort of sentiment or if it's perhaps connected to a change in fashion rather than listening itself change in fashion you mean sound has become fashionable can you wear it that'd be pretty cool Wearable sounds? Yeah, maybe so. Well, I found that, to my delight, actually, that wherever I go these days, there are lots of young people at my concerts, and they seem to have understood something that was very difficult to come by in, say, 20 years ago. 10 years, 20 years, 30 years ago. It's been a long time coming. But it is here now that there's much more openness, I think. And I appreciate it a lot. So I agree with Tony. Can we switch talk for a second and talk about... the expanded instrument system. Oh, sure. Because that's something that has existed for a long time, but it's gone through various different changes as technology has changed. Yeah. I started by being very interested in... This has to do with tape machines because you have a record head. and then a playback head, and there is a difference in distance between these two heads, and you can monitor both of them. So if you're recording something, you can hear what you're recording, and then... It passes the playback head and you can hear what it sounds like after it was recorded, but you could hear those both at the same time. As a matter of fact, I made some pieces and I made a piece which was used for a dance performance by Anna Halperin, who's a wonderful choreographer. And this was in the 60s. So you could record and then you could play with the volume of having the playback come in and you would hear these reverberations that changed. And it changed the quality of the space. And so I worked with that quite a lot. That was the initial impulse towards what is now called the expanded instrument system. I got interested in it, and then I started... stringing tape from one machine over to a second machine so that they would pass another playback head. And then I used a telephone patch bay to send the sound from the second machine back to the first machine, either to the first track or to the second track. and so there were lots of different configurations of delayed sounds. And I continued this, and it was probably about 1991 that we could transfer this analog aspect of tape machines to the computer. It took a long time because the computer couldn't record a very good replica of sound. After it reached 16 bits, then it was pretty good. So then the expanded instrument system got to be transferred to computer. And then that opened up many, many more possibilities. What I was doing with the delayed sounds was modulating them or pushing another wave against them so that you get different kind of qualities of sounds. And so with the computer, then it becomes possible to do quite a bit more. I'm still working on it. So essentially it's a series of delays and spatialization tools? Yes. I play the accordion so I have two hands. So I have 20 delays for each hand. Up to 20. I don't always use that many but at times it works. So there are different delays, and then I have foot pedal control over bending the sound. And then I have algorithms that modulate delayed sounds, so they sometimes come back in different form. Is it possible for multiple people to perform on one of these instruments at the same time? Sure, yeah. For instance, when Iona and I perform together, I might take her voice into the system and modulate what she's doing. Not constantly, but in and out. I could bring several instruments into it if I want. I'm not using that today, tonight. Tomorrow night we'll be performing together and I'll be using the expanded instrument system which I call EIS. Okay. Has the experiences you had with developing that instrument Has that informed at all your instrument building for people of mixed abilities? Because I know you've been working on software. What we have is something called Adaptive Use Musical Instrument. We use the acronym OMI, A-U-M-I. And OMI is a free download and can be used on desktop and laptop. So it's being used around the world these days. Anybody here can go to that, Google OMI, A-U-M-I, and download the application. It's been continually worked on and improved since 2007. And it was a program for the class of students from an occupational therapist friend of mine. who wanted a technology that would enable the most limited students to play in her percussion ensemble circle at the school. And so we went there and observed what the students did. They were using mechanical switches to turn something on and off. by just hitting the switch with her. For example, the students that we worked with, I told her to give us three students who had the least possibility of performing in her circle. But they could trip a switch just by a little bit of head movement. That was it. So one of my students programmed in Max MSP software the first prototype of the OMI system. So the student would sit in front of the computer and there would be a, there was a vertical line and you could see the image of the student and you could place a marker on the, a virtual marker on the nose of the student, for example. If they moved their head this way past the line, they'd get a sound. Or this way. That was a pretty amazing experience to see these students who had never been able to do anything like that independently make sound. And it was not very long before they were... performing with Leif Miller's percussion ensemble. And so that has been developed by a lot of different people in different agencies now. There's a consortium of six universities with a researcher in each one working with this. And we now have an OMI iPad app. as well which is slightly different but it works on the same kinds of principles but it enables students of many different disabilities and people without those kinds of disabilities to engage in improvisation with sounds. What do you think about there being barriers to access with music in that a lot of people think they need to be taught a certain sort of way or gain a certain sort of expertise whether it's with a program or with a technique of their instrument or anything like that but a lot of your work is really tied into showing how illusionary that those barriers really are. Well there do not have to be barriers for people to engage in improvisation and making sounds. You do not have to be a trained musician to do that. I have a great respect for people who have trained long and hard to learn how to play an instrument, who play in various kinds of organizations, whether it's a symphony orchestra or a jazz ensemble. rock and roll, whatever it is, this is all really fine and it brings a lot of joy to a lot of people. But these people that we worked with have actually performed now in an international conference. and gotten a standing ovation. It would never have been expected to do that. This is a smaller group coming out of Blythe Miller's percussion ensemble. came to New York and performed an electronic music symposium. It was really amazing to see them do that. Your place in history is definitely sealed somewhat, and it's still expanding. But over the course of your career, did you feel like there was any barriers to the significance of your work being given the due respect? Because, I mean, personally... the amount of times that I hear about certain male New York minimalist composers and their supposed contributions to history versus perhaps what you have cultivated, there's a bit of a disparity there. And I wonder if that's something that, do you buy into that perspective or what was your experience of it? Actually, there was a gathering, I think, of composers and creative musicians in San Francisco. in the 60s, and I was a part of that. Also, Steve Reich was there, and others, Terry Riley, whom I went to school with, who was a lifelong friend. Steve and Terry went off and went to New York. Steve was very enterprising and also Philip Glass. And they built a career with their ensembles in New York so that they got that reputation through their own hard work. I didn't go to New York until... Much later, I was there. I got there in 1981. But I moved up to Mount Tremper, which was about a couple of hours outside of New York and in the wilderness, where you don't get much recognition. But I was happy because I was developing many things during that time. I never went after this kind of recognition. I simply did my work. And finally, you know, I'm old enough, I guess it's all accumulated and there's enough out there that something is beginning to happen. But there's a difference. There's a difference between someone who simply just works and others who work and ask for recognition. And it happens that men are much more inclined to do that. They're programmed in the breadwinner program. Breadwinner is the one who goes out and earns income to keep the house going, right? I mean, whether you do that or not, that's a program, a social program for males. So you've no judgment, of course. Judgment? This obviously is not some concern of yours, which way the balances of history tip in terms of who gets the most. I do have some, but today what I see is really some very wonderful women who are doing really well. Laurie Anderson is one of them. I mean, she's been very recognized and very special. But she was in the New York scene. And I was in California. Would you have anything to say to women who are making music these days who perhaps feel that there is a systemic bias against them? Yeah, well, I'd just say do your work. Do your work and stick with it. No matter what. That's what I did. And if you give up, then it's not going to happen. There's much more openness now for women to do many different things that they were not programmed to do. I mean, the women's program is to be the homemaker. Like I said, the man's program is to be the breadwinner, but that's changing. It's changed because it's possible for everybody to work and to do things, to earn income. There is a bias. There's no doubt about that. I mean, look at a symphony orchestra. How many players are women? How many are men? Look at the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. They finally admitted women. The only woman they had in the orchestra up until a few years ago was the harp player. And they kept her pretty out of the picture for a very long time. And there were reasons to oppose that. And so now there has been a change there. So yes, there are women who have gathered together to ask for change and ask for recognition and it's happening.
