Thank you. Mmm Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. LTJ Bookum is one of the most famous names in drum and bass, a UK-bred producer and DJ who helped smooth out some of the rougher edges of hardcore in the late 80s and early 90s. For some, that meant Bookum, born Daniel Williamson, was offering a much-needed cerebral alternative to the rough and tumble jungle sound that was also exploding around that time. Along with the artists he was signing to his Good Looking label, Bookum became a leading light for what many were calling intelligent drum and bass. He's never liked the term, though. He's long made clear that his end of hardcore was no more proper than what was happening elsewhere along the continuum. With a musical upbringing full of piano lessons and early exposure to classical music and jazz fusion, He came into early rave culture with a melodic streak that felt absolutely of a piece with his surroundings. In this career-spanning interview with Joe Muggs, Bookum touches on all this while discussing his busy present and ambitious future. Thank you. All right, Danny, LTJ Bookham, the man, the legend. What have the big events you've been doing this summer been? Yeah, well, last week I did Global Gathering, which was nice. Played at Hospital 10 and did a back-to-back with Fabio, and that was really good. With the sound levels, I find the festivals a bit annoying sometimes. Nowadays with all the kind of restrictions you have with levels and stuff so it's kind of It kind of can get a bit annoying. I'm used to the old days of the 80s with no restrictions, no holds barred, big sound systems. But it was a good time, a fun time. And a couple of weeks earlier I was over in New York actually to do Disco Biscuits, which is like a massive festival. They're a kind of band that's similar to Soundtribe, Sector 9. I don't know if you've heard of them. They do kind of massive shows all over the States. I was invited to play a set there, so I did that as well. I'm off to Womertown this weekend, which is down in Winchester. And then off to Outlook Festival, which you must know. It's a big one, yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a good time. And is this the work rate you've just had over the past years as there have been ups and downs? Because, I mean, you know, drum and bass, I guess, has been seen as fading into the background a bit with the rise of other genres in this last decade. But is this... how much you've been working all that time. I have sort of continuously for the last 20 years just been doing my thing and like I say Drum and Bass has had its ups and downs but there's still a very sort of strong core following in most parts of the world for Drum and Bass and I've been kind of going and doing those gigs and still maintain that. Let's start from the start. I mean, you know, you talked about an 80s background. Where did you first kind of get the bug of sound systems and DJing and all the rest? I mean, I guess the start of it for me, if you want to go kind of right back, would be when I was 10, 11 years old. And I had a big interest in playing the piano and drums and trumpet. I was very fortunate to have an amazing teacher, a guy called Nigel Crouch. And he basically, I kind of learned my scales and the classical stuff, which, you know, I kind of got into. I remember I used to like Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff and Katerchurian and certain composers like that. So it was a romantic sound from the start then? No, definitely, absolutely. And I was learning piano sort of full on. But then I kind of, I had a teacher when I was like eight, nine, then I met this guy Nigel when I was ten. And the first thing he came in and did... was play me Chick Corea, Lenore, on the keyboard when he came in and asked me if I liked this kind of stuff. And I was kind of dazzled. And so, what is this? Never heard this kind of stuff before. And he used to play me some stuff by Bill Evans, a track called Peace Peace. instantly I was hooked on that whole kind of jazz sound and then he would basically teach me and do the normal stuff over the course of an hour lesson and then afterwards sort of get me into improvisation, jazz, blues, 12 bar blues, that kind of stuff and basically also he would come around and leave me like Wurlitz's Moog's Rhodes that he had because he's like a session musician that played for all kinds of people and had every single keyboard so he would come round literally and leave the clave at my house for like a week and say have a mess about with that so you think of it and I would literally sort of forget about what I was supposed to be doing and just play these synthesizers and Rhodes and stuff and that got me so into the sound of soul, jazz. And he also took me to see Chick Corea at the Royal Albert Hall when I was sort of 11, 12 years old. And so I kind of got a grasp of feel of music I wanted to do and it kind of kept me out of trouble and that was kind of the start of my journey and then I guess DJing came into it sort of mid-teens whereby friends of mine would have parties And I'd go along to them and you'd do the usual thing and just have a laugh and whatever. But then I kind of really wanted to hear the music that I wanted to hear at those parties. So I used to steal my dad's stereo and speakers and reel-to-reel or tape machine or whatever I could do. And I'd get all my music that I had. And that time as well, I kind of, I used to be into kind of the jam as well. And a lot of kind of... that mod music and just a widespread stuff of disco, rock music, mod music. Well, there was a crossover there, wasn't there, in British culture of the mod soul boy kind of interface. 100%. 100%. And I'd just kind of go along and just... throw down the music and before very long all the parties I was just standing behind a turntable a tape machine and playing the music and that got my interest in DJing And, I mean, were you into the subculture side of it, the white socks and the fashions of it and everything? Not so much. I mean, obviously all my friends and stuff and different guys did and did get into that. But I was kind of just into the music side of it and then got heavily into like reggae as well. And I was just solely on the music side of things. And whereabouts did you grow up? At that time, actually, I was living in Watford, Hertfordshire. Yeah, so I was, I kind of, I originally was in Croydon in South London and then family moved to Watford and then spent a lot of time there and still have kind of a lot of connections in Hertfordshire and Watford to this day. And was there much going on beyond the parties you threw? I mean, it sounded like you were sort of doing it out of necessity to hear the music you wanted. I was, but then a kind of few of like-minded friends came together and it was kind of heavily into the sort of 80s, 80s time, getting into the sound system culture, which was massive then. Sounds like Coxon and Saxon and Java. all these kind of guys and then you have this whole system of guys like Rap Attack Special Edition Norman and Giles doing the Camden Dingles thing and so you'd be going down to London to these oh absolutely yeah because we are very kind of I think the Pirate Stations had a lot to do with kind of your education of music. Could you get them out in Watford? Totally, yeah. Yeah, yeah, totally could, yeah. And they kind of, really kind of got you kind of educated into the music you wanted to hear. And there were so many parties. I mean, in those days, you could go out five nights a week, I remember. I've gone to places like Gossip's, seen Radigan in Dean Street, places like People's Club in Paddington and Prairie Street. And just used to kind of go out to all these things whenever you could and just hear so much good music. There was such an explosion of good music. And then you had so many record shops, of course. unlike today. And so you could spend a lot of your time going to record shops. And I thought record shops as well were a good source of just... It was a culture in itself, I think, record shopping, where you kind of went and just met different people. And it was just good communication. And, yeah, I kind of miss that nowadays with the whole online stuff and whatever, because you just had a good, it was a whole culture just going down and meeting people and buying records. And then, of course, you had the record fairs as well. I remember I used to go out all weekend. and then get up Sunday morning after going out. In fact, we were still out, basically. go and get some breakfast somewhere and go to Kings Cross or go to a record fair and try to pick up all the tracks that you'd heard like Alistair from Rap Attack play at the Acklam Hall in Labrador Grove and it was just an amazing time and I also started a sound system with some friends of mine called Sunshine and we one of the members his dad Helped us build some speakers and he also owned a weightlifting club in Watford So we basically spend most of our time underground was only underneath the car park And we said most of that time just there literally all night Just I think we were stealing all the the drinks from the gym that were sitting there and just basically playing music all night on this sound system and that was that was me that was kind of me and what I wanted to do for life from then. And that was, I'm talking like, I don't know, 17, 18, 19. And did you ever get any sense that what was happening in this sound system culture at the time? time was going to lead to bigger things in mainstream culture or were you purely doing it for the sense of belonging to the underground? It was really I think for the sense of belonging to a community of people of like-minded people and also it was we used to set up parties in houses and charge like two pounds to get in. And that money would go directly back to buying music because, you know, I hadn't got much money then, really. And I had like little part-time jobs and stuff. So it was really just for maintaining and acquiring music. And also becoming a DJ in my mind. I had no idea that it would ever take to anything or go anywhere. Or I'd be where I am today. No, I mean, it's just not even, you know, I would never have believed you. So it was just, it was purely self-sustaining. Absolutely. And what about as, you know, you started to get to like 1987 and the cold cut and bomb the bass and... massive attack and and different people from that kind of exact scene you're describing started breaking through with you know sample collage records and stuff i mean did that sort of inspire you to think here's something new definitely in the same time of course you had the uh summer of love the acid house thing and by that time we were all going to massive parties of 10 20 000 people a lot of them were in the home counties in Hertfordshire and stuff and and and around those places so we we spent a lot of time going to those parties and in fact I remember going to a few of them and I'd be standing there then someone would tap me on the shoulder and I'd go they go hey Danny how you doing I'm like yeah yeah what's happening this is my party I'm like, you're joking. I'll be like, I went to school with him. So like a lot of these, a lot of these people I kind of ended up knowing without realising that they were doing what they were doing and I'd be like well I'm DJing now you know can I get like a little gig at one of these things or and that was a big part of me getting onto the scene and then doing stuff so it was really that whole that whole house thing and that really kind of propelled me into kind of thinking well I can actually maybe possibly earn some money from this and take it somewhere to I mean to step back you know sort of two notches was there a point when you realised that this Summer of Love thing was something different because obviously it had strong connections to the soul and reggae and everything that was happening through the 80s but was there a magic moment for you when you just kind of looked around and went this is a new thing now I don't think you could not notice that. I mean, it was just, I always kind of say to young kids that I know and kind of see out and about, they always talk and reflect about those times. And I say, you really... missed something amazing and the whole kind of scene in his infancy infancy i mean it was just it was just like i was saying at the top of the interview you know the sound systems were just phenomenal there were no restrictions a guy would go and hire someone's field of a farmer and be able to let loose and go and do where we had to go and do and these things would I remember going to gigs and sort of being there for eight, nine hours. then just going home for a shower and then coming back again for the next like two days kind of thing and just literally staying in there and listening to all these guys play the most incredible music. There was no kind of set format to music as well. It was just such a mishmash of different things and beautiful music. It was an amazing time. You had to, there was no way you could not. say this is something massive and big you know the police are still trying to stop it all which was always, to me, kind of almost destructive in a way because a lot of the times in those parties, it did bring different cultures and different communities, different nationalities together. You had the blacks, the whites, the Asians, and everyone that loved music has always been universal language of bringing people together. And it certainly did then, so it was a shame that the police kind of tried to just break it up and make it something that was a bad thing, when you actually looked at it properly. it was a good thing. Obviously, they had some, you know, I guess there were some legalities and things to consider and stuff. But fundamentally, it was a good thing. Totally. And obviously, it then progressed through into hardcore. And, you know, that had its kind of more mental elements. I mean, how did you feel about the scene developing through that and then into the, you know, the breakbeats and jungle and so on? I mean, like I said, there was always, if I remember, there was always a hardcore element. You know, I mean, you know, Joey Beltram kind of menthas and whatever was a harder track, if you like. And then you still had... You still had your mellower house tracks, but everything was played in the same light kind of thing. And as you say, it did. I was a big kind of follower of hip house as well. I now understand why, because I used to love the break element. It wasn't just the force of the floor. You had this little break kind of shuffling along underneath it. And that used to kind of, I used to kind of enjoy that because it used to remind me of the. 80s hip-hop stuff that I used to love so much. And then, of course, like you say, it kind of progressed into the floor being left and then the break being so on its own. And then suddenly we had German bass before we actually even knew it kind of thing, you know? And that was really me. I thought, I love it. this this is this is the piece of me let me let me go off and concentrate on that and is that when when that started to appear is that that's really when you started thinking about making tunes or definitely i remember um 1990 i did a tune A friend of mine had a semi-conner studio. I remember we took the breakbeat from Funky Nessa, which was used in the 80s by DJ Mink, the hip-hop guy. And we took that and I did the track, which actually is funny. The other day I was collecting together stuff for the catalogue. for iTunes and stuff. And it's actually featured on my producer album, which is this series of albums that we had in the 2000s for all the artists on the label called Looking Records. And I was playing it the other day and it sounds so hilarious now to listen to. But it reminds me of a good time. for me when I was just starting to kind of feel my way around the studio and learn how things worked and think I was doing it, but it's quite a funny track, but you know, some of the times, but that was kind of the first time. that I made music. And did you think you wanted to get straight into studio? Because obviously some people were just going Amiga, plug it in, there we go, that's all you need, like one floppy disk and an Amiga. Or were you, because you had, you know, quite a musical background, were you already thinking, I want to be in proper studios, like proper musicians? No, because at that time, you know, we couldn't really, I couldn't really afford. unlike today when you can just do everything on a laptop and you can almost nick half of your stuff to actually make the music on you couldn't go and nick an outboard keyboard outboard you couldn't go and need to nick a mixing desk you had to have some kind of setup the computers obviously weren't as fast as they are today as well so you were limited actually to to a certain extent of how many tracks you could almost have on a on a tune before it started getting a bit messy and out of time so it was just atari computer and uh i think an early version of uh c-lab creator right or something i think i used and then um just kind of used what you could use but obviously musical knowledge and having music to sample and stuff was a good thing yeah so you could reference different bits and pieces And you had an instant idea because I've been out for so many years. You had an instant idea of where you wanted to go, what you wanted to sample. It was just the construction of something that was maybe difficult that a few of you would get around a computer and you'd work it out basically. And then, you know, you were gigging. You were kind of this was your job now. your tunes were coming out and then 1993, which we've spoke about before, but that was the year that kind of Jungle separated, Jungle Drum and Bass really separated from Hardcore Techno on the other side and you made music. That's right. I mean, before that, of course, I mean, the label Good Looking Records started in 91, 92. Yeah. with Demon's Theme. And then, as you say, music, I think, was the third release in 1993. And you're right, it was in itself its own genre. It had its own people doing its own thing, its own music, and it really kind of took off on its own. And did you have... negative feedback because of course like you say it was its own thing and it was very separate from I mean Jungle was still known as Dark Side Rave in a lot of quarters people were still doing that kind of long dark tunnel um very dark sounds menthas and noises and all the rest of it and here you were bringing musicality and sunshine and it's true but it's funny you mentioned it's funny you mentioned that in his long dark tunnel yeah because you now go back and play that tune To me, it's quite a musical track. It is, yeah. You know, and maybe at that time it was referred to as maybe a dark track, but you think back to it now, it was a very, very harmonious musical track, you know. But I wouldn't say there was, I mean, certain places, I do remember. going to certain gigs and promoters would say, you know, Bookham, this is not going to work for you really. You know, I actually like what you're doing, but people want to hear it mad and dark and loud and stuff. And what you're doing, maybe it's got a bit too much funk and melody in it. But it's funny because at that time as well, You know, I've liked all aspects of music. So there were tracks that I used to play. When you go back, I mean, my Mixcloud page, I spent the last year uploading all the old sets that I can find from that time. And if you go on there and check it out and check the kind of history of what I was doing, a lot of stuff was actually, I'd say it was dark. I do like that aggressive side of music as well. And I've always kind of incorporated the dark and the reggae and the musical and different things take me at different times and I'll represent those things. Yeah, you certainly were never shy of a big amen break. Exactly, exactly. And certain kind of that whole mentasm sound and, you know, I used to love that. So there were, I think... In general, there was negative feedback to the whole scene in certain quarters of the press, saying, you know, what are these guys doing? You know, what is this music? It's, you know, it's rubbish. It's not going to last two seconds. And always heading like a quote, you know, people and the press said what we're doing in drum and bass as a whole thing wouldn't last. like two minutes, two years, let alone, you know, 20 odd years. So there were kind of, there was skepticism in what we're doing, definitely. Yeah, I mean, I can remember as a teenager kind of hearing this stuff, only hearing it on my mate's mum's car stereos as we drove through the countryside, you know, just going, this is a bit of a mess, this stuff. And, you know, of course you don't realise until you hear it on a system and you've got the bass kind of holding it down while all these brakes are flying around. Then you're like, OK, there's sophistication here. Definitely. I think another thing as well, you know, obviously at that time and right throughout the 80s, we didn't, you know, people didn't know the, maybe the seriousness of sampling a piece of music from someone else. It was almost like the thing you did. And that was the way you made music. There wasn't no understanding of a sample clearance or... like this and that was that I find really funny going back and listening to like a lot of the old tracks just with how kind of obviously people would sample stuff And even like the big rave tune from the last week would get sampled and re-sampled. Exactly, good point. Everyone used Cubic by Atoit State, you know. That's right. 50 different records, 100 different records. Yeah, that's right. Someone would make a track and then someone would actually, there would be no time delay, there would be no gap between, okay, well, someone's used this sample, we'll wait a couple of years before we use it again. You're right. And I guess you were sort of slowly differentiating yourself from that with trying to, you know, bring in the more original sampling and more live musical elements and stuff. I mean, I think that's my love of jazz and soul and stuff. And also at that time you had, you know, you had Korg and Roland. producing a lot of great keyboards with some great sounds. And I used to love all those cosmic kind of string and pads that used to be created on these keyboards. So I had to mix kind of these pads. sounds maybe get a guy to come in and give you like a little live trumpet or sax hit or something and and and mixing all that with samples as well it was just a gorgeous mix of sounds that I just love to use, I guess. And I mean, to bring in another negative, did you ever, you know, there was this term intelligent drum and bass. Here we go. Which I'm sure you've dealt with this many, many times before, but which must have been a millstone around your neck. I mean, in certain senses, it was a racist term because it ended up being. white student-friendly drum and bass as opposed to the ragga jungle, which somehow was meant to be unintelligent? Well, I mean, there's several points there. I mean, first of all, I don't think, you know, to have, I've always said to have something and call something intelligent, then the rest must be unintelligent, which is kind of a bit stupid. in itself and as well it's it didn't really define a musical sound for me because in all aspects of music even the dark stuff you had a nice musical pad that would appear in a track as well so what do you you know i've kind of never i've never got into this whole labeling of music and never know where that kind of came from Because, you know, it wasn't just student-y white kids making the music. Very much the opposite. It was an all-cultures thing. It came from everywhere. And different people made different sounds, different times. So it was, I mean, even today people. want to label something they're into and how can I do that when I come from a time when you just heard a piece of music if you liked it you play it and that could come from any genre of music it doesn't matter so it was never it never kind of made sense to me But you were happy to go with the drum and bass scene. I mean, you sort of felt that as home. Definitely. You were willing to be contained within drum and bass per se. Definitely. It was a very exciting start of something that I was there at the beginning and wanted to be a part of and have met a lot of. great people through it and it was just just an exciting time for the music and and definitely 100% I was LDJ Bookham drum and bass DJ producer so tell me about the social side of it as we go through into the the mid 90s I mean um you know what what was happening with the clubs that you were playing at and running I mean, Drum and Bass itself attracted a lot of high-profile people from all walks of musical life. And the club scene, there were some fantastic... clubs that became famous right up until now like Metalheads and Speed and our own Logical Progression that was at the ministry and around the world and stuff and then of course you kind of got into A lot of big labels, like the Londons and the Sonys and different people became involved. And then you kind of really kind of sensed that it was something serious. Out of something that was done of love and fun and just to do stuff, it became an actual career for a lot of people. And I think that was kind of really the, that was the change. That was the start of the change. And was it exciting? I mean, glamorous? Because, I mean, that was a time when the music industry was swimming in money. That's right. As James Lavelle said when I spoke to him recently, you know, it was Spice Girls money kind of flooding in. It was. And then there were people in the industry who wanted to throw it around. Did you have people like David Bowie? looking at drum and bass and that's right and all these these kind of people that's right did it feel exciting and glamorous it i mean it was just it was just nice to know that something you started doing had some future to it and you could actually leave a daytime job and and go and do something with yourself because it was something you want to go and do glamorous i'm not sure I'm not sure it did kind of feel that to me. It was just proof that we were kind of all right in doing something that we wanted to do. And you're right, there were... You were never one to get quite so caught up in the DJ ego thing. I mean, I remember seeing you back in the mid-late 90s in Brighton and sort of thinking, oh, nice motor. And then you got out and carried your own record box. I was like, OK. Yeah, I still do now. There were a lot of people who did get caught up in the kind of, you know, got some lackeys and, you know, we've got people to look after. to me. Yeah. I mean, sometimes you go out and play three or four gigs in the night and I was genuinely tired and friends in the car would like, let me get out of here. And it was, that was the only reason why I did that. But I wasn't, no, I didn't, I didn't kind of have that. But at a point you did, you know, at a point you had to have like a driver because you think about it, in the early 90s, it wasn't so Like now, every weekend you're getting on a plane to go somewhere. And it was doing four gigs in the night, doing maybe 500 plus miles. And you try doing that and DJing, rushing into all these gigs and stuff. Sort of come like four in the morning, you can't even see straight. You can't even walk on the straight line. You need someone to like drive you to get to go. But there's a difference between a driver and an entourage, I guess is what I'm saying. Yeah, yeah. I had the people around me, but it was not for glamour reasons, just for assistance reasons. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I can certainly remember sort of walking into DJ booths at certain points and... Just having to get through, like, nine people who were all with the DJs there at the moment. But as well, as well, I mean, there were, you know, everyone went out with their crew because it wasn't as exciting for the people. knew the DJ as the DJ himself. It was fun times for everyone, you know, it was a, it was a, so you can understand like people wanting to be involved and, uh, kind of get wrapped up in the whole, like I'm with him kind of mode. Yeah. It was good. And, um, Because drummer bass has been seen as being insular. You know, people started setting rules about what it could and couldn't be. And obviously, trends move on. The music industry started to contract. Other things came in. Garage came in and then dubstep and so on. Did you feel you had to, were there things you had to do to readjust as that, as I guess the spotlight shifted from it? work hard work harder i mean you're right it did it did have it have its shift but i just think that it was so set in its ways with so many people and figureheads and their labels that it was kind of uh you know the stone kept rolling kind of thing and I wouldn't say it didn't need outside support and stuff from like majors and whatever. But I just think that drum and bass was set as its own genre and the labels and guys involved kind of took up the mantle and took it forward. I think that's really been proved recently that what was... often perceived as protectionism in a negative sense, has actually created an industry which, 20 years into Drum and Bass's existence, is rock solid. No, you're right, but then, as well, you still get high-profile pop artists still having their Drum and Bass mix on their digital single. If you like, along with their house and different dubstep and whatever, you still have the drum and bass mix. And I think that has always been something that's been there. It's been consistent right the way through. I don't think it's just been shelved and no one wants to actually be a part of it. And I think a lot of artists have, because maybe there was a point when drum and bass was too insular. And people would say kind of like, no, we don't want to do that for that person or that person. But then that kind of doesn't make sense, does it? You want the music to be out there. You want it to be heard by as many people as possible. And I think that there has been a... Continual trend from a certain time of artists doing drum and bass mixes of pop artists and keeping it there, basically. Yeah, I mean, I guess the point where I realised that that was fully acceptable again and was really changing things was that high contrast remix of Adele. Absolutely. I mean, that's just like, oh, this is an amazing piece of music in its own right. and you know Annie Mack plays it on a Friday night and the world's going mad to it yeah 100% and long live those kinds of remixes and that That, in turn, has led, you know, with what Hospital have been doing and then on to DJ Fresh and Drum & Bass having its first number one, 19 years or 20 years after Drum & Bass was invented. Yeah, which is amazing. I guess that must have sort of, a few people kind of done a double take when that happened. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it was more of a double take. Well, it had all kind of mixes to it, but it's just amazing. It's so good to see happen and it'd be good if if more of us could kind of follow and uh get drum and bass to that kind of level. I mean, do you have secret pop aspirations? Do you always think, oh, if I just get that vocalist, I could write a number one? I'd love to get, I'd love to remix a large pop act or, you know, I mean, you can interpret music in your own way from... bits and pieces of anything that you're given. So definitely it's something I think that I'd definitely like to venture into with the label running full steam now. I think that an album is something that I want to definitely get done for the label and definitely incorporate. all kinds of different styles of music and people from all genres past present and future and um i mean talking of genres did you follow the new things that emerged in drum and bass's wake i mean uh especially dubstep obviously which has changed the whole landscape which again like you say no one would have predicted from ultimately a bunch of boys from Croydon mucking about and doing stuff for their own pleasure has ended up being world-shaking. I mean, it's really shifted the industry in a lot of ways. Yeah, which is amazing. I mean, it's hard to... Obviously, I do follow what goes on in the stars. and the different things and they've got the whole trap thing happening and it's amazing and kind of, you know, a lesson to us all as well in getting something and promoting it and doing it to that level. I think it's fantastic what's happening. But musically, I mean, do you have time to keep up with kind of small shifts and innovations? It is hard because... To be honest with you, I must spend about three days a week, two or three days a week, just listening to drum and bass stuff that's being sent to me from all parts of the globe. It's phenomenal the amount of music that's being made in all genres. And I still get house stuff sent and tech stuff sent. I feel interested in all aspects of music. But you could actually sit for probably seven days, for 12 hours a day. You could, just keeping up with, and you still miss something. You still get to like six months out of nine and think, what's that track? And you still miss something. thing and that's a both beautiful and annoying thing about the amount of music via me because I I'm an addict I want everything that I like that could possibly be in my computer to go and play out it's really funny the mixture of kind of expressions I can see on your face as you describe that process of listening there's a there's a mixture of total love for it work ethic and obsession. Yeah, there is, yeah. Because as well, you have to, I find, with me, maybe other people are different, but I find sometimes I'm not in the right frame of mind to actually digest music. And, you know, you can't, you know... There is a certain work ethic to it when I have to put aside some days in the week to do that. But if I'm overtired or just not in the right frame of mind, then you can miss things that you can skip over by not concentrating fully. And that really does wind me up. And I like those times when I'm... When you hear someone play a track... that you slept on definitely yeah which is again an annoying and a beautiful thing because she raced up to me going what is that it's a wicked track I've got to get hold of that and then at the same time you're like you go back to that producer and go please send me that they go Danny I was saying to you six months ago and you're like you're joking me and you know that happens so Well, I guess I was going to sort of round up on where next, but, I mean, you've said you're working towards an artist album of your own. Definitely. I mean, Good Looking Records, as you say, has been going for like 20 years. We had a small break and relaunched this year, and we're literally putting out an album a month and a piece of vinyl a month. well which some people are surprised at but it's something that we want to continually support and in June we had the first release of a new mix series concept called Booker Min Sessions And July, we had an album called Collectivism. This month, we got Makoto Producer, following on from the Producer Series. Next month, we got an album called... Resistance. Then we got also a new Earth album coming as well. Because I'm still interested in that kind of whole down-tempo stuff. I do love to hear that music still. We got a Studio X album. We're basically doing a lot of stuff every month, which you can check out, of course, on the Facebook of Looking. and the real LTJ book on Twitter. And I mean, yeah, it's definitely leading towards me to doing an album which I'm semi kind of working on now. Have you got specific ideas of people that you want working on it? Type of instruments or type of vocalists? I have. I'm sitting with a long list. And going down it and trying to work out, you know, who I'd like to work with, who would work with me, what kind of ideas I want to go and do, what kind of styles I want to do. And it's kind of a whittling down process that you can't kind of sit in this and go, yeah, okay, I want 16 tracks and that's what I'm going to do. I think it's constantly a work in progress. kind of excited about doing with all the new kind of processes of making music and stuff. And yeah, can't wait. And I'm DJing constantly every weekend as well. Now without the vinyl and using Traktor, which has been a whole new experience for me as well in the last three years, but the best thing I ever did in my whole life. And yeah, we go on. You sound like an optimist. I mean, it sounds like you're comfortable with where the scene and technology and musical developments are and your place within it. I am. I think it's exciting times for... music and for how you go about processing it, DJing it. I really do. I kind of say the amount of music that's coming through and stuff, but that's fantastic. If there was nothing coming through or people weren't making music, I'd be sitting here feeling very glum. For me, in good looking, it's all about the fans. I've had some fantastic fans over 20 years that maintain to follow what I do and come out. I've just been doing fabric for the last six years. I'm now doing 12 months a year of fabric every month, bookkeeping sessions the last Friday of each month. And I mean, you know, the room is packed for the people wanting to hear that music. And for me, it is all about the fans and the music. So it's, you know, yes, I'm definitely optimistic about what's happening and what's going on. And I think you have to embrace change as well, which is a hard thing for an old guy like me. to do sometimes. But I think you have to embrace change and adopt it to what you're doing. And it's a good thing. There's too many kind of, you know, with the age of people kind of... writing online and everything else, you know, there's a lot of negativity kind of out there and that, but I don't see it in that way at all. And I see positive, I see good things happening and I think we should all embrace those things and not be so negative about it so much.
