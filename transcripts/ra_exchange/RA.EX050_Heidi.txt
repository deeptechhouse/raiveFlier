Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Stephen Titmuss and I'm a freelance writer for Resident Advisor. To the casual observer, Heidi's rise to the top may seem perplexing. She's not produced many tracks, or even been playing records for all that long, yet she's managed to score a slot fronting BBC Radio 1's In New DJs We Trust show, broadcasting house and techno to a huge worldwide audience. In fact, Heidi's journey is fairly uncomplicated. A fun-loving personality and gift of the gab, of course, mixed with a bit of luck, has meant that Heidi has often found herself in the right place at the right time. From her early days listening to Indie in to setting up the influential Fonica Records store in London. We talked to Heidi and found out that it's an ability to not take herself too seriously that's helped her get where she is today. So you grew up in Canada? Yes. So whereabouts in Canada? Well, I did, I grew up in Windsor and I lived there until I was about 21 and then I moved to England when I was 21 and I've stayed here since then. So it's been a long time. So for someone who's... He doesn't know Canada's geography, what it's like. Can you maybe describe where it is? It's on the Great Lakes. So, I mean, that's a good way of putting it. The city is the most southern tip of Canada. And, yeah, it's on Lake Erie. So, it's just there, just sitting there at the bottom, collecting dust, as I would say. It's suffered a lot over the past few years. It's going through some pretty pretty bad times at the moment But I mean, I think it'll come out on top eventually. So what was like growing up there? It was Awesome. I have to say I love living there. I love growing up there I had a lot of amazing friends and I mean the older I got like when I became old enough to drive and stuff that's when everything sort of, you know, became a lot more happier and brighter because then I just started going over to Detroit a lot and going to gigs and going record shopping and just being free, you know, so. Yeah, there wasn't very much to do in Windsor, you know, music-wise, so everything was sort of happening in Detroit. Like, every band stopped in Detroit, and every, well, later on when I got into dance music, you know, the DJ scene was pretty fierce. So, yeah, it was great. I mean, it was just a good place to, I mean, it's a cesspool. Cesspool? No. That's what we were looking for. It's a pool of creativity, that city. There's a lot of people in bands and a lot of artists and everybody was into music. I have to say Canadians are really, really, really into their music. They know what's up. They read about it. They research it. They know what's going on. A place like Toronto, it's all great. More of the electronic acts. like Warp always did really well in certain places in Canada because they were really into the sort of obscure stuff and the indie stuff. So that's cool. So was I. Yeah, so were you originally a bit of an indie chick? I was completely an indie chick. I mean, my mum and dad were. like majorly into into rock music there are music like freaks actually my dad is a vinyl collector he used to buy two copies of everything like one with his initials on it and the year he bought it and then one that he would you know not one that he would touch and then the other one that he would play and there's always music playing all the time like during dinner like as soon as he got home from work always the radio was always on in our house like all the time. So what kind of bands were we talking about back then? The first loves? Well, I mean, first, first loves, I'll have to say was like Janet Jackson. And I was really into the sort of like new Jack swing sort of era, like Evie, Evie and the boys and like Jodeci and I'll be sure. And like all these sort of like. R&B, like early, like late 80s, sort of. I mean, I was quite young. I was like 11, 12, like that sort of time, dancing around in my bedroom to Lisa Lee's Then The Call Jam on 96.3 FM, because we got only American radio stations. We didn't get any Canadian radio stations, thank God. Music's pretty bad. But we were lucky in that respect. And then, obviously, when I got to high school is when I kind of found my footing. And then I was really into it when I started to. take drugs, to be frank, when I started to take acid and mushrooms and things like that, and the whole other world was opened up to me, and I was really into the shoegazery. The very first Verve album, A Storm in Heaven, is one of my all-time favorite albums ever, and Slow Dive and Spiritualized and stuff like that. And I took that, that was like, I was into that for a very long time. So you clearly got into like the wrong crowd at high school or the right crowd. The right crowd. Yeah, totally the right crowd. If I got into the, I mean, if I got into the wrong crowd right now, I'd have four kids. I'd be fat as hell living in Windsor with a garage, five cars and, or it's not five cars, sorry, five kids, two cars, you know, the whole thing. But no, I definitely got into the right crowd. That's for sure. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I wasn't ready for that yet, or now. So what was the kind of tipping point, you know, when you first got started into electronic music? Was it friends, DJs, radio stations? I know it was 1996, and I was bartending at this bar called The Loop in Windsor, and it was quite a hub of, you know... who's who and cool people and just trend it's a quite trendy place and they had you know good music playing and yeah and I met Richie Hodden through a friend of mine used to come in there all the time and yeah we just kind of became friends through he was on like a downtime he was I think he was making his consumed album because he lives he's from Windsor and he had a house there in the studio yeah we became friends and he sort of opened my eyes to that whole world I didn't really know anything about it to be honest with you my sister was really into that sort of music um she was into actually plastic man and things like that and when I met Rich I didn't know who he was or what he did so um I was like oh yeah my little sister listens to your music But like I said, I was more into rock music. So yeah, I went, I think it was at St. Andrew's Hall in Detroit, which was like the mecca of every single rock gig that I ever went to. And which was then is transformed pretty much into a club, which was with Richie, I think, and Jeff Mills. I think it was called the Black and White Party or something. And yeah. It was completely different than anything I've ever seen before or heard before or felt before. And I went in there and yeah, the energy like zapped me like straight to my legs. And I was like, okay, this is it. Like I'm into this. I'm feeling this a lot. And yeah, I kind of, I got the bug and that was it. I was ready. I was ready for it. I wasn't ready for it when I was younger or else I would have already found it. But I was definitely ready to find it then. And I did. And then I moved to England shortly after. I flew over to go to Glastonbury. And that was like another thing. I was like, whoa. Okay. Right. England's where I need to be, like, music-wise. So I just came to England on vacation, saved up all my money, and I flew over and went to Glastonbury, and then that was it. That was like... That was me done. I was like, okay, I'm done with Windsor. Going over to Canada. I mean, going over to England and I'm never coming back. When did you make that first gastronomy trip? It was so, oh man, it was one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had. It was just, oh God. This is back when there was, you know. it wasn't like it was today. I mean, I remember paying some scouts for like 10 quid and he was like, you don't have to pay him to get through the gate. And I was like, that's great. So we get like paid 10 pounds, went in. and spent the whole three days but I was with my boyfriend and his brother and my other friend from Canada and we were not prepared at all like obviously this is before cell phones too so we didn't have any any communication with each other we had like a two-man tent and just no wellies no nothing and just I had a blast I lost everybody the whole weekend I spent the whole weekend on my own just like you know, screwing around listening to music and getting drunk with strangers and it was awesome. Hanging in a stone circle. Yeah, I don't know if I made it there the first year, but I went every year after that for like 10 years. Oh man, that's the reality. So maybe go back a bit, you know, when you was, you know, first getting into electronic music and stuff like that, was it just, you know, from a passive perspective, were you not really... participate in the music like djing or stuff or just going out no i oh god i wasn't djing no no i was just going out and dancing like that was my favorite thing to do just going and sweating and just just the whole energy like the lights and the sound and the vibe it's just complete opposite of what i was experiencing going to rock gigs and it was way more high energy And I loved it. I just, I completely got sucked into it. And then, the thing is, I moved to England in 1997. And then it's like the world of electronic music is ten times bigger here and it pretty much dominates anything. You go to anywhere and it's just like, you know, it's clubs. What were the kind of like first nights that really caught your attention when you moved to London? Well, I started working at a bar called The Dock. Dogstar in Brixton and it was quite a hot spot and I think Brixton had kind of had like, which is now like you could say shortage with now, but like Brixton really, you know, got life back into it after all the really bad things that happened there and they reinvented themselves. And yeah, Dogstar sort of like... this crazy cesspool of characters. Every night was like a different electronic night and they used to do, um, Andrew Weatherill used to do a night there. thing called Electrocuted and they used to do drum and bass night which of course was my favorite night because I really got into drum and bass when I moved to England in a big, big, big way and I was dating this guy and he was really into it and we used to go and rock out to all the drum and bass nights and it was fantastic. I also was going to like Lost The Lost Nights with Steve Bicknell and as well the Haywire Nights were my all-time favorite nights, I think, at the premises in East London because it was just, that place was just disgusting. Disgusting? And perfect. But in every way, the music was loud and it was dark and sweaty. And Andrew Weatherall was like, he's one of my all-time favorite DJs. That man also turned me on to so much stuff that I've never heard before. I swear, he was like... five years ahead of everyone and was playing stuff in a way that just sounded like a whole other genre of music. I think he was creating his own genres while he was DJing. So it was, um, it was, yeah, him and Radioactive Man. I don't know. I always, I, I liked all different kinds of music all the time. I was never like one type of music all the time. It was always like, I had my fingers in all the pies. So I just liked to dance and it had to be bass driven. So yeah, like I said, hence why trance music never got me. Thank God. Yeah, no trance music with this lady. I appreciate why millions of people love it, but unfortunately it just doesn't do it for me. No, not enough bass lines. And you said that Derek Carter was a huge influence. Yes, Derek is, yeah, another thing, because Derek, I used to go to the end, to go to the Classic Records nights, and watch him get completely inebriated, but yet able to work three or four decks. at the same time whilst pouring like drinks over himself and other people around and it's like just oh like he just rock like rock out and like it just wasn't like that place was just jumping all the time people were just busting out there was no like There wasn't a moment where the dancer wasn't completely rammed all the time. You know, like Luke Solomon as well. Like those guys, they knew what was up. They were, you know, they were like the biggest house label of all time, I think. And it's prominent. All the releases, and I used to love it because the covers were all done by the same artist. Can't remember his name, but I used to kind of collect them. Actually, they're all up over there. And, yeah, I was a big fan. Still am a big fan of Derek. Derek is one of the reasons. He's why I asked him to do the vocals for the Jackathon compilation because he has one of the sexiest speaking voices ever. Yeah, just pure filth. Pure Chicago filth, which is right up my street if you've ever listened to me DJ. Oh no. We gotta take it up again. Yeah. How's that elbow? I like it. Way to go, baby. Are you happy you came? Nowhere else would you rather be. I just fell head into it. Completely like kind of pushed and I didn't really push aside my my rock my love of rock music But it did take a side seat for a little while. It was fun. I just loved it. I was like yeah great Just dancing just dancing all night long and being like spit out to the street at 6 a.m. Going to the pool of sweat It's actually a really good feeling So do you not have any aspirations at that point to be a DJ? No, not at all to be involved in music that's why I moved to England like I was I was just I've been a music lover since I can remember that's all I've ever wanted to do is just be I didn't know what I wanted to do I just wanted to be involved in music somehow like I was always thinking I was gonna come to England and work for some you know indie label and discover some big band or just you know something like that I honestly being a DJ was like the furthest thing from my mind I had no no aspirations to be a DJ, but it just kind of happened by accident. So like most things in my life. Yeah, so I suppose when you did move to England, you started working at a record store, is that right? A couple years after, yeah. First I was working in a bar. I was working at the Dogstar in Brixton. I was managing that place. And that was a really cool place to meet people. Because all the nights were really good. Apex Twin was playing there. And all the drum and bass. I was really into drum and bass back then. Well, like, you know, um, crew writer used to have residency there and it was just cool. It was just, you know, and on the weekends it was house and techno and stuff, kind of unknown DJs, but yeah. And then in 2001, I started working in Kubla, which is, was this little record store on Barrick street. And that, that was that. Yeah. Then I just started to learn about everything. I thought I knew a lot about music and then I realized I didn't know anything when I got to Kubla. And then, yeah, over the years, I just learned a lot about the labels and the music and the people and met a lot of amazing... friends who are now friends like long life friends of mine and it helped it helped sort of pave the way for who I am as a DJ today definitely what were you doing at Kubla exactly I was just selling records It's pretty simple. I was standing behind the counter, probably being bitchy at some point, which I'm sure most people who are listening to this podcast will agree with you. Sometimes I wasn't the nicest of people. You guys have to understand that I was definitely a minority in that shop. And sometimes my patients were worn pretty thin. And then I just, yeah, I'd snap sometimes. But most of the time I was very friendly. But yeah, that's it. I just worked there. And then we got approached by two sort of backers. And they really wanted to do something creative with a shop that they had bought. And the guys who own Fact Magazine worked for them. And they came to us and they offered. us that which is now Phonica and they said hey here's some money do what you want with it we're like sweet so yeah me and Simon Rigg and this guy Tom Merlene opened up Phonica 2003 and that was that was a big deal like a big deal for me and we started from nothing and it became such a such a big success I'm really happy about that. It's still a really big success and it's great that people still go there and, you know, buy records. Because what was the thinking at the time when you thought you because at the time there was a lot of record stores around that area Yeah, there was tons. We were actually really worried. We were like, oh god, is this gonna work? I don't know We have so many loyal customers here But the guy who owned Kubla was a complete and utter dick like and I will say this this guy Richard who was like some little rich kid who opened a record store trying to get friends be cool and popular It was just a big coke head and he used to steal all the money out of the till every Friday night when his dealer came in. And he sunk that place. Like we could never make any money because he just was stealing it all the time. And it was bad. And me and Simon were like, oh, we got to get the hell out of here. So yeah, we made the right choice. It was like a big leap of faith, but it worked out in the end. And we don't know where Richard is now called Flat White, and they make good coffee. So maybe just to give people an idea that might not have been to Fonica, might not know so much about Fonica, can you kind of say the people that would regularly come in there, because it's a real hub in London, you know? Yeah, at the beginning it was, because it was there also before the big electro house boom, you know? And... I mean, just all people who now were big producers and DJs who are like unknown men, you know, used to come in and buy the records every week. And people, you know, this is before digital stuff. So people still were coming. Everybody now that is a DJ from London or who lived in England shopped there. And it's just great. Everybody come in and it all talk about music and where they're going. this remix. It's just great. It's just a really cool place to work. I enjoyed it a lot. I mean, except for Saturday mornings with major hangovers. But yeah, there was actually a lot of hungover mornings in that place. Oh, the younger days when I could deal with hangovers. Because I suppose even the ex-staff, if you do a roll call of that, it's pretty deep. Will Saul used to work there. Will used to work at Kubla, actually. Oh, really? Yeah, before he used to work with us at Kubla, too. And James Priestley. And, you know, Anthea. And who else worked there? Hector. And yeah, everybody's kind of gone on to do... Good stuff. I mean, it is a stepping stone. If you look at all the people, a lot of the DJs and producers, most of them have worked in record stores. And I think it's just a little, it's a stepping stone to kind of get to where you want to get to, if you want to get there. So you think it was really important for you, you know, just being on the count of the people? Oh, yeah. 100%. 100%. I mean... I gained a lot of knowledge and I had like, I had an entire record store at my fingertips. And the thing is, I knew almost what every single record sounded like in there. And it's good. It definitely helped. I created my own sound with it. So this is why I still go in there today. I was in there a couple weeks ago, or a week ago, and honestly, there is so much stuff in a record store that you will never get digitally. Never. And it's so important that you go there, even if you buy it and rip it onto an MP3. It's just so much good stuff that I don't get sent. And it's just fun. I love going to record stores. It's therapeutic for me. I feel like it's some sort of therapy. I feel really happy. It's like a solo mission. You go in, you know, it's calming for me. I enjoy it. So perhaps as a general point, why do you think Phonic has still survived where so many other shots have gone to the wall? variety and the ability to to get in music that a lot of people are afraid to get in you know like there's now I mean the thing is Simon Simon Rake is a genius in the fact where he knows what people want and he knows what's happening and what's hot like you know what's bubbling on the underground before it actually So are you DJing at this point at all? Nope. I started in 2004 or 5 and I was just playing like hip hop and reggae and stuff just for fun with my ex-boyfriend. He had a night. He was into breakbeat and stuff which made me into breakbeat and stuff. And so I used to go at all the breaks nights and I sometimes he started doing a night and I was just play hip hop and funk and reggae and ragga in the back room. So that was my beginning. Not just, you know, just for fun. I didn't really know what I was, I was just having great time. And yeah, then it changed. I don't really remember. I can't really remember how it changed the exact day, but I know when. I sort of started playing house music. People were just like, you should DJ, you have good taste, and blah, blah, blah. So I kind of started playing house in the back rooms and things like techno and stuff. And yeah, then I went to go see Mandy in 2005 or 2004 at like a nightclub for Muck at the Key. Do you remember that? And I met the Mandy guys from Get Physical, and that was that. We became friends and then they invited me to Berlin to play. I still didn't even know how to mix, so I was just dropping tracks in and out. like on the, you know, on the breakdowns and stuff, but people seem to enjoy it. And, and I just, it's, that was it. It kind of just started happening. I don't even know. It happened so quick. I didn't even really know what I was doing. So like the first couple of years, I was just like, you know, making tons of mistakes and not really knowing, having to learn in front of a thousand people, which is really difficult. You know, I didn't have And over the years, I've sort of mastered the craft. It's taken me a long time, but I think I know what I'm doing now. So that's pretty crazy. You're saying you're learning in front of like a thousand people or whatever. Yeah. How was that? It was scary as hell, man. I remember like my first ever gig in Ibiza was like 2006 at Monza. And they put me on like. the main slot and I was absolutely shitting myself. I couldn't speak. I was just like, oh, I think I threw up a couple of times. And then my two best friends were with me and they totally gave me the confidence. I just remember that being one of the most amazing sets that I ever played and I just did it and it worked and I didn't screw up. And it was like, the feeling that I had after that was like, I've never had that feeling before. And then that was it. I got the bug and I was like, that's it. I want to do this. Like, I really want to do this. So I kind of stopped working at Flanica like a year later. Just, that was it. I just leaped in. I was like, okay, either this is going to work or it's not going to work. I might as well just give it a shot. And I did a good job. I made the right leap. I jumped on the right path, which is cool. There's going to be a lot of bedroom DJs here listening to this and thinking, you know, I've been slaving away in my bedroom for 10 years. Those are the ones who hate me. Those are the haters on Resident Advisor who are gonna come up, pop up on this and go, "Bah, bah, bah." - But almost, can you give someone who's like a bedroom DJ a bit of advice, you know, how you get out there, like, you know, how does it work for you? - I honestly, my advice, I don't, it's really hard for me to give advice because I really feel that luck had a lot to do with it. And personality, you know, I knew a lot of people and a lot of, you know, I'm sure many people out there would like to think that I slept my way to the top as most female artists do, you know, out there. That's what we do. We just, you know, love to perform, you know, certain acts. on producers and stuff so we can DJ with them. No, I worked really hard. You know, I did work really hard and the first couple years of doing this as a full-time job was really, really intense. It's still really intense. I think now there's like a million times more people wanting to do this than there was back then. And now because everybody can make music, I do feel, I am really lucky as one of the few people that has never really had to make music to do well and get booked. But I think it has a lot to do with personality. And I'm a nice person. And people like promoters like to bring me back because I get along with them We have a great time and that's the point you go there to have I'm there to entertain and to have fun with these people This is my job, you know, and this is what they you know, it's a great job I'm super lucky but if you act, you know grumpy and bitchy and you're like complaining all the time and you're tired and People don't want you around. They're like Kate next I'll have somebody else who's a lot more interesting to be around. So that's my advice. Don't be a prick. It's really simple. Don't be an asshole. Things might happen for you. Couldn't have said it better. You better myself. So you said you haven't done much production, but you have produced. I was with my ex-boyfriend. I did a couple tracks with him. Obviously he did most of, he did all the like, you know, production stuff. I was like the vibe master. I definitely knew what I was doing when I was in the studio with him. I was looking, you know, I can read logic on a computer and I know what I'm looking at and stuff like that. But I didn't click the buttons, but I definitely. I did, you know, it was a joint adventure and we had fun. Then I did the track with Lopez too. I just, I'm not a producer. Maybe I will in the future, but I don't have the patience to sit in a studio and for hours and hours and hours and hours. Some men do, they love it, but I am too. ADD. Gotta get up and do something. Walk around, go make some tea or I don't know. Sitting around for 12 hours in a studio is not my idea of fun. I'd rather be out DJing in a club. It's kind of funny. I suppose you were the first girl on Get Physical really. Do you ever feel like First and only. First and only, yeah. like a first and only if you look at all the other labels there's only a first and only on almost every label really weird would you feel like you know you're often like the only girl in the boys club oh yeah oh for sure but i've always been a girl who's always had male friends and more male friends and female friends i'm not exactly like some prissy little you know girl who's like I don't want to do this and I don't want to get my hands dirty you know like I'm right straight in there drink all the boys under the table you know that's sort of my vibe which I've done a few times I'm sure a few promoters can tell you yeah they um I definitely get along really well with men so yeah just because I guess I don't take myself too seriously. I just want to have a good time and enjoy myself. I think that most of the guys in this business are in the same reasons. Most of them. There's a few out there that I'm sure aren't in it for that reason. Do you think it's been an advantage then? I'm not going to say that it's not been an advantage. That'd be silly to say that being a woman... doesn't help in this industry because there isn't very many of us so when we do do something people look at us and of course we're scrutinized and we're like looked at and like we're criticized but we're also praised you know so it's um yeah it's definitely something that has helped me for sure I'm not gonna say it hasn't because that'd be stupid And when a woman can go out there and do it and do it well, then it's a good thing But when they do when they make one little mistake, they're all over you They're all over you like they just won't let you live it down like, you know But if a man does it they like they brush it off, but if a woman makes a mistake, that's it It's like you're done for done for It perhaps heightens the focus on you as a DJ and a producer. I had to work really, really hard. The last few years I've managed to really work at the craft of mixing and DJing in front of a lot of people. But I had to work at it. I made a lot of mistakes. But I also like, you know, there of course is always going to be people in the crowd who are going to be pissed if you screw up a mix. Whatever man, like they don't know the circumstances They don't know if you you know if you slept or if you you just did seven gigs in a row You just flew from Tokyo you've had you know what I mean like people don't know it's not easy You know these people like we're not machines. We are humans and we we know we sleep and we eat we bleed you know it's like it's crazy and they don't they don't really get it they just think that we're robots they think that we shouldn't ever make mistakes because you know like we're so lucky to have this job and blah blah blah and yeah it's sometimes it's hard sometimes you just can't help it you just make mistakes You just do. And I mean, I hear DJs, some of these like the biggest DJs on the planet who are, you know, doing this for 20 years. And like when I hear them make a mistake, I'm like, I just made a mistake. And then I'm like, oh, yeah, thank God they do it, too. Do you think it's, you know, almost there's too much focus in the world of dance music on things like mixing? Well, there should be a focus on it. I understand that. There definitely should be a focus on it because that's what you're doing. You're mixing music together. But yeah, sometimes things screw up, but whatever. Of course there should be a focus on it. Please don't get me wrong. That's what it is. We're DJing. DJing is combining two things together and you should be able to do it properly. Of course. But yeah. But to take it to its logical extreme, you've got someone like David Mancuso, who can do an amazing party, which everyone's having a great time with, and doesn't even mix records. Yeah, this happens in Wolf and Lamb. Those guys, they don't always mix too. Well, the majority of them do. Sometimes they'll just drop records in there, and just get on the mic, and the party goes off, and people love it. like thank God for that like thank God for people like that it just makes me happy knowing that there's DJs like that out there that aren't like it's not about being super technical because when you get like you know these long drawn out mixes for me I just think that is the most boring thing on the planet you're like Like, come on, let's go. Where's the energy level? It's just like this long... Yeah, that's not really my sort of thing. I'd rather just drop it in there and watch people flip out. So going back to the Radio 1 show, which obviously has been a great thing for you, how did that first come around? I know, I got a horseshoe up my ass, I think, as they say. my agent in America is also well he was I'm not with him anymore but he is Pete Tong's agent as well and they were like hey there's this show coming out called the New DJs We Trust and they're doing you can do go and do what's the word I'm looking for Guest show? Yeah, I can't afford. Like a fake show. That's what I'm looking for. How are we on here? I just lost my train of thought. Like, yeah, anyway. I went to go do a... Guest show or something? Audition. That's the word I'm looking for. Audition. So I went, and I haven't listened to the radio, and I'm not joking you, in over 10 years. So I've never listened to the radio. I mean, I do have listened. Obviously, you're in a car, you listen to it. But I never honestly turned on a radio and went, okay, I'm going to listen to the radio now. Because I worked in a record store all day. And I did, yeah, I went and did I asked Love on Stroke if he would do a little fake interview with me because he's a mate and he's like yeah no problem so I called him up and we did this like this thing and this radio show and I handed it in and two months later they're like yeah you got it I was like what? cool so yeah I was actually totally blown away by it like oh my god I can't believe they want somebody with my speaking voice on Radio 1 and I was really worried that they're gonna like it yeah they they loved it and it's really I was really lucky in the fact that I could get the people that I wanted on the show and I got a really good lot of good guests Because I knew everybody from working in the radio store. The radio store. The record store. And, you know, just from touring and met a lot of people. And it was great. Just so nice to showcase music that I love to a really big audience. It was scary as hell. Like I had Richie Houghton as my first guest. So I thought he was the reason why I'm involved in this. Like, it only felt that, you know, only felt right that he was my guest. And because I didn't really know what the format was, I interviewed Rich in my kitchen in Berlin, like you're doing now, like a recorder, over dinner and stuff. Yeah, and little did I know that all they needed was like three minutes of, or four minutes of, and we had like an hour and a half, like blah, blah, blah, blah, Me and him just yammering on, slightly pissed. And yeah, it was cool. This was really, really cool. I've learned a lot. The people there at Radio 1 are so awesome. Really good crew. Like super into, you know, really positive. And they back you, like no matter what you want to do, they back you. So it's cool. Did you naturally take to presenting? really weird I have the gift of the gab like you meet me out in person and I'm like blah blah blah as soon as you stuck a microphone in front of me in a room with nobody bounce off of I like froze like the beginning I was just like I kind of choked I didn't really know how to talk to everyone and no one so it took took a few took a few tries and then I got the hang of it yeah I was like I still was like talking like I was talking to people in the room, but they're like, no, you have to like, you know, talk like you're talking to one person and everyone, which is really hard. But it's cool. It's super cool. I love it. And do you ever like, because obviously you're a Canadian talking to a British audience, do you ever get problems with kind of language or things like that where they don't understand you? Oh, yeah, yeah. See, I knew this one That happens, and it happened a few weeks ago when I described Nicholas Jarvis' drum patterns as spastic, because that word is not used in the Canadian vocabulary to describe what you guys use that word for, and I got a little bit of trouble. And, you know, I don't know. And it's also the title of one of the biggest techno records of all time from a person from my hometown. So, yeah, I kind of, there is sometimes I have to bite my lip. Definitely bite my lip a few times. Because I do, I am quite a trucker mouth. I can be. After a few drinks, I can be quite a trucker mouth. I've learned to speak slowly and more pronounced and yeah, things like that. We don't want to hide any Russell Brands. No, no, I'm really good at holding it down because, you know, you don't really need to, there's no need to be swearing when you're like on the radio. You don't need to use those words in that sort of context. Sometimes. So what place do you think the radio show has in the digital thing? There's just so many places you can listen to music now. Do you still think it's important? Oh, yeah. Well, the thing... My show, it's more about the listen again, because I just saw the figures, actually, and I get a lot of people listening again, because it's on for seven days after, and that's when people listen the most, I think. I get lots of clicks from around the world, which is nice. So yeah, that sort of music is wanted and needed by other places besides the UK. I mean, there isn't a lot of that music going around in America, like of the more underground sort of genres. But yeah, I get a lot of good vibes from people around the world, a lot of nice emails and stuff. And they're like, thank you so much. So it makes me feel good knowing that there's somebody in Columbia listening to the radio show like that night or somebody in LA or something else. It's called Australia. It's great. It's just a great feeling. It's an absolutely fantastic feeling knowing that you're spreading this music and anybody around the world can listen to it at any time. So, it's good. What's your favorite part about doing the show? I like the interviews actually, because the thing is everybody that's ever been on, I've known quite well. So it's really nice to be able to showcase my friends' music and also have like a little cheeky sort of like laugh with them on air. And I always want, because most of the people that I know and have on are quite big characters. And I want to showcase that. I want people to hear that they're really funny. They're not so serious. Like, this isn't such a serious business. You know, it's actually really fun. And people need to hear people laughing. I do giggle a lot on the radio. I think I'm just laughing at myself. I suppose that's almost the opposite perception for a lot of techno. It's very po-fade. No, they need to get over it. Come on. Like, it's just, this is supposed to be fun. This is the idea. I think people lose the whole concept of what this business is all about. It's supposed to be fun. You're supposed to make people dance. You know, that is it. It's so simple. Smile, laugh, dance, have fun, enjoy yourself. Like, that is really it, the bottom line. People can't do that and don't want to do that. They're totally in the wrong industry. Yeah. Just piss off. Do you think people just overthink things too much? Oh, God, yes. Oh, God. Especially in, like, the techno world. It's just a lot of serious business going on in there. Sometimes it becomes about money and it becomes about fame and I just see, you know, you see things, you see people that were once level-headed turn into complete dicks. It's really unfortunate, but, you know, some people lose their way. Yeah, that's, who am I to judge, you know? what they want to do, then that's what they want to do, but that's not really my vibe. Feels like you have got a lot less baggage than some people coming into things. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I don't know what would happen if, say, I was Tiesto, you know, or I don't know. I mean, the thing is, I've met him, and he's actually a really awesome dude, so that's the thing. He's a really cool, level- And I'm sure there's times when he's not so nice. People are always like, well, people are always nice to you, Heidi, because you're a girl. I'm just like, come on. I'm like, I like to think people are nice to me because I'm nice to them. Like, come on, man. Like, you know, people can be dicks because people are being dicks to them. That's the way, that's it. It is actually simple. You just look at it like from the outside. It is so simple. It doesn't need to be difficult. Obviously, we're talking about how things are going to be simple. We're just making people dance and all that. And most importantly, you have your own party, the Jackathon. Yes, I do. So can we tell, tell us about that? Well, yes. I started the parties like 2009, like a year after I started doing the radio show. And I thought, okay, you know, I was actually seeing like Annie Mack. I mean, she's doing it and does it on a bigger scale. But, you know, Annie Mack presents and I could see, you know, she brings people that she likes and artists that she likes alongside her. And I was like, I could do that. I want to do that. I want to like start some parties and I want to just bring all and just have a party together. Because I was actually getting quite depressed. I was touring a lot. I was by myself a lot. I was just like, I really need to connect with some friends and get in people's faces and have a laugh with my friends. Because when you're touring, traveling alone a lot, you're kind of like... And yeah, and I approached Uli from Watergate Club because I had a residency there. And he was like, yeah, it's a great idea. Let's do it. And we did the first one, which was with Derek Carter. Of course, I had to have him. He's the reason why I love house music in the first place. And Lauhaus and Jamie Jones and Soul Clap. And I think it was like Soul Clap's first gig in Berlin ever. And I paid them with a bottle of tequila. Look at them now. And yeah, it was just great. So much fun. And then I just started to, because I've become quite friendly with a lot of the promoters I play for, I just approached them. I was like, hey, you know, I have this idea. Would you be interested in doing a night? And they were like, yeah. Like, I'm surprised. How would it be? But like, okay. Like, I really want to bring this person. They're like, sure. And that was it. I just You know, they're really diverse. The lineups are really diverse. It's not the same music all night long. So I wanted to have like a big sort of house party. I just wanted to see people bust out, like dance like nobody's business on the dance floor. And they have been. So it makes me happy. It's been super fun. And it's also great to have all these, you know, all your friends with you. you and just kind of have a party and everybody comes early in the night stays all the djs watch each other and they're standing there supporting each other drinking with each other it always ends up in a big shit show usually it's the end of the night nobody can remember anything but yeah like you say all friends together it's Everyone's been there. What I do really want to talk about is the Jack of Wands CD because it's actually put together by yourself. It's been all the tracks been selected by DJs you've worked with. So can you just talk us through the process on that? Yeah, I asked everybody that I love. Not everybody because I love a lot of people, but I did bring the concept and idea to a bunch of people. DJs who I respect and I love their music and I asked them if they wanted to make me a track for the compilation. Some of them had already played at the Jackathon parties and some of them hadn't and I just wanted to bring a diverse group of people all together, which is kind of what the parties do. and also kind of do what I do on my radio show and just kind of bring it more. I just wanted to have a compilation to give to somebody, to people, just people I've been supporting, you know? It's nice to have something to give back to the fans. And yeah, they all delivered, like, great tracks. I mean, I kind of knew, like, people were always like, I'm sure she's making a compilation, and she doesn't even know what anything sounds like. And I was like, yeah, well, that's kind of the thing that's fun about it. You know, I could just go pick a bunch of old tracks, jack tracks, but that's been there, done that. It's been done a million times before. I wanted to try something new. you know, exciting. So yeah, I did that and it was, you know, quite interesting trying to piece them all together because they were quite different from one another. But, you know, the feedback I've had has been amazing because every DJ likes different tracks, you know, like, so which one's your favorite ones? And then they'd rattle off three and then they'd go ask somebody else and they'd rattle off a different three and it's great, you know? It's nice to see that all of them It's been awesome. Like I was saying, I did the CD release party on Friday at Watergate and it was out of control. Seven years of playing there and it was the best party I've ever done there. Like people on people's shoulders and lots of sweat. Lots of people chanting and singing along to songs with no words in it. If that makes any sense. You know, it was really funny Solomon dropped body language downstairs and like I haven't heard that played in so long There's a reason why I haven't heard it. Thank God. I sleep like I needed like five years off from that track We dropped it everybody was like chanting along to it. It's really cute sweet and people are just going nuts the whole night was um, It was really special. So yeah, I played with Solomon until midday back to back with Lauhaus and Shenandoah was there and Kamiya. It was just like really, really nice to see that hard work is paying off, you know? It was a good night and there's many more coming, so. Watch that space. So how have you been selecting DJs to play? Because as you said, it's really wide encompassing the music style. Not all the time. I mean, I've tried the ones at Watergate is different because I have, I can have two floors when I have like same with Sankey's when we can have two floors that can make it a bit more diverse. But when it's just one room, you know, it's a tendency to kind of be not similar, but you know, a bit more choose the people that I've heard DJ that I like straight up you know or I've gone to see them or I've been at parties that they played at and they've just rocked it and I've you know it takes it takes quite a bit to make me bust out on the dance floor these days you know so and if you do it then you're coming to play at the jack-a-thon when was the last time you was busting out on the dance floor always when I'm DJing I'm always dancing around like a maniac but um I'm trying to think actually my no Detroit Detroit Electronic Music Festival yeah I was definitely soul clap played and it was great on the Sunday or the Saturday Sunday yeah Sunday They did me proud, my boys. I was very happy. I had goosebumps like eight times. And they played the track, which is the first track off the compilation. And they made like, I don't know, 2,000 people sit down on the ground. Like the track's called Get Low. And it like was just a sweet moment, you know. It's such a great time. I mean, I love going there. Obviously, the Detroit Electronic Music Festival is the best festival. in the world for me the energy's great and uh yeah that was like I did and also I think at the Watergate party at Sonar was really fun too because all the goodies were there all my favorite boys were all there it was it was nice it's really nice yeah not I mean maybe it's not so hard to make me dance I was lying. Totally telling lies.
