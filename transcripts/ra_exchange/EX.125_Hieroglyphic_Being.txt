Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artist labels and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Hieroglyphic Beans' approach to music is a singular one. The Chicago-based producer sounds like no one else. While he often cites the mentorship of Adonis and the memory of seeing Ron Hardy as key influences on his career, career, the abstract, noisy dance music that he makes is no one but his own. In addition to his own productions, the artist born Jamal Moss also runs a label, Mathematics, a platform he uses to showcase largely unknown artists to the world. Its aim is to give people a leg up without taking a cut from publishing, a rarity in the music business. I spoke to Maas in Poland at the UNSound Festival as he prepared for his debut performance with ITAL as part of RA's Live Exchange series last month. He talked about his music, his label, and his record bag, which, believe it or not, features a couple of records from Simply Red. you I wanted to get started by talking a little bit about what you're going to be doing here. You mentioned to me just now you're working in the studio with Itel. Yeah, we sat in there for a couple hours and just worked on something that we both felt that represented. himself as well as myself and not let it be too much of a hot mess. So I decided that I just laid some beats and some bass lines or whatever and some sounds and I let him just be like the brain in control. and keep it more singular and that multiple like brain mind fuck is what I usually do so it'll be more palatable for people to digest it easier because he'll be controlling the sending out the signals to everybody yeah have you done much uh recording together and rehearsing for this show was that the first time this is the first time yeah okay yep just went for it yeah But you'd heard his music before. This is where I'm supposed to say yes, right? Yeah. Hopefully. I've heard some snippets, but I've never listened to any of his stuff all the way through. I live in a bubble. I don't really get out much. Like, seriously. I sit at home, watch TV, play with the kitty cat, eat hot wings. I don't, yeah. So, yeah. So who suggested this collaboration? Was it unsound? I guess I still have no clue. I'm just here and I'm just going with the flow. Yeah Yeah, so yeah You do a lot of collaborations or is this you know one of the first times you've really worked in this way with someone People are usually too scared to collaborate with me because they don't know what they're gonna get So why do you think I tell I mean, what did he say to you when you were getting together at first? That was very vague. I just remember Matt from Unsound hit me through an email and said he was, I tell, supposed to work with someone else, but he couldn't make it. And they were discussing about possible people. And I guess I was one of those possible people. And then when he hit me up, I was like, yeah, sure. All right. Well, I was watching TV, my hot wings, playing with my kitty cat. So, yeah, I was just like, yeah, I'm down with it I was like, no, you got like 15 minutes to come up with a name because we're making the brochures and stuff. So I was flipping through some books. I read too. I just don't, yeah, eat hot wings and watch TV and play with the kitty cat. And I flipped through a book and I sent back. some names through an email and then they weren't filling it and I came up with one and they were just like the interplanetary prophets is what stuck and then yeah they just kind of threw it out there and they were just saying when we come together we'll try to work on some stuff and I remember when I was in New York and I ran into Itel and I was hanging out with him and because somebody he knows brought me out for a party and I tried throwing ideas at him but he kind of gave me that look like I through at him he really wasn't trying to say yes to but he definitely wasn't saying yes to it yeah so but we worked it out and people will be happy tomorrow did that answer your question okay all right we got there in the end it sounds like a sun raw name uh interplanetary problem Actually, it's from a book called "We Are Not the First." It's about how the human race comes from another place out in the universe. Yeah, and you know, that term comes from like a section in the book. Where actually I was like just stopped at and had creased the page Yeah, and that's the last thing I threw at him and that's it But yeah, it's from a weird fringe book that I read. I read a lot of weird esoteric fringe stuff No newspapers, no almanacs You know out there stuff. Yeah, where are you finding all this stuff? Do you have a local bookstore? Well, actually there's a guy that's just as kooky as I am, and he has a shop like half block from my house, and it's called Soapbox, which he sells records and vinyls and DVDs and books, and it's like a resale shop, so a lot of older people that's in their 50s and 60s and 70s have like these really eclectic like book editions, it's very hard to find and rare. and they'll just come in, he'll buy them off, and he'll put them on the shelf, and then I'll find all these books on witchcraft, and the occult, and like Masonic stuff, and like Illuminati stuff, and Illuminati does exist, so... Just really, really, yeah. I went to the church in Sweden. It's crazy, but it does exist. So in Stockholm, if you ever go, you can check it out. What's the church like? Very gothic looking. And it has like a really tall obelisk sitting in front of it. And there's a lot of armed men with guns walking back and forth. So be careful what you do and what you say at 12 o'clock at night in Stockholm. Yeah. That's a whole other story. but uh let's keep going yeah what's the book you're reading here uh this is Edgar Cayce the sleeping prophet a lot of profit yeah exactly but he is like one of the best modern day ones if people don't know about him you should really look him up he uh influenced a lot of people dignitaries politicians presidents corporate people average people yeah the works what is uh you know what is this book about and what is he saying he's basically the equivalent of what nostradamus was a couple hundred years ago but he would more than predictions or remote viewing of future, having future visions that he can like predict the future and tell certain things that would come about or you can tell if you have like sickness or illness, you know, strange things like that. People wouldn't believe but a lot of important people came to him. for advice and the whole thing was he did it and he did it for no money so he didn't do it for profit which is kind of weird i would have got paid if it was me but you know yeah how does the books and all these other things come into your work as a musician does it affect it in your mind well because i came from a childhood and upbringing that wasn't normal so no i wouldn't say uh I was one of those people that was like heavily abused anything, but I just lived a life where it was just more different from a lot of other people. And I was just like kind of a loner. So I kind of went off into fantasy worlds. I was all into like Jules Verne's and like Ray Bradbury, stuff like that. So it's always stuck with me from when I was little because. I was adopted, so I was like an only child in that household, so didn't have too many people to reach out to. So I would just reach within from whatever that was around me. And it just so happened the people I grew up with was into the... esoteric or fringe sciences, religion, you know, abstract thought or whatever and it was just books laying around and when I was old enough to comprehend it, I was able to comprehend it and it just stuck with me ever since. And you, early on, were you listening to music that was esoteric? Yeah, esoteric as well, a lot of fringe music, you know, I guess people would call it like free jazz or you know anything that was blue note anything that jazz musicians did or they had weather report laying around the crib or Jack Espresso story or some Herbie Hancock but a lot of it was like Pharaoh Sanders Thelonious Monk because they were some older generation so it was just like I got a different like feel for a lot of stuff and a lot of that stuff influenced me now so it's very hard for me to be linear and keep things simple because my mind doesn't work that way. I might need medication, I just haven't figured it out yet to get back to normal. Your parents were much older than a lot of kids of the same age. And so they had these records that maybe other kids your same age didn't grow up with. I remember you saying in an interview that, you know, like Parliament, P-Funk would have been the normal sort of for a kid your age, but that wasn't in the household. That wasn't in the house, no, because they kind of seen that as like... It's weird, this is stuff that was around my house, they seen it as more like stupid music. Yeah, and not things that can like activate the mind and the spirit and the soul. So they had a lot of like, I guess some people would use Christ consciousness, stuff that's gonna help elevate or like. empower or make the shock work, you know glow. Yeah, I came from a very tripped out black hippie family Okay, so it gets really out there. So yeah, and When did you get in touch with dance music? dance music You started going out to clubs at a pretty young age. Well, the dance music aspect came from because you live in a neighborhood and everybody would have mixtapes or have a boombox. And then two blocks away, somebody else could be into something. And then another two blocks over, somebody could be into something else. Or somebody across the street will have music that they play on their cassette player or their boombox. And you would hear it and you'd get interested and ask what it is. And then like that's where mixtapes would come in and people make little mixtapes and then pass them around. So I would get like my little bits and pieces of knowledge of dance music through that, but also got it too as well from like older people from the neighborhood that would talk about parties they would go to that I was too young to go to. And then there's a lot of influence too from like college radio stations. They would play a lot of eclectic dance music that was heard in like underground clubs But at the same time too, even though there were older people going out, a lot of those DJs would make their money playing school sock hops, as they would call them. or they would go to high school proms or homecoming games and they would DJ as well. So those influences kind of crept in just from that because I couldn't really get in the house, in my home, but if I'm at school where they don't really have dominion to control what I hear, it's going to eventually creep in to what I've already been accustomed to. Yeah, you mentioned sock hops and homecoming and dances and things. One of the things I was most interested in is you saying that, yeah, I saw Ron Hardy once at the Music Box. Yeah. I had the chance to see him at all these other different places as well. Yeah, he would play at other places too, like Mendel Catholic High School. They would do like these huge blowout parties. It'd be like close to 3,000 to 4,000 people. And this is like 85, 86, this would happen. Or he would play hotel parties. Or, you know, for a special occasion, but you just, the music box was the only place that you can go hear him play. It just, I was fortunate enough, and that's the thing, people keep talking to music box. but there was damn near 10 different locations. So whatever was supposed to be the original quote-unquote place, I have no clue. I just know I ran into two different locations that I knew about, but there used to be multiple ones going all over to the city, but I guess the most popular one was 326, and I was able to go down there twice and only got in once. And the reason why I got in once is because he walked up. And me and my friends were standing out front. He said, y'all can't get in. He was like, no. He was like, well, come in with us. And we was like, thought he was playing. But we walked right in and got a chance to experience what he did. And people quote unquote say the original place where it all happened. Yeah. Do you remember that night? What he played? How he played? Very sped up, very distorted. Hearing. different things happening all with inside the place, which I come to found out later he was using things called like crossover switches and then the sound system was customly designed to be a certain way. So it literally would be a wall going like this, just all bass bends. And then it'll be another wall with just tweeters going across. And then another wall with mid-range. And then some more bass. And then it might be like regular huge speakers right by the stage. They would just bring out the highs, the mids, and the bass as well. And then I guess with the crossover switches, he would do this weird like modern day you would call surround sound. They were doing it back then. But like on 10. and very like high-pitched and heavy bass. It was like... mad crazy and a lot of records that would be like at a normal speed he would speed up some people say it's because he was doped up on something so it sounded slow when he was high so he would pitch it up to make it sound normal to him but to everybody else it was like he's playing this stuff like on plus 10 those are just what I heard I don't know I just but when I was there I thought it was unusual but I thought it was cool because you're everybody's screaming and yelling and getting into it so if they're feeling it you think it's cool too and it's just like if a bunch of people said it was whack then you would think it was whack but nobody said that so you just went with the tide yeah you said distorted and that's something that also I think you talked to quite a bit about that you want your records that you make to have that almost sound in a way because that's what you've seen rock a party. Yeah. that sort of like, it doesn't have to be as clean or as pristine as anything else. - Well, music is, or what some people define as music is an interpretation of life. And for a lot of people, life is not as clean and pristine and precise and pretty. For some people, it is distorted and dirty and ugly and muddy, you know? So it's just like... For people who like that clean sound and if you think life is that perfect for you, then so be it. But I didn't come up. from that mindset, from that perspective. And that's what I gravitate to. I mean, even though I'm grateful to be here, there's still a lot of imperfections in my life and a lot of stuff that's not so good that I have to deal with when I go back home. And that still affects what I do in my creativity. I mean, there was a point in time in my life that it was birds and bees and pretty clouds and nice scenery. and stuff and I did that for six years but I wasn't feeling it and I just said I need to go back to what I'm accustomed to I didn't like that the happy lifestyle the clean lifestyle the normal normalcy I didn't feel complete because I wasn't programmed to be that way. I was tweaked to be something different and I just had to accept who I am and not give in to the other. Was that the six years that you were not making music? No, I was making music those six years, but I was living the good life those six years. and my music was starting to gravitate a certain way that I felt like it wasn't reflecting me. Yeah. - Tell me about the label you run, Mathematics. - Well, the label itself is kind of its own entity. It's more like a co-op for artists who's trying to get their name out to the forefront instead of waiting three to four years to be in the spotlight. I just set it up to a point where certain artists can get ahead of the curve and don't have to go through what I went through. Because I went through a lot of weird situations with certain labels or things in the industry. And I just said, if I got a chance to get to a point, I would try to just pass it on and help somebody else out instead of telling somebody who's 20 years old, well, you got to do your time and you got to pay your dues and you got to wait 10 years. you can get to the forefront. I feel like it doesn't have to be that way. I feel like if people have the creative energy now and they're doing something good and positive, I just felt like what my mentors told me, pass the blessing on if you have the opportunity to do that. And that's more what the label is about, is trying to find... young people, new up and comers, who can't really get a chance because they'll send their stuff to labels and labels won't put it out because they feel like they don't have like an investment quality to put out because they're afraid they might lose money on it. I've been broke all my life. I'm not afraid of losing money. So I don't have that fear. So I can take the chance to take someone that nobody's never heard of before. And then like, I do a lot of A&R and then like artist development with them to get them to a certain point of where they need to be. And I'll put it out and let the chips fall where they may. So there's some artists who worked out really, really well and doing good now. And there's some things in a bad way but you know that's a choice that I made and I have to live with and deal with but as far as the artists they put the music out with the label like I said it's a co-op whatever they put into it they get back and the thing is they own 100% of their music and a lot of artists can't say that if they deal with any labels so it's like if If the music is on point and it's good and it does really well, if any third party sync licensing is done, they get all the money for that. So I've had where John Heckle did real good and he was, I've submitted his stuff into the Quartz Awards and he won for like 12 inches a year and he won 2,000 euro. He got into it, you know what I'm saying? What he put into it, he got back. and he believed in himself and he really like pushed himself to get out there and he's reaping the benefits from it, not me as a person or quote unquote corporate entity trying to like bleed people dry. So when artists come to me, I tell them this like. When you write this record, you got to make sure when you want to eat and you want to buy this record, which one is going to be more important, that sandwich or getting this record? And I just said, if you was an avid record collector like I was, there were times you would buy records and you would just sip noodle soup, you know what I'm saying? Or just... drink hot water, put a little pepper in it and just do what you got to do until you got your next meal. So I was just like, it has to be a record. You know, you're going to keep 10 years from now. And that's what you should create. You shouldn't have to go and put out 20 something records like I did. I think this day and age, if you just do quality compositions, you can do really well just by doing three releases. And then just focus later on on what you want to do as an individual on your craft. So, and that's what I try to do with the artists. You get about three releases, and then after that, you should be fine. And usually it works out for them because I take them on and put them out. The labels who told them before they wouldn't deal with them, all of a sudden want to deal with them because now they have that marketability and that brand they can make economics off of. It seems like you don't seem that interested in developing an artist over many, many years. This is simply, this is your leg up. Yeah. All right, after that, good luck. I don't call it a handout. I call it a hand up. So it's just like I shouldn't have to nurture someone for so long because there's other things or other interactions in life that will nurture them to help them grow. I can just only do is help them and tell them what I've been through and what they need to do and not to go through what I went through so they can make it in a shorter period of time. And a lot of these people I put on are actually in school getting like master's degrees and like PhDs and stuff. So it's just like, this is a chance for them to do this. And then like if they decide to come back to it, they can because they have that blueprint to fall back on to still be valid in the industry to decide to take it on. You keep mentioning mistakes that you made early on. You know, what were some of those things? What do you wish you had known? early on? I actually have been patient and not put out a lot of shitty music. I'd be the first to admit it because I put out stuff because it got caught up in the hype of just trying to get a 12 inch out, you know? And it's just like, if you really think about what goes into putting out a 12 inch piece of vinyl, there's a lot of blood, sweat, and tears that go into making that. And some people take it. advantage that situation and don't really look at the blessing and the power that it has in that 12 inch. But when you realize it, if I'm not mistaken, oil is in the process of processing that 12 inch. So you got to think about that. Oil that comes out the ground, it comes from the Middle East or wherever it comes from, it hurts the environment. And you make vinyl out of that. You have this 12 inch that you put out there and then... you find people making plates out of it, bags out of it, that's the point where it's getting to and I feel like there's something sorely wrong where it's to a point where you could value wax like you would a piece of gold or a diamond to the point you got people melting it, making ashtrays or whatever. So it says like the sign of the times where we're out of tune. what good sounds are, the vibrations, the harmonies or whatever, and I think it needs to get back to that. And I'm one of those people who was at fault where I was just putting out stuff just to get it out there because everybody was like, oh, that's the thing you need to do. And I realized at a certain point I didn't want to do that anymore because I was doing more harm to myself than good to myself. Because they got to a point I was putting out stuff. that people was like, "No, this don't really sound like who you're supposed to be." And at one point in time, nobody would pick up the phone and even want to give me a gig or like put a record out by me. And I realized I had to quit doing it for what other people was telling me for them and I had to do it for myself and do it the right way. So my biggest regret was putting out a bunch of stuff that could have just stayed in the closet and worked on more quality productions and solid productions, but I still like the dirty sound because it gives that aesthetic or translate what I've been through in life, but there's a way I can do it for it to be still palatable and respectable in a proper way. You got a lot of feedback though early on, I assume, from labels saying, yeah, maybe I'd like... to put this out but you know you really need to clean this up or this won't fit with this clean sound. I've heard things that well you're way ahead of your time then when your time comes it'll happen. I've had people tell me like, yeah, it's not like industry quality standard. I've had people tell me a lot of things. But the whole thing is, is what do you tell yourself and what's right for you? Because you can go all day with people telling you stuff, but it might, the thing is, it's all about perception. So it's just like whatever person perception comes about. is reflected about what they deal with in life. And if you deal with certain people in a certain industry, you can't knock them because they want this certain type of thing done for their brand because it's their brand. They put whatever they put into it to build it to get to a certain point, and they are looking at the fact they don't want to put something on it that's going to jeopardize it, that cause it to lose its value. They want to have longevity. So I had to learn that over time and understand those people who told me no, why they said no. But at the end of the day, it still worked out because I learned to do it for myself and not for others. So it's like, if I had labels who loved what I did and totally supported it and pushed behind it, then I've had others that told me I had to go back and tweak and do something different to it. And I just told them I didn't want to do that because then it'd be totally something else that's not me. And you know, there's but I shouldn't anybody should not wait around to put your destiny in one person's hands that's a fool's game you should just do it yourself d-y-i you shouldn't have to wait for anyone for you to accomplish your life goal or dream so yeah when did this light turn on for you? At what point did you know that you saying I'm not going to listen to what other people have to say. I'm going to start the label. I'm going to do it myself. I'm going to you know go in this direction. The thought has always been in the back of my head but when you're around a bunch of people in industry that has certain influences on you because you would have called it peer pressure or you got the vapors or you're just joining the hype but you always know in the back of your head between right and wrong but then when you got to run a group of people that's what you perceive that you know is wrong but if everybody's doing it then you have the perception that it must be right because everybody's into it but then you realize over a period of time it's only a trend so those people who thought stuff was right at the time. Three years later, sell themselves out and go on to the next thing. Three years later, Lauren, they go on to the next thing. In the process, you were selling yourself out six years ago to appease these people who would have moved on to something next. So you might as well stay true to yourself. So I realized around 2002 that there was something wrong. You had all these people in industry, a lot of places I was hanging out with, they had this like very egoist point of view or mind frame. They had a God complex. So it was like if there was already industry, they would see people come in and treat them like they were minions or servants or like. Like below them. Those are things I noticed. I just said I didn't want to be part of this industry because I'm looking like everybody's running around at night acting like they got like God or got superpowers or something. And I was just like, there's much more going on in just the nightlife that things have to be done in the daytime. So I did my research and realized I don't really have to be part of this. I can just do this on my own and still influence what happens at night by just doing And the one thing that really just said I can't take it anymore, I would go out and I would always hear people talk about, I'm doing this, I'm doing that, I went here, I did that, I was with this person, I was in this country, yada yada yada this, yada yada yada that, I got this newest equipment that, I got this new synthesizer this, I got this new keyboard that, yada yada yada, I had sex with her, wow And then you realize nobody's talking about the music. The whole thing is just a wash. And it's like madness. And now it's just like, wow, everybody's talking about the ego. And then you realize you look up and you hear the music and you realize why the music is gone because the ego is totally tooken over. You see what I'm saying? So I just said I didn't want to be part of that foolishness anymore and I pulled myself out of it. And I used that as a learning curve and as part of inner self-development for myself. You know? Because I was getting caught up into that type of... energy field and I wanted to go a different direction. Did the music change at that point or was it already there? The stuff type of stuff that you were making? I got a better idea of what I needed to do and what happened was I went to a bar that was looking for a DJ, and this is the first time I guess I would consider myself a DJ. The guy was putting an ad in his bar looking for somebody to play records for the holidays or whatever. So I didn't have a record case, nothing. I just took my bed sheet, took a stack of records and walked in to the bar and there was about five DJs. They played all this stuff. And then I found out the guys were like from Manchester or something. They was opening up this bar and off the back I knew what to play. So I played some Simply Red and some Lisa Stansfield and some Barry White and I got the gig. It was just like that simple because everybody else was playing. No offense to any British people out there, but it was playing garage or whatever you want to call the sound or two-step. And they were just not feel I knew off the back that was a wrong thing because everybody was into the three-year height You know I'm saying and like always saw themselves out and I just said I will play some stuff I knew that they felt was universal and good Eclectic, you know sounds and I got the gig and I was doing it for five years I mean four years non-stop every weekend as developing to try to understand What is a proper for for what is a proper snare? What is a? proper core progression, whether it's a proper break. Even though I don't really apply it to this day and age, I do know because I educated myself because I sat there in front of 200 plus people every weekend. And the thing was, I didn't put my name on the bill, never told nobody I was DJing there. I just went in and just played the music and let everybody else. Feed off the vibes and feed off each other and not let it be about ego me walking up. Oh, hi I'm the DJ Oh, blah blah blah this and blah blah. I get you drinks at the bar sleep with me. I'm fake No, I didn't do none of that stuff I got behind there from 9 o'clock until 2:00 in the morning and I did that every weekend and sometimes I would actually do double weekends and then do private parties because people like what I did they look oh the guy with the na Can you come have us, him play our private party? You know, and that's what it was. They didn't know my name because I was just a guy back there, you know, playing records. And I learned a lot from that. So when I took the label, like, full-fledged, that gave me an idea for the better sounds to find and put out by certain artists. Because I got filtered with a lot of junk music for a period of time from, like, 98 till about 2002. You know? I'm having a really hard time imagining you DJing a Simply Red record, I have to say. Okay, you have no idea, yeah. If anybody's around Sunday night at 3:30, I'm gonna get it deep and sexy. You're gonna hear a side of me. I got it. Who was in Bristol? Anybody listen to the Echoes, the Young Echoes? Would you let them know it was deep and sexy? We got some witnesses. They heard a side. That's how I used to play every Friday for almost four years at this spot. And I think I seen some shock looked on faces when I was inside Young & Echo playing. They were just like, we didn't even know he knew he can get this deep. But I did. So if you be around Sunday. I'll be around. You'll get a feel for it. I'll be in the front row. Yes, it won't be all some rough jack tracks and bugged out. Yeah, it's, yeah. Get your dancing partners. Get it sexy. Yeah. How does that stuff affect the music that you make, though? I mean, you said the chord progression. where's the break, where's the four-four? Music that you make often, I'm like, I'm asking those questions, where are the core progressions? - No, but that's the thing, I don't apply it to myself, I apply it to when I listen to other artists who send me stuff, because when people send me music, they're obviously influenced by someone else or something they've heard. But when I hear what they do, when I get the demos, I can get an idea where the influence came from. So I can hear artists, I can be like, oh, he's got a little Todd Edwards going on, or he's got a little Masters at Work going on, or he might have an Arnold Jarvis thing going on, or a Larry Hurd thing going on. It's the fact that I sat there for those number of years and went through a plethora of good music and kept listening to it and listening to it. Now when I get demos, I can be like And so to say it doesn't work for me because I'm helping them grow and help them understand what who they're trying to become or who they are because a lot of people can make music and don't even really know what direction to go because There's no mentors. People try to front and say they got crews and they'll say, oh, I'm the head DJ. And these guys follow me around hoping to take my place. But there's nobody that sits down with somebody and actually like shows them and tells them and educates them, you know, like they need to. And I think that's too why the music scene is kind of weird, because the ego has really messed up a lot of things. So I'm not going to say there's probably not. A lot of people out there mentoring people, but right now, I don't know that many. I can't think a handful of people, this hand right here, I can't even count five. Maybe I can't even count three at this point. But I've actually mentored close to 12 artists on a label. And I felt like if I never make it big in my life in what I do, at least I was able to give a hand up to somebody who probably will make it big. So if I can't do it, at least I know I can help some other body else able to excel. You said in the past that your mentor was Adonis. Yeah. What did he teach you? you eat Can you distill some lessons? I mean, he taught me about a lot of bad stuff and good stuff in the industry and a lot of stuff that he went through in life. So he came from a humanist point of view and from his perspective of what he learned coming through the industry, good and bad. So it wasn't just about sitting down and just jamming out with my idol and like, oh, you made this song with that equipment and stuff? No, it was a human connection. and the music was secondary. So it was kind of like he was a father figure to me, teaching me stuff about life and stuff that goes on in life. So we talked about everything, economics, politics, booty, you know what I'm saying, porn, you know, books. Food, you know, girlfriends that pissed them off, you know, whatever, just life in general. And then the music comes secondary. And that's what I learned. Things in life affects your creativity. It's the same thing as when you, with literature, stuff happens to people in life and they write a book, you know, stuff happens to people in life and they do. visual medium you know stuff happens to people in life and they do motion pictures to tell stories about would affect them in their life or other people. So that's what I got from Adonis, from that aspect. And he also, too, when it came to the music, when I went to mess with his equipment, he'd always say, don't touch that because you might break it. You know, because I didn't really know what I was doing. And I wanted to use something so bad. One day he just gave me this really big, bulky drum machine. And I walked around for a year with it, thought machine then I'll let you graduate to the next level of touching other stuff and that's how basically it started yeah. You said earlier that you can sort of detect the influences of people that are sending you tracks who in your own tracks are your influences that you can hear through your music? There's a various peoples it just depends on the mood, like the swinging I would say Larry Hurd is one. What about his work is coming through and what you do? Put this way, Larry Hurd would be the epitome of what I want to try to do because it still has a dirty aesthetic to it, but it's clean and it's polished and it translates and it tells a story very well. That's why I admire Larry Hurd so good because he can do the most jazzed out stuff, the most bugged out stuff. to his gherkin tracks, to his acid stuff, to his deep house stuff, and it translates really well into a story across the board, hands down. So, and the thing is, he can talk in many different languages when he composes. So, I would say he's on top of that list when it comes to what I aspire to be like. And then you have like Herbie Hancock, where his involvement in the early 70s when he was dealing with electronic stuff, when he was doing his electronic jazz, you know, hybridation or whatever you want to call it. And then you have Sun Ra, of course, and you have Miles Davis with his Bitches of Brew. So there's like many different things that influenced me. I mean, and then you have... Manuel Gotzig with the E2, E4, because that was a mainstay in the house scene in Chicago. That influenced me a lot because it was a lot of cerebral harmonies going on. And that's really just the rough 4-4 happening too. And then, you know, you have Kate Bush, you have Laurie Anderson, like all these people, you know, that have a deepness in their own way of expressing. their art. So it goes across the board and it's like ongoing every day. I learn something new when I encounter other people. So in a sense, we don't do mixtapes anymore, but But we have FTP sites, the modern day version of it, or SoundCloud, where I can go to people's pages and hear stuff and still get influenced to this day. It's always an ongoing process. I don't know all, I don't claim to know all. Some stuff I know, I forget, and I gotta relearn it again. Yeah. What are you working on right now in the studio? What are the projects that are coming up? Well, right now. I'm not working in the studio because I'm here. So besides the thing I'm doing with ITEL, but right now I kind of scrapped everything that I have and I'm actually rebuilding and starting differently. So I want to be able to... Why are you scrapping everything? Because I feel like I've... I'm not saying I've outgrown the stuff I have. I feel like I'm in a different place now that I need to challenge myself. and go a different direction and try to evolve. So I'm not saying I couldn't evolve with the stuff I already had, but it's time for me to like, I guess, try the industry standard thing and get some of the newest keyboards and whatever, because I feel like I'm ready for it. But believe me, when I have this new stuff, it's still going to sound really fucked up. Yeah, so in the process. So I guess whoever was at Robert Hall, got a chance to see me bust out the magic wind flute. Any hands? Anybody was there? So you got to let me know how I sounded because I told you I gave a disclaimer. I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I didn't even have material made. I just went for it. But obviously people liked it. Magic wind flute? Well, it's called an iwi. It's an akai. But I call it a magic wind flute because it plays all wind instruments, like over 100-something of them. So it's like the oboe, the clarinet, a jazz flute, all that stuff. Horn. Why were you attracted to that? Because it's a way of growing and challenging myself. Why not? Because you go to a lot of shows and know just anybody who use keyboards. But it gets to a point if you see somebody from a laptop or a keyboard and you're paying your hard-earned money, whatever, 10 pounds, 10. year old to go see this person it's kind of like you could do that at home and sit in front of a laptop and just do this and then sit in front of your keyboard and do this and that's what kind of industries come to and it's like if you're claiming to do music then do music the thing is I never really claimed to be a musician I just claimed to be an experimental sound person the the techno asset house thing is what people label it to try to sell the records but I felt like maybe now instead of doing what I do or like feel indifferent about the laptop thing or the keyboard thing I just say you know what let me not talk shit and evolve and take it to the next level and try something different and hopefully people see what I do and say you know what maybe I'll get an electric harp You know or hook up a guitar and this is where I had a discussion with somebody the other day You know how the TB 303 was supposed to be an accompaniment for a guitar Have you ever seen anybody patch a guitar into a 303? Ever? Like, that would be interesting to see somebody actually rock a guitar out, pass into a 303 with the attack and the decay. So that could be a challenge for somebody to do. You see what I'm saying? Take it to that next level, you know? And that's all it's about. People kind of get lazy and mundane with what they have and really don't push themselves. And that's all I'm trying to do is push myself to a How long had you been doing the same thing over and over, so to speak, before you had this moment where you're like, I've got to chuck it in and kind of restart? When I started going on YouTube and seeing people who are actually trained music theorists or the fact in the town I live in, Evanston, Illinois, is outside of Chicago, there are actually music students who walk around and load these big-ass trombones and the violas and the upright bass. And I just said, it's kind of fucked up that I get to go to these countries and play in these really old cities and beautiful places. places and these kids are running around got their parents paying $50,000 a year hopefully one day they could do the same thing I didn't go through that rite of passage and a part of me just said I should do right by them for at least trying and not take this blessing wrongly and try to add more to the continuum because you really there are kids are running around hoping one day to play royal albert hall there's no way i should have been in that place you know there are people who sit around and train 14 hours a day with a violin and a viola or they go to opera class or whatever, or jazz class, and do this stuff hoping to get there one day. And could you imagine looking at a kid's face when they're telling me one day their dream is to be at the Barbican or the Robert Hall? I'm like, oh, I did that. That would crush them. You see what I'm saying? It's kind of wrong to even say that to them when they're going through this rite of passage of learning to be music theorists. And I feel like Some people just say, why do it when it's already working for you? But it's just like... I needed to work. Now that worked for me, just make it to work so I can feel comfortable and easy with myself for what I do. Because there's a lot of people running around, like I said, with these little keyboards and laptops and traveling the world and getting paid all this money. And you've got to realize there are people out there that really live and bleed and suffer and sacrifice for this with traditional organic instruments. And a lot of times they don't even... get to this point. There are a lot of people who will never get a chance to come to Poland, to be in Krakow, to sit in front of people and play in front of hundreds of people and do their craft. They might be stuck playing a cafe or might be stuck playing at a church. They might be stuck being a teacher to younger students, hoping they can, if they didn't make it, to pass the gift on so one day they can be somewhere grand or great and travel the world and do the same thing. So these are things that start to sink in my head when I watch and see other people, what they do. It makes me more grounded and humble because I revere somebody who can sit. down and do a piano recital and notice by memory and play it immaculately you see what I'm saying and there's a chance one day they'll never make it out of their town to be able to do that but they still sit there with joy and pleasure of the craft of doing that yeah I got some tissue if anybody's about to yeah tear up because I'm getting a little moist right now so Well, thank you very much for your time. Thank you. I appreciate it. You better be there Sunday night. I will be up front. You better get sexy. You'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Thank you.
