Breakdown. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. So today's exchange is with artwork, and as I said in the written introduction to this interview, we've never heard a story quite like his. Arthur Smith has been making music since back in 1989, but the sheer range of different hats he's worn during his career has meant he's never really got the recognition he deserves. Although in speaking with him, it felt like I was more concerned about this fact than he was. Most recently, Smith has been known for Magnetic Man, his crossover dubstep group with Scream and Benga, while over the last couple of years he's begun to establish himself as a solo artist through his party series Arts House. But as you'll hear during our conversation, these projects represent just the tip of a very large iceberg. Various people have been urging us to speak with Smith for an exchange on account of his sense of humour and knack for a story. And when he stopped by a London office recently, he didn't disappoint. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud. at ra-exchange. The exchange with artwork is up next. So a few people had approached me and said that we should definitely get you on the exchange. Right. They were telling me that you would have loads of stories, you're a really fun guy, and yeah, certainly something I could see from myself from your internet presence. So I guess I was just wondering, firstly, did you kind of grow up in a household where having a laugh was sort of the done thing? Yeah, that's all it was. Me and my brother and mum and dad. But my dad is a big practical joker, kind of never taking anything too seriously. Do you know what I mean? So it was, I grew up around that, you know. And it's kind of never left you. Well, I kind of left sort of school and went into Apple Records. So which is just like continuing in like being in school, but without the lessons. It was just like. lunch time for like 10 years I think it was just constant people you know taking the piss out of each other and having fun do you know what I mean so you've kind of said on the flip side of this that you feel like as an artist having this public persona maybe like even limits your option somehow or people think you're not taking your music seriously it's weird it's kind of like way back when I was doing the techno stuff with the grain records, at the time, all the people that I was sort of like, you know, the people that I was looking up to, you know, they were all incredibly serious. You would never have Jeff Mills, you know, crack a joke or anything like that. It wouldn't happen. And I think sort of growing up, it was weird for me because I saw these people. And I saw other peers of mine making music and being incredibly serious and taking photographs with stony faces and just putting out this music, like this incredibly serious stuff, you know, and you just, none of their personality came through on the music. which was weird for me because I thought my close friends, if I'd have put out a record and stood there, you know, black and white, staring at a wall or whatever, and they would have just been like, what are you doing? You know, they would have never, I would have never lived it down. So that's why I put the phone calls and stuff on the record and things like that. But it did catch people out because they get this record and it's got music that they like on it, but then it's got this weird bit at the end that's someone taking the piss or it's a prank call or something like that that was just a little bit of me in there to sort of say, look, I'm not taking it that seriously. But it is weird. It's sort of people don't seem to take you as seriously as the other guy who's staring at a wall. You know what I mean? So you would have been putting these records out in a time when there wasn't really internet or wasn't in widespread use. So what you're kind of trying to do in this is inject just a little bit of your day-to-day personality into the record. however subtly it was weird I mean I did do it a bit because I actually called all the records untitled and I called all the tracks untitled as well because I was like look it doesn't matter you know it's like I'm not going to call it Journey Into The Dark Light or whatever you know all these sort of things I was just like look it's just a track it's just a track it's called untitled blah blah blah that's caused me absolute murders over the years because anyone that wants to license it has got untitled off of the untitled record you know it's like it's been a nightmare but and that was me being a silly young sod i mean did you ever end up butting heads with any of your techno peers in sort of a personality clash style no not at all not at all absolutely not at all and and they just did their thing but i mean it was just the fact that I think I was making the music, but I was also always, I've always been never taking anything too seriously. I just, I like to laugh a lot. So I think if I'd have done a really serious sort of techno record and not put anything on there and taken the photographs and done all the press releases about. how serious it was, they would have just been like, shut up. You know what I mean? I would not have lived it down. So it was just, I was doing what I was doing. So sort of connected to this, there's very much the line of thinking in dance music, or there at least appears to be, that people should stick to a sound. Yeah. Right? There's this idea of purity where, you know, you are a techno artist and therefore you will make techno now and you will make techno in This is something you've never done in your career. You've done a multitude of different things. So what I'm wondering is how much have you had to think about what I just said, like over your 20 year plus career? I've always just loved music and I love all types of music. I mean, Duke Ellington said there was only two types of music, it's good and bad. And there really is. You can listen to country and western and, okay, there's a lot of bad, but there's also some incredibly good stuff. And it's just, it doesn't matter what kind of genre it is, if you're in a mood, a certain mood, and you get it right and someone plays you a track from a genre, you may not even know or whatever if it's really really good it's great music it doesn't matter you don't have to sort of you're saying this but you've existed in the scene where it kind of does matter to some people it does matter to some people but not to me okay yeah I don't care do you know what I mean it's just and I like to hear new stuff or try new stuff and like my hero growing up was sort of like, you know, Steve Bicknell and Jeff Mills and stuff like that. And if you, if Jeff Mills had brought out a garage record, I probably would have gone, what the hell is this? Do you know what I mean? So what's he doing? But I was doing that. So it is a bit complicated. I guess what I'm asking is, like, did you ever lose any sleep over these sorts of things? No. Are you thinking like, oh, God, like, am I, you know, am I confusing people? No, I didn't care. Possibly, if you looked at it as a career kind of thing, then I probably was damaging myself. If I'd have stuck to one thing and done it very seriously and blah, blah, blah, but I don't... see music as a career it's not a career it's not like working in a bank it should be doing what you love and having fun do you know what I mean for me I just want to have fun and keep interested and if I want to make one type of music one day and one type of music another day then I'm going to do that you know yeah so presumably no regrets over like you know, certain shifts in what you were doing. No, no, no. I've always had fun. Let's take things back to the beginning. Did you grow up in South London? Yep. Whereabouts? Croydon. Tell us about Croydon. Croydon growing up was a bit grey. It was sort of a concrete shopping centre with houses around it. And I... Grew up there and it was the worst place in the world, really. It was pretty dire. There's not a lot going on there. But would most people say that about their hometown, do you think? Do you think it was particularly dire? It's a shithole. It was an absolute shithole. And then Apple Records started and it was in a fruit market that I used to go to as a kid. I was dragged along the fruit market buying fruit and veg with my mum, and then this record shop opened up. It was opened by John Kennedy and a couple of other people, and they were selling techno and sort of progressive house and stuff like that, which was, you know, but they had a drum and bass floor. And a friend of mine got a job in the drum and bass floor. So he was selling stuff in there and I would be hanging out in there constantly. That's all I did. I was just in there all the time. Ever since I was really young, when I first got my first sampler, because when growing up, I heard house music on a radio in my bedroom. And I heard this, it was Nick Kershaw that had a world radio show and I used to listen to it at night. at two o'clock in the morning, whatever it was. And it was, I used to play African record and then he'd play a record from, from South America. And then he'd play, and then he said, there's this new music from Chicago. They're calling it house music. And I freaked out. Like, what is that? I have to like. what is it? Recorded it, played it back over and over and over and over again and sort of at that sort of time found My Price Records in Croydon run by Jazzy M and I used to go in there and buy these very, very early house records. So we're talking like 87, 88 sort of time at this point. Before we go on any further with this interview, I've got to tell you that I've completely fried my brain over the years and I have no idea of any dates. All my friends tell me as well that I say the other day, this could be seven years ago, right? So unfortunately, chronologically for the listener, you haven't got a chance. I can tell you roughly. I'm going to guess. Yeah. Okay, 87, 88. Yeah, it was like around that time. Okay. So I was in there buying those records and I wanted to, I thought, hang on, that doesn't, and I asked people about it and they said, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's like a drum machine and a sampler. There's not a lot to it. And I was like So I got myself a 707 and that was the drum machine and I was like... well, I'm halfway there. I can make a drum beat, you know. And then I needed to know what a sampler was. I understood the idea. And my dad said, look, I know people that have got studios. You can go in there. Obviously, they've got it. And I remember my dad phoning his friend up who had a studio and he was part of Procol Harum, this guy. And he said, yeah, your son can come into the studio. And I remember going there and saying you take a sound and you can play it again and again and again. And he said, well, we can make a tape loop. We can record a sound and cut the tape and make a loop. And I was like, yeah, a loop, but how does that go in over and over again? And he went, well, you can't. You've got to press the play button. So I was up against that sort of wall and there's no internet. So you have to go and find other people to say, what How do we get this? And eventually bought a Roland W30, which is like a seven-second sampling. Changed my life, and that was it. So that was when John from Big Apple said, do you want the room upstairs? Make a studio. And I had that little keyboard and an Atari at the time. And that was the studio. I had a studio, which is just one keyboard and a desk. Are you still a youngster at this point in the story? I'm still a youngster now, thanks very much. Yeah, I was really young. I don't know how old I was, probably about 19, 20 or something like that. So I had the studio upstairs and I was making drum and bass stuff at the time because of the drum and bass floor. But then I was listening to things from downstairs and listening to the techno records and thinking, whoa, this is like, you know, going back to the original house stuff that I loved, you know, years before. I never sort of lost it, lost listening to that stuff, but I drifted into the drummer bass thing because it sounded exciting, you know, and it was like this new sound. It was great, you know, but then listening to this stuff again, I started to drift off and make that again, make sort of techno stuff. Were you going out listening? listening to both techno and drum and bass around that time? Well, it's weird. I was engineering for people making drum and bass records up in the studio. And John Kennedy's friend was Steve Bicknell, who was running Lost. And John said, listen, can you give Steve a hand? He runs this nightclub. You know, it's in a warehouse, blah, blah, blah. I said, yeah, sounds blinding. Go along. So I went along, met Steve. I had to spend a day putting up camo in a railway arch that stunk. pure dirt, you know, getting grimy. And then at the end, he was like, hang about, you know, come and see what it is. And Jeff Mills turned up, never seen him before, didn't know who the guy was really, only listening to a couple of records and everyone was really super excited. And I remember standing in that room and hearing this. super loud sound bass and everything like that and I remember standing there walking in and standing watching all the people and feeling the excitement and the tension and then some hi-hats came in fucking place went mental and it was like that's it this is it this is what I'm doing now Did it take you long to crack the code, as it were? I never did crack the code. Come on, you had, I mean, the grain records, but, you know, still people are into those. Yeah, it was. I mean, because of that sort of world of the garage music at the time and all stuff like that, I was making techno records, but I was putting vocals in them. I was putting garage vocals into the techno records, which was freaking people out as well. But then... I was making these records and putting them out and they weren't really, you know, didn't have internet. So you don't know what the reaction is. You put the record out and it's six months before you know how many you sold or whatever, you know, so you don't know what's happening to it. I remember turning up and seeing Derek May play and he played one of my records. and you just think, fuck, it's actually working. Do you know what I mean? So you don't have the instant thing that people do now. Yeah, it's not like measurable and trackable instantly. But then when you see Derek May play one of your records, you're suddenly like, oh, shit. So the period of time, I'm not going to press you on dates, but the period of time over which we're talking, because I'd read you started making music like 89 or something like that, for example. And then Graeme was kind of the first successful project you had. Would that be accurate to say? I wouldn't have said successful. I think we only sold like a thousand copies of it or something like that. And that was in a time when people were selling a lot, you know. Sure, sure. A good Detroit techno record would sell 20,000 or something like that. So it wasn't a hit, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see. But I guess it was notable. You had the tracks included on the Richie Horton CD, the Dex FX 909. I mean, were you like getting gigs off the back of the grain music? Yeah, yeah, I was. A lot in Spain. That sort of scene was doing well in Spain at that time. But not really in England. It was kind of strange because I was still really, really young. I always thought it's not good enough. Do you know what I mean? And I always have done. I've always thought. this music isn't good enough. Do you know what I mean? It's a weird thing. It's sort of, I know I made the records and people would push me like Alex Knight from Fat Cat would push me and push me and push me and say, I'm putting this out now. And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. It's not finished. It's not. He's like, forget it. It's done. We're putting it out. And then he put it out and it Sure, sure. I mean, was that a particular anxiety you were feeling working in techno or does that just go across the board? No, no, no, totally. Even to this day, I mean, I'll sit down, try and make a record today and I'll go in the studio, start something, go around for sort of six hours and then I'll suddenly find this thing and it will go click and you go, that's it, smashed it. And you're jumping around the studio, same as you were when you And it's amazing. It's the best thing ever. Work on it for two hours and you go round and round and round and then you think, this is shit. So you turn it off, right? Put it in a folder, leave it, and you carry on, make something else. You do that four or five times. Maybe a month later you go back and think, what is this folder? Go in there, click on it, open it up and you go, fucking hell, this is really good. Two hours later, this is shit. So it's very rare for me to actually finish anything. And it takes people like Jack Master to say, no, that's done. I'm having that. I'm already playing it. And then he will give it to someone else. And there's like three people playing it. And then you think, oh, fuck, it's gone now, you know. I mean, is it usually another person who snaps you out of that loop that you're creating in your mind? If I was left on my own, I would never, ever, ever finish a record or put it out. But people take things off me and I'll say, I've got a demo. I'll play it to Jack and say, what do you think about this? Next thing, he's playing it and he's giving it to two other people, you know, to play. And people are saying, when's this And they're like, well, it's too late now. It's out, you know. Thinking about the techno records you did release, was there a particular... style that you found yourself kind of gravitating towards like i mean if i'm listening back to those records now and maybe hearing an influence of you know the mills and the hoods of this world like with those people who were kind of uh key for you would you say yeah they really were and it's and more actually steve bicknell i think he's probably like for me the most underrated artist in the UK if you go back and look at his catalogue and listen to those tracks they were works of art they are so out there and so like brave and they weren't there to fit in or be like the other people's records where mine possibly were a bit because I was quite young I wanted to be to fit in and you know blah blah blah but listen to his stuff. How were his records received at the time? By us, amazing. I think whenever people talk about techno and sometimes you say, yeah, but what about Steve Bicknell? And people are like, sorry? And you're like, not everyone. I mean, everyone that we know knows him, but some of the younger generations. like don't know who he is and how important it was he was the guy that bought Jeff Mills Richie Horton and like all the DJ Funk and all right through Derek May everyone he bought them to London put on a huge warehouse party for 2000 people with a massive sound system and two lights that was it That was it. And it's just like him and Cherie did the parties together. But as an artist, because he was pushing those people forward, he would do the warm-up set. And then it would be all about Jeff Mills or all about, you know, Ritchie Horton. Sure, sure, sure. So maybe if he was an outside artist kind of like gunning to play in the lost fold, he might have got more recognition. Yeah, because he was doing it. Rather than being a selfless person putting it on. And he would, I mean, we're not talking about a promoter that sits in an office and turns up 10 minutes before and the decks are in the wrong place. He was there with me from 8 o'clock in the morning, climbing up ladders, putting up drapes, building and checking everything. decks going up underneath the stage with lumps of two before to straighten it up because you knew that Derek May would jump about a bit testing everything so that it was absolutely perfect it was a work of art and it was underrated so you said before you were making Techno and Garage simultaneously would that be accurate? I don't know yeah the record shop at one point was selling Techno and I was making it and buying it. But then there was Garage in there as well. And I was interested in it. I really, really liked it. So I started to make those records. and I was making them with Danny Harrison, who was, he was Narshan, he was 187. So we were doing those together, and we were making so many of them that we had to make up, like, different names every week for the next release because we had sometimes almost a whole wall of the record shop was stuffed by us. So we had to keep inventing these pseudonyms for, and some of them would only last for two or three releases, and they would just keep... bored of it and make another one but I mean do you think there's anyone out there who like is fully aware of the full scope of the work you were doing at the time probably just the people around us in the shop yeah sure sure a couple of people come up to me I mean the weirdest thing is everyone completely forgotten about grain because it was pre-internet I think it was sort of like And it's just one of those things that very, very few people know even about Grain or what it is, let alone know it was me. And I got a phone call a year ago. Hey, do you want to play at Berghain? And I'm like, oh, yes. Yeah, great. Where abouts? I was thinking it'd be Panorama as artwork or something like that. I said, no, no, no, I want you to play downstairs as Grain. So it was like, it's Ben Clock and you for the night. And I was like, oh shit, you know what I mean? So I went and did it. And the guy from the club comes up to you in the end. And I was like, he said, oh, great set, really good. He said, I loved your old records. And I'm like, oh, you know, the grain stuff. And he went, no, no, no, I love the D&D stuff. I love the What was going on in that period of time? I mean, you were talking about covering an entire wall with the records that you guys had produced. Were you just feeling impossibly inspired at that time? What was going on in the studio? It was just fun. It was real, real fun. We had... friends of ours who ran a printing distribution company that were just desperate for, you know, record shops were kicking. You know what I mean? You could put a record out and he'd say two weeks later, we've sold 5,000. You know what I mean? here's your money you know and and great fun making this a lot of the time we were nicking vocals of of r&b stuff doing a garage track underneath it and then just pressing them up and okay yeah around the wall and it was just so fun and danny's got a huge like collection of r&b stuff his is he knew all about the um he could tell you what vocals from where blah blah blah and he had been collecting that sort of stuff and R&B for years so he's got all the 12s that have got the acapella on the third track on the other side so he'd be like he'd come in on Monday and go I've got another one and we'd just sit down and like make the beat underneath it and Julian Jonah was with us as well obviously and so the three of us would make these records and then you know I don't know just put them out as quick as we could. You know, people look back very fondly on the, you know, these halcyon kind of garage days, like late 90s, early 2000s. I'm just wondering, like, you know, as a young person around that time putting out all these records. What was that like for you? I mean, it sounds like it would have been insanely exciting kind of on a day-to-day basis. Yeah, it was. Every day you've got a new sort of like thing. We wouldn't spend more than a week on a record. You know, you get into sort of like a thing where you get the vocal. you know, the drums and everything together to fit together. Then you start to, you know, make the bass lines and stuff like blah, blah, blah. Sometimes they'd happen in two days, you know, you're done. So then you do a double. and knock it out. Obviously, it'd be a week. But it was good fun. But I mean, for us, the big distraction was the market outside because I had a window that overlooked the market. And you've got a constant stream of people walking up and down this market and all the traders as well who were also, like these guys in the market, they've got to stand there all day selling a hand of bananas for a quid. And they are bored out their minds, you know. So they want fun. They want fun. They want something. They want the slightest distraction for them is brilliant. So we were like, we got our record shop there and we're up for taking the piss. So we would have like catapults. We'd buy a box of grapes in the morning, go upstairs with a catapult. And I was fucking lethal. I could take... a bag of crisps out of someone's hand with a grape from a third floor window on the other side of the street so you get it without moving as well if they were walking I could take it out of their hand And then so like Christmas would come and the guy across the way would set up his stall and he'd have plastic little waving Santa men that would wiggle and make a little song, 50 of them along this stall, right? So then you'd move up ammo, you'd get a lychee, right? It was a little bit more weighty with a... Oh yeah, yeah, that's going to pack a punch here. So you take the first one out. bang off the side and he's like oh through that like not knowing where you are because he's a new guy the christmas guys were always the best because they came on the market They didn't have a clue what was going on. So you take one by one, you take every single one of his Santas out with a light tea. It's fun. It's like, but you waste a day. So there was a downside. Maybe one of the slightly lesser known facts about this area is you guys were the producers behind Daniel Bedingfield's Gotta Get Through This. Yep. Which obviously went number one in UK. It was nominated for a Grammy as well. Is that right? Yeah. Tell us the story about that record. How did that whole thing come about? Daniel came into the shop. He used to come into the shop. He was from Streatham, I think. So he came to the shop. I mean, he was a ridiculous talent. Do you know what I mean? And he came in with some ideas. And then Dean and Andy, the other guys from D&D, said, look, he's got this record. We've got to take him seriously because this is... Amazing. Signed the record to our record label and basically came in and said, you know, let's make the record. And we made the record and it went out and started to get played. And it was just ridiculous. I mean, back in the day, those things were, it was mad, the money that people would spend on records because you could sell units. You know, this was just before everything went. before mp3s and stuff like that you know so you'd have to go and buy a single yeah sort of in the last wave of that was it physical yeah yeah that was it you know and it went to number one and you're just like what the hell you know how how's that happen i mean what was your response to that like you know again you're in sort of like a youthful period and you've got this like hit record on on your hands like yeah yeah but what was that like for you oh it's mad because you know suddenly you have to get yourself a lawyer and you have to start talking to people who know what they're doing you know and stuff like this and then you go and shop it for a record deal and I think it went for like half a million quid in the end for the single You're 21 years old and you're thinking, hang on a minute, this has gone for, number one, I think it was 11 countries. You might be wrong there. I might have made that more exaggerated as the years went on. It was huge. So you're thinking, 21 years old, right, which Porsche am I going to get? Do you know what I mean? And at the time, it was like I was spending money like fucking nuts. Every time we go out anywhere to anything, I would buy everyone all their drinks. I would buy all the drugs because I thought... I had this huge amount of money coming, you know, so you just didn't care. You just go fucking crazy. And then you get the phone call. That's not going to happen anymore because the record company has gone bankrupt. Wait, so you were spending the money you didn't already have in advance of this fat check that was going to come through and then... Yeah, and then you're going to get one penny in the pound, yeah. And how did you dig yourself out of that one? Oh, whatever, you know. I've done it a few times in my life. Yeah. Any others you care to mention? Oh, no, it's happened loads of times. You know, every time you think you're up, there's always something that, you know, you go, oh, shit. But you just keep, you know, as long as you can just keep doing what you do. And if you're having fun and you're getting away with it and you've got a roof over your head, you know, and still no one's gone, hang on a minute, you can't be doing this. You're laughing. I mean, was it the case that that particular deal collapsed? and then it just happened elsewhere? Was it that kind of situation? Yeah, I mean, that particular deal collapsed and then just something else happens. That one, we were, I was in, you know, a little bit of a pickle. And then a friend of ours, Ross Allen, who worked for Domino, said, yeah, I've got a, do you know, you don't want to do a Mary J. Blige remix, do you? And we were like, yeah. Yeah, all right. Yeah, go on. What sort of music do you want? Garage? No, no, no, no, no. Do it like, I don't know, like something like Daft Punk meets Garage meets something. Didn't understand at all what he was going on about. we did this Mary J. Blige remix and it was another one that just went bang. It just sort of like suddenly, this record that we were just sort of like, oh, go on, do it because it was like, give it a go. It wasn't a lot of money and we were like, you know, we'll just do it. And it suddenly, that was a hit and then got nominated. for a Grammy again and as soon as that happens it went mental so you had every record company in the world just see oh what remixes have gone on this year okay Moto Blanco never heard them before but they've been nominated for a Grammy get them to do one for us and we had a line of people queuing up to do remixes it was like ridiculous so we had to do one a week it was regimented okay so you'd already been like making a bit of house at that point yeah in that sort of particular style so it wasn't like a you know no no no yeah we'd done Danny and I did Mickey Moto and Bobby Blanco which is 3am 3am yeah I bought that yeah which is on Defected But we've done some other 12s as well. I did a Mickey Moto 12. Danny had done Bobby Blanco 12s, which were phenomenal. He's got an ear for a disco sample that is just... Sure. You know what I mean? So we've done that, and then that's why he got us to do the remix, the Mary Jo Blige one. But then suddenly you've got... Every record company in the world want their record, but with that record, you know. So we had to do these mixes, and they were great fun, you know what I mean? We were working with pop vocals and pop singers, you know, and it was hilarious because you'd get all the raw files. They'd send you all the files, every single one, so you could hear. They'd just go, oh, can't be bothered, just send them the whole thing. So you get this break. down of 140 takes of let's just a pop star right so you can hear all the takes and it was blinding so yeah i mean just for for the listeners it's probably worth taking a step back here and actually you know listing or talking about some of the the artists in question here yeah i mean you've got that wikipedia entry with all of the all the remixes you pulled off Adele, Brandy, Janet Jackson, Jennifer Lopez, Lady Gaga, Lionel Richie, Mariah Carey, Rihanna. Yeah. That's insane. Yeah. I mean, Danny's done some of those. Okay. So since, but yeah. Danny's done the good ones. Do you know what I mean? But no, I mean, it's kind of like I wanted to keep moving, you know? Yeah, sure. Danny was doing it so well and so good, you know, that it was just I said, we wanted to start that Magnetic Man thing. And he was like, it's cool. Yeah, no, no, I see. I don't actually need you anymore. Okay, okay, okay. So there was a period of time where you were both kind of working on these. You're certainly dealing with some of the names I mentioned, but then he took the project on. Well, no, it was just, again, I was doing two things at the same time. We were doing that together and I was It became more and more that I needed more and more time as that Magnetic Man thing needed. It's like a monster. It starts to take up so much time as it got, you know, bigger and bigger. Yeah, sure. And Danny was just like, you know, he was doing great. You know what I mean? It was really firing. So he was like, you know, he just carried on doing them because he was brilliant at it, you know. I just wanted to ask, like, you know, artistically, did you feel like you were just kind of in a different headspace when you're working on a project like that? Does it feel more like commercial? No, it's all the same. It feels all the same, really? It doesn't matter what you're doing. It doesn't matter if you're making any type of music. If your head's nodding and you're jumping around, it doesn't matter what you're making. If you're doing it and it's solid, whether it's making a pop remix or whether it's doing the Magnetic Man stuff or techno or house or anything. If you're in it and it's great fun, then it's no sweat to do. Do you know what I mean? If you're sitting down and trying to make music and you're not enjoying it, there is not a lot of point in sitting there. So in order to discuss some of the Magnetic Man stuff, we should probably go back and talk about Big Apple just a little bit more. The store and Croydon and the early 2000s is obviously mentions like frequently as being, you know, the pivotal environment or, you know, this like fertile ground for what later became dubstep. And, you know, like. elements of grime and you know people talk about this dark garage sound that came through so you made the track it's the sounds of the future right mentor that was with danny as well that's with danny as well right and at the time you had like it was a core producers around london who were producing in this kind of style yeah so lb or j like said by a zinc people people along these lines So what I'm interested in is when you guys, you know, around the shop or, you know, as a sort of group of producers, started noticing that this thing had kind of shifted enough where you started to consider it as a new sound, you know, even if you hadn't given it a name. you know, it's moving in a direction where it's like, fuck, this is just like something new now. You know, this isn't garage. Do you know what? It was weird, right? Danny and I were making garage upstairs in the studio. We're making it all day long. Yeah. Benny Ewell, who was part of Bill and Ben on Hard House, he was making that sort of Bill and Ben stuff. And he was into techno. He taught me a lot, actually, because when I used to go into another studio, when I made records with John Kennedy, which was the Block EP, which is really weird because it's worth so much money on discogs now. How much are we talking? Ridiculous. Really? It's mental. Because it was sort of like a big sort of tech house sort of record. It used to be played at Wiggle, that sort of scene. Okay. we went in to do this tracks and Benny Hill was in the studio and he would sort of like look at the desk when I was working and he'd go, why are you boosting that frequency? You know, you should be, there's nothing there. And he taught me a lot of, and I'd be like, yeah, why am I doing that? I was just doing things just because no one's ever taught me and I just do stuff. So I learned quite a lot off of him. And then he came up to the and he'd go away, and Garage was sort of like two-step. Yeah. But then he had reggae samples, and he was right into sort of like all his kung fu films and stuff like that, and he'd come back to us with a track that had kung fu sort of like samples. and because it was he was going to his reggae the snare was on the wrong one the snare was on the wrong beat and he said what do you think of this I was like yeah so what like no one's going to play it the snare's on the wrong beat it's like it's not you've got it wrong that's not garage and he was like oh okay Hatcher was like that's fucking brilliant I love it can you make me some more Hatcher was saying, "Look, I want that, but make the bass more like this and blah blah." So Benny will come back in and start to make these tracks that were like nothing else. You know what I mean? Banger and Scream were making beats on their PlayStations and coming in every day with a mini disc with five new tracks that they'd made the night before to test them out on the system. And I think they were picking up a bit of Benny Hill stuff and they were still, I mean, Screenworks in the shop. So he was listening to the techno stuff and the house stuff as well. And there was this weird sort of mix, but definitely the dub sort of that sound, the very, very early dubby sort of sound, that dark stuff was, was Benny Hill making Garage wrong. I mean, that's just so often the case, right? Yeah. Someone goes for something and gets it wrong and it creates something new. So your Red EP, for example, was that kind of along those lines? I mean, was that a response to the time and what was going on around you? No, I was making the Gary stuff, but I thought... wouldn't it be good to do this garage stuff but like incorporate some of the techno sounds as well right okay to make it more a little bit more sort of like there was that sound going on it wasn't i mean i didn't invent it do you know i mean it was like there lb was doing stuff and blah and i thought yeah it would be good if it was a little bit more techno you know so i made that one with very very techno sounds and and uh But I think that whole sort of thing with the early Benger and Scream stuff was just another planet. Do you know what I mean? They were coming in and we were laughing at them at first. because these things were crap. They were these mini discs with these really bad records and we were like, all right, you can play it for 30 seconds, right? But then, because they were on the phone to each other every single night and bouncing stuff backwards and forwards to each other, they were learning so fast and the curve just went crazy. And then at one point, they were 15 years old and John was like, we've got to sign this stuff. We have to put it out. Hatcher was playing it all the time on his pirate radio station. And he said, this is something, you know. And we didn't sell a lot. Again, it was like 1,000, you know. I think there was only 1,000 of red ever made. And then the other Ben Green screen ones, maybe it was like 1,500, 2,000, something like that. But it was something that we were doing because we only wanted them to be sold in the shop. only just our shop oh really yeah we were like right make a record that people have to come here to buy yeah okay because like it was like pre-internet well the internet was just coming in then so he was starting to sell things online but people would buy records online So you'd post them out physically. But make a record that people have to come here to buy and then they might buy some other stuff. So let's make it our thing. So you've got to make the pilgrimage to Croydon to come and get these tunes, which was great. And we had record shops going mental saying, we need some of these records. And for a while we were sort of, nope, very like, nope, you've got to come. And it was... How long were you able to keep that up for? I don't know. It wasn't long until everyone was going bananas. So then we did sell some boxes to other people. Was there a particular place or incident or story that you can recall where you did think to yourselves collectively, oh shit, this is like really becoming a thing now? No, it goes really, it's just a little step every time. Really, really? Until you sort of like... It was later on when we were doing the Magnetic Man stuff and suddenly it's like you're used to walking out onto the stage to bigger and bigger crowds and then it's 70,000 people and you're like, oh, shit. So in sort of conceiving of the Magnetic Man project... Did you guys feel like that was kind of a next logical step for the sound in a way? It was just the fact that all gigs to do with that sound were just dub plates. It was go and get a dub plate cut and play it. And we were sort of talking about it and it was kind of like I thought... there's very few elements to this music. So there was, you've got the drums, you've got the bass and you've got a top line. So if each person could fuck around with each one and make it different every time and move stuff around and then blend each one into each other, you could have something that was like a next level. Do you know what I mean? So that, that lead line that you hear coming in on that record that you know is coming in. isn't there and it's something else or it's turned upside down you know what I mean it keeps it a bit more interesting so it was we only meant to do it forward once that was it we put the whole thing with the sheet right and you were kind of keeping your identity because we just wanted To see whether it would work. And we thought, right, put a screen up. Call it Magnetic Man. We weren't thinking, we're going to do this. It was just an experiment to see if this thing would work. And we got three computers. So when you say this thing, you just mean from a technical standpoint? Yeah. Like, get three computers, link them together. Will it work? And we did it once at there and it did work, but it didn't work for long because if this is a bit technical for, you know, and somebody who doesn't mess around with electronic stuff written into the code of Ableton, it only goes up to like 22 minutes or something like that. And then the link between the three computers drops. So we had to have three sets. And so you play 22 minutes, stop, then pokes would say something on the microphone and then you load it up quickly. We had one, though. It stopped in Newcastle. There's us, standing, three of us, with three laptops on the stage like that, and they've all got the Apple sign glowing, you know, and it broke down. It was a wire that fell out. We didn't know it. It vibrated out. A wire gone out, and it took me, like, I'm standing there, like, going through everything, reboot, reboot, reboot, do this, do that, but nothing. dead silence from the crowd for 25 minutes and they're all just looking at us a few people started to leave and stuff like that and one one Geordie from the back went we should have got fucking PCs and everyone pissed themselves laughing so at that point you're like okay cool we can figure it out so how did I mean you were talking about it from a technical standpoint But when did it start or how did it start to enter into your thinking that this could be something that like kind of incorporates you guys' love of pop? And, you know, this might be something that like, you know, tickles the mainstream or this is going to go out on like a big record label or something. Well, it was odd because it went the wrong way round as a band does because... We started doing that just for an experiment to see if it would work as a bit of a laugh, really. And then Sarah from Ammunition said, listen, I'm in contact with the Arts Council. could go on tour you could you could tour this we could go and do like 10 clubs and that's that was the next time let's do 10 clubs that was our biggest that was all we thought yeah we're gonna do 10 clubs in a row doing this and so she got us 10 grand so we could hire the bus the driver and a projector and some black cloth which we actually looked like a fucking punch and judy show to start off with it was a black box with a slot in it And it was a punch and Judy box. But she said, we can do this thing. You could play 10 clubs. And that was all we thought. So we were like, and when we played the 10 clubs, we were like, shit, that was actually all right. Do you know what I mean? Because people were going mad for it. You turn up somewhere and it was sold out. you know, it was this thing. Were you still hiding your identities at this point? No, no, no. This is out. This is out. That was an N-type that went on the radio. We gave him one of the records and he went, yeah, this is Ben Gurr artwork and scream. So ruined the fucking, ruined it. That's out. Yeah. We only wanted to do 10 shows. And then when you finish, to ten we were like fucking hell we could do some more of these so we haven't got an album or anything like that next thing we're doing festivals and we did Ross Gilda Festival and it was like 15,000 people now and with all the production and stuff like that and so the video went up online of us playing to 15,000 people this music that people are like what the fuck's this and that's when the record companies came in and said we want this fucking thing. Let's do a deal. And we're like, well, we haven't made the album yet. And it was old school. Like, okay, we'll give you the money to go and make an album. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah. When I was reading that, like when you were touring the album, you had something like a 750 K. thousand pounds like in rig yeah that would have been connected to the record no no no we didn't buy it it cost 750 it's a worth it's worth worth i think it's still very impressive it was yeah it was quite impressive it blinded a lot of people and it was a fucking stupid because i'll tell you what we could have actually done that show with the strobe light on stage and I could have a nice car at the moment do you know what I mean but we spent every single penny again you're thinking there's going to be loads more of this coming do you know what I mean We spent every fucking penny on the show. And we had at one point, it was pretty, it got like, you know, spinal tap. It was, we are going to have the biggest, most mental light show in the world. We had Italian designers like make this rig that went off of every sound that was being triggered from the computers. Super complicated. to each light. I mean, ridiculous. No, it looked great. Yeah, it looked great. But it was like, that cost fucking... Because you've got like two or three lorries and you've got 15 people. They all need a bed. They all need breakfast, dinner and lunch. And the tour buses and all the managers and then all the riggers. And I was like... Every gig, you're like, you know, you see it and you go, we're getting 50 grand for this gig. Are we? Yeah, 50 grand. Fucking hell. How much we got left at the end? Well, you got like 500. Dumb 45 grand of light. Yeah. How did you guys tackle it when you did sign that deal and you've got this, you know, record promised and coming through the pipe and you've got all this interest in it? Like, were you able to sort of seize the momentum and like write quickly? You know, was it like a stress-free process or were you kind of like tearing your hair out? actually getting the deal was a bit mental. Okay. The deal was sort of like all of a sudden you had a bidding war, which, you know, is a crazy thing in itself because you're suddenly, you're offered like 50 grand, then 100, then 200, then 300 grand. You're like, what is going on here? You know, we haven't even got a record. We haven't got an album and people are offering us 300 grand, you know. And it went up and up and up. And then eventually I did get an offering from one of the people that was working for the company that went bankrupt. And so he put in an offer and I was like, I'll tell you what, we should really fly to Los Angeles to see dubstep, you know, because you need to know about it. So we did. And I said, we need to sleep. You know what I mean? I need to sleep. So we got three first class, upper class, like super first class a day before, which cost £12,500 each seat. And we went out there, hired the biggest... cars, went to the best fucking restaurants and hotels, went to this gig. I just fucked straight off, right? Slept all the way there, all the way back. And on the plane, you know, this guy was like, look, we want to talk about the deal. And I said, you know, you don't remember me, do you? And, yeah, so we didn't sign with them. But we did sign with Columbia. They said, what do you want to do? And we're like, okay, we want to, you know, we want to go into a mansion somewhere. Again, it's fucking stupid. Like, wasted all this money. So we... hired this mansion in winter with a heated outdoor pool hired a huge Range Rover all the stupid shit you know went down there and we got down to this place and I went with Ben and Ollie both lived with their parents at the time got down to this place I said like let's go shopping so we found this remote place out in rock opposite Padstow And we went to the supermarket and I said, we'll split up. You go and get what you want. I'll get what I want. Meet back at the Tills in like 15 minutes. It's the first shop. So I went and got mints, like herbs, you know, potatoes, vegetables, stuff like that, milk, eggs, all bread, things like that, all stuff like this. I swear I've got a picture somewhere of the trolley. They turned up with their trolley. They had four bottles of Coke and the rest of the trolley up to the top with Kit Kats, funny hippo fucking sweets, like bags of Haribo, nothing else. I was like, what are you going to eat? And they went there. Fucking serious. That was fueling the album. Yeah. And then we sort of tried to start do this album and we were going nowhere because they were going fucking stir crazy because they're used to, you know, going out every fucking night. You know, this whole thing. We're stuck in Cornwall with the three of us in a mansion. We went bananas. Well, they went bananas. You know what I mean? And so the record company came down about. Oh, man, it must have been like after a month and a half, six weeks, they were like, right, we need to come down and listen to what you've done on the album. See where this is going. Yeah, so you've got all the execs, probably 10 of them, and the publisher, everyone, because you've got publishing advance as well. All of them, big wigs, come down to see their big investment. We'd made a song that went, and it went, ketamine, check. Cocaine, check. Ecstasy, check. Let's party. Seriously, their faces was like, okay, cool. What else have we got? Well, that's about it for the minute. And then we went home to Corden and finished it. Bang, yeah. So looking back on the project now, artistically, do you chalk it up as a success? Were the label happy with the results? It was great. The guy that signed it, Mike Smith at Columbia, was just like... this is great. And he was old school. He was the last of, you know, the sort of like the old school. And he was brilliant. He was just like, yeah, make us this record. Do you know what I mean? Go and do what you do. We really, all three of us, me, Ben, Grant, and Scream, love songs. You know, we love, like, most of the garage records we listen to were all songs and stuff like that. And we thought, having someone say to you, for the first time, you can say, can we have John Legend? And they're like, yep, here you go, give us a backing track, we'll give it to John Legend, and we'll give you a song back. Fucking hell. So it's a new thing, again, it's just like a new thing. Let's do it. Let's make pop songs. Not pop songs, but let's make songs that are... actual songs that you can sing along with. You know what I mean? It's like a new thing. I think it was great. You know, all three of us love it. We still stand by it, you know, because it's, it was something that was, it had been done. We'd been making all the dark stuff. We'd done all that. We'd done that. This was the next step. This was something. you know mad it's another weird thing you've never done you know did you feel like your peers had kind of given you like not not like a pass but like obviously were you guys being so connected to like the very earliest days. Was there a sense of like, well, if anybody's going to take this to the charts, like these guys just go for it. We didn't actually think it was, we didn't think it was chart stuff. We didn't really. No, like we were just making these songs. Yeah. And we thought it was quite, you know, but with that machine behind you, they're going to be hits. Because they're going to put it in people's faces. They're going to get it playlisted. They're going to get it everywhere. So I Need Air, which when we first played it out at DMZ... Tore the roof off the place. Do you know what I mean? And like you'd play it in the middle of a set of that stuff and it would fuck up a club. Yeah, sure. A space, a night of darkness. Yeah, but then you listen to it out of context on Radio 1 30 times a day. Of course, it's going to sound like, you know, like another one of those pop songs. At the time, it really was like, fuck, that's a tune. You know what I Yeah, I mean, I'd argue now if you heard it on the radio, it would still sound like quite a bit different to, you know, everything around it. It does, but it wasn't meant to be that. Yeah. It's weird. Your perspective changes of a record when you hear it. Yeah. A hundred times. It's like, I don't know, it's a weird kind of thing. Just sort of creatively speaking, is that like a niche that you still want to scratch some more? Like, would you want to write more songs in the future? Like, will you do more Magnetic Man stuff, do you think? I don't know. It's just like, I've never had a plan. Yeah, sure. None of us sort of group have really. There's never been like a thing. I couldn't tell you. Something might happen tomorrow. Someone might say, hey, do you want to do this? Or whatever. And I'll be going in a different direction. I don't know. Let's change gears. Let's talk about Ibiza a little bit. You're doing a regular residency, right? You're at Pikes. Yeah. I'd seen you described it in glowing terms. You said it was like the best club in the world, the one of the best clubs in the world. What is it about necessarily on the radar of everyone who goes to Ibiza? You know, everybody's like space, amnesia, blah, blah, blah. Should we keep it that way? You want to just end it there? Should we keep it? Do you see what I'm saying? All right. How many people are we getting through the door usually for one of these things? Maybe over the night, 600 or something. Okay. So yeah, still. On the dance floor, 150 people. Okay. Yeah. So what is it about Tony Pike was a model. He was a sailor, first of all, actually. He was a sailor on shore leave walking through Manhattan and someone said, hey, are you a model? And he was like, no, mate. a sailor and he said well you're a model now come with me signed him up became the Chesterfield man which is like the Marlborough man but for Chesterfield cigarettes and he was suddenly hanging out with all famous because he was on every billboard in America he's hanging out all the big parties and all these you know amazing people at all these amazing parties he thought I need a place for these people to go so he went to Ibiza when it was a fishing town and bought an old farmhouse and built it with his hands and within a you know over the took him years and years to build but as he was building it it was sort of like one point you'd have Grace Jones you'd have Wham you'd have Freddie Mercury you'd have Genesis you'd have it like they're all there And Freddie Mercury sort of checked in there and said, I want this room forever. And they were like, well, how long? No, I'll just keep taking the money out of my bank. Moved his record player and his clothes over there. So every time he finished, he'd just go straight there. And then he'd have parties that was in that room, in his bedroom, that would start on. Monday and they'd end on a Thursday or Friday. And that was just like the, and it's never lost it. So when he died, they were like, well, we can't turn it back into a hotel room. It has to stay as Freddie's place, you know? So it is Freddie's. So you're in there, you're in Freddie Mercury's bedroom. And it's absolutely the best place. How would you describe the feeling of the place? It's an age group from, there could be people in there that are 20. There could be people on the dance floor that are 60. There is something that's just run through. You can be put on the guest list. You can do them an email. They'll put you on the guest list. But if you don't look like you're going to fit in with the rest of the people there, you're not getting in. So there Everyone there is cool. Everyone is on a certain, you know, wavelength. Everyone will talk to everyone else. There's not one person you could say, hi, how are you? Do you know what I mean? It's like, and it's not like a nightclub. To be able to play there, I mean, I went there years ago and just fell in love with it. And to be able to do sort of like six weeks there is, I say amazing, but it's like, I do the Saturday nights, and I finished playing there, and I walk around like, oh, I did really well there. I smashed that. Do you know what I mean? I really did well. I'm really happy with that. And then Harvey does the Monday. So you go in, and you're like, why the fuck am I doing this? I'm going to throw all my records away. What's the point? But then it takes me a few days in the sun and thinking about it and then I can go back. It wasn't so bad. It wasn't so bad. I might as well go back Saturday, you know. What do you think about Bifa in general? I love the place. It's great. Have you been going a long time? Must be 20, 22 years ago I went there first time. and I used to, you know, bombing around on mopeds, you know, dropping bottles of vodka over the club wall so that we could go in there and pick them up in the bushes at night. It's a good one, that, yeah, yeah. Just being a scallywag. So, you know, you drive through San Anne and you see all those people, you know, and a lot of people are a bit kind of can be snooty about that sort of thing. crowd and I'm like that was me exactly yeah you can't you know but a lot of the big big clubs I don't know they've got a bit mental now do you know I mean it's a bit for me sort of to go and have a good dance somewhere space was great you know DC 10 but no one's making any taking any risks for me it's like but then again I can go and watch Villa Lobos do his thing at Cocoon and you're just like open mouthed that how good this is and how many people are into it do you know what I mean yeah yeah yeah that's one of the weird things this is some really weird shit this is a lot of this is art right And you've got a crowd who are going along with it where it can't imagine sort of like that happening anywhere else. Do you know what I mean? It's weird. You should probably tell us about the party concept, how it came about. So it's Arts House. Yeah. We were sort of, I like Twitter. So we were all, I'm constantly messing around there. And it was sort of. started to become a bit like this is like a few years ago every tweet suddenly became come to my party come to this party I'm playing here I'm playing here I'm playing here I'm playing here and it was like my feed because I follow a lot of DJs and stuff like that was a lot of that so I thought fuck this like turn it around and say, look, we'll have a party at your house. We'll come to you. So tweet me if you want a party at your house. And we did. And someone, we picked someone, went round their terraced house, round the back of the East End, on a Wednesday, and we took Scream, Teed, Route 94, took a load of speakers, lasers, smoke machines, a bar, the whole fucking thing. Put a gazebo up in the back garden. It was like they invited all their friends. It was a proper party until about two o'clock in the morning when the neighbor knocked on the door and said, what the fuck are you doing? It's Tuesday. So we shut it down. And then Andy Payton said, look, you should do this. You should do. an arts house like same sort of thing you can have the nest do you know what i mean do it the nest so we did and we made the club into a front room by putting up wallpaper and light bulbs and lampshades and all that sort of stuff and it just sort of went on from there and it got bigger and bigger and bigger and now we're doing one at uh electric in brixton for like 1700 people at christmas Did you manage to flog any of those 800 quid tickets in the final release? Not yet, but it's not the final release. Oh, it hasn't reached the final release yet. You should probably mention what we're referring to. I looked at ticket prices and stuff like that. And if you want to go out on a night out, all my parties will be like a fiver. If you get in there quick, you can get a ticket for a fiver. So I think that's reasonable. Five quid, you're going out, and you're still going to spend money on drink and stuff like that. But £28 tickets and things like that to go out to a club, that's a kick before you even go out the door. Sure. We do a load at a fiver, then we do a smaller amount at a tenner, then some at 15, and then the last one's a £785 20p plus booking fee. Wasn't the booking fee like £40, £10? No, £76. £76, okay. So you sort of mentioned you love Twitter there and this, you know, kind of how the Arts House thing came about. Is it something that you've always been a bit of a natural at, would you say? You know, were there any like teething problems? Did you just like take to it or do you take to it when these platforms come through? I think I do it wrong. When I first started doing it, people were telling me and saying, oh no, you can't do that. And I started on Facebook recently. Someone said, you should do Facebook. And I was like, oh God, that means seeing all your friends and that, doesn't it? That you don't want to see from in the past. And they were like, no, no, no. Set up a page, do this thing. And I was like, so I started to do this past I'll just put a video about that. Yeah. So if I see something funny, I'll put it on there. Or if I've got a gig coming up, I will do a come to my party, but I will steer clear of totally ecstatic to announce. That is funny because it seems to me like there are a certain number of artists out there for whom social media is like the most stressful thing ever. They don't feel natural doing it. They're under a lot of pressure from agents and promoters to be this person. Is this conversations that you're having among your peers? Do DJs talk about this a lot? Has it become a big thing in the community? No. You wouldn't say so? No. For me, if I see something funny, I'll put it up there. Do you know what I mean? It's more like put it up there because it's easier to do that than to text five of my mates with a video. Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what it's about. So I'm just like, I'll put it on there because it's easier for them to see and then everyone else can see it as well. So it's, you know. Two birds with one stone sort of thing. There you go, yeah. So in reading like interviews to prepare for this, it seemed to be like. like a recurring theme where you're kind of saying a lot of things along the lines of, I just have to mix it up, you know? I have to do something different. And we've been talking a lot about these different, like, musical left turns you've been taking, talking about wacky party concepts, talking about getting social media wrong. But at its core, what you do is fairly simple, I'd say. You make music, lots of it for the club, and you play that music in the club or on the radio. So I guess what I'm wondering at this point, as someone who's been doing this for a long time, do you feel as though there are enough... different permutations of this very simple format to kind of keep you interested for the next, I don't know, 10 years or something. I mean, for me, it's only just taking off, just getting going. Kind of as artwork. Yeah, it was sort of after the Magnetic Man thing, it was sort of very, very difficult for me to sort of say, people didn't know what I did before. It was pre-internet. It was a lot of it. It was like, no one knew who I was. And then I did that and it was like, oh, artwork's the other bloke who was with Benga and Scream. Do you know what I mean? So they didn't know that I did this stuff before. Did that bother you at all though? No, no. But what was difficult was sort of saying to people, listen, I actually, I used to make techno stuff and I really like disco as well and I can play it. Didn't have a fucking, Real bad times, you know what I mean? Saying to people, yeah, but I can do it. And they're like, well, what am I going to book you as? Like artwork playing disco. The bloke from Magnetic Man who, the bloke in the middle from Magnetic Man playing a disco set. Yeah, that's really going to draw people in, isn't it? So I couldn't get a gig. I was, fuck. And then Andy Payton, he sort of said, why don't you to say, go on then, show people what you can do. And I did that four or five times and that was like the big break, the big sort of like, the bit that got me going again. Do you know what I mean? I mean, it's interesting because you're going to, you know, in doing this, you have this like very ass backwards arc in a way. Yeah. Because people could just discover you and take you on exactly the terms they find you now. Yeah. And then in getting into you as an artist, like, oh shit. Yeah. Magnetic man and then garage and then techno. Yeah. I get that all the time though. Really? Yeah. People that I've known for quite a while. come up to me and go I didn't know you were involved in that you know it's really really strange you know weird things like Mr G at the weekend we were in Scotland and known him for ages and we talked to each other and know each other quite well and then somebody else told him that I'd done the Magnetic Man thing and he was like fuck off so the connections just aren't made yeah But I think that's all right. I mean, at the moment, I'm really happy that it's just, I can do these parties that I can play what I want. It doesn't matter. People will come along and they know it's going to be a good fun. Do you know what I mean? So I can, might be disco, might be techno, might be anything. It doesn't matter. I might have a guest, I might not. So for me, it's just getting started. It's a really strange feeling, but I'm only just getting started. So all the stuff, it's really odd. Maybe it's because I've got a short memory. Are you still partying hard when you party? When you're doing your parties, do you still like to get down? Do you still like to let it hang out, would you say? I think I'll always party. I live to do that. I live to hang out. talk bullshit. Do you know what I mean? It's like, it's great. I mean, I've been curbed recently because my missus was like, you don't actually need to stay out that late. Do you know what I mean? You could have come home so many hours earlier and, you know, because she works, you know, and there is a thing where you go, yeah, that was a bit silly. Do you know what I mean? So I love to party, but maybe I won't, you know, stay for three days like I did a few years ago. You're just one and a half. Yeah. Yeah. Fair enough. Tell us about what you've got coming up. I'd heard that there was a single on Numbers that was going to come out this year. Is that potentially still the case? We're just doing a little bit of dancing around a sample clearance. Okay. Yeah. Are you at liberty to say which sample is in question? It's a sample that's about, I actually, because I had to send it to the record company, it's a sample that is actually 1.1 seconds long. So everyone keeps saying to me, when are you putting this record out, man? And it's, I can't put a record out because it's got a sample in it. You know what I mean? But the lovely people that are clearing it are just working as hard as they can. And I'm sure that soon we'll... we'll have something to put on the shelf I mean you're saying you don't tend to make plans but you know do you have anything in particular that you would want to achieve even if it's just like get more music out in the next 12 months or something I can't commit to that yeah no it'll just come back to haunt you I suppose no I mean Another interview. I've been building a house, actually physically building a house. I've been there for a year, like doing that. Not on my own. I've got builders who actually know what they're doing, but I'm actually there like helping carry bits of wood and stuff like that. It does take up all of your time because of this thing that you think was going to be three months and you're going to paint some floorboards suddenly turns into two years and you were left with a front wall and a back wall. It's different. You know what I mean? So that's taken over a lot of my time. Yeah. Just for the tape, you'd received a setback when you called the tile supplier before we came on air and saying how that's potentially pushed back the flooring for God knows how many weeks. Yeah. But that's every day. Every day you go to order something and this is boring, isn't it? But you need a bit of steel. No, no, we want to hear about your time. You need a bit of steel that goes in the floor so that he can lay the floor so that then that wall can go on that thing. And you're like, cool. When's the steel coming? Thursday. So Thursday, Laurie turns up, it's got the wrong size bit of steel on it. And you're like, fit in the hole it's too short oh okay well we'll send it back okay well when will the next bit be ready well it'll be two weeks to cut that now and get it painted and brought our blower so it's two weeks that that guy can't put the floor on so the next guy can't put the wall on and it's like every day For years. What's it going to be like that first evening when you sit down in your completed house? Well, that's tonight. Oh, that's tonight, really? And we haven't got any bathrooms or a kitchen. I'm not fucking about. It's just seriously. I'm absolutely serious. Our lease has run out on the flat we were renting. So, I mean, we're not that far off. We were like, look, don't get another one. We're just like, it will be ready soon. Yeah, yeah, sure. We've been staying on people's sofas and stuff like that. And then tonight, I've got one room now that we've got ready. So we're going to go and stay in there tonight. And yeah, we're staying in a room of the house. So there we go. Well, listen, man, thank you. Thank you very much. It's been great. No, Bye. Bye. Bye. Thank you.
