*Outro* Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. For our 100th RA Exchange, I spoke to Chilean-born, German-bred DJ and producer Ricardo Villobos. For many of you, Villobos needs no introduction. He's one of the most popular house music producers in the world. He grew up near Frankfurt. parents moving away from the South American country in the 70s. It was a fortuitous choice. Frankfurt was one of the hubs of electronic music in the 90s, with the lighthouse its most important labels. Villobos first made his name there and then went on to forge equally as important relationships with the Cocoon family and its booking agency. London's Fabric Club, with which he released a mix CD in 2007, and Perlon, the Berlin label that is now largely his dance music home. Lately, Philobos has been dabbling more and more in experimental music. Last year he released a collaboration with Max Loderbauer in which they reworked tracks from ECM, a German jazz and classical imprint. In this rare interview, He talks about the importance of maintaining an innocent outlook in everything that you do, why he shies away from the internet, and much more. I guess I wanted to begin with how you're feeling these days. I'm feeling? Yeah, because there was this back thing. Okay, the back thing was, I think it's the damage of... long time of working in a wrong position and it's I think it's a general problem of people who are a little bit taller you know and also problem of people who are has been doing sports and then they stopped at the beginning when when I was 24 stop to do sports. What sport were you playing as a young girl? I was playing volleyball, athletics, like playing soccer. I was doing all kinds of sports, but like at the end, I was, the last five, six years, I was playing volleyball. It seems like there's a lot of Berlin DJs that play volleyball together. Yes, well, I don't know. Like, well, this was in my... pre-Berlin period but it's yeah it's a pity well I was like relaxed because I thought okay I've been doing so many sports so I can relax and like live my whole life with this background but it's not true you from a certain point on you have to start to do sports again and especially for the muscles for the wrong positions you have as DJ or you have to go down completely because your records hasn't, there's no place anymore and wherever I play to put the records on. Or if there is a place all my friends are sitting there so at the end I have to put the records on the ground and this movement is like really, it's a horrible movement. and this for hours and this for many many years and also the turntables are a little bit too low most of the time. This business wasn't made for people as tall as yourself. Yeah, well, but it was like recently, like the last three, four, five years, in the clubs there is no place to put the records anymore because no one is playing with records anymore, which is very sad. And well, this is the problem. No, but my back is good. I couldn't be standing more than five minutes, so I had to cancel everything because this would have been possible only with a lot of painkillers and things like that. But I really had to make a break. and recover and train a little bit my back. Now everything is good. But there was no, there's no operation necessary, what I thought at the beginning. but it's all good. Good. It's good to hear. I saw recently, and it may come out by the time this comes out, that you have a new 12-inch coming out for Prolong. Yes, this is like the pre-album 12-inch. So another album is on the way. Yeah, well, another album. It's clear that I'm not only producing... space out electronic jazz music recently. No, all the time I've been producing electronic music for the dance floor also. And so this is a selection of all these productions because, well, we produce and produce, produce, but we have a big exchange in between the friends who are also producing, but many of the things are not coming out. So like 99% of the things. And it's not only for me like that. It's in between all our producing and DJing friends. We have like a little group of exchange, this kind of music. And a selection of these tracks will come out now on Perlon. With the tracks that you're exchanging with people, you talk very much about vinyl and how important it is. But are you making dub plates then? No, we exchange with tracks like we produce here in the studio, which are very long, more sessions. And it's a very, very little group of friends. It's like, I don't know, tens. They are also producing a lot. And so we exchange the music in between each other. But that's all. But for us, of course, it's very, very important to go on producing vinyl, an original copy of the music. because it means that the artist will get money for it, the distributor, the record store, the designer for the label. And this is what we want to provide and protect that this is going on because this is financing a little bit also. scene and our whole culture and i read an interview with you recently it seems like the protect idea is very important the protect idea is very important because like many things uh like many things many moral things are also like um rules how people live together uh really getting like really mixed up a little bit and there are some not traditional but there are some things it's important to to protect the conversations the writing a letter reading a book or like something things which seems to be old-fashioned and traditional but yeah there is there's something to protect at the moment yes and like the To have an intimate situation of life which is not public. To protect from the internet, spy machinery. which means that the computer knows much more about me than my wife and about my needs, my inner thoughts, my everything. So we are not, like I or many people, we are discussing with many people the thing that not taking part in this big spy machinery. And the Internet is one of the things which is a very critical thing also. Like all the social networks and all these things, these informations, I wonder where they are running together, where this information is going. And yes, this is... in the recent interviews I was saying that like that the big brother idea of George Orwell is a cold joke compared to what's happening at the moment At the moment, a big brother is coming into your house, fucking your wife and goes. It's like really something which is going into your most intimate situations. And I have the impression that the internet is like a big gift, a free big... playground where everyone can exchange. But at the end I have the impression that this will disappear and at the end you will have Facebook, Google, Apple TV and four, six or seven providers and you will have to pay for all information and the internet will disappear. This is the impression I have. And it was used for 25 years to by all necessities, the most hidden wishes of every person, and that this thing will disappear, and at the end you will have to choose again and pay for taking part in this Internet thing with five or six providers, which will be like giant providers, and that's all. And so this idea, we always had the impression that it's like that. And so we try to protect. And that's what I was saying in many interviews and things like that. But, well, I don't know. It's a personal point. It seems like at the same time that you, for good reason, don't like the internet, that the internet's helped you. Well, the internet helps. Every form of communication helps. But the most important promotion for what we are doing is the party in itself. and the record you produce and the form of helping other people also. and spread information and pass information and get information also from other people directly. This is what is important for what we are doing. The only promotion is the party where you're playing for the next party. This is the only promotion existing and the only promotion necessary. And of course, like the distribution promotion for selling the records. that a record can reach someone in Jakarta or something like that. The distribution network is something very important also. But I think this is the most important. The party decides over the next party. The party decides about the next party. The way that you've talked about parties, I think you said once that it's one of the few places where people get together and it's peaceful and fruitful. Yes, there are some. places where people are getting together like concerts, soccer games, things like that but there are not so many situations anymore where people are voluntarily getting together and are there for a common reason and this is the nice thing about the parties it's like the get together with the people and not the absence of aggression and things like that and conflict and this is like the the nice thing about the party and this is why I really want to be there I want to be part of this collective get-together that's why I'm DJing that's the only reason I want to be part of something belong to something be dependent of a whole group Because I think the promotion of independency is something to create values and necessities and products to sell and satisfy these necessities. But I follow more the doctrine of dependency. That means that you have to be dependent of people. be aware of dependency, to be necessary, you know, and to belong to a special place where you are necessary and you are dependent in a whole system of dependency. And I think dependency, like you see it in family systems or things like that, the dependency of a child to a mother. All these things are leading to happiness. And to belong to something is leading to happiness and not the independency, not the promised freedom of something. Because freedom means to be lonesome at the end, you know. Where does this philosophy come from? I mean, is this something that your parents gave you or is it something you've learned over the years? Of course, there is like a... education, a social responsible education that means that you are, but all our children are educated and we are all educated like that because otherwise we wouldn't have friends, we wouldn't have family, we wouldn't belong to anything. So our ground education is based on the idea of belonging, of dependency. and of social behavior. What happens then when you have to make a career and when you have to start to be responsible and things like that, that's another story. But I'm talking about having friends, about having a family of belonging. And these are things, values which are coming from the childhood more or less, you know. And I think every one of us has this experience that we are treating friends in a social way. And that's why we have friends. We are not trying to make business with friends or something. There is something like never mix up business and friends. This information is very true because it's not to find an advantage over the other person and then make a good business and things like that. Otherwise, you wouldn't have friends. You would have to buy your friends. I think the ground rules for this behavior are shown in the family system, you know, what means family for you and me. It's like the ground information is coming from the family idea. And then you substitute your family with friends, then you substitute your mother with a new girlfriend and things like that. But it's more or less the family idea of belonging together and being independent of each other. And this is leading to happiness. This is making you happy to belong to something. And that's why I... It's not a philosophy, it's something you see every day. You see when my little child is making "Wee!" and then the mother runs immediately and makes something. And tries to find a solution for this situation. There is no discussion: "Yeah, but you have to do this and that and then I do that and that and if you're not doing this then I won't do that." These things are not existing. People who belong to each other, they just do things for each other and they take care for each other. And this is the most important thing which is rescuing our world. Otherwise, I don't know in which direction it goes. Not a good one. When you were growing up in Frankfurt? I grew up near Frankfurt, yeah, in Darmstadt. Was it hard to make friends? No, absolutely not. Because you were an outsider. In general, it's hard to make friends because you have to invest a lot of time, you have to have common interests, you have to find the common interests. Of course. In the family, you don't have a common... You have to find a common interest between you and your father. And father, you have to make a relationship. What was your common interest? My common interest was playing. Just playing and being as innocent as possible. As irresponsible as possible. But your father was a mathematician? Yes, my father was working. He wasn't very irresponsible. After he had to leave Chile, he couldn't work as a mathematician. He had to work as an engineer or whatever work was coming because he was in a new country and he had to survive and his family had to survive. If I would be deaf from one moment to the other... I would also have to find another job, you know, or to do something else to help my family to go on. What was Frankfurt like growing up, near Frankfurt? Yeah, it was very nice. It's like there was a lot of information about electronic music. There was a good educational system. It was also not in Frankfurt, so it was in the land side a little bit and saw a lot of nature, but a lot of technology, information and culture, of course. But, of course, it's a different mentality than the Spanish or Latin mentality we have in South America. So there were always like... some limits where you realize, okay, this is the moment where you realize that someone from Northern Europe is reacting differently to someone in the south of the Alps, you know? Like, the Latin culture is a little bit different, but, of course, we all belong to the same culture. What were some of the things that you were like, oh, that is a little bit different? For example, it's the way how you handle truth. In Latin culture, there are different ways of explaining. reality with different truth and you always have a little backdoor where you can escape out of the situation. In Northern Europe, like, you have the mentality to always try to say the truth, whatever truth it is, you know, you have to realize that it's a subjective, your own personal truth, but you have the right to say it. This right to say a personal truth can be very useful for making appointments, for being scientists, for example, but it's not very useful for having human relationships, for example. So there was always like a difference, a little difference in mentality you have to deal with when you are coming from different cultures. But at the end you learn to use the advantages of both mentalities. of course. What were some of the first parties that you were going to? Were there certain things that really caught you? The first parties I was going to were the kitchen parties of my parents, you know, like it's always music, always dancing in whatever situation and being happy. Also when all the Chilean people had to live in Germany, there was always like the situation to Come together and celebrate, you know and listen to South American club, no, not club music, South American dance music. And, yeah, this was where the first party is. The party was always there. Were you listening to your aunt, was it, Violetta? Yeah, well, we were listening to all kinds of South American folk music. But what I remember more than everything is the party. It's like the... The dance situation, the rhythm situation, this is like what impressed me the most. And that's why I'm so impressed about this and go on trying to have this. Is your house also a nice, lots of dancing? Yeah, of course. I try to. If my children want to, they want to, of course. I remember talking to Roman Flugel and he said that you used to have after parties in your basement. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, when I was like 20, I was getting out of school and I was still living with my parents and I was DJing a lot and making parties. And we had many invited friends, people also from Detroit or from wherever. from the whole world and making parties and then having our personal little after hour in the basement of the house of my parents here and my parents there also, you know, like... He said something like he remembers, you know, coming up out of the basement. and your dad was just sitting there. Yeah, exactly. He was like, oh, hello. Yeah, exactly. He was sitting in the kitchen, and in the basement, there was, like, a car wreck playing. And he was 22 years old, and he was playing one of the most amazing sets I've ever heard. No, it was a very, very nice period. And this was like from 92 till, I would say, 96 or something. And you were hanging out with all the Playhouse guys. Yes, of course. They were always very active in Frankfurt setting records. having record stores, Delirium record store, and before playing, working at Boy Records and providing all music to all the very known Frankfurt DJs. And I'm talking especially about Atta and Heiko MSO. And this was, of course, it was a... central point of the central point of meeting people who are interested in house music and electronic club music in general it's like what i mean not berlin in the same way as it is now but it seems like the center in a lot of ways yeah it was it there was a it was the center of of information about this you know there was a culture, a lot of record stores and you had like very important clubs like the Dorian Gray and then later the Omen and yeah, there was a lot of money for entertainment in the night and so yeah, you had like many, many record stores. And the club situation. So I think these are the basics for creating a cultural nucleus. Who were you talking to when you were first starting to produce to kind of get advice and tell me how this thing works? Well, like get advice is... there is no source of advice. It's like your whole musical experience is deciding about what you're doing in a certain moment. the music you're listening to especially, and the people, your friends, who have this common interest again and likes the same things as you like, and helping each other, getting information and buying the first synthesizer and then buying... What was your first synthesizer? Roland SH-101. I wanted to have from my parents and all my parents, my grandmother, everyone, they had to collect money because it was much too expensive for every parent in this time, to have a DX11 or a DX100. or a DX21, or a DX7 was a dream. And it was impossible because it was too expensive. And then my parents could collect money, like 700 marks or something like that, which was a lot of money for a present. I don't know if it was a birthday present or for Christmas. And then they collect all the money and they could afford SH101 and I was super disappointed. I was like, what should I do with this shit? And I was like throwing it. Like children are sometimes very, very unjust. Like they're unjust treating their parents, you know. I realize it now at the moment also with my two and four years old kids. And this will go on my whole life, I think. But sometimes when I think back how I was treating my parents sometimes, it was like really very scary. But I think all of us. I think all kids reach a point probably at a certain moment. Yeah, it's really horrible. And then after half a year, I was looking at the 101. Okay, let's start to do something. And then a friend was buying his first drum machine, which was 707, I think. And then start to do pop music and more like Depeche Mode oriented music and things like that. But already like Daniel Miller, the producer of Depeche Mode, he was already behind the whole song structure of Depeche Mode. You were always recognizing some repetitive four to the floor beats like Get The Balance Right, Max The Single, for example. which is from 81 or 82, which is a revolution. I've been playing it now and it's one of the first techno things. It's like really wow. And this was in the back of Depeche Mode and like all this wave. and wave scene of the beginning of the 80s. And this was a big, big, big influence, of course. The Italo disco things. Did you go see Depeche Mode play? Yes, I was from when I was 12 until I was 17. I was on 32 concerts. I was following them. everywhere in Europe with the train and with friends and we were really like super huge fans. Well, until I was 16 or 17 and then, well, of course I had to start to take care about my own. life, getting out of school and things like starting to be responsible. That was the biggest band though. That was the one band that you really followed. Yeah, well, of course, Depeche Mode was a good compromise between the pop world and the new technology of electronic music. For me, they are like the Beatles. of the 90s, you know, the Beatles of our new era and also really explaining to a bigger mass of people that electronic music is also music and the synthesizer is also an instrument. and that this also could belong to our normal perception of pop music. And pop music means music of everyone, of as many people as possible. And this is why the Depeche Mode is very, very, very important and especially the quality of how many good pop songs they were writing. And in the back there was this electronic world and samples and drum machines and loops and bass lines and all these things. How did you get to house music from pop music? You said when you were first starting you were making pop music. Yeah, well, of course, for me, house music, the rhythm, South American music was there and then the disco thing. came on and my parents were like taking me when we were on vacations taking me taking me to the discotheque in the night and dance and for me it was more or less always the same thing you know and and then like of course out of disco they the the and through the whole electronic wave scene at the beginning of the 80s something happened that it becomes house music, you know, and this mixture. And this is so natural, like, that house music was a base or a common thing, which I was interested in, of course, you know. But for me, it's always like dance music, you know, it's like... I think for a lot of Americans it's hard sometimes because it is pop music in Germany and it never really was pop music in America. No, no, no, it's not pop music in Germany. What happened is that from the... song-oriented house track there there was like suddenly this new dance floor style which is more like a like a very cheesy form of electronic pop music based on house, which is like this dance floor style. But it's also not, I'm not considering it house music anymore, but of course it's all based on the four to the floor idea, formula, but it never has been pop music, I think. But I think the dance thing is something like pop music. The whole techno house and Euro trance, all this thing follows certain dance rules or certain rhythmical rules, I would say. see it as a whole thing, it's pop also. The rhythm thing is the dance, what we are doing, you know. What you are writing about and what I'm trying to contribute is also something like pop music. It's because it's It concerns so many thousand people in the world, you know, and it's supported and financed by so many thousand people all over the world that I would consider it as a whole as something like pop music, of course, you know, because pop music is popular music. It means, as I said before, that it belongs to as many people as possible. Tell me about putting out your first record. It was on Playhouse in 94? No, no, no. My first record was on Overdrive. It's a label from Mainz near Frankfurt. And it was in 92. Yeah. Called... What was the name again? I forgot. And then we had like two little labels, Holistic Music and Pleasant Flavor. This was like '93, '94. And then end of 94, my first Playhouse record came out, but this was like my fifth or seventh record or something. When did you feel like you had a sound, that you had something? I never felt this. I'm not following any sound thing or style thing because... But when did you feel like you had an individual voice that maybe you weren't copying? I really never tried to feel that I have it because I don't want to realize or define what I'm doing. Also, when I'm sitting here in the studio and record, press the record button, I don't have any concept about how it should be. it has to sound nice for me. It's like, I don't know, music is like a language. It has to be... in a nice, not aggressive, explaining voice. If someone is screaming to you or if someone is talking too much, I stop to understand this language. So for me, what I do is try to produce a hearable and nice form of clear language. If someone understands, good. If not, not good. And so I exchange with other people and try to find out if this music is good to bring it out or not and things like that. But this is more like experimentation between the friends. But the most important is to don't have any concept about how it should be. It has to sound nice to me, the frequency of this bass drum or the bass line. Then it has to be enough or not enough, enough language, enough words, enough frequencies represented. And then record. And that's all. It doesn't matter if it's house, techno or electronic jazz music or whatever you call it. It has to be a clearly understandable, non-aggressive language. And also when I'm listening to music here in the studio, of course I try to listen to the most really relaxed and nice form of music. And of course when I go to a rock concert, I know that someone is screaming to me. Or I go to a techno party. Or I know in a club that if I have a conversation in a club, I'm going to screen someone's ear and the other person has to screen back. Otherwise, I won't understand anything. But generally, also you or me, when we are talking, we talk in a very gentle and non-aggressive way. It's the best way of communication. And I think music should be like that also. But there is a lot of aggressive music out there. In rock music, there is the whole thing. I really love the moments of pure energy exchange. This is something I really love. I love rock situations. I love when there is a hard techno track and it really crashes me away. smashes me away. Of course I love it, but not all the time. And of course I like dark holes and bass, you know, but of course I like also bright and nice and like nice situations, colorful situations. It's like... I think it doesn't have to be all the time in the same way only. So also for the music you play as DJ, I really love to play techno, but I also love to play something colorful and with voice and melody and things like that. For me, it's absolutely the most important not to try to define at all the music you are playing and to define music in general and separate it into different forms of music. And the worst thing you can do is to declare music is good or bad music, because good or bad music doesn't exist. There is music you understand, the language or communication is fulfilled, or the communication failed and you don't understand this music. And that's all. But that doesn't mean that this music is bad. So this is the most important thing. It's like not to make any differences in music. Music is just music. It's a language you understand or not. I think with your DJ sets, over time you've incorporated more and more influences and you've gotten to a point where audiences are willing to go with you further and further. I think in every DJ situation you have to convince the people. No matter if the people are really prepared, if they are freakies or if they are... they don't have any clue about the music you are doing. In every party situation you have to start to convince the people with the language you are talking in this moment. If the people want to hear this language or not. Or if they prefer to go beside the dance floor and have a talk. or something like that or even go home and then say this guy is playing really strange music things like that and I think this is the important thing and also it is very important that you have to have the energy to convince every time as a DJ you have to have the position okay I'm here in a situation and it's not because I'm Ricardo Villalobos or whatever DJ. You are in the situation that you have to have the first, the will, the energy for the first half an hour, an hour, even if you feel bad, even if you're not in the right mood, to try to convince to have this form of communication with each other or not. If this convincing or this communication fails, it fails. It doesn't work and it's so good. So perhaps the next time someone won't book you again for this situation. We'll book another guy who is having another more understandable language. And I think this is how you describe the success of a DJ. That the person is always able... It's like someone who is explaining you something. And if the person is able to explain you this, then you understand. Otherwise, you're not interested in or you didn't understand to explain. But it's interesting that among, like, I guess... It doesn't matter how the culture is, the cultural background, you know. And this is, you notice that because you play all over the world, where the people have completely different cultural backgrounds, but with the rhythmical thing, for example, with the rhythmical formula, we are talking about this last time. I think you can convince anyone in the whole world of dancing, of just dance. For example, at the moment I'm playing a record from a Palestinian guy who looks exactly like Osama Bin Laden. And they're doing this Palestinian folk music with... clapping their hands. It's more or less the same BPM as house music. And they're sitting around the fire, I don't know, and singing this folkloric chants, melodies, you know. And even if the whole world is condemning the Arab culture for whatever enemy it could be, you know, and you're playing this music. And then suddenly everyone becomes Arab and everyone, it doesn't matter from which culture it is, is completely fascinated by this Arab music. And then suddenly first all the Arab people come and say, hey, this is Arab music. Yeah, this is Arab music. And then suddenly you realize that people who even think that this guy on the sleeve of the record. looks like a terrorist, he is completely convinced that the music is wonderful. And this is the nice thing about the language of music, this universal language of music, which is like an anti-Babylon. It's a general language. It's something that belongs to anyone. And it doesn't matter from which culture you come. If this Arab guy is convincing you with his chants and his singing, then suddenly you could be the biggest Arab hater in the world. I swear to you, you will dance and scream how good this music is. And it doesn't matter, you know. what political background and opinion you have, you know, it will convince you. And it doesn't matter if it's Arab or not. There is some like general language, some common culture we have in the past, I think. I'm not sure, but there must be something which all humans have in common. And at least we have to think about that we all belong to the Anglo, to the Indo-Germanic culture, which is like India, Persia, the whole European, the whole South American. Like all our languages are based on the same cultural language, which is the Indo-Germanic. language culture and three and a half billion people in the world speaks English, Spanish, Persian, Hindi, all these languages belong together. That means that we are all belonging together in a way, cultural, you know. And it's very strange when then like some people in America or some people suddenly invent to bomb the Persians. We are all belonging together. Without the Persian dynasty, an imperium, like where the Persians came from, from India, and then they cut the corridor from Persia to India. And if this wouldn't have been like that, then we would all speak Chinese now. You and me would speak Chinese now. And so we all belong together. And this is what music is able to show, that we are all coming from the same culture. We all love each other. We don't have problems with each other. It's only a political... an economical system which makes you believe that we have to hate this other person. But the reality, and music shows it, is that we all belong together and that we all come from the same culture. And this is the sad thing when you see them... suddenly, yes, this guy is really dangerous, he wants to kill us all and he's having an A-bomb and blah blah blah. This is bullshit. This person never wants to leave this point. They are there since 7,000 years, you know. So it's very... It's very important to recognize that the people don't have anything against each other. No one. It's always some guys and some politicians inventing a conflict. But we all belong together. We are all coming from the same culture. And this is like the music sometimes is showing that. That music shows that... can have a communication with each other. We can love each other. We can dance together without having any problem with each other. You have a really interesting perspective on it and any person who's playing all over the world as an international DJ has an interesting perspective on it because they're traveling all the time to all these different places. playing to all of these different cultures and you can see that all of these people are dancing to the same songs. Exactly. So that's important. I don't want to be a politician. I don't want to blow up our bubble because we at the moment, we exist in a bubble. Our movement. Our movement is a bubble. a still accepted bubble, which has no political meaning. So that means they leave us in our bubble. If we want to make and produce political meanings out of our bubbles, then it could be dangerous for our bubble. So we should really protect our bubble and be happy that we are able to make parties and have... a time in the weekend or in the night where we are able to do what we want to do, to dance and to be together. It's very interesting, though. I mean, you have to work very hard to create that. Yes, and then to defend that bubble and not become an instrument of any political meaning, you know. And this is very, very important that we protect our bubble. And we are just, we are not DJ terrorists, you know, as long as there is no DJ terrorist killed by some whatever agency. We are safe. We have just to be happy that we are able to have eight or nine or ten hours in a week where we can meet and be together and hear music and dance with each other. This is something we have to be very, very happy for, and that's what we have to protect also. When you were doing some interviews around the ECM release, you mentioned there was a certain point at which you started putting Hervé Paire and Alexander Kneifel? Alexander Kneifel, yes. Kneifel. Yeah. in your DJ sets. When did this start to happen? Especially when you have a period where you can really play very monotone, really only rhythmical music. There are some certain moments in the party where you feel very dizzy and things and you see that the party is dizzy as like really losing control about the normal state of life and the normal forms of life and then you play a lot of rhythmical things and then you think oh shit but it would be nice if now you have this rhythmical thing and now you put a choir on it or you put like a violin on it or whatever and it's only because of the boredom that you are like in this situation where it's very monotone and rhythmical and it's very nice. And then you think, but now a melody of somewhere which doesn't belong to the party normally. You put it on and then you have like a colorful touch into this kind of music. And this is where when I start to put things like that in the DJ sets. I also always put folkloric things, also from South America. Always putting things like that out of the musical background you have. And if you're impressed by... Even if I hate it, I was not into classic or jazz music in this time. Not specialized in this. didn't listen too much. But every time I listened to this music, I was really like emotionally impressed. And so I thought when I was... "Okay, I can put this, what impressed me so much, I can put it in the DJ set." And especially things which are not rhythmical, where you have like a choir or a voice or a solo instrument which is not following a certain rhythm, these pieces of music are very useful to put it on monotone rhythmical music. When did you get into jazz and classical? Well, of course, because of ECM. Because when I was a child, I bought the first ECM record. of someone of Keith Jarrett's music. And I always, like also my parents always brought me to the concerts and like meeting all the South American people here in Europe because you have to meet the people, like my parents had to meet people who were speaking Spanish and liking the same culture, the common interest like always. And so I was always in contact with live played music. But when you are innocent, you don't make a difference between jazz or classical. It's just music. And so it was just music for me. I got into listening to jazz and classic music like 10 years ago more because I was interested in listening to that. When you were doing the ECM thing, you said that you were looking for empty parts. Yes, exactly. The things I was using in my DJ sets were like this non-rhythmical, musical, like very pure musical. piece as well like one instrument or a choir singing or like whatever melody comes which is not rhythmical and to put this into the into the into the dj set And there were some people from ECM hearing that on the parties. And then they said, "You can make an evening where people are playing jazz music. You can perhaps do an evening where you are playing ECM records or ECM things together with your music." And then suddenly, oh, why don't we record a record like with electronic music mixed with... ECM things. It seems really hard. Were you nervous? No. How to figure out how to do it? No, no, no. It was absolutely, of course, for me, it's like working on something with a concept and it's for me quite difficult. My life has been always very difficult too. constantly one thing, you know. So of course I was working together with Max Loderbauer because we had good friends and we have a good situation in the studio. and we are always listening to records and we listen more to records or to music here than producing music. We are always sitting here and smoking some cigarettes and listening to music. So it was absolutely clear, okay, let's make this and then, okay, we have this part of music, like this part of an ECM track. let's make something with it and loop it or like and put something on but in a very innocent way you know without thinking about shit like perhaps it's not serious enough and it's not cool enough and for the jazz people and is we always try to be as innocent as possible and not trying to think about shit we are dealing now with this serious world you know what did when you met Manfred Manfred the Manfred Eicher yeah when you met him what did you play him first we played him the first four tracks we were making with it and And he recognized immediately that it's a good form of mixing ECM music with some new electronic approach. And so he said, "Okay, you can do whatever you want, take whatever you want." And then we produced like 20 more tracks, and based on the tracks I was playing on my DJ sets also. And then we tried to find new tracks. Then he was sending us some, like, some suggestings. He said, okay, listen to this, for example. This is also... And then he was searching for empty parts of... And sent it to us. And it was very fertile and very nice. And then after three months, we had, like... like sitting around and like playing around with the things and then we had like 20 or 24 tracks together editing them and then we had the album and then we had to kick out five or six tracks it was too much music for and then put them on two CDs. You played live with it as well? Yeah we are playing live with always Max and me with the modular systems with and one jazz musician, one solo instrument. I saw you guys play in Poland. We played with Christian Wallenroth, and the first concert was here when the record came out. Here in Berkheim, we played with Claudio Puntin. He's also a musician from ECM. Then our Italy tour was with Luca Petrella. He's in... amazing trombone player and yeah and now we go on to have now next week we have a concert in France again with Claudio Puntini is playing clarinet and doing all kinds of sounds and things yeah and then in October and November we have another tour in Italy again and we are playing in all this old places where Paganini Puccini and well this incredible Italian places, you know, concert halls which are like 500 years old and everything full of gold and it's really very very nice to get in touch with this old traditional culture in Italy and Italy has an incredible culture. It's like really scary and they didn't have some bombs in the Second World War so everything is still existing. So it was very clever. It must be exciting and interesting to have this challenge now to be performing for the first time. Yes, but of course then you are there and then you have also your Italian people, your Italian friends who are coming to the other parties and they never listen to the SCM records but they are coming to the concerts. And it's very funny because after 20 minutes the first guy is screaming "BASS DRUM!" And then... I want my money back and things like that because the people think okay this is a Riccardo performance and he is going to play danceable music and sometimes it's a funny situation because well they are quite disappointed that it's a concert doing something else of course there is a rhythmical situation also but only for five minutes and then it disappears again And it's all also, everything is improvised. Our concepts are completely different. How do you go about playing the modular live? It's... Yeah, me and Max, we separate some roles. I'm taking care about the rhythmical thing, the rhythmical sound structure. He's taking care about the melody. the melody part or the harmonic part and this is like from the beginning we try to separate the rules but then they come together of course and it can go wrong like because sometimes you don't have enough light or you're a little bit nervous and then you don't find exactly the same like whole where to put the cable in and and it's different than the last night and sometimes things are going wrong and you can't avoid that it comes out and then it comes out and then you have to deal with it and things like that. So it's always very, very interesting for us and it can go wrong completely also. We have a slight structure but we don't have any rehearsals or something like that. It's completely improvised. But until now it was okay. It's like being here in the studio and recording here. It's just to play around and see if it's nice we record or not. But in a concert situation you can't stop the concert. You have to deal with the situation that it's going wrong in this situation and then you have to try to repair the situation. This is what can happen. But normally, like in the studio, you're also with if an accident is happening and something is too loud or a frequency is really getting on your nerves. you also repair the situation as fast as possible because it's also not very nice to listen to it. So it's more or less the same situation as in the studio. Do you feel like you're getting better at playing, quote-unquote, the module? Yes, you're getting, not that you get better, you get less nervous about, you know. When you are doing some things more often you get less nervous. That means that you are under less pressure. Because pressure on you is always causing some not very skilled actions. And when people are under pressure they don't work properly. In music or in whatever things you do you have to be free of pressure. And, well, innocence is free of pressure. This is the nice thing about observing the kids, my kids, for example, to see what it means to be innocent, free of responsibility and free of pressure, free of competition that you have to be the best or the fastest, the biggest. And this is very, very nice. And when you are free of all these competition parameters, then everything is okay. But it happens that you have to start to think about shit. What is happening now during the concert? You have to... react and also when you are under pressure try to express that you're not under pressure. You try to fake that you are like okay and everything is nice and this is really costing a lot of energy. So not being under pressure is the best and nicest situation. And when you're doing it more often you lose a little bit this pressure, you know, what can, what could go wrong. It seems like so many electronic musicians are playing around with the modular these days. Why do you think that is? I don't know. I think it's an emancipation. I think you have all possibilities and the computer, of course, but I think it's simply more fun to connect the modules you, for example, have in Reactor. Max MSP or Ableton, you can connect them inside the computer and it's nice and it's also credible. You can have the same kind of modules also digitally. But it's more fun simply to find the cable and connect. this hole with this hole you know and that's i think this is why and also you have um the impression i don't know if it's like that but i have the impression that you can find an individual more individual sound or more particular sound or the var like the variations are bigger you know so this is a nice about modular you can can give someone exactly the same modules and something completely different is coming out. But if you are going into a computer, for example, where the systems like MaxMSP or Kyma or Reactor are also modular systems where you can connect all modules with all modules. But then you have a preset, for example, and the preset is influencing you already. you start your work based on this present and then perhaps the sound you will create is similar to the sound someone else is having also using reactor for example And so with modular you don't have any present. You are always starting from zero and see what comes out. And so you have the impression. I'm not saying that it is like that. But you have the impression that your sound is more individual, more specialized, is more personal. And that's why I think Modular is quite successful at the moment. And it's not expensive. I have to say, like all these modules, the modules are costing between 50 euro and 150 euro or something, or 200 euro. If you are interested in this world, you can buy one module per month, for example, or every two months, and you go step by step. Like, okay, I need a sequencer, I need an LFO or an oscillator or envelope or filter. And you start to... It's not something... like an elite of out of reach or something. It's something accessible for everyone. Are you using it quite a bit in your dance music? Yes, of course. Yes, it's like... It's less boring for me, you know, like to have the possibility to connect these cables. It's like, I don't know, when you're children, you're like playing with Lego or Fisher technique and make like, like boys are like that, especially they love to, they're very interested in technical things and relationship between this technical thing and the other one and what happens if I combine it. And the whole life of a boy is about this, you know. And then with modular, it's like, it's for grown-ups, but I'm standing in front of it like a little child. It's like, really, what happens if I'm connecting this thing with that, you know, and what's happening? So it's like a game. It's like fun. It seems like keeping things like a child is very important to you. Yeah, I think also not losing the relationship, innocence, and to being a child as grown up in our world is really very important. Like when we meet with the boys or we meet with some friends and we go party and some of them, or we are taking drugs, for example, just to say it, you know. then suddenly everyone becomes a child, you know? Everyone is not serious anymore, smiling and huddling and no competition anymore. Everyone is like in a kindergarten. That's why I love so much the dance and the parties we are living in. or we are doing everything for this party because going to a party is like going to the kindergarten. It's like going there and like... being a child. And when I got child, it was really, they are my biggest idols now. How they handle to be innocent, how they handle not to be responsible, not to take the responsibility about anything, not to have to take... really intelligent decisions. They just decide. They don't use their brain, their intellect. They just decide. They have a connection to the subconsciousness information, which is there since millions of years. It's like the information, the things we do anyway, without thinking about it. So the consciousness is more or less my biggest enemy sometimes, you know, like to think about the future and the past and what will happen. This is all bullshit, you know. When I see my children, they just decide. They don't know why. Or someone is saying, I'm first, and the other one is the last. I'm the last or something like that. It's so so nice when you see people out of competition, you know and stay out of competition is for me my biggest the most important sentence in my life, you know to recognize a competition and to step out of the competition immediately, you know, and even if people are having competitions with you To recognize that and to just to say, sorry, I'm not competing with you. I don't want to be the biggest. I don't want to be the largest. I don't want to be the richest. I don't want to be the best. It's bullshit. Let's just do things. And this is the nice thing about observing children. They're so innocent. It's so nice. How do you balance the responsibility? Yes, I give all responsibility to my wife. My wife is taking a lot of responsibility. Thank God I find someone who is completely different than me, organizing and planning things. And I can go on. I'm doing what I'm doing the best is trying to be as innocent as possible and so I'm more creative. whatever I do. It can be DJing also. She allows you the freedom to be creative. Yes, she gives me this like a shelter where in this shelter I can be free and I can be out of competition, out of seriousness and responsibility and she's protecting me a little bit. And it's important to find someone who has different qualities than you. It's important at the beginning to have common interests, but after a while to separate the roles and say, okay, you take care about this and I take care about this. Let me do it, you know, and don't criticize. I said, let me be a child, let me be in the studio three times a week for eight hours and do whatever I want. If I'm listening to music or I'm producing music, it doesn't matter. And it's an organization thing, you know, to try to have this freedom. Last time we talked, I said, you know, what do you want to be doing? You said a soundtrack work, more jazz things. And you've been doing that. You did the ECM thing since then. What next? Is it just more of the same? I don't know. If you have to explain what you're doing next and you have to define it, then it's always complicated because the ECM thing for me is nearly the same thing I'm doing also, like trying to create or make music or record whatever comes out here of the studio. and not doing it for a... a purpose, it's like just going on doing things and for me it's the most important to just go on doing what I do. Not to reinvent myself and to find a new name. I really love the party, I really love to produce dance tracks or tracks to listen and dance. And I will go on doing that. And if there is something jazzy coming out and it's not so danceable, okay. But for me, it's the worst to define the future. It's like I try just to go on doing what I do. And for me, being a DJ is something I really, really love because of the whole situation, the collective situation. And producing is also something I really, really love to do. And that's what I'm going to do in the next 10, 15, 20 years if my health is admitting it.
