you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Few a better place to discuss the art of promoting parties than Rob Starr. You might know him as one half of the team behind Mullet Over. a wildly popular event that played a leading role in shifting London's dance music scene out of nightclubs and into temporary spaces. These days, Mullet Over is a legit operation, but in its early years, Starr and co. worked in the spirit of early rave promoters, producing events in weird and wonderful locations, while trying to stay one step ahead of the law. Starr's earliest jobs in music were with huge UK festivals like Tribal Gathering and Homelands, and he channeled those experiences into Eastern Electrics, which started out as a large-scale inner-city event and eventually grew into an outdoor multi-day festival. Away from the dance floor, he's also become a respected pub proprietor with three venues across London that aim to draw in grown-up ravers. In a nightlife climate as turbulent as London's, Starr has had many ups and downs over the years, so we invited him over to hear his story. you So Rob, you started out working for a promoter called Universe who ran the Club Night Final Frontier and the Tribal Gathering Festival. I wondered if you could start by telling us about the significance of these events and what your role was within Universe. Yeah, I mean, I'd been going to Tribal Gathering since the first event in 93, so I was sort of well aware. of Universal when I came to London in '96. And I suppose, yeah, I just wanted to be involved in clubs when I moved to London. And it seemed like a natural sort of fit that I'd been going to their events. And they had a club. They ran Club UK for quite a while and had quite a seminal night there, which then moved to the complex in Islington. And so I just sought them out, really, and blagged a job. What was the first tribal gathering like that you went to? Pretty special, yeah. It was down in Warming. I'll always remember driving down there and there was another party called Perception that was on that night that was in the Midlands and that got cancelled and they sort of turned that into an illegal party but a lot of people couldn't get into Perception and they all ended up coming down to Tribal Gathering in Warminster and so I remember the roads just being gridlocked. We got down there maybe about 10 o'clock at night and... You just couldn't, like the cars weren't moving, but you could hear the bass like in a distance somewhere. And I remember we dumped the car in the end and just walked across these fields to get to the party. Yeah, it was pretty special. I think there was about 30,000 people there at that one. Was the event kind of doing something that stood it apart from other sort of festival style offerings in the UK at that time? Yes, I mean, tribal gathering was the first really, I suppose, multi-gen dance music festival in the UK. People had put on big raves, big all-night outdoor raves before, but they tended to focus on, I suppose, hardcore, or sort of what was traditionally known as rave at the time, whereas Tribal Gathering put sort of techno, drum and bass, rave, hardcore, house music. They put everything together in sort of, I suppose, the traditional dance music sort of format that you get now. So what was sort of your music preference around that time? At the time, I was sort of just going from being a raver to getting into house music. I'd sort of started off going out in around 1992, went to, I think it was a big Fantasia rave, the first rave I went to, just literally a couple of miles from my house in Castle Donington in Leicester. So we sneaked out and pretended we were going night fishing and went to that when we were about 14. So I was really into rave at the time. And then I suppose as I got a little bit older, I got into the sort of housey sounds. I was also getting into a bit of techno at that time as well. So tribal gathering was perfect for me because you could sort of... have your sort of rave tent then you could go and listen to a bit of Sasha and then you might go and listen to cold cock so yeah I had everything so what was your role within the universe I was basically there boy Friday I suppose I used to go in on a Friday morning work in the office and I'd just be doing a little bit of paperwork sorting out itineraries and stuff And yeah, I'd work in the office all day on a Friday and then we'd go down to the club on Friday night and I used to look after the DJs really. I'd be running around making sure people had drinks and making sure people had taxis and were getting away to their hotels and making sure everything was alright with the equipment. Just generally helping out really. I mean, who were some of the prominent bookings around that time for you guys? They had everyone in the techno world, really. I really remember Richie Horton coming. He actually bought a little digital camera with him, and it was the first time I'd ever seen a digital video recorder. This was like 1996, so yeah, it was pretty special. So he's always been ahead of the curve in technology. He's always been into his technology. But then Jeff Mills is a really regular performer there. I think Sven's played a few times. Carl Cox was playing down there. played down there a lot Harvey I remember played in the back room so yeah it's quite big names so obviously you had like a long-standing appreciation of like rave culture and everything sort of connected to it I was sort of interested to know why you wanted to get involved with promotion like what was it about like putting on parties and being a promoter that sort of really appealed to you from an early age I'd put my own parties on from the age of 16 when I did my first party it was just something that appealed to me I mean I had decks at the time but I was never so interested in being a DJ and yeah I remember the first party that we did me and two of our friends at school we put on an end of term sort of school party and we hired a hotel out and we took people there in a convoy of buses and Yeah, just the feeling when you see everyone really enjoying themselves at midnight and, yeah, having a great time. And I got the buzz from them, really. I understand you also work with Homelands and Gatecrash Summer Sound System. Is that right? That's right, yeah. Homeland sort of came off the back of Universe when Tribal Gathering stopped. Creamfield sort of stepped into their shoes on that weekend, really. And at the time, I think Darren Hughes was at Creamfield and a few people who were associated with that event I got in touch with. And yeah, then I went to Ibiza in 99 and worked for Home Ibiza. And that sort of developed into me working for home, really, and working on the Homelands Festival. I mean, were there any like core kind of aspects of those festivals that really instilled like good practices in you? Were there any like, you know, elements of that event that you've really like taken away from them? I think a lot of those events, obviously, I was quite keenly like interested in the bookings and the way they sort of booked artists. that were up and coming over the years. I remember one year at Homeland, they bought the streets just before they came really big. And I think that's always been something I've aspired to do. identify acts who who are up and coming who are going to be perhaps the next big thing but I think in terms of the format of the festival I always used to think that those festivals could be better in terms of the production there and musically they were always really amazing you always listen to some great DJs and the musically they're always spot on but I just felt they lacked maybe a little bit of production and I think that's probably the thing that I've tried to take into our events is to try and add that extra level in there yeah i mean have you always been excited with kind of working or aspiring to work with kind of events of that size Not always, no. I mean, I used to work full-time for Home and when Home closed around, I think it must have been 2001, I very much went, I suppose, back to the underground and was like, I don't want to work for a big super club or a big corporation or put on big events. And I suppose that was a similar sort of time when lots of really exciting things were happening in East London. And I moved over there and there was lots of little warehouse parties going on and Secret Sundays were just starting to do their events. And I suppose then I really wanted to sort of get back to that sort of more underground ethos, I suppose. Because home is massive, wasn't it? It's like for people who don't know, can you sort of describe the space for them? Yeah, home was basically a seven story super club in Leicester Square. Which, when you say it now, it's like, yeah, wow, a super club in Leicester Square. But yeah, it had, I think it was four floors of music. Then it had a VIP bar at the top. And then there was a sort of really high-end restaurant above that. And there was a roof terrace. It's a pretty amazing space. Do you think it just may be, because it wasn't open too long, was it? Maybe a couple of years? Yeah, opening in 99, I think it closed 2001. I mean, do you get the sense that it was maybe at the end of like a curve for that style of venue in a way that maybe that style of venue would sort of run its course a little bit? Definitely. I think they really suffered because they couldn't get a 6am licence at the location that they were at. And I think if you want to be a serious dance music club in London, it's not great closing your doors at four o'clock, especially if you're maybe travelling from a different part of the country to go there. So that didn't help for a start. opened its doors when a lot of the really interesting things in the city were shifting out of the West End over to the East. And I think those factors combined and the fact that, yeah, at that time DJs were getting paid a lot, the rent there must have been hugely significant. And I think, yeah, to put on a club. of that sort of scope was was was a big ass really so in 2004 was when you staged the first mullet over event you'd kind of said in the past that there were aspects of the london scene that you're feeling maybe a bit disillusioned with um i wondered if you could kind of paint a picture of sort of what was going on with london clubbing around that time Yeah, I mean, at that time, we still had some great clubs in London. The End was there, the Cross was there, the Quay, the Turnmills. But for me, they didn't feel that exciting. And when I first moved to London... You had lots of parties like Lost and you had Reclaim the Streets doing crazy parties in Trafalgar Square and taking over motorways and the whole sort of squat party scene, I suppose, was a lot more prevalent then. And yeah, I suppose at that time, time a lot of people who come to East London started putting on their own little parties I remember Hoxton pimps were doing some great parties where they were taking over sort of car parks and warehouse spaces and I remember going to one in maybe about 2002 thinking wow this is amazing it basically ran all weekend so it'd start on the Friday and finish on the Sunday and you could sort of rock up there at any point in the weekend pair fiver to get in and listen to some great DJs and I thought Yeah, this is much more what I'm into rather than going to a club and paying £15 and having maybe a bit of an intrusive search to get in and everything else. And that was the sort of ethos I was looking for. I mean, would it be fair to say that there's like you maybe look for an element of danger or something in it, just something a bit more rough around the edges? Yeah, definitely. I suppose at that time I'd been in London for sort of six or seven years and you're just always searching for something new, something different. I'd been to pretty much every club in London and yeah, after a new sort of sound as well as a new sort of space because a lot of the clubs at that time... weren't playing perhaps the most forward-thinking music, with the exception of Fabric, I suppose, in the end. So what were the prevalent music styles around that time, do you recall? I suppose house was still really quite big then, and even though the whole Superclub thing had died off, there were still not many really amazing musical nights in London. and I didn't think anyway. And yeah, I suppose club-wise, Fabric was the only place we really used to go to. And it'd be more sort of searching out those smaller parties, like Secret Sundays started around that time. Sometimes we used to go to sort of some of the nights that were on the AKA, like on a Sunday night down there, there were some really good nights. And I suppose the tech house sort of sound was still quite prominent. And a lot of the cooler parties were playing that sort of music. So in terms of Mullet Over, what was the sort of feeling among the group about what you wanted to achieve with the party or the direction that you wanted to take it in? It was quite an interesting dynamic, actually, the way the party started, because Geddes, the resident DJ, partnered with a guy called Jafar. who's been DJing around London for years, and another promoter, Kelly Love, and they'd started the event themselves, and I had basically had a warehouse. I'd been looking for a warehouse in East London to do parties for a while, and I stumbled across this space. And so I'd started... putting on my own sort of warehouse parties there and they needed a venue for their party their party had lost its venue at the time and we sort of came together like that I was programming two floors of this warehouse and they were programming another floor and it worked really well the party was really great and We all became friends after that and then decided to put the party on as a collective. When you met up with them, what were they looking to go towards? What was their aim or ambition, would you say? Certainly for Geddes and Jafar, they were wanting to push their DJ careers and establish a reputation in London musically for what they were doing. Whereas I was always more about... finding interesting spaces and putting interesting parties on. And Kelly provided the sort of production element to it. She was always wanting to dress the venue nicely and add, I suppose, the feminine touch to the party, which always helps. So I suppose that combination worked quite well because you had the musical side covered, the venue covered, the production covered. Talk me through the process of securing and finding venues, because this must have been such a big part of your career in music. OK, so for example, what was it like around 2004 to find these spaces in London? Around 2004, you couldn't get a temporary event notice. So for those that don't know, a temporary event notice allows you to put a temporary license on a space for up to 500 people. Because you couldn't do that, essentially you were putting on, let's not call it an illegal party, but a party without a licence. Which meant that when you went to a landlord, a venue owner, a warehouse owner, you essentially had to say, I'm putting on a party without a licence, which at that time people weren't that keen to do. despite the fact that in East London you had a lot more available spaces. So you had lots of spaces available to use, but then you had to convince whoever had that space that what you were going to do wasn't going to get them in trouble. wasn't going to wreck their space, wasn't going to cause any issues with the neighbours. I mean, what would be your bargaining chip in those sorts of situations? I mean, I guess if these guys have unused spaces, it's just like, you know, a bit of cash flow. Money is always the bargaining tool, yeah. I mean, do you feel like it was a bit easier to get away with events like that sort of 10 years ago? And if so, why do you think that was? I'm not sure whether it was easier to get away with. I mean, we still had our parties closed down by the police. We still had venues sort of closed before we'd even started parties. So I don't know whether it was easier. In those days, I suppose, you didn't have a choice. So you couldn't apply for a license. So you didn't have any option, really. So if you wanted to put that party on, then that's what you had to do. Did you have any sort of favorites from the early years? Or actually, can you give us like a flavor of the type of venues that you used to use? So the first venue we used was a disused toy shop. on Whitechapel Road, very close to Oldgate East Tube Station. It was basically three floors, so you had three rooms of music and it had a little roof terrace on the top that you could go out to. The toilet facilities, I have to admit, weren't amazing. I guess it's give and take with these things. Yeah, I mean, I don't recall us actually having any portaloos in there. I think there was some toilet facilities, but they weren't great. and you used to have to go down to get into that particular venue, you had to go down an alley, you had to bang on the door, and you could hear the music for that event, but you wouldn't have actually known where it was unless you actually knew which door to bang on. So they were quite often hidden away. Obviously, they weren't promoted. The actual address for the venue never went out until the day of the party. So, yeah, it was a little bit more clandestine, shall we say. How were you promoting them in those days? Was it mainly word of mouth? Yeah, it was mainly word of mouth. We did print a few flyers that we just used to give out to our friends. I had a phone number on and used to call the phone number and then you'd get the address from the phone number. Where we were situated in East London, there was almost a ready crew of people to go out partying every weekend. So it didn't take much to get the word round to those people. And there were a few other sort of venues. Doveridge Studios springs to mind in Shoreditch, which was another unlicensed venue at the bottom of Kingsham Road. And there was a little circuit that people used to go around. in East London in those days. So to get the word out was fairly easy. All right, I see. And do any of the early events kind of stick out in your mind as being particularly special? I mean, the first one, obviously pulling off the first party is always going to stick in my mind. I suppose when we did at the EQ warehouse over in Hackney Wick, it was a Halloween party. I can't actually remember what year it was, but it was probably like 2006. And in those days, Hackney Wick seemed a million miles away. When we said, oh, we're doing a party in Hackney Wick, nobody even really knew where it was. sort of point out the fact of how far away it was we actually ran buses from Shoreditch over to Hackney Wick because we didn't want people to get lost and it was there was nothing in Hackney Wick at that time and I think yeah that that was a pretty special party. Do you think it's kind of fair to say that the beginnings of Mullet Over kind of coincided with like a new sound sweeping London in the way because I want to think back to that sort of like middle of that decade i'm always associating it with like minimal and like deeper house and like more stripped back stuff yeah i mean was this the stuff that was really like fueling the party and exciting you guys i mean you kind of like looking to places like germany for inspiration yeah certainly and i mean when we first started it was a bit more along the electro sort of sound And it sort of, yeah, it morphed into that more minimal sound. Certainly Geddes, who does a lot of the bookings, that was the direction he was going in. And that was the direction that we wanted the party to go in as well. And that was what seemed really exciting. time was it at all tough as the kind of years went by and the party grew was it at all hard to like transition from something that was really grassroots really underground kind of really word of mouth to something that was more established with like kind of brand considerations like how was that like transition for you i mean for us it was a fairly natural evolution the parties obviously got bigger And we had to find bigger venues. As we found bigger venues, we had to think about things like putting good toilets in and making sure the sound system was really spot on. And I suppose this sort of circle that we were in was getting bigger at that time as well. Things were becoming more popular in East London. More people were moving over. And yeah, the crowd was growing. crowd just sort of naturally swelled, I suppose. And we didn't really have like, oh, let's create a master plan for this. It was just like, to be honest, a lot of the time it was just, let's keep finding the venues because that was the most difficult thing at that time was to find venues that we could. use and keep them interested and our ethos always was that we didn't want to party in the same place so we're always trying to come up with new spaces and that was the hardest thing were you guys among the first to use temporary events notices in london i like to think we were probably the first people to use the temporary really it's like yeah i certainly Don't know of anyone else who used one before us. The first one we did, I didn't actually believe that it was capable of happening. I mean, I remember, I think I read it somewhere. It might have been in Mixmag or something like that. I read the change in the licensing laws meant you could actually license temporary spaces. And it wasn't until we actually did it and the council didn't object and the police didn't object that I thought, wow, this is going to really change the game for us. I mean, do you think from that point on it kind of did shift what you were about or did that have a noticeable, discernible knock-on effect? I mean, I suppose it had two effects for us. One, it meant we weren't constantly on the run from the police and we weren't worried every time we... We put on a party that it was going to get shut down or we were going to get the equipment seized or we were going to get everything stopped and effectively lose a lot of money as well because we'd obviously hired everything in and booked all the DJs. So it caused that to sort of dissipate, I suppose, and we weren't so concerned about those threats. But it also meant then everybody else had licence to put on similar parties to the ones we were doing. So it took... I suppose that uniqueness that our parties had away to a certain extent because eventually everybody realised you could get a temporary event notice. I think we probably had a good year or maybe a couple of years where people didn't really realise you could do that and people still thought we were putting on illegal parties and people still thought that we didn't have a licence and yeah it took a little while but most promoters cut and done after a while. And I guess even though you're able to utilize the tens, you still had to contend with like last minute venue changes and that sort of thing. I mean, has that been a kind of like continued reality? Yeah, I mean, we just get used to it now. I think it was quite funny when we lost the venue for the first Eastern Electrics, everyone was like, wow, what are you going to do? You've not got a venue. How are you going to put the party on? And I was just like, well, it happens all the time to us. It's not like we'll find a venue. That's what we do. So, yeah, it just becomes a reality of the party, really. those sorts of parties and you just get on with it and deal with it. Yeah, sure. I guess this whole process was what kind of led to what was quite a low moment for the party when you had the incident with the cloakroom at the event in Hackney Wick. Maybe people outside of London don't know about what happened. Just explain what went down at that event. Yeah, I mean, that also stemmed from another venue loss situation. Originally we were supposed to have that party at the Pleasure Gardens, which unfortunately we weren't able to use. We'd sort of put a deposit down and we'd put the tickets on sale and we were all set to do the event there. And so we had another last minute venue change. We'd already sold a few thousand. tickets so we needed a fairly substantial venue and we we found the space in Hackney Wick and unfortunately the the people who who ran that venue wanted to run the event themselves I mean they obviously had financial motivations to do that, but they wanted to run the bar operation, the cloakroom operation, the security, basically run everything, which traditionally we have always done ourselves. We always run our own bars, we always employ our own security, we always take care of the cloakroom, and it's something that over the years we've sort of built up a certain level of knowledge and expertise in. and we negotiated for quite a while and tried to get the guys involved to change their mind, but they were adamant that if we wanted to do the party there, we had to do it on their terms. And I look back on it now and I think, well, maybe we should have just pulled that party and not done it, but at the time we'd sold the tickets, the event was pretty much sold out, we'd booked the DJs, we'd committed to quite a big spend for that event, and we would have if we hadn't have done it. So we went ahead. Unfortunately, pretty much everything that could have gone wrong at that event went wrong. There was big queues outside for people to get in that weren't managed very well. When people got in, there was queues at the bar. The cloakroom wasn't very well organised. The bar ran out of drinks and ran out of change. And all the things that we'd spent years making sure we didn't do basically happened at that party. And at the end, there was quite a few people who didn't get their coats back. Clothing room tickets went missing. Coat rails got knocked down. People ended up trying to get their own jackets back. And it's our party. We have to accept responsibility for that, which we did after the event. And unfortunately, yeah, it was probably, as a promoter, the worst moment of my promoting career. I mean, would it be fair to say that after such a, you know, a low, it perhaps made you reconsider like, you know, the continued existence of the party? Yeah, I mean, certainly after that, we sort of... took stock of what we were doing and said right do we want to carry on doing this like is it worth i suppose putting ourselves through that and both me and Geddes felt that we couldn't end the party on a low note like that there was no way we could just finish the party with that being its legacy i suppose And we sort of did everything we could to repair what got damaged. I mean, every single person who lost an item of clothing or who didn't get their coat back, we personally approached, we gave them money and we gave them free tickets to the next event. We did everything we could to repair that relationship and that money came out of our pocket. and we didn't even take the revenue for the cloakroom or the bar or anything like that but we still paid everyone back in whatever way we could and we ended up not making any money from that party in the end just because we paid back so much money for people's coats which we can accept is fair enough but I suppose it was more the damage that it had done to our reputation and it was really upsetting after putting on so many great parties to have. something like that happen but in terms of finishing it then we did talk about it but there was no way that could have been like yeah the the legacy of that party it just wouldn't have been yeah i wouldn't have been able to let that happen yeah because you made it to the 10th anniversary earlier this year that's right is the plan to do more more over events so you kind of figuring it out at the moment or yeah i mean I think that will be the last club show, doing an arena at the festival. Yeah, certainly at the moment we've got no plans to do another club show. I think 10 years in any business is a long time. And 10 years doing something that is something that we love really, essentially, and something that we do as a hobby. And we do because we want to put on great parties. eventually it comes to a point where you're like, well, we've done pretty much every club in London. We've done every warehouse in London. We've done like lots of fields. We've done lots of parties in Ibiza and Croatia. And we always said when we started that if we didn't feel we were... adding something new or something interesting or something different to the club scene in London, then really what are we doing it for? And I think we certainly reached that point this year where we were like, well, how can we make this party different to what everybody else is doing? And I think now it's really hard in London to do that. Yeah, we didn't want to just put on parties just to like, oh, we'll do a Halloween party and a birthday party and a couple of other parties and we'll make a few quid over the year. And it's yeah, that's not really what we're in it for. We're in it to put on amazing events. And if we aren't doing that, then there's no point doing it for us, I think. So I guess the backdrop to this story is you work with Easton Electrics. Could you kind of describe the origins of the event for us? Yeah. So I suppose back six years ago, which would have been, if my maths is correct, 2008, myself and Will Patterson, who also does the FAM Festival now, we wanted to put on... an event in Shoreditch, which was a multi-genre event that had house, techno, more bass-led music. And we wanted to do quite a big event in Shoreditch over the August Bank holiday weekend. Again, the ongoing venue loss theme running through this conversation occurred and we lost that venue. And we managed to find the Great Suffolk Street Arches, which was the home of Eastern Electrics really for three or four years. And yeah, the idea from the outset really was to put a festival on. But we wanted to... build a brand and build something rather than just go okay we're putting a big festival on and we wanted to have some sort of depth behind it and we also wanted to sort of build a fan base I suppose so we did the warehouse parties for three years and then we did the first festival in 2012. Do you feel that there was perhaps a gap in the market for an event of this size in London at the time? Certainly, yeah. Yeah, definitely. So, I mean, there was... The scene was a lot smaller when we first started doing Eastern Electrics and I'm not sure whether you could have had a 10,000 capacity festival playing just house and techno really at that time. But certainly when we launched the first event, the appetite was there and I think almost like a new breed of younger clubbers had sort of come through. And mixed with the, I suppose, older guard who'd been listening to that music for the last sort of 10 years, I suppose, meant there was quite a big market for that sort of event in London. And when it actually came to staging what represented a more like full festival offering, obviously the inevitable of a venue problems rose ahead. Did you have to sort of rethink the way that you were approaching as a result of this venue switch? Because you were down for Clapham Common initially, weren't you? And then went to sort of a more concrete space over in Greenwich. Like, did you have to tweak the way that you were approaching everything very much? Yeah, I mean... We basically had to fit what we were putting on the common onto that space, which meant we lost a lot of the production elements that we were going to put on the common because it's a concrete site. You can't physically fix certain things into the concrete. All the tents that we used were sort of clear span tents because we couldn't dig into the ground and put sort of proper marquees and perhaps more interesting structures in there. One of the biggest issues that we had was that also when we hired that site, we were supposed to hire it with everything set up. Unfortunately, the landlord for that site went bankrupt before our event and he never built the site. So we ended up actually building the site ourselves, which for a year one festival. was quite a tough ask. So it was actually quite a stressful situation to actually bring that event together. The least stressful thing was selling the tickets, which isn't always the case. But for that one, the tickets sold out sort of four weeks in advance. But yeah, the actual site was, I suppose, fraught with problems. In terms of this year's event, you're back to a single day offering. What are the things that you kind of learned from last year's event that you sort of applied to this year? Yeah, I think last year's event was too ambitious. We wanted to go for three days when in reality we probably could have put a one-day or a two-day event on that site and it would have worked a lot better. Which is Nebworth for those that don't know. Yeah, yeah. And I think in my head... I maybe assumed that people would be really into the all-night concepts. I suppose for me, growing up, going to raves that went on till six in the morning, that was a format that I thought people would really like. But I think today people are quite happy just to come in the daytime and go to an after-party or go somewhere else after, and I think people aren't. as concerned about being out all night. And obviously, the longer you put the event on for, the more your costs increase. costs increase security costs increase staffing costs increase and yeah the event we put on last year was very expensive yeah i mean was it just a case of like not quite getting enough people through the doors yeah i mean in terms of numbers the saturday was really well attended we had nearly 15 000 people there on the saturday and then it was the friday And really the Sunday where we lost the money, the Sunday, there was probably only about 7,000 people there. And most of those had been there all weekend and had sort of camped for the weekend. And yeah, that's where a lot of the money was lost because really, I suppose, in hindsight, we should have looked at it and thought, well, do people want to rave for three days solid? And if we'd have maybe just done the Friday and Saturday. it probably would have made financial sense. But the additional day with the cost of the acts on the Sunday and again, the cost of security, policing, infrastructure, etc. meant that, yeah, it just didn't become viable. So bearing in mind all the sort of stresses that are associated with... putting on such events like what's the moment for you where you kind of like look out or you know what's the sort of point in the events where you really think to yourself okay this is all worth it you know what do those moments usually look like in 2012 that moment was uh Me and Jamie Jones on the main stage, sun just setting over the city and over the sort of gas tanks down in Greenwich. And at that point, yeah, you're thinking he was playing the last set of the day. Like everyone had a great time. The sun had shone. I think Britain won like five or six gold medals in the Olympics that day. Like, yeah, it was it was one of those moments where you look at my mum and dad were there as well. Yeah, that's what makes it all worthwhile. And as if you didn't have enough on your plate, you also own three pubs. Are you someone who kind of subscribes to the long English tradition of the good old boozer? Where does this love come from for you? everybody loves a boozer don't they? Yeah they do yes. It was actually an accident the way I got into the pubs I actually wanted to buy a nightclub that was probably just after I'd started doing my let over really in 2005 2006 and one of my mates Richard me and him were looking at a venue in London And obviously to buy a nightclub in London is a fairly expensive process. But we managed to find somewhere. We'd put an offer in. It was all looking like it was going through. Solicitors were sort of getting ready to sign papers. And then the person with the venue pulled out and we ended up not buying it. Whereabouts was it? I'm not going to tell you. It was in East London somewhere. And after that, my friend went traveling and I still wanted to get a venue. And I'd been looking around sort of East London for a while. And there was this place in Bethnal Green that was called the Pleasure Unit. Great name for a venue. And I'd sort of looked at it. a couple of times and I thought, oh, maybe I could turn that into sort of live music stroke sort of DJ venue. And yeah, eventually I took the plunge and thought, yeah, why not? Let's buy it. So what sort of makes a great pub in your mind? A great pub obviously has to get, you have to be able to get a good pint in there. Got to have good food. And I think increasingly, well, for me anyway, music's an important element. And I think the pub's all about socialising, so it's about the people who are in there and it's about... meeting interesting people and different people and meeting characters, I suppose. I mean, what's the sort of biggest obstacle for you in running these venues? I mean, we talked at length about the problems you have with putting on club events. Like, what is it in pub, sort of the world of pubs? The world of pubs. Staffing is always an issue, getting good staff. And I hate it when you go into a pub. and the bar staff don't want to talk to you or they ignore you or they don't serve you. And I think getting good staff is always difficult. I suppose with any business, cash flow is always a problem. We're always wanting to expand and do new things to the pubs and refurbish areas and do things. And the banks don't want to lend to pubs. They're not seen as a sexy business. So raising finances is quite often difficult. It's not a bad business. I don't mind being sat at my bar and having a pint and having a chat with my mates. It's not a bad place to be. And just to finish up, I wanted to ask you about London in general because obviously you've been involved in nightlife in London for a long time now. Do you feel hopeful for the future of London's nightlife? We're here in 2014 and obviously there are many challenges associated with putting on events and such. Do you look to the future in a hopeful way? I think people will always want to go out and dance. party and so far people haven't been able to stop them and I think it'd be a very sad day if London didn't retain that and I think as long as you've got people who want to put parties on and who want to put events on and who want to go that extra mile to put decent things on, then yeah, London's always going to have its own scene. And I think even if clubs do still close down, I think you'll always get people putting on parties. And I think that might happen even further outside of the centre. And it might happen in Tottenham, or it might happen even further out towards the south. I think people are always going to want to go out and party. So hopefully it's not going to go anywhere. I think when I look back and think to when I first came to London in 96, there was a lot more things going on. But I think also there was a lot less things going on in a way as well. So there might have been a lot more. club nights going on and a lot more I suppose parties going on but then there was a lot less other sort of cultural things going on in London and I think we've got more sort of mini festivals now we've got more I suppose pop-up spaces to go to and I think things just change and you can always hop back and say oh it was better then and it was better in like when I came everyone was going oh it was loads better in 1988 and you should have been here in 89 and Do you know what I mean? That's always going to be the case. And I think when we look forward, we should just think, well, it's not going to be the same. It's going to be different. But that doesn't mean it's not going to be good. Thank you. You really don't have to do that. You really don't have to do that. You really don't have to do that. Suck.
