Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. Nick Fanciulli is part of a generation of DJs who got their break by handing a demo tape to a club owner. But Fanciulli's rise to become an internationally respected DJ and producer really stands out when you consider that the club in question wasn't in... dance music hub like London or Berlin, but in Maidstone, a small town in the southeast of England. As a resident at Club Class, Fanciulli played with some of the best DJs in the world, and he formed studio partnerships with guys like Andrew Chatterley that would go on to define his production career. In fact, collaboration has been a recurring feature in Fanciulli's success. He started to save records with his brother Mark, and together they've overseen a prolific 10 years that's featured releases from the likes of Mark Broom, DJ Rolando, and Andrea Oliva. There was One on One, the popular DJ partnership he formed with James Zabela that toured the world. He spent time in the studio with guys like Steve Mack, Stacey Pullen, and Gary Beck. And most recently, hooked up with Joris Vaughan to start La Famiglia, with the pair playing and programming a string of dates at Ashwaya and Ibiza. But whatever Fanciulli has achieved over the years, all roads lead back to Maidstone. Fanciulli still lives in the town, and when we sat down to chat in London recently, he told me about The Social, a boutique festival he runs annually in Maidstone, with the aim of bringing world-class music to the town. For anybody who's been following your career down the years, Maidstone, the town you grew up in, has kind of become synonymous with your name, particularly the party club class. Now, I've never been to Maidstone. My kind of impression of it is it's a sort of small to mid-sized town of about, I don't know, like 100,000 people down in Kent. So what I really want to ask you firstly is how the town of Maidstone and kind of became a hotspot for dance music. Like what's the story there? - Well, I think it's more about the county Kent, you know, Maidstone's in Kent and a lot of the early day raves, the M25 raves were outside, were in Kent. You had things like World Dance down there, Lidwater Sports and around Maidstone, actually in the center. We had a really big drum and bass scene with a night called Pure Science, which was, I think before Fabric It was the longest weekly drum and bass night outside of London or inside. There was some statistic. There was a really good drum and bass scene in Maidstone and in Kent. And then Club Class started, which was started by two people called Greg and Serge. I think it was started originally in Brighton and then eventually ended up in Maidstone at a club called Atomics. It's where I sort of cut my teeth into dancing. music, going to listen to people like Jim Masters, Shades of Rhythm, Cole Cox, Sasha and Digweed. And for me, growing up in Maidstone, it was a bit like... If you're a Chelsea fan and you want to play for Chelsea, this is my home club, I want to play for this club. So I used to drop mixtapes in to Serge the promoter and basically just push him to say, I really want to play for you, I really want to play for you. And one time he was trying to get a hold of me, but where I was giving the mixtapes in so quickly, I wasn't writing information on the mixtapes. So he said when he finally got hold of me, he was spending three or four weeks trying to find out how it was, asking other people in the club, have you seen Nick, do you know who he is, he's this guy that's giving me tapes. And eventually we caught up and the relationship happened with club class and myself. Who were some of the early people that you would see there? Sasha and Digweed, Cole Cox, Shades of Rhythm, and then a lot of UK DJs like Jeremy Healy and Alistair Whitehead. Graham Park used to bring the Hacienda Night down there as well. So a real variation of music. And I think that's what... inspired me you know one week it would be trance one week it would be techno one week it'd be the early days of deep house when it was actually you know very deep and yeah and that's there was a lot of inspiration and also I used to go to the drum and bass night quite a lot I was a big fan of like LTJ Bookham DJ Zink so I had a real wide spectrum of you know electronic music coming through the town and I got to listen to it. How easy was it to get a crowd in a sort of smallish town like Maidstone excited about the music that you were talking about? Did it all go across well? Were all the parties well attended? I think... back to the stage where less is more there was there was less nights doing these sort of things where now you can go to every corner every pub and they're playing dance music at that time pubs were pubs and you know you used to drink to 11 and then you went to a night club from 11 to 3 nowadays you go into a zzz's or a pizza express and they've got a dj in it you know so it was a destination and and atomics was a huge warehouse it was raw as you like and it had a great sound system and a great lighting system for the late 90s. It was perfect to go and see your favourite acts and I think that's what it was. There wasn't that many things going on and I think that's what drew the people to go and see it and it wasn't very overground at the time. It was still very underground. It was still very, you know, you go to Atomics and... And it'd be the case of, you know, it wasn't overground music. It was very niche at the time. So thinking about those early mixtapes that you were dropping into the club, were there particularly DJs that you feel that you were taking cues from? Like, where would you kind of place the style that you were sort of operating within? Well, I grew up into indie music and bands like the Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, Charlatans. And then it wasn't until like 95 where one of my friend's brothers played us an Underworld album and then it went to Chemical Brothers. So it was a transition between indie to electronic music, but gradually not straight into the DJ world. And I was playing drums in a band at the time, just when I was leaving school. And I was like... electronic music's okay, you know, and then I started listening to Underworld and I was like, I understand it, there's a reference between indie and dance and then I started listening to people like Francois Kay and Laurent Garnier and the spectrum of music they was playing, it was so wide, I loved it, you know. And then a DJ that really hit home with me was someone called Lee Burridge. It was when I was record shopping at the time. I was shopping in Maidstone and then I felt I needed to go to London to find better records and more upfront stuff. Because by the time the records got to Kent, most of the London shops had taken them. And Lee had just come back from Hong Kong and he was brought back, I think at the time, by Craig Richards to start this new night called Tyrant. And Lee was selling me records and we had a really good relationship. You know, we were hanging out. I used to drive to shows in Nottingham and he was the one that I think I really developed the sound that I wanted to be. Was that when it was at the bomb? At the bombing Nottingham, yeah. So we used to spend countless nights with him. And it's such a great story because he went off. touring he was a huge DJ at the time I didn't see him for like months on end and I remember like five years later I think we both ended up in Chicago and I was warming up for him the thing with Lee I loved his personality his passion his happiness he wasn't afraid to drop certain records you worked at a record shop yourself for a while is that right? Yeah, I worked in, originally one was called Tart Records, which was run by one of the influences for me in Maidstone, a DJ called Rob Cockerton, who really used to inspire me, you know, the local hero, you know, he was Garth, you know, he never broke into really into the international scene, but he was one of the most solid DJs I'd ever seen. And I used to work in his record shop part time. And then eventually, when I got made redundant from my insurance job, which was sort of like a saving grace, really, I went to work for Eddie Locke and Owen Ingram at Plastic Surgery, which at the time was a call cut shop, which was, you know, you mean you got really good records at the time. And, and yeah, and it was, it was. great year and a half two years spending all my wages on on vinyl do you at all miss that kind of sense of community in the sense of like having a meeting place for like-minded people that the sort of record shop sort of you know entailed i think you sort of cut your teeth with record shopping i think there's a bit of the romance has been lost now by sitting in your bedroom and clicking on a link. You know, it's the way we've gone forward. You know, you can't change that. But there was something about sitting in a record shop and the shop owner knew exactly what to put on at the time and everyone was on the counters and as soon as they heard it, they'd put their hands up and say, I want a copy of that, I want a copy of that. And you'd sit there with a coffee for hours on end with a stack of records. And it used to be my, you know, that was my Saturday afternoon for five, six years. That was what I was doing all the time. And it's something that I look back on. I'm glad that I experienced that where some of the newer generation might not experience that because there's less record shops and less people to push you in that direction. Were the record shops in Maidstone until quite recently? Or when did these stores end up? closing down i'd say i left 2003 i'd say that they probably went to about 2006 2007 it's almost crazy to think that you know record shops multiple record shops could exist in a town the size of maidstone yeah we had three at the time three that just shows you the power of electronic music in in in the late 90s and the early 2000s that uh I remember really clearly, I remember it was a record, it was the Stardust record had just come out and we must have sold 250 records in one afternoon. You know, I just remember that record being sold and so people were just queuing out the door for that one record. It was such a buzz, you know, that feeling that, you know, that people are really into the music, really inspiring. And there was less genres then, you know, on the wall we would have techno, drum and bass and house and that would be it. And people would intermingle between them. They wouldn't, you know, they wouldn't care. You know, it was a really, really inspiring and good time. I wanted to go back to this mixtape. or a series of mixtapes that you handed to Serge. Do you remember much about them? I remember just they were so varied. So I would do one like I'd do a warm-up one and then I'd do a middle set one and then I'd do a late night one and I'd give him so many different variations because I didn't care what time I played, I just wanted to play. Actually, Serge has found a few of the old tapes which he's converted onto CD. really fast really fast back then do you think most people were playing a bit faster back then it's funny because i found a lee burridge tape and it must have been like 133 134 bpm and things have slowed down now a lot more yeah it's funny because it's almost like the tone of the tracks themselves is roughly the same it's just five to ten bpm faster yeah and and that's what that was how you played at that time that was that was the style and uh And then you develop, you get older, you slow things down. Yeah, sure. Tell me about the first couple of years of your residency. Were you kind of playing weekly, but sort of very regularly for club class? Like how did you think you sort of developed as a DJ? So originally when we were at Atomics, I was playing once a month. So, you know, because there was four or five residents in the town, so everyone had their warm-up slot. So there was like four, five weeks. And it would vary. Like one month I'd play with Sacha and Digweed. One month I'd play with Andy Weatherall. One month I'd play with Jeremy Healy. You know, it was so varied. Then when the venue got bought and turned into apartments, as all good clubs, it seems to happen. And we moved to another club called Icon, which was next door. that's when I became more involved. A lot of the residents had moved on or left and I was pretty much playing every week. So I think that's where I developed one week I'd be warming up, one week I'd be playing in the middle or one week I'd be playing at the end. Because it was back in the sort of early 2000s where a lot of the DJs would double up or triple up in the UK. So they'd come to Maidstone, they'd go to London, then they'd go to Birmingham. So the main guests would do the warm-up. And then I think that's where... I adapted as a DJ for different situations and sort of did my apprenticeship in the club. I guess that was fairly common at the time, wasn't it? For guests or headlining DJs to zip around the country, maybe playing three gigs in an evening. Yeah, I used to go with Lee. I remember he used to start in London, then go to Nottingham, and then we'd end up at The Void in Stoke. And yeah, it was really common. Were you playing elsewhere off the back of this residency? Did you manage to get other gigs in the UK? I was playing, obviously, in Kent, other places. At the time, bar culture was really kicking off. You know, it was like I was saying earlier that pubs used to stop at 11 and used to go to the nightclub. But the time that I started with club class, when I was playing a lot more, bars had become clubs in a sense, you know, so was a bit of a flaw for me because I was going to play in these bars wanting to play music that I was playing in the clubs but people weren't feeling it and I felt that was quite it really sort of threw me for a while really how I was playing, how I was doing things. Then Danny Newman from Terminals at the time, he said to me, he goes, look, we really like what you're doing in Maidstone. Would you like to come and do something in T2, which was the back room of Terminals, which was... amazing and we're coming up with names and we came up with this this sort of tongue-in-cheek name Fandango and it was great it was I used to have people like Loco Dice play for me Timo Maas, Paul Walford, Yusuf, Express 2 and they would come and play in this room that I don't know if you've ever been there it must have held 150 people it was tiny it was really tiny but there was something about that room that I loved. I loved the intimacy. I loved that, you know, there was a regular crowd that came in to see us every month and Danny put his neck on the line for us and it was a great residency. It lasted, I think, two years and then I think, yeah, we moved on to other things. It's probably important to note as well that you got into the label management, label ownership game pretty quickly and you also released your... first music in like 2000 was it? Yeah. Porn records. Yeah. Yeah. So basically Rob Cockerton, obviously the guy from Maidstone who was a big influence on me, said, look, we need to start making some music. And I was like, really? And I did IT engineering at school, at college when I left. So I knew a bit about computers and stuff. And there was a guy called Andy Chatterley. I went with Rob because it was quite expensive to go and use a studio. So me, Rob and my best friend, Matt Blewett, we went up and... we made a couple of records together and then Matt and me went, kept going back and we had this, um, partnership called fan Julie and blew it. And we did this record called dockside, which, um, It sort of wasn't a hit, but it crossed over in the progressive scene. You know, people like Sasha and Digweed were playing it. And I was like, how are we going to release it? And Matt was like, let's start our own label. Let's start a record. And so we called it Portent Records. None of us knew what we were doing at the time. We didn't know we were doing P&D deals. We didn't even know what that was. We just didn't have a clue And it lasted for a few years until we realized we didn't really know what we were doing on that side of it. And yeah, it was fun. It was interesting that even probably at that time where this sort of idea of the DJ producer maybe was less formed, you know, someone was saying to you, we need to start making music now. Was it kind of important that you had that push? I think, yeah. If it wasn't for Rob, then I don't think at the time I would be where I am now with the music side of things. I didn't think it was important because when I went to see DJs play... It wasn't that I wanted to be the person standing there. I wanted to be able to make people feel what I was feeling. So it was never like I wanted to be a touring DJ or a superstar DJ or anything like that. All I wanted to do was play at after parties or at house parties with my friends and have that feeling that we're really enjoying ourselves. And that was the main reason why I wanted to become a DJ. The music side, I was never really that interested in doing. I never felt that it was a Because... But when I saw Rocky and Diesel play, I never knew they were Express 2 at the time. Do you see what I mean? So I never thought that they were putting records out. So I didn't really feel it was necessary. But I ended up doing it. I got the bug for it. I ended up loving making music and still do now. Did that sort of click into place quite quickly for you? Was it like a love at first sight kind of thing? I just remember walking into Andy's studio when I didn't know And just, you know, it was just like all these machines and these lights and these sequences and just being able to make something and walking away with something that you created. I think that's what was really amazing. and going home and playing it to my mum. And my mum was like, yeah, it's okay. I was like, yeah, it's a new record I'm going to play this weekend. And the bit I used to love is the fact that I'd go and get an acetate cut and play it out that weekend. You know, go to Heathman's or Music House and stand in the queue with your dad and wait for it to get cut onto an acetate. So you wound up working with Andy for... for many years. In terms of the kind of working dynamic between you, was it one of those classic cases where he was maybe more on the engineering and technical side and you were ideas? 100%. I'm never going to hide the fact that he was so talented in the studio and I learnt everything I do now from him. from Andy, you know, from now being able to work on the road with a laptop. You know, he was the guy that told me frequencies. He's the guy that told me how to roll the bass off a kick and things like that. And he was a musician. You know, he wasn't a DJ. So that's how it worked really well with the Skylark and the Buick project stuff. I'd walk in, I'd be like... we need to create something new and we used to do a lot of sampling together so I'd bring all my record collection up we would sample a lot of the drums and then Andy would bring the musical element to it and it was a great partnership because Andy never really wanted to DJ Andy just wanted to just create music yeah I mean was that the case for you know on a sort of ongoing basis as he was more happy to be like a little bit more in the background he was Really into bands. So that's why we ended up taking another project that we had, the Buick project, which was a bit more electronic. We remixed bands like T. Schwartz and Timo Maas and Tracy Thorne and things like that. And we developed that into a band. So we did three or four live shows with it. It didn't last very long because what I found is when we had to... try and get the gigs i used to have to dj off the back of it so i'd have to sort of get the dj gig so i'd play and say to the promoter look can we do the show as a band and yeah and it run its course you know me and andy had i think 10 great years working together And then we just went in different directions. There was no fallout. There was nothing like that. You know, we're still in touch now. We haven't really seen each other as much because we're doing different things. But, you know, like I said, he was definitely the catalyst for me making music and enjoying making music. I mean, did that form kind of an idea in your mind of what it meant to be in the studio? just in that you know you've obviously gone on to collaborate with lots of people and usually in duos did that kind of you know solidify how it would work for you i mean is that the sort of thing that you kind of naturally gravitated towards like forming these partnerships and those types of arrangements i think so you know from the dj perspective the partnership thing came through i grew up playing at house parties with my friends djing with my friends so i was always used to playing with back to back with someone or playing at a house party or playing at a club. So when I started going solo, I found it a bit lonely. I found it sometimes I was traveling on my own. And that goes, you know, the project I did with James Abila. For me, that was so much fun because I had like one of my best friends with me on the road. And it felt like I did when I first started. And that was one of the reasons why I did it. Same to a certain extent in the studio as well. You know, I do love working with other people because I have got a short attention span and I do like to bounce ideas off other people. So, and it works really well in the studio for me. Just to backtrack. very slightly, I think from a personal perspective. I started hearing your name or seeing your name in Mixmag and like, you know, radio DJs like Pete Tong mentioning you. So I wondered in your kind of evolution and kind of getting your name out there, was there like a turning point? Was there like a particular record or a particular gig? Like, how did you kind of have that breakthrough? I think there was a couple of things. Gavin Hurley was working. at Mixamag in early 2000. and Pete Tong is obviously, he was a Kent boy, you know, he's from Gravesend, and he was playing the club quite a lot. And at the same time, I did a remix, a Skylark remix of Dancing in the Dark, Fortune 500, which went on to be an Essential New Tune, which at the time, Essential New Tune was quite a big thing, because it was, you know, Radio 1, you know, this is the hottest dance record of the week. And it went in Pete got me on the show. I did an essential mix. Gavin did an article on me, a mix mag at the time. And it sort of snowballed from there, really. And I got a lot of support from everyone, from Steve Lawler, Express 2, even the way through to Fergie at the time, who had a radio show. And that was the catalyst for traveling. I ended up finally getting a DJ agency, which at the time was like what you needed to travel or to DJ because you could never do it on your own. You know, you needed to be on a DJ agency. And I remember at the time it was an agency called Type and they took me on. It was Seb Fontaine's old agency. I think Craig Richards was on it at the time when it first started. And then it just went on from there and on to... to Dovefire when he was in Deep Dish, taking me on to Bullet. And it was all from that one moment where I made the remix, had the Mixmag article, and then the Essential Mix. I wanted to talk a bit about the sort of middle of that decade because I sort of look back on it as being quite an interesting time. There's just lots of the DJs you were mentioning, people like Steve Lawler, James Beeler, Yousef. and some of these big UK guys. Because I assume by the middle of the decade you were playing in Ibiza a lot and places like that. And then, you know, gradually this wave of German music's coming through and things like electro house and then eventually minimal. So I was interested to kind of know how, as like a DJ and a producer, you sort of, you know, responded to that. You know, how did you interpret these things coming through? Did you like assimilate lots of the sounds? Like, you know, the landscape like really shifted around the middle of the decade. I think for me the big moment was when I joined Bullet with Deep Dish and I was touring. A lot of the UK DJs were doing like double ups and triple ups in the UK. And luckily Ali and Sharam took me out of the UK to travel the States. So in my early days I was traveling around the world a lot where a lot of the UK DJs were based in the UK. So I was playing Italy, Spain and South America, North America and a lot of the UK DJs weren't getting out of So I got a lot of experience and a lot of knowledge for the music, what was going on around the world. So it wasn't just the UK scene that was in my head. I saw what was going on in Germany. I saw what was going on. But that period you were talking about, the minimal stage, I think that was, for me, the lost stage in my career. The stage in my career where I didn't know what was going on. I didn't really know how to... to replicate what was going on at that time so I stuck to what I was doing and I was playing quite housey at the time and it wasn't the fashionable sound it wasn't a sound that people really were into they were into like you're saying the minimal stuff I remember Guido Snyder at the time being like a real superstar and and in in that scene and and and I never really tried to emulate it I never tried to copy it I just carried on doing what I was doing because There was no point. There was no point in trying to be that sound because that German sound had it covered. You know, there was no, you know, I didn't want to try and replicate something and someone go, well, he just sounds like a bad version of that. So, yeah. Yeah, I mean, that must be, it must be a difficult decision for any artist sort of facing up to, you know, a reality where if you're going to stick to your... guns you know you have the sense that maybe the style of music that you're pushing might not come back around for a few years I know and it's but the the thing is it's like I say it's rather just get on with what you're doing if it doesn't work out it doesn't work out if it comes back around and luckily for me you know music evolves quickly and it and it and it carries on and it's always if you've got it's hard to explain, but if you, if you really believe in what you're doing, I think that it works out for you in the end. I think that hopefully, you know, I love this, I love this music scene. I love the scene. I love everything about it. And I love the fact that you can reinvent yourself as much as you, as much as you want. I mean, were you personally interested in like the German minimal and, you know, sounds of that ilk that were coming through? Were you certain artists like Gabriel Nando that I'd pull out and like I said Guido Snyder and a few other guys a lot of it I found very linear at the time I didn't you know I come from the disco background from listening to disco funk records and real groovy records so there was not too much of that in the record at the time and not a lot of soul it was uh it was a part of the scene that i was a little bit lost with i didn't really know what was going on at the time but london was loving it london was swallowing it up and and and really enjoying that sound and like i said i wasn't really based in the uk at the time i was traveling a lot around europe and with deep dish so i was i was doing my own thing did it impact on your gigs and stuff like that was it did around that time. Yeah, definitely. It was crazy because you wouldn't get a lot of German DJs in the UK and then all of a sudden you would have the floodgates opened and you would have Italians and Germans and Spanish people coming and playing. And you were pushed to the back of the queue, but there's no point in being bitter about it or being, it was just the way, it's what people wanted. So you can't dictate what happens in music. I guess it was sort of around this time and in this climate that you started Saved, which was your next label venture. Your brother Mark, he was involved from the start. Is that right? Well, Mark went to university in 2004 or 2005 to study music engineering. So he had an input into it, but it was me and Andy that run the business and the music side of it. When he left university and me and Andy separated, working together with the label and with the production side, Mark came in and pretty much... help me get it back to where I wanted it to be. Because when the label started, it was an outlet for our music, like Skylark and Buick project. So we put our first record out, Chancer, and it had a great response. We sold a lot of units of it. And then we're like, what's next? So we had to make another record. for the label and then what happened was people started getting into the label and bands like audio fly paul wolford james talk was sending us demos at the time and i was playing these at my gigs and i was like i really want to release this music it's incredible So then we shifted the playing field a bit and we started releasing other people's music. Then One Plus One came along, which was a tour that me and James Abila did where we travelled around the world and played back to back for about eight months. And I took my foot off the gas with the label. And I remember coming back off that tour and we weren't, there was no love for the label. There was no records being sold. You know, the release schedule was all over the shop. And I was like... this is something that we need to fix. You know, you need to, for people to buy into a label, they need to know how much you love that label and how much you care about that label. That's when I got Mark involved and Mark and me and Mark, you know, I owe a lot to Mark on this one. He turned it around. He really helped me turn that label around to something that we believed in. Like we would, we were never a techno label. We were never a house label. We were never a deep house label. We were just a label, an outlet of music that I wanted to put out. And I had to have to play the record to put it out. I wouldn't put a record you know we started doing parties together we're having a lot of fun and now it's that period has paid off to where we are now you know we've got to 110 releases I think now 114 and it's so much fun it's like it's my labour of love you know there's never been a lot of money in a record label as people know it was just more of like an achievement sure was that more of like a shift in the anr policy would you say when you sort of rebooted the label because obviously there was like a influx of producers from you know different european countries and stuff like that i think that there was just a lot more care and attention right i think that from the ground up from everything from the artwork to how we did the releases how we had the programming to the mastering we found this great mastering company in Germany called Time Tools and we haven't stopped using them since. I think Martin Butchers used to be there originally and you know we've got these great partnerships and we haven't left them since that moment because we wanted to still create. Obviously we've had different distributors because sadly vinyl distribution prices shut down over the time you know over the last 10 years they've been shutting down so we're in a good place now. Would you say it's more difficult these days to run a label? I think that the access to run a label is a lot easier with the digital side. You know, we started with just vinyl only. When the label first started, it was vinyl only. And then obviously with the shift in the way people bought electronic music, we had to do the download thing. We had to do this. I think now it's a lot easier to set up, but I do think that people buy into labels that they see that have care and attention. I really do believe in that. Some of my favourite labels that I buy in, I know that they've got a good team of people working behind it. The record they put out is quality. The music they put out is quality. There's a story behind it. Yeah, I think it's really important to do that. How important has nurturing and discovering new talent been for the label down because everyone can put out a big record and it's nice to have a big artist on your label obviously because it helps people come to your label but we've had people like Paul Walford, Audiofly in the early days, Subban who's gone on to do great things now. When it comes along, it's great. You know, it's great because they're new, they're green, they don't know what's going on. They're like, they've got this record, I really want to put it out on saved. And it's nice because they want to put it out on your label. You know, a lot of the time it's hard to tell people that. it's a good record you've got to be constructive but it's not right for the label you know and I don't want to because I've done it I've given I've done a track and I finished it this year again this would be perfect for such and such and they turn around and go no and you're like oh okay but it you know if you do it in a constructive way because you've got to tell the reasons why you don't want to sign the record because you don't think it fits or you're not going to play it but please keep sending me more music because there'll be that one record that really fits what we do yeah for sure are you in a position where you're able to you know sift through demos and these sorts of things like have feedback with artists like what's the sort of um that was the thing with mark yeah mark was obviously i was I used to play them or not play them. We used to have a meeting on a Monday or Tuesday, go for the demos and reply to everyone. It's difficult. We get less records now, which is nice. But for more people that we've got contact with or we know about or we've got our radar on, it makes things a lot easier. But yeah, we try and we try to be as constructive as possible when we don't take a record on. I wanted to ask a little bit about some of the collaborations that have wound up on the label. You mean you've ended up working with some really notable US producers. I just really wanted to ask, how do these things usually end up coming to fruition? Is it something that's based on a personal relationship? Do you just respect their music and pitch a collaboration? What's usually the case? DJs and producers are so temperamental in general. So if you've got a plan, it's never going to go that way. Well, you know, it's part of the reason I ask because, you know, there is quite a long list and it's an impressive list. It's on personal relationship. It's all about the personal relationship and the mutual respect for each other. And I think that's the case for me. It's the record that me and Yoris did. You know, we were friends for three or I know that if we weren't, we didn't have that mutual respect for each other or we didn't have that friendship, I don't think that record would have been made. But then there's also certain situations where you are really close with someone and you never get the record done. So it can go both ways. But I love collaborating. I love the input from two different people to create something. And I think the people that buy the record can hear your sound and their sound. That's the important part of it. And it's down to personal relationships, I think, because there's so many people that I've wanted to work with that I know that's never going to happen because we're not in the same circles or we're not in the same in not. Sometimes it's what you want to work with people that are slightly off the beaten track. I remember trying to get Beth Gibbons from Portishead to do a vocal for me, and I think I was reaching out too far for that one. You know, I was like sending a demo, send a demos and there was never a response. So, but you know, if you don't try, you never know what's going to happen. Yeah, you've got to aim for it. Yeah. So I guess you would class Uris as your maybe closest collaborator these days. I mean, you guys are DJing a lot together and you had like a first Ibiza stint last year. Yeah, he's someone actually, obviously, I think I knew about him before He did this incredible album on Green. I think it was like 2006. And it was just one of the best albums I'd ever heard. My friend Ramone in Miami gave it to me. And I would listen to every single track. I was playing every single track. And I was like, this guy's got to do a remix for Saved. I want him on Saved. So he did a remix for my first album with Skylark. And he sent it to me and I was like, wow, this is unbelievable. And then we were on tour in Australia together and I was like, I'm in Sydney. He's like, I'm in Sydney. So... Went and had a drink together, hung out, had a lot of musical, you know, we met in the middle. We had a lot of similarities with what we liked. Yeah, and he's, you know, he's a top guy. You know, he hasn't got an ego. He's just a chilled out guy and he's super nice. And that was how we've created the friendship. You know, we've got similarities now. You know, we've both got a kid and we're both on the same sort and that's what came to do La Familia. We were like, let's just do this. Let's have fun. It's less pressure with two of you as well. It's always nice to have someone who's got your back. And he plays amazing music. Yeah, I guess over the years, if you sort of chart your respective arcs, you know, when I first was getting into him, he was maybe playing more techno. And like I knew you as a house guy was like, maybe he slowed down and come more towards house. You become maybe a little bit more techno. And it's funny because someone was saying that the other day. They were like, you always play house in my head. I think he plays techno. Yeah, because I still have But like you think, things change and people, you know, he's done that for the first 10 years of his career while I was doing something else for the first 10 years of my career. Now, musically, maybe I want to do something different. But when we play together, we meet in the middle, which I really love. You know, he plays certain records. I'm like, what is that? And vice versa. But yeah, in my head, I still think he's a techno DJ. So you did the string of dates, Oshawa and Ibiza. How did that go? Really well, really well. We felt, you know, Oshawa gets a lot of flack for being a commercial club as such. But for me, it's just an outdoor venue. I don't look at it as a commercial club. because you walk into that club, you play the music, you're dictating to the crowd, then you can do what you want there. So for us it was nice, because we didn't have a lot of underground or whatever you want to call it, house nights there. It was a lot of it was more EDM or commercial music. So this is even less so this year, wasn't it? Yeah, because a couple of the DJs left their nights there, and the only other one was Ants, I think, were both resident fans at the time and I remember doing the first one for them when they started last not the season just gone the season before and at the end of the season me and Joris did a couple together and Jan the owner was like We need to do more of these. And I said, you know, it'd be great, Jan, if we could start something on our own, you know, something separate to Ants and do our own thing. So we went away, came up with a concept, La Familia, because we felt it was very much what we were about, you know, bringing people together, having fun. The DJs that we'd invite were friends, you know. It was about creating that vibe. And he was like, yeah, let's do eight shows next year. And it went really well. And we had a lot of fun. And we're just deciding what we're going to do this summer. We haven't got any plans yet. We're sort of weighing up what we should do. And it was great. You know, actually, for me, it felt, I've been going to Ibiza since 96 as a punter. You know, I remember going to one of them Club 1830s holidays with my friends And I've always said when I played, I'd love to end up having a night in Ibiza. Yeah, it was sort of a dream come true for me really last year. It was, you know, it was really risky because things fail so quickly in Ibiza. You know, you really got to, it's not just about the music. It's not about the DJ. It's about everything. It's about the promotion, about who's doing what. And it's a real team effort. It's not just a people because that's they all deserve credit because it's not just me and you're standing up there you know it's everything from the the kids on the beach giving the flyers out to the bar staff to people you know running around helping out and uh yeah and i guess as well you're operating in what's a more saturated marketplace than it's ever been you know like thinking about the late 90s the time you were you mentioned and you had like one party per night pretty much and now it's probably three or four options per day that's the thing i remember i had my schedule planned when i used to go to ibiza when i was sort of 17 18 and i used to know what was on a thursday what was on a wednesday renaissance was a passion on a friday you know i had all these things planned in my head who i wanted to go and see what djs now you land and there's there is five or six good parties on that you want to go Do you still feel like it's important for you as an artist to maintain a presence in Ibiza and do you see that being the case for years to come? I think with Ibiza you get two sides to it. You get, oh, it's just a commercial island, it's this, it's that, it's that. But the reason why I love it is because I have a lot of fun when I play there. I really generally enjoy playing there. I was resident for Cole Cox at Space on Tuesdays and I just getting on the plane, I'd be smiling. I'd be like, that was incredible. I generally had a great night. I'm not doing it because it's Ibiza or because it's going to help prolong my career for the next five years. I'm doing it because I love doing it. And the same with La Familia. It was just so much fun. It inspires you. It makes you think, you know what, next gig's going to be even better. The gig after's going to be even better. You go to the studio, you write something you're really inspired by. And it's just, it's a catalyst for me. Yeah, I see. I wanted to talk to you a little bit about mixed CDs. You've released a fair few over the years for some really notable brands like Global Underground. affected most recently balance in the past this was kind of a topic of conversation for us on ra last year we were felt like we were discussing on a number of occasions like the ongoing like viability of the format you know someone who thinks obviously a lot about these projects and takes a lot of time over these projects and has been like very active in this particular format where do you see like the future of the mix cd Do you think it's something that's going to be around for a few more years? It's hard because when I was growing up at the time, Global Underground was for me the mecca of where I wanted to be on a mix CD. If I knew if I did a Global Underground CD at the time, people would listen to it. people would want to hear it. So for me, I hold it in such high regard, the mix CD. For me, it takes six to eight months to do a mix CD because I'm so nervous, so I need it to be exactly right. Unfortunately now, with podcasts and with mixes being given away on SoundCloud so easily, and my mix is illegally sometimes recorded and also given away, it's quite hard for it to stand for value. But what I will say is, when I did the last Defected in the House CD, I felt that at the time, when you're spending six months on a project, It's like doing an album project. So really, the care and attention, it's down to the care and attention, how much you spend doing the album. So for me, I think there's value in it because I've really sat there and worked this mix, you know, and edited it and done certain things to it. But maybe I could have probably done a mix from a club and it might have got more respect from the kids. It's on a free podcast. I don't know. It's a grey area for me For me, I'll keep doing them. Yeah, sure. Because I'm passionate about them. I love doing them. You know, it causes me a lot of stress because I'm really worried and thinking about it. But at the same time, it's what I grew up on. It's something that I'd like to keep doing. Yeah, I mean, you actually frame that in a way that I was going to ask you because you released an album as Skylark in like 2007. But, you know, you haven't Has the mix CD ended up performing this function for you in a way? 100%. If you ask me a question, would you say you're a DJ or a producer? I'd say DJ. That's what I am. I love DJing. I love traveling. But I also do like the element of making music as well. I love creating something. But I felt that the mix CD was my artist album. That was what I was doing on a week to week basis. basses traveling playing you know certain records work really well together I'd remember them that's going on the mix CD that's what I'd want to put on there so people could remember the moments when they did come and see me play so yeah here's my artist album have you got quite a well-established process for putting them together now would you say I'd say that it's a format that I do of um of I have I have a little folder on my desktop And it's called Mix CD. And it's certain records that I know that I would want to put on a Mix CD if I eventually did one in a couple of years time. Oh, right. So you're keeping that going. I've never stopped. I've done it, started it since the first Renaissance album I did. And I just leave it there. And then when I come back to it, we come to the CD, there'll be 600 records collected over the two or three years. And then... the new selection of records, which are at the moment. So we'd end up with like maybe a thousand records in this, in this crate. And then it goes down and goes down and goes down and goes down and goes down until you've got the 60 tracks you want to put on the two CDs. What would you say is like the thread that connects those tracks? So there's certain qualities that you think, um, end up suiting. the vibe that you're going for? I've always had the same format with the CDs. The first CD is somewhere, is a CD that I want people to be able to listen to an after party or a barbecue or in the car, all them qualities I want in that CD. I want musicality. I want it to sound timeless, like long-term, you know, long-term CD or, sorry, I don't know what I'm going to say. I want to get the timeless. timeless feel to it so you're going to look back at the CD in 10 years time and think this still sounds good now like I do with a lot of the CDs I listen to like Danny Howe's Global Underground from Miami I listen to CD one all the time I'm like that sounds good now as it did back then the tyrant cd the first one you're like you know you wouldn't even know when that was made what era or what what year that was made in it was so good yeah i mean i guess by their very nature they're hanging around longer yeah and that was always the idea with cd1 and then cd2 i always wanted to try and transform what i do in the club onto the cd i've had that sort of perspective with cds till now to the latest one so um i want to talk a bit about the social which is a kind of venture you started in 2013 I have to say I was surprised when this was kind of announced because you know in the modern world of very busy traveling DJs and producers the idea of like starting a festival seems like madness in a way what kind of led to this decision for you basically you know I do a lot of stuff in Maidstone anyway it was saved I've done it for the last sort of five six years and it's I look at it as my home you know even though I don't actually live in Maidstone anymore I live on the outskirts I look at it as the place that gave me my chance to DJ you know it's the place that I love going back to and and playing and we had so many good guests play for us and we had this little tiny alleyway and it was basically we blocked the alleyway off and we'd have people like Cole Cox come and play Luciano Loco Dice Marco Car great guests and I felt that let's do something a little bit bigger let's do something a bit more more sort of festival style I wouldn't say it's a big you know it's a smaller festival I think the first year we had like five and a half thousand people But what I wanted to do was a location that actually when Radio 1 did One Big Weekend in 2007, the whole point of doing One Big Weekend was to go to not main cities, but smaller towns and try and leave a musical legacy, you know, try and leave something there. And we didn't do anything amazing after that. Radio 1 came, we had some great bands play and that was it. You know, it was, you know, back to bar culture and clubs and there was nothing really else going on. And Kent hasn't really got a big festival or an electronic festival. So I felt that 2003, I felt right. I've got a good team. I've got a partner called Luke who looks after the logistics, the security, the, you know, all the backend stuff that I didn't really know about. And then I looked after the musical side of it and it was a great, it's a great partnership. Also have another guy called Joe who's on board that takes care of all the promotion and looks after. So we had a really nice team and it felt right. So that's why we did it. So basically it was me cold calling my friends on the phone saying, can you come and play my festival? Which I feel bad about because it's... You know, you're going around the houses to try and get them, but at the same time you're sort of saying, look, it wasn't never in my head as a money-making scheme and we still haven't made a penny from it. It was more the case that I wanted to leave something in the town and do like a... festival you know because if you think of Maidstone you'd probably think of doing something very commercial in your head you know we'd have to do pop stuff and things like that but I didn't I went in the first year we went in we did Loco d'Ice Luciano Guy Gerber, Seth Troxler, you know, not household names in a rural town. Do you know what I mean? It was, to us, they are. You know, they're, you know, in our scene, they're gods, aren't they? And then on the Sunday, I was like, let's do something even different. Let's do something that really influenced me when I was younger. So I did Earth, Wind & Fire, Sister Sledge, Brand New Heavies. because I wanted to cater for the families on the Sunday because I had a kid and I wanted to do something for them. And we had this huge structure. So I thought, you know, we might as well use it. Let's not waste it. So yeah, the Saturday we had a rave and the Sunday we had a disco. Did it feel like it was kind of well-received? did you sort of achieve the aim you were going for? Yeah, 100%. You know, we had the council ring us up on Monday who said we had no problems, we're really happy. The police were like, we're really happy with what you did. So let's do year two. You know, we obviously, we lost a lot of money in the first year, but I felt, you know what, we knew this was going to be a long-term project. We knew that it was going to be something that's And then we did this year. We built another stage. We added another arena. We had other people join us this year like Nina Kravitz, Dixon, Arme, Teenie. And then we kept Seth and Guy because they were there at the start as well. So we felt that we needed that. And then we also added Carl Cox to it, which we knew would be a great, a big pull for us. The festival was amazing. Great. We had a really bad problem with the bars, which was a real thing. People were queuing for like 40 minutes to get a drink. And I was going around going, what's going on? Why aren't people getting served? They're angry. They're not happy. And the reason we did the festival was to try and fix all the things that I had been playing festivals in the past was to try and fix all the bad qualities of this festival. It then came out that Heineken gave us this equipment that was faulty. Luckily, we tried to, you know, we apologized to everyone. You know, it's not, you know, I didn't want it to happen. And we basically apologized to everyone. Heineken put out a statement and said, look, guys, it's our fault. It's not the social's fault. That kind of helped. But what we did in turn is that everyone bought a ticket. We offered them a ticket for £15 instead of £50. So I felt that we were trying to, you know, give back something and try and say sorry because I didn't want it to be like another festival that goes, well, it's tough luck, you didn't get a drink. You know, I wanted to try and say sorry. And Heineken worked with us on that. And now we've got year three coming up this year. For most people, or lots of people who come from small towns, like, you know, when they've reached the age of 18, they kind of just want to get the hell out of there and, you know, never think about it again. But it's interesting to me that you have retained such close ties with your hometown and, you know, really want to give something back in a way. Why do you think this has become so important to you? I never lived in a big city, really. I never lived in London. I never lived, you know, I never moved to a bigger city. I always stayed rural because I'm still friends with my school friends now. And it's a bit like James Abilo, actually. We had the same sort of thing where he still lives in Southampton. He's still got all his school friends around him. He loves doing parties in Southampton. You know, he And for me, it was the same case. It was family. You know, I had my family there. I had all my best friends there. And I just felt, and it was the town that gave me that break. It was the town that gave me that chance. And it's not like I'm trying to be like a local hero or something like that. I'm just saying I generally enjoy playing in my hometown. One, it's 10 minutes to my bed. as you get older and two that people really love it they really generally love it you know they were like people still now going oh we can't wait for the social this year and that gives me a sense of excitement it gives me that I really want to do it sod it if we lose another pile of money or whatever it doesn't really matter I'd like not to but at the same time and you know what seeing this year where we had It's nearly 8,500 people there for good music. That's what makes me really happy. It was really good. Everyone played amazing and I was just walking around smiling. The bar thing obviously threw me a bit, but the music and the atmosphere and all the DJs that played for me, you know, it was just amazing. So I'm still smiling now thinking about it and that's what puts me on to do it next year or this year. *music* so ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ you
