you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Sarah McBriar. She's the founder of Belfast's AVA Festival, which has quickly grown into one of Europe's smartest young events. She spent her 20s working behind the scenes at some of the UK's top festivals, before developing a business plan for an event of her own. Later this month, the festival will be celebrating its third edition and is adding a second day to its programme. So we invited McBriar to our London office to hear how she's made her ideas into reality. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Sarah McBriar is up next. *music* Hi Sarah, thanks for coming in. Thanks for having me. I guess we just start with an introduction, if you can just tell us what you do, who you are. My name's Sarah McBride, I'm from Belfast. I run AVA Festival and Conference, which happens once a year in Belfast on the Titanic docks, beginning in June. AVA is kind of one of the things you do. I mean, what percentage of your time is spent running a festival at this stage? Oh, like if there was more than 100% in a percentage, it would be more like 200, 300%. Yeah, I mean, we're now, like yesterday was a one month countdown. So it's like all encompassing AVA, every waking moment, every dream. Festival intense. It's quite funny when you get... to this like period it's always like kind of creeps into like your sleep pattern and all as well you know what it's like so I mean yeah where are we in the in the kind of in the process one month ago is the venue ready like well yeah we're kind of now at the like final final stage so it's all like down to you know planning as to the get in and The builds will happen really, the key big pieces will happen two weeks before and then we get on site the week before and then it's the build. So it's kind of really the final push in terms of our tickets and promoting all our content, our conference. There's like individual sign-ups for those specific sessions, so it's getting those out and really just promoting like all that the festival is because we've gone from one day to two days. So we're really just trying to get the message across of like how much extra there is now to do and that like it's really a whole weekend in Belfast and stuff. So yeah, there's that. And then there's the other side of actually just making it happen. So it's kind of like the final stages of the promotion and then the like on the grind, right, let's make this. How big is your festival team? The core team, the ones that like are working on it all the time. There's like four core. And then when it comes to live event, I mean, it's like if you include volunteers and I mean, if you even go as far as like security and medical and everyone else, I mean, it's like. 150 people probably. But like the core, yeah, I mean, Emmett, he looks after the conference. Michaela's in all like logistics, artist liaison. Nuala works on the creative and the social media and the marketing side. And then we do have then a number of other freelance people like Oisin who does all our visual content. And then we've got the design side. And we've got a couple of interns as well that sort of work on the sort of admin. And when it comes to the day, what are you doing? On the day, I really try and make sure that I'm not locked in to an area. I think that's quite like bad. I kind of really need to be sort of the oversight. When it gets to live event, it's very much people have their sort of specific roles and areas and I really try and stay above. I have a production, like an amazing production manager who works the three week period. So he's starting very soon and he kind of like takes a big chunk of the sort of management and the leadership bit so that I can kind of step back and not get too locked into an area because if you do that then... then you can't really keep the oversight. Is there any opportunity to block off a couple of two hours and go and enjoy a set? Yeah, I really do try. It was funny in the first year. I was really lucky. A good friend of mine just pulled me aside and just was like, just stop. Just don't do anything. I just want you to just stop and take this in. And I was like, wow. And like, it definitely was one of those moments where you just kind of like stopped and took in the atmosphere and the vibe. and felt like really proud and happy. And the same at the end of the first year, you could just like stand up on the stage and just kind of look at everything. And it was just, it was really cool. It's like the final piece, isn't it? It's like the, when it all comes together. I think that's one of the like mad things about running a festival because you put so much work into it before and then it's like such a short period of time and it's over. But then that it I mean people must think we're mad that we do this but we love it I guess it's a difficult question but how close to the kind of your what you imagine the festival to be like was it in reality year one was more and so was year two to be fair I think year one you just don't know what to expect so you just You don't really have like a fixed image in your head. I mean, you've got a kind of an image, but you're just probably a lot more open. Whereas year two, I suppose you've got year one in your head. But yeah, I mean, it was definitely, I think we took it like a knock. up and like the way that we've planned it this year is to take it a good notch up as well like we want everyone to come back and feel like wow this is like even better you know and and then there's this feeling you know that I have to you know they want to come back and be a part of it so yeah this year we're like doing quite a lot of like sort of additional sort of areas that people don't know about and adding like some really nice sort of creative areas and spaces and because it's gone to two days it's important to have those kind of chill areas and those kind of like hangout areas as well as like obviously the stages and the music and stuff and moving the conference to the Friday as well it's there's a lot more content a lot more going on in the conference which is really cool so it's really like a full weekend The conference has always kind of sat front and centre with this, you know, it's not an afterthought at all. Like, why was it important for you to offer something more than just a rave? I think for me, it was about like the development of talent. Like that's kind of really core. AVA and that's why it's kind of one of the reasons why it started as well like it was to create a fun creative festival that we didn't feel existed in Northern Ireland like going to lots of other amazing festivals in the UK and Europe. It was just like, why does something like this not exist back home? But also the talent that was coming out of Northern Ireland, we felt was really great. And we wanted to do something that platform that as well as kind of help develop it. And also the piece like AVA, which stands for Audiovisual Arts, it was meant to kind of focus as well is about sort of merging the visual art and creating collaborations. between artists and and that creating work so the conference side is a good way of like getting those topics out there and discussing them and looking them in a bit more depth the nerdy end which we're all nerds at heart as well so that was kind of cool and um yeah like having Jeff Mills doing his close encounters fourth time with William Marmon I'm just like so excited about and then asking him to talk and him being down with it I'm really excited to kind of get into his brain about like how he approaches those kind of collaborations because I think they're like it's not easy you know when you've got two artists who are coming from different sort of backgrounds and different kind of visions But then working together to create, I think, the really special stuff. How do you go about that? So I'm kind of really interested to find out how someone like Jeff does that with a lighting designer. Was the idea always to not just book Jeff to DJ? You wanted him to do something special? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we really wanted him to do something special. I actually went and met. His team and Jeff in Dublin in a show he did last year, he took his Philharmonic, his live orchestra piece to Dublin and it was like unbelievable. You know, one of those shows that you just got goosebumps. bumps all over and yeah it was great to be able to have the the opportunity to book something really unique and I think what he's doing just fits so well with what what we want and hope our programming it's sort of like the top top headliners to be able to do so it's great So why did you start the festival in the first place? Just really, there wasn't, I didn't feel like a festival, creative festival platform in electronic music. And I didn't think there was a platform for the existing talent either. There was big events that existed back home, but they were kind of more drink-led events. And so the focus wasn't on the artist or the sort of experience. It was more the sort of large scale two, three hour, but hopping sequentially. And so I had worked on Block Nine at Glastonbury and worked on MIF and worked on some other festivals that I just loved and obviously had been to ones as well and wanted to create something back home. I think also like the crowd in Belfast and the atmosphere. I mean, you know, from people who've already been, no, it's just like insane. So it was kind of like wanting to do something as well. And like Irish people definitely know how to party. and I think there's a really like kind of welcoming there's a really like friendly atmosphere and kind of anyone can come and get stuck in and like conferencing wise there wasn't anything really that sort of hit that nail on the head and we wanted to be able to do something as well to pull in the AV side and the digital art and And, you know, like a little bit of film, like we've got some music and film panel this year and sort of starting to pull together some of the other like strands. So that was the kind of feeling. And I think really the people who are involved were all from Belfast as well. So it just made sense. And then your first year, all the artists were Irish, is that right? Yes, all were basically Northern Irish, to be honest. Johnny of Optimo is Northern Irish Keith is Scottish so Keith was Scottish and John Dealey was from Galway I believe John's Galway or Wicklow so there was a few that weren't Northern Irish but yeah I mean it was kind of really like friends and family but let's pull it all together my dad was the driver was like cleaning the toilets. It was hilarious. I mean, they kind of still do that, which I think creates a nice vibe. Then, you know, we really wanted to broaden the booking to Southern Ireland as well. It was always the intention and bringing in big international guests, you know, like the likes of Jeff and stuff. So it's really cool that we're in a place in year three to be able to do that. Are you increasingly trying to attract a crowd from abroad, from the UK, from Europe? Yeah, like it's really good I think it's really good for like the city as well as like the people that are going people want to meet I think it's a really great opportunity to visit Belfast see a lot of the talent and like experience the city as well so yeah it's definitely something that we want to do you touched on Glastonbury there and I read that you kind of you went there when you were 18 and you know had a life-changing experience and so many of us do yeah I did yeah um you mentioned that that kind of cemented this desire to want to start a festival in your own yeah in your own city and so since then has that been your goal It was one of those where, I mean, anyone who's been to Glastonbury, it's just like a really special experience and like a really kind of like community experience. You go there and you meet so many people and you do so many different things and you see so many different things. and I think musically as well, being exposed to stuff maybe you wouldn't necessarily see and meeting people you wouldn't necessarily meet, and I think it's a really good thing for the industry and the scene and just your general experience in music, and again, that kind of thing didn't really exist. I didn't feel back home. So, yeah, there was a want to do it. And a lot of the artists are good friends of mine, to be honest. And I think there was a feeling amongst people that we wanted to have this. this kind of like platform really. And then in 2014, you get to then work at Glastonbury. Yes. At Block 9, no less. Yes. It's one of the most magical parts of the whole site. Yeah. What was that experience like? Incredible. Yeah. I mean, what they do, what Gideon and Steve and Paula do is just incredible. I think it's almost unbelievable, to be honest. Yeah, it's staggering. I mean, I was like a minute part of, you know, I was just assisting essentially. Their attention to detail is obviously why they're so successful. I mean, they're artists and they're right. And I think that's a really important part in comparison to different kinds of events. You know, they're creating essentially art and the detail down to how people. People arrive down to like the button in a lift in the London Underground. You know, that's the level of detail they go to. So, yeah, I think it was just also a massive eye opener really to the amount of work and, you know, the amount of integral pieces that you pull together. I think anyone that runs sort of festivals and large events and stuff, there's just... so much involved and I think yeah it was amazing. I mean have you ever run your own events before AVA? Yeah I mean I've worked on events I've never run specifically my own night I'd worked on sort of lots of events and that's kind of where my experience more came from this sort of running projects and and working on festivals. That's why, I mean, I worked with other people. There was other people involved in making Avia happen. It's not just me. So, like, it's kind of like a marriage of, like, lots of sort of people getting involved. So, yeah, you're someone who's had experience running all sorts of events. You've worked at Glastonbury Warehouse Project. You worked for Manchester City for a long time. Yeah, I did. That's cool. Were you running events there? Yeah, well, I ran a project there. I ran their tour project, actually, which was a project that I took on. I mean, my background is music, theater and arts as well as like business and management. So, yeah, I had a theater experience. I'd even been in like the National Theater. I got an opportunity to redo something and. I did and it was really fun and cool. But for me, my heart lay in music. So that's kind of why I didn't stay there. You're someone who had a lot of experience leading up to AVA. What kind of new and unexpected challenges did throwing your own festival that first year throw up? Well, it's quite scary. I suppose the good thing about... starting something from scratch is, you know, if it doesn't go well, then it doesn't go well and you move on. So I suppose, you know, it's scary, but at the same time, you just do. And, you know, as long as you've got great people involved and working alongside you, which I did, like this by no means is me on my own, then, you know, I think you just. hope that it'll turn out really well, which we were lucky it did. No, there's a lot of work in it, a lot of planning in it, obviously, so there's that. But yeah, I think there's, okay, there's a lot of risk, I suppose, as I said before, when you're planning something for so long and it is contingent on a small period of time, like it's quite high risk. I mean, again, anyone who runs events. and festivals. I mean, that's why I'm terrified of running something outside, to be honest. You know, I think running a field festival is just, you know, a whole ballgame. Well, AVA is very much a city festival and that's what we want it to be, you know. But organising festivals and fields, you know, like what happened to Secret Garden Party. Yeah, I was there that year. Yeah, I mean, it's just, I've been, you know, a good couple of years, amazing festival, but when it rains like that, it's just crazy. And actually, my friend lost my coat. We had obviously been partying and she had her backpack and she lost her backpack and my coat. And so woke up the next day with no coat and it was just pouring rain. But thankfully, my brother, he arrived that Sunday and brought me like a big, big bomber jacket. I was like, thank God. Because, yeah, it's cold. I've often thought that one of the most amazing things about Glastonbury is that they've managed to turn the bad weather festivities into part of it. Yeah, it's funny you say that because it very much is. That's true because I think if you have a bad weather in most places, it could probably put you off the following year. Whereas Glastonbury, you almost like it's part of the experience. It's part of like what you expect. You know, last year was, I probably had worse, but it was tough and it was fine. days and you know it's like a real i was there last year you know it's like it's like going on a big trek or something like the whole thing like it's not it's not what you'd class a kind of relaxing festival experience like it's by the end of it you come out it's like it's like an enriching experience and you've really put your body through something and you've really you know it's a yeah it's a totally unique thing yeah i spent a lot of my time in the beat hotel last year You do have to think tactically about it. How supportive has Belfast, the city, the council been? Yeah, really supportive. Really, really supportive. I think Belfast as a city was definitely ready for a festival like OVA. The council have been really supportive. They support our conference. And yeah, I think it's a city that's much further behind cities like London and Manchester and Leeds and Glasgow. In what sense? Licensing, regulation, restrictions, alcohol, approach. Sound restrictions, neighbours. Attitudes. Attitudes, yeah. Which is funny for people that are so warm and up for it. Oh, but that's because 90% of the people aren't those people that make those calls. Do you know what I mean? I think in the eyes of the council and the local authorities is, you know, they really see that it's... good event and people have fun and like you know we we haven't had any issues problem wise and I think also the conference element they really see the value in the industry side which I think so important you know especially as it is a lot of people's careers and it's such a valuable side of the industry so that's been really good and then I think we've created jobs as well, I suppose, you know, when you look at it that way and people are getting amazing experience now that are then able to go on to work for other places in Manchester and London and other places that they might not have even got an interview if they hadn't had that level of experience. experience so I think in that sense it's that they're happy and then we're bringing in you know people to visit the city as well and it's really funny this is like a tiny little side story but um Nuala, who works for me on the creative side, she was in like a print shop on the Dublin Road, which is like a city centre shop. And they said that they couldn't understand, there was this one day in June last year, they couldn't understand why their sales had spiked so much, like on printing, internet cafe printing. And it was because like 400 people came in to print their ABA ticket. Of the festival. You know, I think festivals do good for the local industry as well. There was a comment on the review, on R.A.'s review of the second edition. You know, it was very praiseworthy of the festival. It said, growing up in Belfast, there wasn't much by way of a scene or a variety. I mean, does that tally with your personal experience? Was that commented on the article? Yeah. Growing up, there was not much of a scene. Or a variety. Or a variety. Well, I mean, I suppose if you say, if you look at a variety like Manchester and London, then yes, you could argue that. But I suppose if you look at it relative to the size of the city, house parties and like... And non-announced parties, there's a lot of them. So, you know, I think we had a great variety. And Shine and Thompsons and Twitch, you know, who've all been going 10 to 20 years, have been doing and bringing in class artists. So I would say for the size of the city, we've had a good. I mean, I suppose we haven't had a variety in terms of like festivals. and maybe more larger events. I mean, I was definitely drawn. I went to live in Manchester straight away after Belfast, and I lived there for six years, and I was drawn to it because of the music scene and the variety. But then again, it's just such a bigger city. Of course. And did it have that variety in terms of theatre? and film and yeah I mean yeah we've got a cool little arts cinema QFT and the Mac does good stuff I think that like I would love to see more but I suppose the reality is you know you can only put on so much to what the demand is there so I suppose it's probably relative So yeah, just talking about your upbringing. I mean you're part of a talented family. Your brother is Matthew McBriar of Bicep. Yeah. Was music a big part of your life growing up? Yes. Yes. Yeah, I mean I probably got into it by way of just living in the room below him and the ceiling being an additional speaker in the house. So he's older or younger? Older, older. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember going to his first ever gig. I think he was I think I was about 13 and he was, yeah, I would have been about 15. So we weren't all legal, but we were allowed in. Yeah, that was fun. And a lot of his friends, Rory, who's Hammer, who's on our lineup, he's been a big part of growing up. we all went to the same school. Andy went to the same school. And yeah, like Jack, space adventure controller, we all went to the same school actually. Yeah, it's definitely been something that I've been really into from whenever I can remember. My mum is like music theatre. So that's been something. Our house was just never quiet. We're quite a loud family. So I think that's based on... just music and my dad's really into his music as well so we kind of just grew up with it I suppose it would always be weird if we walked in the house and it was there was no music on it would be kind of like okay what's going on what kind of things were your parents listening to my mum was into like really mad like Finnish music and Helsinki and Pointed Sisters was a big thing and yeah just a whole range I mean they were into like the classic Van Morrison Enya like the classic Irish stuff as well Dad's is a big Smith fan but yeah I think we were exposed to quite a lot of my mum was part of like an African Music and Turu, who I remember was my brother's break dancing teacher or something, was really a big music influence in our family as well. And yeah, it's kind of we've been brought up with quite a rich exposure to different cultures and different types of music. My parents would have always played music rather than just put the radio on or something, you know. So there was definitely always a... a feeling of like selecting and being interested in what you're listening to. Did becoming an artist yourself never appeal to you? Yeah, I went through a small phase of wanting to give it a go. But I think I just realized I'm very much a juggling kind of person. Like I'm much more of like an organizer. And the idea of standing in front, I mean, I tried it, but like in front of decks for an extended period of time and concentrating on one thing just didn't work. kind of thrive in situations where I'm like juggling 10 things at the same time. It's just kind of my nature. So it's quite funny. We're very different like that, me and Matt. Well, yeah, the first question I asked you was just like, how much of your time does ABA take up? Because you're also involved in all sorts of other projects, right? One of the main things you do is She Said So. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm involved in the Women's Network, She Said So, which I joined actually when I was living in London, which was class. It's a women's network. And then I started running it back in Northern Ireland. So we've been running sort sessions and panels and talks and that then is just exposing more women to the industry and trying to get them more involved and it's definitely seemed to work. I mean, there's a lot more women, I think, involved in it now than there was three years ago when we started AVA and like, you know, whenever I started AVA, I mainly had Michaela working with me and now the team's obviously a lot bigger but... That's really great. I also run a company called Plume with Oisin O'Brien. So Oisin does all the kind of AV stuff, the AVA, the lighting design. And so we came together through an interest in doing projects like that and just started doing them in other ways. So it's separate, the AVA, but we do Plume as well, which is cool. And then I also, Up Productions is really kind of like what runs AVA, but it works on sort of other big events and it's the kind of production-y, management-y, making it happen part. And has your experience as a woman in the music industry largely been positive? Yeah, very much so. I don't really think about it, you know, like... I just think that sometimes it can almost be a self-imposed barrier. I've worked with amazing guys and girls. I always say to people who potentially feel, and, you know, maybe they've experienced something that has caused that, but I just think, you know, don't even... consider is an issue because then it becomes an issue you know remove that barrier I don't believe in it yeah I mean gender imbalance is a hot topic right now but you kind of hear it mostly talked about in terms of lineups and in terms of charts and stuff do you feel like we need to raise more awareness about the wider industry as a whole Yeah, definitely. I think there's amazing women that work behind the scenes, which doesn't get talked about much. The great thing about the topic of we need more women on lineups is it is actually changing things, you know, and that's a positive. Do you feel like that's the first step and then it kind of... I think fundamentally we need to have more women actually becoming artists and creating output. I think it's unfair to blame promoters. I think it's unfair to just make that the firing aim because the reality is there is a lot less women than male. DJs and I think it's great that this is happening because it is changing it so I'm totally all for it but I just think that there needs to kind of be a recognition of the whole piece rather than just sort of firing it at one. As a festival promoter, what are your considerations in that respect when you create your line-up? I mean, we focus on the Irish talent, you know. So for us, like, AVA was born out of wanting to develop the emerging, bring back the established talent. It started in Northern Ireland, as we talked about, and as we've grown, we've been booking more in Southern Ireland. and then bringing in international guests. Obviously, we are aware and we want to have a diverse offering. But I think for us, because ours is about booking the most exciting Northern and Southern Irish talent and international guests, our focus isn't about trying to do 50-50 lineups. And the great thing is... where we are now to where it was three years ago, there are more women coming through. So rather than booking someone because they're female, it's booking them because they're doing really good things. And I think like for me, I think that's what the focus needs to be on the music and the output and, you know, trying to nourish that talent. And the reality, I think, obviously, where like the industry is going and we don't really know what Brexit is going to do, but ultimately it's going to start to put more barriers up for booking outside of your own sort of local. you know, networking offering. I mean, I experienced it now for the first time with Tiana T. So we just did a castle event there, which was class and we might do again. It happened on Easter weekend and we booked Tiana T who we think is class. She's doing really cool things. And as I said, we book mainly Irish, but we always try and bring in international guests. She's from Serbia and fair enough, it's not Europe so you can't say it's directly to do with Brexit but yeah, it's tricky with visas and stuff and there's a lot of additional costs involved as well and I don't know, I think things are going to change a lot. Who knows what's going to happen but things will change I think over the next couple of years when those... Flights go up, you know, it's going to be more difficult to travel and visas and so forth. Are you directly involved with the bookings? Yeah, I do all the bookings, which is a bit mad. I mean, I get help. I mean, I curate the line-up with a couple of other people, you know. I don't curate it on my own. But in terms of the actual bookings and stuff, yeah. And your brother's not involved in the festival? So they're involved creatively. They do input creatively. Nice. You know, as you expand the festival and you've had events in India, in Mumbai, in ADE, how do you kind of negotiate that balance between, you know, keeping it Irish, Northern Irish, Southern Irish, and then also... attracting a foreign crowd, just kind of negotiating that balance of home run versus... You mean... the balance between the events? Well, I guess both in terms of the lineup and like, and your identity is strongly kind of Irish and local and just kind of making sure that it doesn't become an event where it's majority. Majority. Yeah. Well, no, we're not, you know, that's not a bad thing, but just it retains that spirit, that its original spirit. Yeah. I mean, I think that probably boils down to the programming. and the people that you involve I think the the other side though is is you do want to be innovating you do want to be bringing in other art forms that then add so yeah it's a balance I mean I think it's just making sure that like you retain what you started out but you're just adding to it. So you kind of keep the core and the soul, really, of what the event is. And then it's about growing the other bits. I think the exciting thing of what we did in Mumbai and what we did at ADA and what we do is we bring artists with us. that's like an amazing opportunity for like local artists as well, you know, and they get a lot from that. And so I suppose for us, it's, that's. in a way, like developing the talent by bringing them out to other cities with you and then them being exposed to other sounds and stuff. I think that develops what their work can be. So I kind of see it as like a real positive and we want to keep doing that. Like we have intentions to do keep doing that. I think it's just the core festival. The main festival is in Belfast and it's events that we run. Outside of that. I mean, how long term are you thinking now in terms of the festival? You think long term, but I suppose you take each year as it comes. So it's a kind of a balance. I mean, you know, we want... the festival to continue we love doing it it's increasing capacity every year yep so this year it's actually more increased by the fact that it's two days so it's not growing hugely in capacity and to be honest our intention is not for it to become like a like a Glastonbury or anything you know I don't think that could happen in Belfast Actually, it happened in Glastonbury. You know, this is like a little town outside of Bristol. I think what I love to be able to do is to be able to animate different parts of the city. You know, I think that's kind of more where the thinking is to like grow the festival, but also be able to like add nice. parts to the programming in other spaces as well as keeping and you know for me I would love to be engaging other audiences you know like I don't know, you could do a really beautiful light show on the lagoon, you know, where, like, you walk under bridges and, you know, I think it's really nice when you start to, like, animate the city or, like, involve the city in a way that then it becomes kind of more Belfast-centric. Like an ADE, I mean, no, it's different, but an ADE. or a sonar where for that weekend everyone congregates and like the city comes alive. Yeah, so I think, you know, yeah, we'll see. You touched upon it earlier, which is the kind of the heart and soul of the festival is the kind of spirit of the crowd. And like they have this amazing energy. I've been to a party at Twitch for work and it was, yeah, unlike anything I've ever experienced, you know, like really, really magical. And you always hear DJ saying Ireland, Northern Ireland, their favourite place to play. I just wondered if you could like try and pinpoint where that comes from. Or expand a little bit for people that have never experienced it, what it kind of looks like. It's just from the get-go. Love the crack is in humour, right, by the way. Like, that's a common phrase, you know. And it's just fun. People don't have too serious an attitude. Very unselfconscious. Very unpretentious. Very unselfconscious. Yes. I think people are there to have fun. You know, they're there. to get involved. Our experience in the festival has just been, yeah, people are really open and welcoming and want to just have a good time. And there's a lot of energy. And yeah, not much has held back. terms of like just cheering and and the energy I mean this is talked about many times but a time I remember was when Jeremy Underground was playing the Bonnety which is Room 2 and Shine and Queens. And Bonnettie's also where Twitch, so that's probably where you are. And the ceilings are really low. And they've actually had to replace that ceiling, I think, about three or four times. Because it's just constantly punched. And just the atmosphere. And for us, the way that we program it is we keep our outdoor stages. Like we try and create like a low kind of ceiling and the kind of more intimate but still large feeling. Because it's that kind of like close proximity and that energy. You know, with the boardroom stage, we put the DJ in the middle. With the Beck stage, it was very sort of low down and intimate. And our main stage is obviously big, but I think with what we're trying to create with the visual side and the lighting side, that then works really well against the outdoor stages. And the venue, T13, where we do the festival, is just epic. It's like a big shipping warehouse on the docks of the Titanic. And I remember when I first brought people to there to say, this is where we're going to do it. They were just like, you're mad. This is insane. But it's just incredible. And it's the perfect place for us to do what we do. Far out, baby. Hey, can I get a job with you? Just think of it, man. Just think you and me in outer space together. Not only high, it's low. It's the bottomless pit. No end to it.
