Thank you. Thank you. Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Ropline, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Science fiction, alien invasion, space travel. the distant future, Jeff Mills has tackled lots of heady topics over the years, and with enough gusto and artistry to prove that techno is more than just club music. Mills has been one of the genre's true originals since its early days in Detroit, whereas otherworldly flair behind the decks inspired countless DJs to raise their game. Some 20 years later, Mills is still at Techno's vanguard, technically, stylistically, and thematically. It's hard to think of an artist who better embodies the futuristic, experimental bent of this music. and a new film about Mills, Man from Tomorrow, should only add to his reputation, a meditation on the ideas that have long inspired him. The film puts viewers deep inside Mills' headspace. The day after the film's Berlin premiere, Will Lynch sat down with Mills to unpack its themes and touched on the evolution of DJing, techno, and a singular worldview in the process. ♪♪ ♪♪ So I guess to start, Man from Tomorrow, in your own words, how would you explain kind of what that film is about? What it is? Well, I would describe it as a psychological observation of an electronic music producer. Yeah, you said last night... that it kind of was a reflection of, I think you said, like the dreamscape kind of what's going through your head when you make music. It could be looked at as the shape in which we were trying to kind of create these sequences where there's really no warning or any indication when the scenes were going. to change because there's no story. That these scenes would just happen, more of an occurrence, more of an experience, and very much left open into interpretation. And I guess in a way, it's sort of an abstract glimpse at your creative process on some level. Would you say that's true? Not as abstract as one might think. I mean, in the conversations with Jacqueline, there was quite a lot of attention to the subject of being isolated, being alone, being detached in your surroundings. and finding ways in order to be able to adapt to that and eventually end up embracing it. And we really wanted to show that in the passages of the film. When you say isolation, is that isolation on a personal level or sort of more of a broad society level? Well, I think both. I mean, one and one, you know, kind of leads to the other. I think that when you're a DJ, especially speaking from a DJ standpoint. the experience doesn't end when the last record is over and you leave the... The experience of that lingers on. And in some cases, you really want it to linger on until you can get back to your studio to kind of translate what you've just been through. Both are pretty much related, the two aspects of detachment or isolation. you know, your conversation is being replaced by music. You're speaking to the people, but, you know, it's not with your voice. It's not, you know, you're finding the productions of other people to say what you're trying to say as a person, as a DJ. So at this time, I want you to raise your hands up in the air. At other times, I want you to, you know, dance in a certain way. And so I guess being a DJ, being a producer is manipulating these extensions of your personality in order to communicate. And so there's like an element of isolation and being the only person in the room who is communicating in this way. Yes, because you have the control over the system of the room. So, you know, your voice, whatever you do is the most prominent. So, but my point is, is that, you know, you're not really communicating with the people one-on-one. You're not communicating with the crowd. You have this thing, the sound system or the music between you. which doesn't really give you the opportunity to be closer to the people. So it reinforces this distance that you have from your audience. There are some themes in the movie that I kind of wanted to touch on. Some of them are sort of familiar Jeff Mills themes, some a little less so, at least as far as I know. One of the quotes in the film said, I may not have gotten this exactly right, but success is measured. not by what one has, but what one knows. Or what one believes to be true. Basically, what I'm saying is that the truth may become harder to be able to distinguish to the point that it may not be as important as we're told or taught. Telling the truth, finding out the truth that perhaps maybe in the future Only what you believe to be true may be good enough. That you may not put truth on a good and bad scale. That it's just what you feel that would actually accommodate your beliefs may be good enough. Especially when people can't really tell whether things are true or not. For instance, a... A DJ is one that uses a computer that mixes the music together or one that uses his hands, which is more, you know, the truth. I don't think that... people really care from what I can see from my standpoint, the DJs that I play with, it doesn't seem to be a concern from the audience. As long as they know that the music is just being played and it's what they want to hear is good enough. So there is where, you know, for a lot of us that have been doing this for a long time, it was really a shock to understand that there won't be a reaction from the audience. about how DJs are actually programming and presenting the music. And that is a small indication of, I think, how the desire to have things that are more pure and the things that are more genuine. may be disappearing. Another thing that came up in the film that I wanted to touch on was this theme that's a little bit more classic for you, the importance of space travel. I guess in your mind, what makes space travel important at this moment? Well, I think that for humans, we have For centuries, we've always searched for answers of who we are, where we may be from, so that we can have some type of idea of where we may be going. And I think that, or I feel that these answers may not be here on this planet, that we have more chances that there's more answers to be found out in space. And as we become more advanced and technology will make it possible to be able to exist comfortably out in space, we may venture further and further out in search of these answers, in search of places. to migrate to, in search of places to find things that we can use here on Earth or just to survive and evolve. So space will become a very important part of our lives. That's one side. Then it could be that the planet becomes too difficult to remain here on the surface of it. So either underground, maybe floating in Earth's inner atmosphere, coming to Earth, getting the things that we need and going back to a safer location, perhaps maybe the surface, the lunar surface of the moon, perhaps Mars maybe, or just simply floating in space, floating colonies in space may be safer. And I think that if you look at what's happening in the past decade with weather and how extreme things are getting, one might imagine that in 50 years or 100 years from now, what that could be like. So that's the second thing why I think space might be... And then there's other things too. I mean, you know, war could always, you know, make life unpleasant again. It could be an economical situation where you may find very rich people not finding earth pleasant enough and would like to live and exist in other places. But for sure, I see it as our future. That's for sure. And knowing more about it will be essential. Does techno play a role in that turn of events? Yes, because techno will change. What we know of the genre right now. We're still very much in the early stages, I think, I believe. It's different from other genres of music because it's undefined as to what it is. And every time someone comes up with a definition, someone counters that and debates that, and there's no resolution as to what it is. It's always an impasse. That, to me, tells me that it has the ability in order to be able to accommodate itself. for just about any type of situation. At this point, it can accommodate political statements if we wanted it to be. It could explore more in space science and science in education and educating people if we wanted it to do that. It could be more based on escapism, allowing us to be able to transcend if we wanted it to be that way. Or it can stay just as dance music and in the clubs and in nightlife, if that's what we really want it to be. It's this non-definition is what I think will allow it to be able to evolve for whatever we need it to have. So from that... should give it longevity, I think. So it will change. It will change as we will change and what we think we need in order to be able to escape from our reality. And also technology assisting that change as well. So if there's money to be made, you have manufacturers willing to make it in order for people to be able to do that. So I think that the, I'm not sure if the term will survive, but definitely the usage of it will change to something else. And I guess to some extent, techno as an art form is kind of inspired by a lot of what we're talking about, the future itself and technology. sometimes outer space. Something I heard last night, I actually can't remember if it was the Q&A or in the film itself, but you had this line that when you're making music, you're trying to translate something astonishing into musical form. I kind of took that to mean that you're channeling this sort of wonderment that you have. space, technology, the future, et cetera, into kind of your art. Is that right? Well, I'm trying. I mean, I've moved into territory where I'm not very familiar. I mean, I'm not a scientist. I don't know the exact points of these subjects. But instead of that, I'm using my imagination to try to... create certain situations and then present them in the form of music or in story form to make people think about if they were in that situation, how would they deal with that? But it's not something that comes very easy. And I'm convinced that I need to do it consistently to be able to emphasize my point that I think it's important. If I were to do an album a year, you know, I think it wouldn't be as noticeable, as impactful as it has been. So consistently, when one album is done, consistently moving on to the next chapter, the next story, the time in between. is quite important. Actually, that's almost as important as the story itself. So yeah, it's not an easy thing. Creating a story to give to someone that they might find interesting and then using music to be able to translate it and to try to have some notion as to what things may be in the future is kind of tough. This whole phenomenon of taking inspiration from themes like this has quite a history, not just in techno, but going further back with parliament and mythology around parliament. And last night you mentioned Sun Ra. It's sort of a common thread in a certain part of African American music specifically that's this theme of outer space and often even people leaving earth. And also, in a way, the electrifying mojo, the radio show where you got your show as a radio DJ, started with the sound of a spaceship landing, didn't it? That's right. It's an opening sequence of his shows. I mean, how do you kind of explain that ongoing theme in music, or where do you think that comes from? Well, I think it's, I think, I mean, there's a couple of things, but I think... More than anything, it's connected to the culture of Africans that we're all aware of. Well, not a common belief, but it's a very strong belief that's lasted through centuries that we're not from here, that we're from the planet Sirius in the constellation of Orion. And if you are Afro-American and you're in a country where your relatives were not able to practice the culture where they were from because they were slaves brought over from Africa, it was prohibited to do that. You adapt in other ways. You recreate your universe. You recreate your belief system and the world around you. And so I think that it was done a long time ago out of necessity to stay sane in an insane world at that time. So I think that... It has a long history of considering the stars, considering other places other than this planet and the way things are here. So Parliament, Sun Ra, you know, Juan Atkins, Lee Scratch Perry, you know, it's not something. Actually, if you think about it, maybe it's more normal to pay attention to the stars than actually to not do that. It's more natural to wonder what's up there and how you're connected to it than to completely ignore it and assume that it has nothing to do with you, that we're just in space, isolated, alone, and not connected to anything around us doesn't make any sense. So that I see being the connection. And I know you grew up, your own personal fascination with all this stuff goes back. a really long way. Have you ever had kind of like a firsthand personal experience that really fueled this kind of belief? No, no, I never woke up in the middle of the night, you know, floating in the air or anything like that. No, I mean, but I think it's accumulation of... what was available for entertainment when I was a kid. I mean, we were, I'm not sure because, you know, you just, the way people communicated back in the 60s and the early 70s was very different from now, but at least in Detroit. at that time, I think we had an extraordinary amount of resources about science fiction and fantasy. We had a lot of TV shows, a lot of movie programs. I mean, that was a time when one movie was presented a week. It was the movie of the week on one channel at a certain time. So this is before cable. So everyone would all go in and watch this movie of the week on Thursday. I think it was Thursday at 8 o'clock. And that was your home. That was as close as you're going to get to a home cinema. And it was the same for children. So Sunday afternoon, we had these TV shows that would play fantasy from Frankenstein to War of the Worlds. It was that. Our neighborhoods were structured that on certain corners, you would have these shops that would sell music. comics, candy, of course, and all types of junk food. And this is where most young people went after school, before school, at lunchtime, on the weekends. And this is where you would go to get all your goods. And that's where you really bought all your comics. And that's where you bought all your 45 single records. And it was pretty much like that throughout all the neighborhoods in the city. So it's not so surprising if Derek May grew up or Blake Baxter or any folks grew up on another side of the city, they were getting the same distribution as we were on the west side. So that could probably explain the reason why we're all around the same age. And same similarities. But it was everywhere. And then, of course, NASA was active at that time. And there had been a few really successful movies like 2001 and all these things. So it was an industry that was very much embedded into the American psyche. And I think... was something that was manifesting over time. So when I had the opportunity to be able to make music about something, ideas and concepts about space travel, those type of things were already kind of ingrained. Do you think all that sci-fi stuff maybe had... an element of escapism that was particularly appealing to people in the situation of like growing up in Detroit at that time? I think it was pretty much all over the country. It was, I mean, I found an encyclopedia of science fiction writers from pulp fiction all the way to comics. And in it were where the people were from. And if you look at that, you see that it was very much in the Midwest. A few on the West Coast, of course, in San Francisco and Northern California. Many in New Jersey, many in New York, some in Boston, and then a few spread out in other places. But some were women that were disguising themselves as men. Some people were black disguising themselves as Jewish people or white people so that they can get their stories published. America has a very interesting background. fantasy science fiction writing. And so these weren't their primary jobs. They were accountants, they were waitresses, they were people from all sectors of the workforce. And they had the opportunity to write these stories because this is what they felt they were contributing to in terms of... the future, I suppose, which has been, this has been going on for quite some time. I mean, if you go back and look at the history of science fiction writing, it's been, it's been a hundred years, you know, of constant accumulation of writing. about and projections about the future and space and humans' relationship to it. So by the 70s, the 60s and the 70s, it had really been manifesting in Americans. Most of these magazines and these periodicals were read while people were catching the train or in transit coming into the cities. So big hubs like Chicago had large amount of readers. Detroit also was a big hub for trains and the type of rail travel and things like that. So those places. had the most active readers, which could explain why comics are so popular in Chicago right now, because it's been handed down for generations. Huge conventions, all types of things. There's a very strong, strong connection between this genre and American societies. For you, was music always connected? science fiction or early on? No, but there was a certain amount of escapism that I realized at a very early age because in Detroit in the early to mid 70s, especially in Detroit, there were lots of places that you could go to listen to music and to party to music. And in a sense, places to go to kind of escape in a social atmosphere. And that has a very long history for Detroit and Chicago. These are the two cities, the two last cities before the Mississippi, before settlers went into the West to search for gold. and then find gold and then come back. These were the first two cities that they came back to. So these were like outposts. These are like cities where people spent their money, their findings, their riches. So they both had long entertainment, saloon, bar type of past. and entertainment. So always a large amount of musicians were coming and going out of these two cities. That was always the case for that. So the Italian mob and all those things, the Jewish mob and all those things, it's all connected to these two cities in the long history. Prohibition, distilleries in Canada. To Detroit, you know, and all that in between Indiana, Ohio. It's all connected to the fact that these two cities were very much large entertainment cities. When you were first getting started as a DJ, I heard some of you describe yourself as a street DJ. So you weren't playing music, or correct me if I'm wrong, you weren't playing music that was so directly channeling the kind of sci-fi fantasy themes, right? Right. No, no. I mean, the definition of it back then, a street DJ was one that basically worked out of their car. I mean, they... They would be booked for a party and everything, the sound system, records, everything would be brought into the basement or into the space. You weren't hired by a club. That was what a street DJ was at that time. And no, no, I mean, the idea of science fiction, you know, there was no connection. It was a time when the world was just really being introduced to the art form of DJing as well. So we had to go through that whole process. What is a mixer? What is a turntable? What is this technique? scratching and using records in that way. This was really the era of that. And so it was really far too soon to get to the point where you realize that you can manipulate the music to the point that you can begin to describe things. Those are the very early, early days of it. So what was the turning point or maybe like a record you heard or an experience you had where it kind of clicked? for you that DJing could be this kind of art form where, as you said, you're kind of describing things? For me, because I did radio in Detroit for such a long time, and I had a quite regular show, it was six days a week. Even if you had the latest records on Monday, you can't play them Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. You had to come up with ideas. different ways to play the music so that you could show the different variations of how the music could be programmed. So I had to come up with concepts, different concepts in order to be able to apply the music. And so it really started in the 80s using music in various ways to compete with Mojo that was on the opposite station. And then that led to producing music. But it wasn't until like, I think, 1992 with Underground Resistance where we made the rings of Saturn. X-102 discovers the rings of Saturn that we attempted to really create. an album based on space science, using our imagination to translate using the equipment that we have to things that supposedly existed then. I mean, I went to the library and got as many books as I could check out. noted all the important points that I thought we should make music about and then we discussed it and then looked at the equipment and figured out ways of how we can translate rings of dust and rings of ice and debris and certain magnitudes and the rate and the speed. The rings of Saturn are the fastest in the solar system. So we had to kind of figure all that out with the little information that we had. And so that was really the first time that I really had a chance to really sit down and map out to really get into detail about that. And then from there, the interest grew more and more until I got to the point where I could write a story and then extract from the story certain points and then compose music about it and then piece it all together again. And that's kind of where I am now. Is it possible to describe in any way how you get from... you read something in a book you got from a library and then how that information actually makes it into musical form. Like you guys all talking about it and like, you know, how do you riff on something about science and, you know, into a song? Well, you have to have a certain type of scale in your, in your mind. to kind of feel what is representative of certain things. For instance, you have two people that are in a relationship. They're in love. And so to try to find those notes and those chords that would give the listener the feeling as if it's a very sympathetic type of way of doing that. And then that love then turns to hate and finding the right keys and chords to be able to make that transition into something more negative. And you have to find all this within your keyboard or the sounds, the voices that you use. the more that you work at that, the better you get at locating those sounds or finding those chords and notes. In terms of discussion, well, things have to be discussed and then understood, and then you turn to the equipment. So for instance, in terms of, say, like the rings of Saturn, there were multiple rings, and then the space in between the rings that had to be considered. In that case, we calculated the width of the rings and the width and the contents. And from that, we would figure how clustered the rings would be. If it were a lot of debris, a lot of dust, if it were a heavier mass, more dense type of rings, that we would then turn to the... equipment and say well we need to have eight voices happening at the same time and there needs to be little space in between that because of the density of that ring and these sounds need to intertwine with one another to the point that is indistinguishable creating more of a dense feeling and yeah i mean you know you just have to try to talk these things out and rationalize it, basically. I guess in a way, I was just thinking, you said earlier about how when you're DJing, you're kind of talking to the crowd, but in, you know, this language of music, given what you just said about the rings of Saturn, would you say it's a stretch to kind of say that in a way you're kind of a science fiction writer, but instead of, you know, prose it's music. Yeah, that's a, that's a stretch. No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that, but I mean, I, I, my, is to do whatever it takes in order to be able to create a certain situation to put the people in. So as a DJ, I'm giving the responsibility of having this enormous sound system. surrounding the people and given this atmosphere to do something with it. To me, it's not so important how it's created as long as it is created and the people can feel it. I still don't put much emphasis on technology unless it can really create something really unique. But using certain pieces of equipment, using computer versus this or CD versus that are very small, minute type of points that I think that are less important than actually what it really takes to create. create an atmosphere that would make someone remember it for the rest of their life is what I'm more concerned about. And I think that that's probably the one thing that has retained in the culture of DJing almost from the very beginning that hasn't been changed because of technology. This idea of playing something to allow the people to be able to expand, to be able to move beyond their normal consciousness. conscious state. Again, that's one thing that I think is most important above everything else, above where the DJ is from, above the style of music, above the different genres of music. It's the idea of creating a situation so that the person's mind can drift. can detach from this reality and move on to something else. You said before that you feel strongly that techno could be something much more than something that people dance to on the weekends. Do you feel kind of like it's your personal goal or personal mission to some extent to help evade techno? Well, I know that the more people that are with this idea, in this vision and working towards that will make it more possible that in the future, this music will be considered for any and everything. I don't know if it's a, I mean, that's something that I can't say. I don't know what each individual person that hears the music, what they get from it. But I know that we have a better chance if these things exist, if projects are made for this, albums are made in that way, parties are rethought. The whole concept of people getting together are re-approached with the idea that... create an experience is really giving the people eventually what they really want to have. And there's many different ways to do that. It's not just playing one record after the other. You can do that in many different ways. So I've always been interested in visual things and lighting also because I know how important that is in creating the situation. And other things, I mean, dealing with the other senses of how people feel things. So there's been cases where we used large fans to give the sense that the people are being pushed towards the image. I think that when I'm in a small club and the air conditioner isn't working and it becomes a sweat box. That can be very much related. It can be used with the music, actually, to create a certain type of atmosphere. Your own projects like Man From Tomorrow and the other things you've done over the years, are these sort of attempts at taking techno out of its club? I guess. Well, not, not, not taking it out of, or not replacing one with the other, but simply just expanding. I mean, I'm using electronic music, you know, to, to help translate what people are seeing on a screen. You know, it was the same with Metropolis. It was. I wasn't interested in making a film. I was interested in using electronic music to support a film. So my interest was the usage of techno music. And it's been the case with performing with orchestra. My intention is not to become a classical musician. My intention is to mix techno with classical to create something unique that perhaps maybe we can... consider more on the techno side. So my intention has always been consistent. It's maybe kind of easier to think that I'm leaving one to go to the other because the other seems to be so much attractive and maybe I'm bored with techno, but that's not the case at all. I'm more, actually, the truth is, is that I'm more excited that I have the opportunity to be able to expand it. and reach people than we normally would if I just made just straight up dance music. So that's really a large part of it. Do you think this is something you've mentioned a few times is this phenomenon of how techno has this ability to sort of transport a person, sort of mentally create? a new interesting space for them to occupy. Do you think that's sort of like a fundamental sort of function of techno as an art form? Not yet. I think we're headed, we have a possibility to head in that direction. where the music could be even more instrumental and have more control over your experience. And that depends on how much the person is willing to give to let that happen, and then what technology will allow to make it possible. I can see in some ways we have the opportunity to head in that direction. Almost like, well, it's like taking drugs. If you want to drop out, you take a pill and within minutes you're out. Music, especially techno music, could have that effect if we wanted it to have that. But overall, I think it will depends on whether the people think that they would want to have it from music, from this type of music. But I see the opportunity to do that. You don't think that already happens to some extent? Like if you're DJing in the right kind of club and the gig's going well? No, no, I mean more profound experience. In other words, when you hear something... You can no longer recognize, you know, the same place. That's something completely different. You're not in the same place to that point. You're somewhere else. You're convinced. Your mind is convinced that you're somewhere else. That's what we want, really, I think. And I also mentioned the other night that we are becoming further and further away from each other. And this has been happening for quite some time. We're becoming more isolated, which is interesting because it's easier to capture someone's attention, capture someone's mind if it's not a group of people, but it's one person. So that's what I mean by we have an opportunity to do it because we're moving apart. We're living in our own world. We're believing what we want to believe. And if what we're interested in is escaping, we're going to find more profound ways to make that happen. And if the technology is there, we're going to use it. A bunch of things you said kind of... point to this idea that techno as we know it today is kind of this in a state of infancy or what we see now only represents a fraction of its potential. I mean, in your mind, what would techno at full potential be like? What would that consist of? Having that ability to be able to convince someone. that they are no longer where they thought they were. When it reaches that point, when, and it may be a combination of music and something that affects the other senses. But I think sound will be important and inclusive in that combination of technology or whatever it is. When it reaches that point, I think it reaches for potential. And I think that when it can make you understand something and make you believe it, that's when we're rolling along, I think. I think what we're doing now is... You know, it's an extension of something that started, you know, in the 1920s or something. You know, we're still playing music and the sound is being projected out of speakers. And we still have no idea, even now, we still have absolutely no idea how the audience is really feeling. We don't have any way of knowing that. It may look like they're having a great time, but there's no way to know that unless you ask each individual person. And then they may be lying when they say that. So I think we're still in this emphasis of the way that the music is being presented and the way it's being received. When the audience can feel the same thing I'm feeling when I'm mixing the music or to experience what I'm experiencing before the music comes out of the speakers, that's when we're making progress and we're allowing the people to be able to understand much more of the process, not just the after effect, the post event, which is what dance music is right now. It's the last part of the process. It's not, I need to find a record that has very little vocals in it because I need to mix it with this one. The audience doesn't understand that. They don't get to know this. It's 12 o'clock, so I need to slow the music down because I want to bring it back up in 45 minutes. They have no idea. And then how to do this. So I'm taking this record and this record and then understanding the process of how you're making those two mixed together in order to make that happen. These are things that only the person, the musician, the DJ knows. And it's the majority of the process of the art form of DJing. And so one might understand why so many people can be kind of up in arms and kind of against the idea of allowing a computer to do it. Because there's so much more to the thought process. It's not just the end result. There's a whole timing that's involved of locating the music. second thinking things, all those things are kind of wiped away in this automated type of way of programming. The idea of wearing headphones as opposed to using a computer and not needing headphones because the computer is mixing it yourself. All those things have an effect of how the music is being programmed. I mean, to kind of... you divert off into the art form of DJing. When I realized that that is the way that a lot of DJs are actually playing music now, I kind of realized that the culture, the art form of it is probably is gone, is dead. Because they don't see that there's any value. They could not. understand that there was a value in, even though it was not as easy to do it, but there's a value. Once a DJ loses his timing, that's everything. You lose timing in deciding what to play, when to play it. Once you kind of take that away or you lessen that, those things are quite crucial to your style. which could possibly explain why a lot of DJs all sound alike, because the process is basically the same. So maybe that's another conversation, another story. But to sum it up, a large part of the process is not what the people hear on the loudspeakers. And there's much, much more to that, that that's there. And I think in time, the people, technology could make it possible that the audience could understand that in real time, if that's what we wanted. You sort of said just then that in a way, DJing as an art form is dead or is in trouble because of this. loss of technique, but for you, it seems DJing remains an extraordinary way for you to do what you want to do with, with music and art. And, you know, as time goes on, do you think DJing will always be kind of your, your best tool to, to do what you want to do? Well, it's, it's a difficult question to answer because DJing won't always stay this way. It'll change based on the technology and the circumstances. So 10, 20 years from now, it can be completely different. That maybe I'm just pressing buttons or maybe not even know what I'm thinking about the button and the button activates itself. Well, I mean, I think that society will always need these people that will... have a certain insight to saying things, to doing things that will enlighten people and allow them to be able to think of other things. So I think as the art form evolves, it will probably still have that task. But I think that the way that we're doing things now won't survive. I think that... The computer gave us, you know, something great, but it also took, in terms of DJing, what it didn't take. But people are understanding less about the more natural things that are in the process of programming music for people. you know, sometimes allowing mistakes to happen are okay. Not allowing mistakes, but making a mistake is okay because you're letting the audience know that it's not a perfect, you know, you're not playing for machines, you know. So perfection comes in many different ways. So I think we're still very much in a stage, when I say early stage of electronic music. we're still very much excited by what's new, what's technology. And I think we haven't reached a point where we've kind of rested at, okay, so this is enough. This is what we need to be able to create. Now let's get into the creative part and really begin to use these things differently to go beyond. what we've been doing for the past 30 years. We haven't reached that point yet because of this constant filtering of this, this filtration of new, new technology. But at some point, I think we're going to slow down. And I think we will say, OK, so we have enough. So let's really now begin to get into the art form of making music. Yeah, I think it'll come. Maybe we're a ways off, but eventually it'll come. Thank you. you
