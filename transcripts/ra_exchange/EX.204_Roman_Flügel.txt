Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Aaron Coulthate and I'm the news editor at Resident Advisor. For more than 20 years, Roman Flugel has reinvented himself. He emerged as part of the fertile Frankfurt scene in the 90s that spawned three much-loved labels. Playhouse, Klang and Ongaku Music. He's worked under a string of solo aliases that have taken him from jacking house and electro to experimental and ambient. He formed the duo Alter Ego with Jorn Elling-Witke and the success of that partnership brought its own rewards and challenges. The past few years have ushered in a new era for Flugel. In 2011 he put out Fatty Folders, his first solo album under his given name, and it's regarded by many as his most accomplished work to date. When I caught up with Flugel at this year's Mise-en-Or festival in Lyon, we started our discussion by talking about his next album, which is coming out via dial in September. Thank you. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ you So you have a new album on the way this year. Is it all finished and ready to go? Yeah, it's finally finished. Mastering has been done, artwork has been finished and it should be out or it will be out on the 1st of September this year. Well, your last LP, Fatty Folders, came out in 2011. So there's a three-year gap there. How long did you spend working on it? Since I was touring a lot and playing a lot, it took me quite a long time to finish the album. So in between, like within, I would say in total, it might have been three up to four months. But if you see the whole time, it took me much longer. How does it sound compared to Fatty Folders? That was the first album that you... had released under your given name and how does this compare as a follow up? Well in general I would say it has a different vibe, different groove. I got rid of jazz or considered jazz elements like solos or like the percussions I've used, they're completely different. it's a different texture all over it's more distorted it's more noisy it's a little slower and it's a little darker at the same time I would say Was there a particular reason why you decided to drop the kind of jazz influences on this record or did that just happen? I think it just happened it was the overall feel I had was a little more crowdy, let's say. And I didn't use any samples. It was all, I mean, everything I sampled was played by myself this time. And I tried to create a certain texture in the music. And therefore I had to get rid of a certain, let's say, groove or certain influences I used to have. What kind of instruments were you using and performing yourself in the making of the record? Even though I'm not a guitarist, I was using a guitar, I was using lots of feedbacks and I have a little Marshall amp in my studio and I was working with that for feedbacks. them on top I was using very old drum machines like a keynote drum machines from the 1973 I think stuff like that and and got rid of let's say like the percussion I still used on Fetty Folders. Were you consuming much music or listening to much music while you were making the album or did you kind of shut yourself off completely from outside influences? Well, usually I'm always listening to music but not to get a certain vibe for my own productions. It's just, it could be anything but I don't usually listen to a certain style of music too. get involved into my own stuff. But sure, I mean, I've always been a fan of crowd rock and I've always been a fan of guitar brands that are more noisy or more left field. So yeah, that's also part of me. And the album's coming out through Dial. How did your association with that label begin? Well, I know David Lieske and Pete for a very long time. I think I got to know them back in 1995 when we put out an album as Sensorama on the Hamburg-based. Laudamart label. I think David at that time, he was probably 16 years old or something. He was a volunteer. And that's how I got to know him. And a little later I knew Peter. And my first ever remix I did was for Cast News. It was one of the first dial records ever. So I got involved very early. It was a fairly natural thing when it came to releasing Fatty Folders and now this next album. do it through dial was that an easy choice for you absolutely because i really love what they're doing i really like the view they have like the overview like the total view of of music what they prefer or what they really like to feature there's it's a wide range of music but always with a interesting twist and i like them personally a lot so it was really easy to for me to say yes Is it important for you to work with people and work with labels of people that you consider friends? I know you've also been putting a few records out recently through Running Back, for example, and I've read... interviews that you're quite close friends with with good Janssen yes I think it's very important for me after all those years to be honest I I always work with with people I would consider be friends and um especially if you put out independent music it's a very good thing to do I would say I guess before you you started working closely with dial in terms of with fatty folders um that the labels you're most associated with were of course, Playhouse, Ongaku and Klang. It seems like those labels have now run their course. Yes. How did your involvement with them come to an end? Well, the story of Klang and Playhouse starts 20 years ago in the early 90s. That's when I did productions together with my longtime studio partner, Johan Wuttke. Back then, as Asset Jesus, this was our first project. And with a demo tape, we went to a record shop in Frankfurt. It was the Delirium record store. And there was Heiko and Atta working, the two guys we would start the labels with. This is how it all began. And then step by step, it became bigger and bigger. And it became a company. We worked in total more than 15 years together. We had our peak time, we had a nice office, employees and volunteers and all that. But at a certain time, it all changed. And what was that time? The time was when the internet became faster. And when our whole business was based on selling vinyl records. Even with the strangest records, at that time we sold about 1,000 12-inches, which was always good to pay the money for the artist and the record and all that, no problem at all. In between, we had much more successful records. But the whole business was vinyl. And when we started to realize that the vinyl sales were going down... we weren't fast enough to change our idea of what record business could be like back in the days. And that was finally the end of it for us. Is that a regret that you didn't sort of react quicker to prevailing trends? Sometimes I regret, but at the same time, there's no way back. And it's not, not everything is our fault. I mean, Many people had to struggle with the fact that record sales went down the hill. For example, all the distribution companies. And if you have a strong record, like for example, Ricardo Villalobos' first album, which sold thousands and thousands of CDs and vinyls, and then you don't get the money back from the distributor, you have a problem. And that's what happened to us. And am I right in saying this is around the turn of the millennium when the distribution business fell out? I mean, I guess it's a story that's been, you know, a lot of labels have experienced, especially across Europe, like the likes of some of them like Clone and Versatile, I guess, of weather that storm. Yeah. But I guess you were saying at the peak of it, you had an office, you had employees. Was that sort of overnight where you had to kind of... end up cutting the label business or was it a gradual decline? It was a gradual decline. It's nothing that hits you with a hammer or something. It's something you realize step by step and then you try to turn it all in a different direction but then it's already too late. That's what we realized. Then we cut down. space and less people were working for us but you can't we couldn't we weren't able to to be fast enough and you don't i mean you still believe in what you do but you at a certain point you find out okay believe it's not enough i have to make decisions and maybe those decisions were too late And in terms of your role with these labels, which were you most closely involved with and what was your kind of influence in the sort of day-to-day running of? I would say I was very much involved with Klang Electronic because of being an A&R for that label and also taking care of records in general that came out of Klang. And also in the very beginning I was... taking care of accounts but that changed drastically when I got more into things like alter ego and touring and all that. At the moment there seems to be a lot of producers especially younger ones who are kind of going out and starting their own label. to put out their own music and also the music of their friends or whatever. Do you have any desire whatsoever to start up your own label in the future? Well, I wouldn't start a label like I did with Klang & Playhouse. If I do something, I would keep it really small, not slow but small. And I'm not sure if I really want to. I mean, there's people who can do it a lot better than me probably. Sometimes it's also hard because it doesn't get along with you as a producer or as a DJ traveling a lot and all at the same time, it might be a little too much. I guess I want to ask you if you see a situation where lots of artists have their own labels as a good thing or a bad thing. Sounds like you sort of prefer working with a label like Dial, which has a sort of established, well-defined aesthetic and where someone else can kind of take care of the background side of things. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Because I can be focused on other things. And just sort of taking things back a bit to sort of growing up in Frankfurt, how did you first find out about electronic music? Well, I think it was quite early because Frankfurt has been a major city for dance music in Germany, back in Western Germany. say and there was this huge huge club at the Frankfurt Main Airport the Dorian Gray which was one of the first places in Germany that had no limits in terms of opening hours because airports have a different law than any other cities and that was a reason why the party on weekends were really crazy and some really interesting people where they're involved already, who became later very famous people like Sven Feti, who was playing in this place for a long time during the 80s. And my older brother, he went there, and he, like probably in 82, 83, something like this, and you could buy tapes in this club. And he brought back those tapes, and I was completely addicted. these tapes that were basically like very early electro and new beat and this kind of music. I got totally addicted by listening to those tapes. When I was able to go out on my own, I was trying to go to Frankfurt as soon as possible because I was living a little bit further south and I managed to get along with some friends of my brother. We managed to get into those places when I was 17 or 16, way before I was allowed to. And I got completely into this kind of music back then. A little later, I think 87 or 88, I think 87 for Christmas, my brother handed me a vinyl, a compilation of street sounds. this compilation label, and it was, I think it was called, it was already called Techno or something like this. And on this compilation, it was only very, very early Detroit and Chicago Techno. And this is how it all started for me with this compilation. In terms of the inspiration you got from that compilation? Was that, right, I want to start producing or I want to start DJing or both? I would say both. But in the beginning, it was basically producing. I bought records, but I didn't have record players or anything, like not two of them. But I wanted to make this kind of music. So what I did, I was working in... during holidays and was finally able to buy my first drum computer and a synthesizer. And no sequence at that time because I had a four-track cassette player and we called everything on four-track, like playing with my fingers, bass lines. for five and a half minutes until it was finished. And yeah, that's how it was. Sort of taking it back even further than that, you got your start in music in general. You were playing the piano from quite a young age, is that right? Yeah, yeah. I started the piano, like classical piano, when I was six or seven years old. And the interesting thing was I had a piano teacher. who was also a little bit into jazz, but he used to be an organ player. He played the big organs in movie theaters in the 20s in Berlin for, how do we say in English, like movies where like... The silent movies? Silent movies, that's the one. So he was improvising for these movies. And he was a very interesting character. So on the one side I was learning to play the classical piano, but on the other side he allowed me to play on his organ at home, which already had a little run computer. So I was listening to these kind of sounds in his house. and got involved into this kind of rhythms also already there back then. I always mention my uncle because my uncle was a hobby musician but on a very good level. And in his house he had a room full of music instruments, like literally everything, like from analog instruments to a Roland System 100 synthesizer. And as a child, we could mess around, like my cousins and me in this room, and we could use anything that was there. So that was a great opportunity to start to play music on your own somehow, just do whatever you want, along with a very strict classical education I had also. And those early experiments, what did they sound like? To be honest, I have no idea because I didn't record anything. It was basically making noises. I really liked to, because there were so many things to, so many knobs to turn in this place and really enjoyed making noise as children, I would say. It was obviously the Dorian Gray. How long after was that when Robert Johnson came on? Oh, Robert Johnson opened, I mean, this year we have 15th birthday of Robert Johnson. But Dorian Gray opened already in 78, I think. And then the next step would be the Omen, the very famous Frankfurt-based club where Sven Fede was one of the owners and where he was playing every weekend. So that was the next step for me. And I was a constant, I was one of the omen kids, like from day one for a couple of years, spending every weekend in this techno club. how big an influence was that on you as a very big very big to be honest I mean there's no one who had a bigger influence on me back then as Sven Fee definitely and he was the DJ you were waiting for every Friday and he was the DJ who was able to educate the people and to play the most crazy records back then already and the thing was he realized you as a as like one of the kids when you go there regularly one day because it was always so packed that not everyone could get in for example so he was going outside taking care who was coming regularly and he was pointing with his finger on you and put you inside then later on he started talking to me and so we got became friends somehow and then I was part of his label for a while and so we started to have this kind of history Sven is someone that I've heard you mention before as a DJ who really pushed your productions, especially some of the alter ego stuff. He kind of... helped create a bit of a buzz around some of those records. Yes, yes, definitely. And he also here was asking, even back then, Harthouse, the label he used to run and IQ, it wasn't really my cup of tea musically, but I really liked him as a person. And he liked me and he liked Jörn, my production partner. So that's how we ended up on his label. Because the records we put out, like the first Ultra Eagle albums, had nothing to do with the sound we put out later. With the big hits like Rocker or whatever, or Betty Ford. It was more or less home listening music or sometimes ambient music. But he wanted to have us on the label and he took us on tour with him even though he knew we wouldn't play as hard as people would expect you to play on a rave or something. He was believing in us. So I really appreciate that. At what point did you decide, all right, I'm going to make a career out of music? Because you went to law school. Yeah. But only for one year. And then I decided law school wouldn't be the thing for me. And I already knew it before. But the thing was, I mean, when you finish high school and your parents are waiting for something, you better do something. And that's what I did with law school. But then after one year, I really knew that was nothing for me. And I started to study musicology for quite a while, even though I didn't. finish my studies because everything else became too important or more important and very I mean I was able to play a lot back then already and the labels were taking off and yeah so it didn't feel right to finish the studies you know it felt right to become a part of a label and all that and whereabouts were you were you djing at that at that time it was a lot around i mean there was parties every weekend around frankfurt first then the cycle became, or the circle became bigger, and you started to go to different places in Germany. But in the beginning, it was basically Frankfurt and the Frankfurt Rhein-Main area. And we did parties on our own also, which was also very important. Who did you do those parties with? Back then, a lot of parties with people from my hometown, but also with Ricardo, for example. He was doing parties back then. Atta and Heiko were having different nights different places in Frankfurt. Yeah, that was the combination. How did you first meet Ricardo? I think we both met first time in a club in my hometown, which is Darmstadt, 30 kilometers south of Frankfurt. And we both grew up there. And somehow we get to know each other because he was playing as a percussion player. And I was playing as a drummer in a band. So we somehow got to know each other. Did you find it was the DJing or the production that really took off first? I think for me it was the production because I was playing in bands already, as I said. I was playing as a drummer in different bands. And I always liked to make music. And as soon as I found out... how to produce this kind of sounds I heard on certain records. I was desperate to get a sampler and I was desperate to get a 909 and all that. And I was working every holiday and step by step I bought my own little studio. And production was first. So I was doing nothing but making music in my living room at home and recording things on 4-track. That went on for at least two or three years, I would say. And then with this, finally I had a demo tape that I was quite happy with. And I handed this demo tape to Johann Wuttke. Because I knew he already had a studio place at his grandfather's house. which was more professional. And he called me up the same night and saying, hey, I really like what you do. Let's do something together. You come over to my studio and we can record something. And that's how Alter Ego and Sensorama and all that started. So is that how you heard about Jorn? It was very much, okay, he's a guy with a good setup. He knows what he's doing. Let's send some music off to him. Yes, because in this town, everyone... It's not a big city, probably like 100,000, 120,000 people. So if you're young, you know each other somehow. And there was one guy telling me, you got this demo finished, give it over to Jörn. He already has a studio. So that's how it went. So I gave him two tapes, one phone call and that's it. So he called you later that same night. Same night, yeah. How did things develop from that point on? How quickly did you guys start working together? Very quickly because I already had finished more or less the first As It Jesus album which came out later on Klang Elektronik. But I was able now to re-record everything in the studio. And I recorded everything back then on a hardware sequencer. And he had a computer in the studio, like an old Atari. And now I was able to modify the arrangements because I was able to put all the MIDI data into this computer and then work on the tracks again and record them professionally. And this is how it started with him. So he gave me the opportunity to take the next step in the studio. And he's a few years older than you. Yes, he is. He's around five years older than me. And so what was the dynamic like between the two of you? I would say since he had the experience in the studio, studio he was able to especially to help with the mixing and also with the arrangement because he saw he had the different perspective i was always this like kid working at home on on tracks and being very focused on certain aspects which he saw maybe a little different so it was quite interesting we got very good along with each other and found a way to like a workflow that was interesting in terms of your your work with with your i guess you kind of explored various different styles of music under different names what kind of discussions were you having to to kind of decide what direction you were going to take your music together Well, lots of discussions sometimes. But in general, I would say, because I was making the music more or less all the time. And if we wanted to make like a slower track, we didn't discuss about the tempo because it was already like the ideas or the... the basic ideas were already there. But for example, if it comes to arrangements, like how does the track start? How does it finish? What is in between? What kind of instrument can we use? We did all the decisions together. had a lot of discussions also, definitely. Especially the more years you work together, the more discussions. And do you guys still work together? No, no, we haven't worked together for a couple of years. So we're still on the phone from time to time. But after 15 years, there was some, I don't know, something changed. Once you're not going back to the studio for a while, it gets harder and harder to go back to the studio together. So what was it that changed? Was it just that the magic sort of disappeared from the studio dynamic? Yeah, definitely. I mean, there was a change. The magic had gone at one point and it's hard to get the magic back sometimes. And at the same time, it was very exhausting touring. and playing your own tracks, the same tracks all over again, every weekend somewhere else, all around the globe at one point, because we had this huge hit with Rocker. I mean, I wouldn't like to miss a single thing or a single day, but there had to be a change for me. And I remember a time when we were touring in Australia for a festival tour. We had this discussion in Perth, like sitting in Perth in a pub, drinking a couple of beers. And then I think that was the day when everything changed because we didn't get along with each other anymore. So basically there had to be a change and there was a change. I really want to ask about the alter ego stuff. And I mean, you mentioned Rocker, you know, there's tracks like Get Snock. You know, there were big, big, big songs. How did that affect your career? How did that affect your life? Oh, I think very much. I mean, at that time, it changes a lot because you play to bigger audiences. People expect something. from you and also people think that you make like one rocker like for the rest of your life like all over again and another Gatesnacht probably or something but that didn't happen I mean it wasn't like this before and it wasn't like that afterwards so there was a certain time when we were all very happy with the situation it was good fun it was lots of lots of good parties, lots of touring, lots of, I don't know, lots of everything. But then at one point, even that doesn't make sense for the rest of your life. And then I always try to experiment, do something new. I always try to surprise myself and to take the next step somehow. And that wasn't possible with UltraEgo after 15 years. You've said before that you never are a person to follow trends. It seems to apply even if you're the one who's set a particular trend. How important is it for you to stick to your own creative path? I think that's the most important thing. I mean, you can try to pretend to be someone else, but that doesn't work out, I think. That doesn't work out. I mean, my music is very diverse, but that's the way I feel it. But I'm not pretending to be someone else. I mean, if you take a listen, if you listen to what I'm doing or what I was doing for the last 20 years. It's different kinds of music, but it's still me. And I think the older I grow, the more closer to what I am is happening. So hopefully I have another couple of years in front. Have you ever felt yourself getting kind of swept up in a scene or a zeitgeist and have to actually pull yourself back from it? Yeah, I think especially with the peak of Alter Ego, there was this time when you had Ed Banger records and all that and it was very successful. There was a certain sound going all around the world and we were part of this for a certain time. But at the same time... I started to feel that it doesn't make sense at all to continue with this kind of scene because our intention was never to be part of the scene. I think Rocker was maybe like a blueprint for many other productions, but we never thought about the track being as big as it was. So it was time to take the next step and go out of it, I would say. It goes pretty fast. I mean, once you have a big tune, people consider you, or they want, many people would like to have you the same way all over again. How did it feel to have Rocker actually as a blueprint to hear it sort of... on so many other tracks around that era. It's interesting, once something like this happens, you really can't, in the moment it happens, you really don't see what's going on. If I look back, I think it was kind of crazy because it was all around everywhere. I went to a party and it was played more or less every night. But we never had the intention to make a hit by producing Rocker. It was just there. People just loved it. And then they started to hate it. I mean, that's always the same. But for us, it was a big, big push, like in terms of playing, in terms of audiences and all that, festivals. So, yeah, I mean, I really loved it for a while. And do you ever think or wonder if this is... going to be massive or I wonder what's going to happen with this one. No, to be honest, I was always surprised by the success of a certain tune I was producing. I never had the intention in the studio to make a hit, for example, with Geiznoch. It's the same. It was a compilation track for a Cocoon compilation. I was in the studio thinking, what the hell should I do? I have to get this thing finished within the next 24 hours. So I used this little monophonic synthesizer, like a Korg Electribe series, and was messing around with that one. And then I had this simple rhythm and the sound, and I thought, like, that's kind of funny. Let's keep it like it is. And suddenly Sven played it and he gave me a call saying like, hey, you know what happened? Nobody knew the track, but they all freaked out. You got to be careful with this one. And I was like, okay, let's see what happens. And then finally it was in the French charts and it was, I don't know, it was in Italy. It was top. 20 or something. I don't know. Something like this happens with this kind of music. No one's singing. It's just a beat and a sound and it makes people happy. That's kind of funny. And sort of beyond alter ego, you've worked under so many different pseudonyms, Soylent Green. miles high of course Sensorama what have you enjoyed in the past about working under so many different aliases well I think back in the days it was quite normal to have different aliases because I released different kinds of music on different platforms and everyone was asking me for another name basically and I was always hiding I liked to hide different monikers back then and it also keeps you it's like a bit like playing a different role in a movie or something and I thought this was very enjoyable You've said before that 8 Miles High was your favorite alias to hide behind. Can you explain that? Yeah, I think 8 Miles High was a lot of freedom in this project. I think it was very much home listening at the same time with quite hard techno tracks and it was a wide range of music and I think it was paired to the things I did with Jörn. It was the most... of myself in the project 8 Miles High. There was finally one album released I was very happy with and I felt very comfortable with 8 Miles High for a long time. Was putting out an album in 2011 under your given name, was that a symbolic thing? Was that like a, right, here I am? Yeah, I think it was because, I mean, you said, right, here I am, but at the same time it was many people knew me. only because of Geht's noch. I think it was about time to say, hey, well, this is one track, but there's a few other things happening. I used to have a lot of different monikers, but it's all me. And I'm trying to... release whatever I want under my own name in the future. Does the idea of collaborating in the studio still interest you? Well, sometimes it does. For example, I was asked to go in the studio to see my mobile disco last year and I thought that was quite a good idea. We had lots of fun and I really liked the guys. But in the daily life... To be honest, I really enjoy to be on my own and in front of my little setup and messing around with the things I have. It's like if you compare it to a painter or something. I mean, he doesn't ask usually someone else to paint the one corner and I continue with the other one. And I see myself more like this. I mean, I've played in bands before and if I find the right people or the right person, I would try it again. I mean, I'm quite happy how it is at the moment. I guess after so many years working in collaboration, it's natural. It was a close, it was a very close work relationship we had. And as I said, we worked more or less every day together for 15 years. And yeah, I had it all, I think. I wanted to ask you about the Simeon Mobile Disco collaboration you mentioned. How did that... sort of come about did they did they get in touch with you or yeah i mean i think their manager or management um they sent me an email last year asking if i would be interested in working with them and i was like that's a very weird idea because i i mean i knew them i knew they they had quite a few big tunes and and huge remixes and all that but then i thought like that's actually quite interesting and and because i used to play records from the label quite often and then suddenly i had this phone call or this email and i said yes let's do it and after a couple of like after a couple of weeks we ended up in the studio in london So you went to their studio? Yeah, I went to their place. I think they put out like three different collaboration 12 inches on their label and I was one of them. And are you kind of open to the idea of future projects along those lines with other artists? Why not? Yeah. I mean, I think I'm open for this. This year, Robert Johnson is having his 15th year anniversary celebrations. And I wanted to ask about your involvement with that club from the early days through to now. How has that helped shape the last decade of your career? I think Robert Johnson was also very, very important. Atta, who was the main person behind it. the idea of Robert Johnson. I worked with him with Playhouse and Klang for a long time. And then one day he showed up with the idea of having his own club. And everyone was like, crazy idea, but let's see what's happening. And he made it happening. And 15 years ago, I was more or less playing for the first party. And I'm a resident since day one. And it's a bit... with the same story like with the labels because Atta is a very he's a very free thinker a very free thinking person And if he has an idea, it's going to happen somehow for him. And the club is completely his idea. It's a place to be very free with your music. You have the best circumstances to play the music. And I'm very happy to be part of this. So you said you played at the opening? for Robert Johnson? What was that like? You know, in the beginning, it wasn't really, it took a while until Robert Johnson became famous in the area because there was lots of competition with other places. And Robert Johnson is a bit out of the city. It's in the suburbs or it's already in the next city called Offenbach. And so people were not really, well, in the beginning, not really interested. It took almost two years until the club was becoming successful. So in the beginning there was a lot of experimenting. The sound system wasn't very good. Yeah, as with everything, you need some time. In your opinion, what was it that helped build up the momentum for the club? Was it just a word of mouth thing and Atta and the residents sort of sticking to the principles? Yeah, because it was so, I mean, the place is quite minimal and the idea was quite abstract because everything was different. There was no fancy light show. There was no... Couldn't see any bottle of alcohol. It was all no branding, no brands. There was no sponsorship or anything. So it was very different compared to other places and other clubs. And people were a bit irritated by that in the beginning because it was so unique. So it took a while until they really understood what was happening. As a resident, were you able to and are you still able to go places with your sets where you aren't able to go elsewhere? Yes. I mean, I feel so comfortable at Robert Johnson and people are usually very open-minded and you couldn't play a lot of things there. At the same time, you always have plenty of time because... There's no restriction with any closing hours or something. So if it's a good evening or a good night, you can easily end up playing six or seven hours. I guess in terms of the anniversary coming up, have you taken a chance to kind of look back and think of some of the nights that have really shaped your memory of the club? Well, there's been a few, definitely. But it's hard. Sometimes the best nights are hard to remember, to be honest. But no, we had a lot of great parties there. Also a lot of great live shows for New Year's sometimes and stuff. Yeah, but I had great nights at Robert Johnson, definitely. And I'm looking forward for the birthday. I play along with Andrew Weatherhall, which is quite an honor. And he's been playing there also for the last 15 years on a regular basis. So this should be fun. And there was a tour last year. Yes. Is that right? part of that in terms of some of the dates. What was it like sort of going on a sort of mini tour with other residents? Very nice, very good. We had lots of fun and there was also this Robert Johnson book coming out. That was the idea to have this, to show the book to the public and to be on tour with the residents. People like Gerd Jansson or like Oliver Hafenbauer, Atta, yes. And in terms of your own DJing, how has your approach to DJing changed down the years? I wouldn't say it has changed that much. I mean, it's still... one of the most important things I'm doing and I'm very happy about the situation right now. I can play, I'm people, there's a certain interest and it keeps me, there's still this general interest in the music which is the main thing. There's no, it doesn't hurt. It's a great thing to do. You know, you still seem to play quite a few gigs across Europe and beyond. Are you more choosy these days about what sort of clubs or festivals you play at? Well... I wouldn't say I'm, there's always a difference between people who can really choose and the others, you know, and I'm still part of the others. I mean, I can't really say I can choose between hundreds of festivals. That's not me. But I like to play. So, and this is my job, my basic job. I like to go out on the weekend. And tonight you're, we're at Nui Sanor in Lyon and... You're going to play back-to-back with Axel Bowman. What can we expect from that? Well... I wish I would know because Axel and me were on the phone today and we were trying to discuss what we play and it's not clear at the moment and there's only one and a half hours to come I think and I think we're both not usually like type of control freaks behind the desk so it should be fun at the very end. I mean have you played many back-to-back A few. I mean, I played back-to-back with, I had really lots of fun with Michael Meyer. I'm going to play another back-to-back with him soon. But I haven't done it too often. So we will see. So we've got the album on the horizon for September. What else have you got in the pipeline for this year and beyond? I think the album is the main thing. The album comes along with a couple of videos. I'm currently involved in different projects. Then there's a tour planned for the States for the US in October, US and South America. I'm playing lots of gigs in Europe, Japan and all that. So I'm very busy, but the album is the main thing.
