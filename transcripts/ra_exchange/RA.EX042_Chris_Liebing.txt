Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Industrial-tinged techno has made an enormous comeback over the past few years, and one of its leading proponents is CLR head Chris Liebing. The German DJ hasn't been doing all that much different. He fully admits he'd call his recent set at Berlin's Berghain Schranz if it hadn't become such a dirty word since he coined it in the 90s. To him, it simply means the hard-edged 4-4 that has held sway over his taste for years as a DJ. I talked to Leeming last month about his beginnings in the Frankfort area, CLR's recent renaissance, and how his interview with San Juan District's function for the CLR podcast was one of the major reasons that RA started the exchange. I wanted to actually begin by saying thank you because you're actually one of the inspirations for actually doing this whole RA Exchange thing. The exchange podcast. Oh, actually, yeah, Dave told me. Yeah. You know, I listened to the one with Dave and he ended up being the first RA Exchange participant because I wanted to delve even deeper. I loved his podcast for you, but it was funny. I think I'm one of the five people who wants more talking on your podcast. You are one of the five. I only know you so far and maybe me. I really like to give out information, but also I understand that people want to listen to music. But then again, I think, you know, there's the internet. If you only listen to music, just go buy yourself a mix or... find it somewhere or whatever you do. But I think there's, you know, you want to transport a message and with our music it's kind of hard to transport a message. We can't rap over it, you know. For sure. And it's really nice to hear. background stories when I do little interviews with people on the podcast I want to kind of keep it short but I think it's a great idea to have a podcast with only talking yeah so hooray so here we are I saw an interview with you today a video interview where you talked about how you were university you were just kind of like this is not for me no I got to do something music wise Were you already DJing by the time you were in university? Yes, I was. Was it techno by that time or was it something else? Yes, I know. It was just basically the time that techno became more interesting for me. As I started DJing, I started in a student club. That was... Actually, I was just thinking before we did this interview, I was just thinking, like, when did I have my first, because I wanted to get it right, when did I have my first real, like, what do you call it, engagement as a DJ, yeah? Where you basically get paid for DJing. And that was basically 91 and then I was thinking wait wait, it's 2011. Well, that's 20 years Hooray, I'm a DJ for 20 years. I just noticed But that first DJ job was in a bar Kind of club thing the DJ booth was basically set behind the bar It was equipped with a really old I think mixer. I don't know the brand anymore, but it only had kind of two faders and nothing else and we had one 1210 technics and we had one 1200 i don't know if you remember the 1200 the 1200 doesn't have a pitch control i didn't know how to how to mix at that time because i dj'd before in a private party since i've been like 16 17 because i was always more interested in making the music on a party than in just socializing yeah i'm not really the best socializer kind of thing and i always wanted to do something so i was voluntarily always because nobody wanted to do the music everybody wanted to just check out the girls and whatever and i was like i'm happily doing the music and i have kind of a little collection at home so this is how it started and then my sister was always working in nightlife she's older than i am At some point, this one club where she worked at, they were looking for a DJ for Thursdays. And she was like, oh, my brother DJs here and there. Maybe he can try out. So I went there and I tried out. How did it go? It went really well, actually. They gave me the Thursday. There was not much going on. But the good thing in Gießen, that's outside of Frankfurt, like 80 kilometers, it's a university city. And that was one of the few places that So there was kind of... It was open later than most other places. Until three o'clock. Most of the Gießen closes at one. And kind of a student thing. And it was really interesting because they just put me into, like, say, cold water. I just played on a Thursday night and I was really, really nervous, I remember. I hope I didn't, I don't do anything wrong or a track runs out. You know, like these nightmares. Every place closes at one. All the people who get drunk come to the place after that. So you're golden. Yeah. Because everyone's already drunk. Yeah, but Thursday was like kind of this odd night they had and they were like looking for, their big nights were Fridays and Saturdays and the DJ who played Saturdays, he introduced me a little bit to the sound system. And he was like, can you mix beat mix? And I'm like, no, I've never done that. So far, I've basically DJed with tape decks. So basically, it was an in and out fading thing. And at that time, the music was such a big variety of music that... I was into and that I like to play that went on from you know the obvious Chaka Khan thing over we have Phil Collins even to Peter Gabriel rock kind of stuff and even incorporating like at that time beginning of the 90s whatever came out of Logic Studios you know in Frankfurt like Snap and things like this I saw you on Twitter recently talking about. like 80s synth bands. Oh, yes. So that was also a big fan of ABC, Heaven 17, all these things. And well, some of their tracks are played, the more danceable stuff. But then again, you kind of had to watch the people and you couldn't really play too much stuff which was too complicated for them. And even some of the stuff of the early 80s or mid-80s pop stuff. is not really made for dancing, dancing, you know. Sometimes people need to hear something that they recognize. So you were rather playing a little SOS band or something like that to get them dancing. And then you started to try to play something else to keep them on the dance floor. And I think I really enjoyed that. And it was a time where I started to learn to beat match music that would BPM-wise sort of kind of fit together. But the challenge was you only had one pitch controller. So it was a really interesting time. And it took us kind of a year until we convinced the club owner to invest in another 12 tons. So we had two pitch controllers. The party is going to get much better, I promise, if we can get the 12 tons. And very quickly mentioning, next to the DJing, you were standing right next to the beer, what do you call it? The bar? Where you basically... Oh, the tap. The beer tap, yeah. Okay. So you, when there's loads... was loads of people in the club. You were not only the one who was DJing, you also had to get the beer tag going. And the funny thing was you were getting the hourly wage was one mark, German mark less than the bartender would get. You're doing twice the work. Well, no, the philosophy was you, you, you can do the music, which is the fun part. you don't really necessarily have to only bartend. Bartend is just like... which is considered work and the music was just like oh you're the easy guy doing that so you were getting actually one mark less than the bartenders get because you were allowed to do the music which was that was i'm i'm saying that because that was where they saw the dj you know it's just like this is not our main focus you know mainly there is music running that the people are in here feeling feeling nicely but uh else they should drink. That's the big thing. And then after a while, the Thursday became kind of popular because people... started to go out more and more on a Thursday. And I think I maybe also played an interesting music mix that it became interesting before there was nothing going on, basically. So people started to come Thursdays. And it became kind of a popular night then, Thursdays. So that was the nice thing. And parallel to that, to come to your question, I was enrolled at the university. Economics. Thing is, if I go back, I come out of a family with kind of no musical background. I've never learned an instrument. My older brother really was loads into... buying vinyl and loved music so so he was kind of my source of inspiration of of listening to his music but then I didn't really like his taste most of the time so I started to buy my own things so that was the base of music but that was it there was no instrument learned in the family like my brother learned a little bit guitar but as he learned it I was too young to be interested in it you know and things like this so I think my parents always wanted us to be in a serious kind of working environment like work at a bank or something like this you know they always thought the DJing thing was financially stable no they didn't really pay attention to the DJing thing I think they always thought it's a hobby in the beginning you know it's like yeah of course it's a hobby and I did a lot of other hobbies too I did a lot of sports as I was younger and things like this so you know the whole environment just like didn't let me even think to pursue some creative career and maybe go to university and do some art history class or whatever you know it was just like uh well i'm gonna do university i did my civil service at that time you had to choose like you had to do your military duty i didn't want to go to the military so the civil service that took one and a half years um and and i don't know maybe i was just This was right after The Wall came down as well. That was right after The Wall came. And when you graduated, you decided... You mean from school? Yeah. I never graduated from university. I got kicked out at some point. I think after like 20 semesters, which I wasn't present, I think I got a letter, you're ex-matriculiert, which means you're basically kicked out of the university. And I was like, oh, I didn't even know I'm still enrolled. You'd already been just DJing. Yeah, no, I actually opened the club then because the reason was I was DJing and I learned because we had a really good scene in Gießen. With techno, there was this record store called Downtown Records, which was really well sorted and all the latest things from everywhere, from all the distributions. So there was a source of great music. in the middle of the little city. Do you think that's just because Frankfurt was so close? I don't know, because if you look at it, at that time there were so many guys in Gießen interested in techno, even before I was, like Frank Lorber, Tony Rios, Pascal Feos, Johannes Heil, Heiko Lauchs. They're all coming out of this area, Gießen. And there was clubs already playing techno. And as I sometimes... I'm a really late starter. It takes me longer to do things, to understand things. I accepted that fact now over the years and I'm happy with it. How long did it take you to accept that? I don't know. Maybe I'm still accepting. But I'm happy with it because I look at some DJs who totally know what they want to do with 17 years old. I didn't know that. I never really thought of myself of I know what I want to become or what I want to do And so that's why I enrolled for economy in this university because my parents thought that's a good idea. And I was like, well, if you study that, you can still end up going anywhere. You know, it's not like as set as you would study like medicine or law or whatever. But immediately I noticed when I went to these two universities, sit there, I was like, I don't know. I just don't want to. to understand all this. And I'm just not interested in this. So I spent a lot of time in the record store. But the thing was we already had a functioning techno scene in Gießen going on with all these guys. So why did you decide to start a club then if you had sort of a functioning techno scene? Because I didn't have anything to do with the techno scene. In the record store I saw all these people and they were all looking at me. That's the commercial guy. Okay. They were looking at me like, that's the commercial guy, that's the guy who plays SOS Band and Jackson 5's Thursday nights. He does, well, sometimes I started then playing on Saturday nights too in that club. During the week I spent most of the time in the cafeteria of the university hanging out with all these people who also didn't go to university and spent the time in the cafeteria. There was always enough to do, you know. In the record store, like around '92, '93, I started to get more and more interested because also when playing I noticed I liked to play more the housey, more the faster stuff. In the record store, of course, you were hearing all the hothouse records, all the IQ stuff. And I was like, wow, that's really cool stuff. But I felt embarrassed to pick these records in front of all the techno guys because they were like, oh, now you're looking for our music. And so in the beginning, I actually bought these records like secretly. I asked the owner, Tommy, at that time of the downtown record store to just put it away so the others don't see it or put me there. latest records away because I felt embarrassed you know because I was, honestly, we had a sign in the club I was playing, there is no techno in this club. And the dancing person, like. Well, there you go. You know? Yeah. But that was not really my idea. It was a club owner's idea. Because he wanted to, you know, that was the time with all these James Brown is dead, crazy techno. Yeah. That's bored, you know. No, I mean, trying to draw the. crowd that he probably wanted. And I didn't really like that too, so that kind of techno. But then I discovered that and so I got into this. But then I was so much into that music and I couldn't play it in the place where I was playing. And I knew nobody's going to hire me as a techno DJ. So the only solution for me to play techno was to do my own club where I can hire myself. Spin club. That was the spin club. And this was just a night in a different... No, it was a club. It was a total building. I actually started to run a whole... everything. I needed to hire bartenders. I rebuilt the club. I hired bartenders. I did basically everything, basically in order to do the Saturday night on my own. So I actually know, I can tell you the date. It was the 23rd of January 1994, where it was the very first night where I played a techno set. 23rd or 21st was one of these. It was a Saturday. It was a success? The club was great. Problem was, that's partly the reason why I didn't really study economics. I can't. I'm just totally illiterate when it comes to... like making charts of how much can you spend where's your budget what to do I just I just don't want to deal with things like So when I was standing at the door, my bouncers usually told me, like, go away because you let everybody in for free. And I'm like, yeah, but I know these people. I can't charge them five marks or whatever. When I was standing behind the bar, I mean, you know all the people. You know, like, hey, have this beer. Oh, fuck. You know, pay later. So that was one of the issues that... You were bad for business. I was really bad for business. And the monthly rent for this place was just totally too much. This guy who owned the place was just like, he knew that I don't have an idea. So he was just charging me way too much money. And after one and a half years, I was totally bankrupt. The bank told me, we're not going to. give you any money anymore so I had to close down even that the club was running okay but it was just way too expensive like the big nights were Thursdays and Saturdays Thursdays we had a house night going on it was amazing with a great house DJ it's really good we had then starting to have some bookings I booked some people from at that time Discomania which was this distribution there was like some house people working there that really happy came to the club. It was really nice actually. And Saturdays, I then started to book the core techno DJs of Gießen. So I became kind of friends with them because they found out I'm really... You're not the guy who put that sign up. I'm serious about it. You know, I'm serious about it. I don't want to invade their territory for like... I just... I want to be nice. Yeah. But after one and a half years, that was over. Basically the club was the reason I didn't go to university anymore, to the cafeteria. And then after the club was bankrupt, there was the idea of, well, that was it with my music career. There is about 50,000 German marks which I have to pay. to the bank so I either go back to university try to get a job and pay that back or I get a job in the music industry kind of so you went for the music industry yeah I started IQ right I started to work at IQ yeah and because I was the only it was so funny I was the only one with kind of university background they immediately put me into the accounting it's like hey you did university I'm like well kind of well you can do the accounting we need you for He said, do you know what happened to the club that I was working at? You know? But that's basically how it came about. And that was in Frankfurt? That was in Offenbach. IQ was in Offenbach. But I was still living in Gießen, so in the morning at 8.30 I had to take the tour because you had to be there at 10 o'clock. It was pretty strict there at IQ. Wow, there were. Like, if you came in 5 past 10... The girl who was managing director, she was standing in front of you yelling at you, like, what, you're late, and things like this. It was pretty strict there. For the dance music industry, especially. Very interesting enough, yes. So you were working in accounts there then? Yes, in the beginning I was working in accounts. That's how I met Sven Veit actually. That's so funny because I had my own room. I had my own office and I had to do accounts. And then one day Sven came in. I still remember his bald head and his kind of little one ponytail on top of his head. He's like, hey, I'm Sven. You're Christoph. So I just want to introduce myself. Could you tell me how much money I'm getting for the last year? And I was sitting there like, yeah, super odd situation. Situations, you know, but that's that's he was already a legend. Oh, absolutely. He was totally legend But at that time I've never been to the Omen Club. Okay, still not Was it through the radio show that he was doing that you had sort of grown to know his name and obviously oh Well, just you couldn't escape his name. Well ready. No, you couldn't because Because with the techno, it was all about... Around Frankfurt, it was all about Sven. And everybody, of course, from Gießen, always went to go to Frankfurt to party. The thing was I didn't because I always had this club, you know, and I was never, I don't know why, maybe it was not out of interest or I was too lazy, but after three o'clock, four o'clock, when you close down the club, you know, I was like, I don't want to drive to Frankfurt anymore to see the Omen Club or whatever. And I only heard stories, you know, kind of. Were those stories pretty amazing? Yeah. They're all like, I don't believe what Sven was like. Not only Omen, there's Dorian Gray, there's like Music Hall, all these amazing clubs in Frankfurt with all these wild parties and everything. And I was like, well, that's Frankfurt. That's like 80 kilometers away. This is too far. Yeah. I want to do it here in Gießen in a smaller scale. I don't even know what they're doing. It was more like... Once you started working for IQ, though, you started going down to those parties? No. Still no? No, because then I didn't have a club anymore, but I actually made myself a little name as a DJ, as a techno DJ. So I started to have little bookings on the weekends around Gießen in small clubs. Okay. So mostly on Friday, I went... home and I didn't go back to Frankfurt over the weekend and it was only 96 that I actually decided to move to Frankfurt and that was already when I played in Ormond as a resident just for the job for the job because but everything else kind of started to be happening in Frankfurt for me there was nothing that kept me in Gießen anymore so Do you remember your first gig at Omen? Yeah, of course. Like it was yesterday. What were the circumstances behind you getting booked there? It was a Friday night. To that point, I only walked by the Omen one time the summer before because there was the tunnel rave in Frankfurt and we went there. That was the only time I went there after something was happening. in Gießen and I went to Frankfurt, it was the tunnel rave. So we looked at the tunnel rave and I actually walked by the Omen where Duck was playing at that moment. I remember it was six in the morning and I only had like a sneak peek inside. I was like, oh, that's the Omen. Oh, okay, interesting. And then like half a year, four months later, and I was already working at IQ then, and four months later I'm sitting in the office and... Friday night and I don't know you remember Paulie and good groove the like Paulie's now the A&R still for Cocoon Records and good groove He was the A&R at Harthouse at that time and they had a night at the Omen once a month It was just good groove and Paulie together these two and remember that Friday night Klaus came into my office and he was like, what are you doing tonight? And I'm like, nothing. And he's like, you know what? Pauli is really sick. He can't play with me tonight. I don't really want to play all night alone. I did ask everyone else, Frank Lorber, Tony Rios. They all have bookings. They're all somewhere. You do DJ techno, right? And I'm like, yeah. could you just come play the first hour? Because then I'll have a little bit more time, maybe two hours and then I come. I'm sure, yeah, of course I can do that. I was like, wow, I got a booking at Omen tonight, okay. Then be there at 11. So I went back home, I got my records and I drove back to Frankfurt and I remember I didn't really find it at the first time. So I was even late. The club opens at 11. I remember I came like... 20 past 11 they were already like where is the DJ and then I went downstairs I remember meeting Ravi and Karl Heinz the managers of the club and I was like really super shy and I was like hi Klaus asked me to DJ first hour and they're like sure we'll do it you know so I went up and I was standing there and I was like okay that's the club and it was basically the first time that was in there and I started playing and People started to come in and I always kind of feel comfortable when I play music. I never really, still today, when I come into a club, I don't really feel comfortable. I don't know, I just want to play then. I want to be busy playing because it still hasn't changed. I'm not the super socializing guy. And I played and then Klaus came and things were going good. People were dancing. So he was like, oh, keep playing. fun and I ended up playing basically till five or something and then he started always went on long in the omen and everybody was happy and the managers were happy I went down I think they even gave me 50 marks I was like I even get money for this wow this is great and they're like hey we heard it was kind of nice what you did give me a phone number and maybe we call you again and that's how that started and that's how I got the residency because they called me like on Wednesday they again asked me can you come Friday because Duck's gonna be late so you were just filling in everyone I was filling in all the time until in November 20 20 I think 25th of November 1995 I was mentioned on the flyer first time you remember all these dates these dates I remember because they're like they were like I remember, well, you're not the first one to ask me how I started and how I went on. And as I told that, as I tried to get all these dates together the first time, I remembered, wow, these are really important dates in my life. And that's automatically, I remember that. And I still have that flyer, you know, from the November 95 flyer from the Omen. What was Omen like? One floor? Two floors? One floor and a chill-out cafe, basically. Just one floor. When it was super busy, at one point, it was suited. when it was super busy. At that time an amazing sound system, an amazing DJ booth, like something I of course never have seen before, never played on before. A Rodec mixer MX-180 with super heavy knobs on the EQs you had really had to push like "rraaah" bass in, "rraaah" bass out. and two turntables, and that was it. Yeah, and sometimes when... was playing there added a third turntable. Sure. Yeah. So it was pretty basic club. Kind of basic but nice in a nice way. Well there was a design in there. There was like it was really nice with the walls and they made it really really really nice. It was really nice underground. Very special atmosphere at any time of the day. or at night you had a certain kind of people coming in, you know, in the morning when it started to get light, you had like really the underworld of... Frankfurt sitting on the bar, you know, but they're all friendly and peaceful there. It all came together there. I rarely heard of any fights or any bad things happening in the club, you know. And a wild crowd. The dance floor right in front of you. Perfect, perfect setup. The DJ booth, I remember, had kind of this triangle form and it was just like this pure energy triangle thing. kind of thing it was really nice and for me basically because I was the warm up DJ when there was guest DJs so you had to pace yourself you know warm up even when the club was already kind of full you didn't really want to overdo it because you wanted for the main booking DJ or for whoever comes on then, or Sven was playing after you, of course you were trying to keep it down, you know. Or the cool-down DJ. Basically when the guest DJ, for some stupid reason, some guest DJs, especially from England, they always only played two hours. And, you know, it's like this English DJ way of DJing, one hour or two. hours which was for us resident DJs is amazing because you were like warming up for them you knew they're playing there two hours and then you would have another five six hours until in the morning to go crazy and that was an amazing DJ school you know you've learned to pace yourself you've learned to respect what the resident DJ is playing and I think that was really really really amazing and you've learned how to a certain mood in the morning and things like that. Were you starting to produce by that time? I actually released my first co-production because I never, as I began producing, I produced with a friend together. My first co-production came out actually end of 95. I started producing before I started. playing at the OM because I found out that techno is actually kind of a music that you can do yourself. Wow! I never had that. You know, because not growing up with a musical history in the family, you never learn an instrument, you have no idea how what it takes to produce a record. And every time I DJed in the early years, I was like, wow, you must have at least 100 people involved in one of these projects to release a record. There's some people singing. You have to have the big studios and whatever. So I had no idea. And then in between to make a little bit more money, I also, after IQ went bankrupt. I started to work for various like Discomania you know just in their storage thing just pulling records packing this and doing this you got to know producers of music and I remember that I was walking around it's like you somebody came in it's like you produced that record like tell me how there's a vocal on there how did you do that how did you have some girl coming in and doing uh and you put this on a record and it was really like I had no idea And that was the first contacts I got. And it was Andre that you did first? Andre Walter was the guy then that we said, well, we kind of built up that studio near Gießen. And I basically worked together with him until 2004. Tell me a little bit about, especially early on, your working relationship. Was he sort of the one at the controls and you were like... Well, he was the one with the hardware. He had an incredible collection of nice hardware. Good synths, you know, all the corks, sequential circuits, like good stuff. The studio was not really set up. So in the very beginning, it was also Tony Rios, the three of us, and the owner of the Downtown Records store, which I talked about in the beginning. We decided, like, let's set up a nice studio and set up a label and do that. It was Soap Records in the beginning. And let's produce music together. I had no idea. So Andre was the guy who knew how the hardware was working. And at that time, software was not really the complicated issue. There was Notator. We were working with Notator on an Atari ST where you just had these little blocks that you were moving of media information that were basically triggering the synths and little sampler, which you can sample like maybe 30 seconds. or 20 seconds and you would have that on a loop or whatever. So in that time I started to learn a little bit of him how the hardware works but I kind of was directly the one who was always sitting in the computer and kind of trying working on the arrangements and if we needed a sound I was like could you make it maybe a little bit more like that more like that and I tried to learn how he did it and But then the software evolved, we got our first Mac in. So the way we were working, it was kind of like he was mostly with the hardware and I was mostly sitting in front of the software. So like Ableton Live, for example, I remember we got version 1.5 was the first version I was working. So you were learning. I was getting better at the software and he was perfect at the hardware and also learning the software. I was learning a little bit the hardware. So that's the way we worked. The way that you often talk about production is you talk about how you have to DJ on the weekends almost because that's the inspiration to come back into the studio. You know, that's exactly why you were sort of doing the arrangements because you're like, this is, I can tell you from experience, this is going to totally work. Yes, you need to have it like this because I just played last weekend and I, yeah, that was, I mean, for me, it was the logical step to produce when you DJ. I don't know if it's for any... anyone else but for me the dj was like i want to create an atmosphere that people can dance in nice um but then you get to a point that with the music you have from other people you can create that atmosphere to a certain point to a certain level but you're always like, I could get more out of this if I had a tune which kind of would go like this. Right. So I can't rely on finding that tune randomly in a record shop. Waiting six months, a year, two years, ever to find it. Yeah. So basically, I have to do it on my own. And I found this like, I just, for me, it was so out there to have a vinyl in your hand, which has your music on there. For me, that was completely like something this is, how does that work? Yeah. Yeah. So when you were, do you feel like there was a certain point at which you finally started to get the hang of it, that you started putting out records that you were like, yes, this is, I'm getting it. It's working. Or was it immediate with the stuff that you're doing? Or are you not there yet still? Yeah. Thanks. Yes, exactly. I don't think I'm there yet. Yeah. But there were records on audio. There were records that I'm really happy with, of course. Yeah, there were records I'm really happy with. Of course there's stuff I'm happy with, but... looking back, I still feel like I'm just starting. But I accepted that fact as well. It's so exciting. It's the same with the DJing. I still feel like it's just the beginning. I guess that's also a function, though, of the fact that... technology is moving so fast that it keeps resetting you in a way. Yes. I am just starting because this piece of machinery is left to be it. Machine is new and incorporated. Was there a certain record that sort of broke you as a name? Like the people kind of early on like, oh. Yeah, that was as I started my label Audio. Audio number seven basically was kind of my little underground hit. Do you remember when you made that in the studio? Yeah, it was. basically it was done pretty quick I remember we made it in two days I remember because of a wrong setting we recorded it completely in mono and we didn't even we didn't even notice that until half a year later someone told me it's like do you actually know that your record is completely mono I'm like no never noticed that yeah that's that's what I meant to do It's pretty. But maybe that even helped to have a really straight sound in the club. Because some club systems at that time used to be mono anyways. So you didn't waste any energy on some stereo signals. And it was a pretty forward techno record. it up audio seven called dandu groove And at that time I was already thinking strategically because that was the first record where I told Andre your name on there. I'm just gonna put my name on there because then I'm gonna get a little bit maybe more recognition as a producer and maybe more bookings and you don't want to DJ anyway so for you it doesn't really matter and then the money that maybe I'll make extra will can get more. you know, this was strategic thinking. That was nine end of 96. I interviewed Timo Moss earlier this year. And he sort of said, the same thing when he was working with Martin Buttrich. It was like, they were like, well, you're the one who DJs. Might as well put your name on it. Yeah. Bring all the money back to the studio. I never really felt comfortable with this idea because I always thought like, you know, it's kind of lying, you know, because you actually did this record. But then again, I... I apologize to myself because I was saying, well, if you look at the label copy. you know then of course our both names are on there and the money goes all the money that's made from the record goes anyways into the studio and into financing my production partner because that's how it basically turned out andre was always feeling more comfortable in the studio he didn't want to set up a live set or beware of djing you know so i was like okay if you help me produce records I'll help you to make a living, you know. We'll find a way that I just basically pay you, you know, via the DJ gigs and whatever we make. with the money and that worked for quite a while this was around 97 97 98 2000 so was the the birth of clr also kind of uh let me put my name on it to sort of increase the now the name clr or at that time chris leaving recordings was just totally made out of a lack of creative on my side of finding a label name because I had to quickly find a label name. The label Audio I ran together with a company that I was working then at, it was at that time called Undercover Music Group and I wanted to go away from there. It was just too much. I didn't really... like the company philosophy where they went to and so I wanted to leave. I wanted to basically leave, take my label with me until they told me, it's not your label. We've paid all the bills. We can prove it's our label. And it's like, but it's my label. I made it here. And it's like, yeah, but we financed it for you. And it's our, we have the rights. Look at the contracts you signed. I'm like, oh, so I don't own audio. Okay, well, crap. And I already had to deal with the Prime distribution in England at that time, which was the biggest distribution for techno. It's like, I really wanted to. be there where it happens, you know. And I wanted to go there. They were interested in taking on audio. So then I had to tell them, like, sorry, I would still like to come, but I don't have a label right now. Were you not working with soap so much anymore? Well, soap went a little bit like Tony took over that. It was getting more housey and I was developing myself into more techno. Again, I had this drive into the more driving direction of music. I really liked house. I mean, we made some really cool records also with Marshall Jefferson and things like that. It's a lot of fun. I still love that kind of music. Just mushrooms? Yeah, mushrooms. I remember hearing that track in a club recently. I was like, what is going on with this? And then the guy told me it was Chris Liebet. And I was like, is that possible? Yeah, yeah. No, it's, I don't know. I also love that. But you have to concentrate on one thing, you know. Time is limited. And I really, then I set a priority to more the driving techno, which I also like. I was with my girlfriend down in Florida. She took me to this place. All kinds of things growing. And she gave me something. It was a mushroom. Eat it. I said, mushroom? What's that? Eat it. I didn't think, no, she was kind of a wild. I didn't think she was that wild, so I ate the mushroom. I said, it doesn't taste like mushroom. Yeah, well, they told me, well, then set up a new label, but we already have everything set up and you need a label name now. I'm like, oh my God, you know, audio just came to me. It was organically, it was like, wow, this is like, this is, I want to keep it simple, audio. is like I listen. Yeah. Period. Yeah. And that's all you should do. Not distracted by any fancy artwork, just black label name, number, I listen. Done. So what am I going to do now? Call it, see, that's what I mean. It's like I didn't want to come with an artificial, just like, oh, I'm kind of. something banana records now which doesn't have any meaning no point so I was like let's just call it after my name but I was never really happy with that and it wasn't it wasn't intended to make myself bigger with the label name or something like this it's just like bait basically kind of necessity to have a label name so I called it CLR you didn't release a ton of records on the label in the early days it was like maybe three a year for a long time Were you just focusing so much more on your DJing career? No, I was very picky. And I actually still, I am very picky. I remember reading an interview with you where you said that you sometimes reject your own tracks. You send yourself back to the studio. Yeah, I am the artist that I have rejected most of the times on my own label. But listening back, it's like, no, I can't release that. good yeah but it made me i think i think i have to say it made me a a good anr i mean maybe i'm picky but i i know i pretty much know what i want to release on the label and if i get sent in like something from artists that i work together with like like regularly release on the label I'm kind of pretty good in kind of directing them into a direction where I think hey could be better if you sit back work on it and then we'll get there together you know and I kind of can do it in a way that you don't feel pressured or that you have to do it but in it in a kind of a way like, oh yeah, maybe it's an idea. Let's look into that. And it works really nicely. It takes more time. You have less releases. But the quality control is higher. Yeah. At least what I think quality is. Not necessarily everybody agrees with that. Around the turn of the century then, I mean, what... Were you... Where were you in your career, did you think? I mean, did you feel like you were, you said, you know, CLR, New Beginnings, as though you were going off into somewhere else? Again, by the way, the first CLR record, I think, is a terrible record. The New Beginnings was just like, the same as the label name, where you had to be quick and I had to do something because I really didn't want to. I didn't want to waste the chance to work with Prime and they were already like, well, we should start something else. I was like, okay, we need to really quickly do something. I seem to misjudge myself all the time where I'm standing and what I'm doing and where I'm at at this moment. But around the 1999... 1999 I was doing a radio show it was the Evosonic it was like a satellite radio station which was kind of fun because it was only electronic music it's based in Cologne and it was satellite So you could listen basically in whole Europe to it. And they kind of started to have really good followers. But I think in the end it was just running out of money. Yeah. I mean, I guess... you're taking sort of inspiration from Sven and other people who, you know, through their radio shows became quite a bit bigger. And as a satellite, you know, as you said, it goes across all Europe. Yeah. You're reaching people. I don't know, Holland and Spain and other places that might have never heard your name before. Well, you were reaching people who kind of were listening to this radio station, but it's already a niche thing. So that was people who were interested in electronic music. and yes if they tuned in Friday afternoons I always had my show from 5 till 7 a 4 hour thing 3 to 7 sorry I remember I always had to leave latest at 1 o'clock in Frankfurt otherwise I would be late for my radio show it's crazy schedules I did and So you did it live? Yeah, yeah, it was always live. I always had to drive there. I was in the studio and I had to play basically four hours of music and talk. That's what I already liked to do there. And then you would have a gig later on? Maybe later on. If I was lucky, I had a booking somewhere and I would drive there then, yes. Did you feel like the bookings picked up over time? Yeah, definitely. Oh, that already picked up with my Omen thing. Like, I remember what impact the Omen had. Suddenly you got calls of, like, even outside Germany. Omen, hey, can we book you? Not necessarily because they heard me play, but they wanted... to put Omen behind my name on their flyers so they have that connection. And I guess that's how it works. And I was happy I got my gigs. I remember my first, I think, outside gig was also because of the Omen was at Complex London at that time. Complex London had kind of a resident exchange DJ program with the Omen. Which Sven initiated. So every month one of their resident DJs kind of came over to play at the Omen and vice versa. What was the difference? You said that, you know, the guest DJs in the UK would come and play for two hours. Yeah. And you were always kind of like, how does this work? Well, the American DJs like Woody McBride or people at that time, yeah, they played two hours and they only wanted to play two hours somehow. There were rarely DJs from the... who had even the thought that you could play longer. Was that the biggest difference between sort of the German DJs? Yes, absolutely. German DJs just grew up playing long sets. And for some reason in England, I think that this clubbing scene was way more advanced. So DJs, early DJs there, like... I think the thing was they always had like three, four gigs a night. So the schedule was like you play an hour there, you play an hour there. I remember one time I ended up, that was 96, I ended up with David Holmes. You remember him? Doing like giving him company because there was Hardhouse or IQ London where I ended up going a lot. because I was one of the few people at IQ Germany who were able to speak fluently English, because I spent one year in the States one time. So they sent me over to England sometimes. I sometimes stayed over the weekend. David Holmes was a good friend at IQ London. He said, well, why don't you come along? And I remember he was doing five gigs, and every gig was like, you jump into the club, he's playing for one hour, you just get in the car, get to the next. club and I was like wow that's an interesting scene an interesting approach it seems strange because you know you go into a club you don't know exactly what might have been played before or what's going to play after nothing totally strange yeah and it's like you never play longer than like three four hours no And I rarely hear that from other countries. I think Germany has kind of this tradition of like, I think it becomes also out of the, like Omen was like, why should we book more DJs? There is a DJ, just play longer. Yeah. It was not so focused on the DJ or the name. It was, you know, people came to the Omen because it was, of course, Sven Sven was playing and Doug was playing. A whole different story. People came. these two people but and maybe some some guest djs but else the club was doing well a lot of times as well only if residents were playing because the people didn't really like care too much of course cared about the DJs who were playing and if the mood was good they kept remembering like who was playing but first reason to go there was it was the omen let's have a fun night you know I think there that's definitely changed that I mean nowadays there's only a few clubs in the world that it's just the club almost over the DJ And even at Berghain where you played last week, that is one of those clubs but at the same time it was way more packed than it usually is for you obviously because it's one of those situations now where you're maybe some things that are interesting for a lot of people come together but I also think that you're right Berkheim is one of the few clubs that people go for Berkheim as well but it bred its own DJs which became so popular that Now maybe some people go for Ben Klock and not necessarily for Burkheim. You feel like you were an Omen DJ in a way. At that time, back then? Back then? Yeah. Oh, totally. Everything I produced was based on my experiences at Omen. Like Audio 7, that record, was just made for playing at main time at Omen. That was the only thing I had in mind. Maybe I'm limited with my thinking. That's why I'm telling you like... I need these weekends to be like for the studio because I'm just imagining myself standing at maybe, I don't know, eight in the morning at Berghain, just imagining like the vibe. I remember that vibe and I'm just like, what would I play now? How should that sound? Okay. And I kind of try in the studio to tweak it that way. And if I'm lucky, I'll somehow get there. Yeah, that's the source of inspiration that happened in the Omen as well. So basically all the releases I had there inspired by Omen. So how did you go from, you know, Omen to becoming, 2003 I think it was, the Germany's best DJ. How did you go to become a French DJ? I have no idea. I think because Omen was basically next to whatever was happening in Berlin, of course, with Tresor, E-Work and everything. Omen was one of the clubs in Germany. And I didn't really know that again this time because I wasn't really so, you know, I didn't grow up with the whole techno scene. I was always a little bit the outsider. Also in the omen because I was coming from a different background. Techno was not the first music I grew up with. I just discovered it basically. I kind of by accident ended up in this club. You know, there was... people probably on the dance floor who had way more history in techno music than I had and still have. But then again, being an outsider, maybe let me go in there with a little bit different perspective of things. And I wanted to do it kind of my way. I also, of course, you were looking at what others were DJing or were playing and what was working. But I still wanted to do my own thing. Before my first night at the Omen, I really had no idea what they're playing there. You'd never been there? No. And I heard this, of course, various sets by Sven or other people. But I didn't. So I think that was a good thing. I think that helped me to be a little bit different than the original. And that helped me a little bit. Was the bookings in Germany, were you focusing so much on other German cities to build up your profile within Germany? No, I was just happy for every booking. Just every booking. Yeah, and if you heard of a good club, I... beginning I did it myself and then I was then I I kind of got a little help by a little booking agency that was connected to IQ okay in the beginning that was a guy called Michael who ran that chaos booking agency in the beginning he was also one of these guys who were really skeptical like who's this this is an outsider he's not like he's not coming from our family kind of thing you know and I totally understand that move and you know it's like what what does he want here He's not kind of one of us. But I kind of also started to be accepted, so he started to take over some bookings. And of course you were always like, hey, could you book me to this place in East Germany? I heard there's great parties. And I know if I could play there once, I could convince them that I maybe can play again. You always had this... always really eager I was always like I really want to go there I want to go there but then again you were happy for every for every gig you got were you so there was no strategy behind it that's what I want to say right you couldn't choose like okay how about we focus on Munich now and then we go to Berlin or something like that right right And eventually Cocoon was booking you for a little bit. Well, 2000 as Cocoon started, or 99, 99 I think, or 98, Sven started the idea of Cocoon and the booking agency and everything. And as he started, he asked me if I want to be on board of Cocoon booking. And I did, yeah. I played the first two seasons of Amnesia Cocoon. How did that go? It was interesting. I remember the first season there was only four dates. I think it was 99. It must have been 99. And it was unheard of for people to play techno. It's very much a house. And you have to really admire Sven and his crew to pull this through because at that time people were laughing about it. And Lisa is like, come on, this is a sunny island. People want to hear a little bit of trancy, housey things and not your Frankfurt, no underground omen sound. And at that time it was really techno, you know. Yeah, it was, yeah. Well, it's still today really techno. But people were not used to it. And they just believed in it. Sven believed in it and pulled it through. And that's why all the success there is today on Ibiza for Cocoon at Amnesia is based on the will to really make it there. That's a great achievement. It seems like as Sven, though, has gotten a little bit lighter in tone, that you went harder and a little bit darker. Was there a certain moment in which you realized that that was more interesting to you as an avenue that you were trying to... you were playing Schranz. Well, I called it that way. Yeah? And it has nothing to do with what most people think that is. You would probably laugh if I tell you I played Schranz and Berghain on Saturday, Sunday, Monday. That was it. stupid word let's just not use it anymore but for me I just wanted to describe and that was basically at this radio show which I did from 97 till 99 every Friday four hours I started play easy stuff in the beginning and then I went to and I was really fascinated by what came out of downwards came out out of all these English dark labels, Blueprint, Surgeon, all this stuff. Basically, this hasn't changed all the day. It's so funny. We still do exactly the same thing, only the methods of producing maybe sound better now today, and it's a little bit fine-tuned. But in the end, it's exactly the same. the same message and what I wanted to describe and that was because the word came so famous and it was because I was using it in the radio show to say like now the sound is I really what I really like about the record you know that was not necessarily fast some of the downwards records of you know female or whatever it was just like slow really distorted crunchy stuff and I wanted to try to put this into one word and shredding that is this is like you know and doesn't necessarily need to be fast it's just dark and dirty. And in the end, it's exactly the same thing that I'm still looking for. Yeah. Yeah. You certainly became associated with pretty fast. Well, yeah, I wanted to, the energy to be combined with this dirty, dark stuff. One of the interesting things I read that you sort of said, um, interviews that it had to be that fast because of the likes almost the limits of the hardware in creating these sounds that it had to be that fast to have the energy that you wanted and once the means of production got good enough you could slow down because you could still have that sort of energy I don't know if that's... Maybe I misread that. No, no, no. You're totally saying it right. But this is the way I would explain it. We were compensating energy by making the record faster. And now at some point you were able to make the bass much fatter in your studio because of your production. the sound systems in club got became better and better and better to basically hear that bass or maybe i don't know i i could be totally wrong but that's that's my take on it yeah so so it was never about the tempo the tempo was just like let's get that energy in and We'll just do loops which are a little bit faster than we have that energy. And now I'm able to basically have the same amount of energy but via other means. With a bass. It's just a heavy bass that compensates the speed. Now, going back to that, you know? I don't know. Can you identify a time at which maybe the tempo went down a little bit? It was kind of the time that minimal started to appear. Was this around the time that you did the album with Speedy J? Or a little bit after that? Yeah, yeah. 2004, 2005. When did you originally meet him? 2001. I asked him to do a remix for me for a record on CLR. And I didn't know him at that time, but I... I knew that Stefan Charles was doing some of his bookings for Germany and Stefan and me were good friends. We know each other well. So, and Stefan actually tried to promote Jochem a little bit more. So he actually came to me and said like, I'm booking Jochem if you want to do something with him. And I'm like, oh, I would love to have a remix of him. Could you ask him? And he's like, sure, I can ask him. I was so extremely nervous then, back then, because for me, Jochem is that big hero. Of course he still is. I actually managed to talk to him. was agreeing to do a remix so he did the remix we got along so well so one time he was playing live and that's how the Collapse thing started he was playing live and I was supposed to DJ after him and I just started to DJ while he was still playing live And he was like, you don't want to do a break or an intro? And I was just like, keep playing. Keep playing. I'll play on top of you. And after two hours, hey, now you play alone. Hey, but that was a lot of fun. We should do that again. Wow. I felt proud. I was playing two hours together with Speedy J. I forced it on him. What does he, when you play together, you know, what does he bring to the table that you don't? And what do you bring to the table that he doesn't? What are your sort of, you know? that is two aspects that go really nicely together. He brings to the table his crazy knowledge of sonic. developing sounds as a life act, you know, this whole idea of hardware, to tweak it, to go crazy with it, kind of a little geeky way to go at it, you know, it's just like go crazy with the details, you know, like just out there, music, with this life act. but maybe lacking a little bit of stage presence. You know, just like basically behind his machines and working like very serious on his machines. And there was I, not knowing really how these machines work, but knowing how to turn on the turntable and to put the records on and partying, just having fun. So we had the great combination of a great sound, which he's kind of leading, with me entertaining the people. having the hands in the air. And it was great to see over the years that we played together, to see this even out. Right. Do you find that you're getting more into the hardware stuff? Oh, absolutely. I mean, we developed the whole nerdy setup together and I'm so into that. And suddenly we found ourselves that I was nerdily tweaking knobs while he was standing next to me like with both hands in the air partying. And I was like, wait a minute. Wasn't that totally the other way around two years ago, you know? And I think that was really working well together. So I learned from him. He learned from me. But two different aspects. That's interesting. So... I guess a couple years ago you sort of started to focus a little bit more on the label. I guess 2009, 2008, around there. What was the moment that you sort of stepped back? for a moment and said, you know, we need to really get back to or restart or do more with this. Well, mostly it was external factors like distributors who went bankrupt. I mean, with the label CLR, I already had two distributors going bankrupt on me and totally losing all the money that you make on the label because with Prime it was really like I just released my only album that I've done so far in my life I've just released it it sold really well like vinyl and CDs like everything was amazingly and just basically before the day I got paid from the distribution Prime went bankrupt you know it happens luckily I was never really depending on the money that comes in from the label because I was always getting kind of financing everything I did DJ gigs. And so, yeah, so that was already a moment that we, Stefan Charles and I, we tried to set up a new distribution basically based on Prime to maybe basically continue their business and maybe even... rescuing some of the money that you know we've lost there because we just took over a whole lot of stock and tried to do this that was a phase where I tried to basically own a distribution totally stupid thought Again, there was again this about 2008 where we had to restart new also because of my private setup. We became our second child, second daughter and my wife used to take care of all the business sides and all the label issues. So there was less time. to take care of it and for some reason it was always a good flow so we the right like the right situations ended up meeting the right people at the right time to continue whatever it is with the new ideas and that's where we kind of had the idea also like let's do kind of a relaunch for the label yeah it's about time Yeah. One of the guys who sort of started around that time is Michael. And I was talking to him earlier today and he said that. you know you took him he didn't have a job at the time and you said come with me for a weekend see what it's like because he thought in the back of his mind chris leaving is he still alive maybe is he still djing mainstream you know what is he doing yeah that was what's the deal yeah And then he went out that weekend and he realized, oh, this is what you're doing. This is what you're able to do. I think he said you played in a club in Italy, maybe? And that he was so surprised at what you were able to play. Yeah. The reality as opposed to what the mentality or the perception was. Did you know that there was a perception about you? I'm still really sometimes shocked what people were thinking. But maybe because I was never really like thinking the strategic way too much, you know. I really strongly believe if you have fun what you're doing and you really do it from heart, you know, even if it may be commercial stuff, you in the end will be at some point successful. And successful doesn't really mean you're going to be rich and famous and successful in, you're going to have a happy life doing what you're doing, you know. And if you have that, the odds are quite good that you actually can make a living out of it, you know. And so I was never really, you know, I was never really thinking like, oh, is that not cool? cool enough for me to play there, you know, is that event maybe not cool enough or is that not cool enough if I play together with this DJ, you know, I was rather looking at the music, do I like the music? Yes. Do I like the music? No. And if it's yes, I do it and even if most people maybe consider it as uncool, which maybe I wouldn't have done it then, but I didn't know, you know, it's like I'm a little bit... I never really, even today, I never really look around in the internet trying to find out, other than my Facebook or my Twitter account, to see what people are thinking about. Because I think it's irrelevant. Maybe it's not so irrelevant. Maybe I would have maybe made... some things not that would not put this reputation on me that I have has still have for a long time you know that I had great talks at Berghain again with the people from Berghain they were like man years ago never book you like you know what we thought what you're doing it's like why well you because you were playing in Berlin for these and this and this and this club didn't you know that you're gonna get a shitty reputation because of this and I'm just like no I didn't think of this this way yeah but now I realize yeah that's true I did and and same with Michael he was like I mean he was running a club in Darmstadt he was running so many things he I think Dice was one time working for him in the office you know and and he he comes from as the minimal thing got really big people started probably to think the techno thing is completely gone but it wasn't I was always busy I always had great gigs. But nobody really noticed that. And as Michael, as we came across, he was like... well, another DJ whose career is over, who wants a little help, but I was, only half a year later we talked about that. And he was like, you know what I thought about you? I was like, really? Do people think that? Yeah. Wow. Interesting. It's fascinating. I mean, I think it's so much. associations you know you're talking earlier about how you put omen behind your name and that became an association people wouldn't necessarily see you they'd just see omen and think great that's what we'll get yes one of the for me i have to admit one of the things that kind of brought you to my attention was the podcast that you're doing and seeing the people that you were picking for the podcast and I there were like every once in a while I'd see someone I'd be like I had no idea that Chris Liebing was into this you know And it's fascinating. So I began to, you know, pay more and more attention. And of course the label, the stuff that you guys have been releasing has been, in my opinion, way more experimental than I... would think that you would release for the past couple of years. Yeah, I wonder myself. Was it a conscious decision to sort of do these things or was it just a kind of natural progression? I want to do a podcast. I'll get my friends like earlier when you were like, I want Adam Byer to play alongside me. It just made sense to you. It just makes sense. You know, the thing is, I started to do this Episonic Radio. And this is, I think, part of me wants to talk. Part of me wants to get my message out. It's my ego. I want to get my message out. And that's why I really love to do radio because I could take the microphone and say like, hey, great, this track I'm playing now is made from this guy. It's so amazing. And I played it there. And the guy told me that as he recorded that track, you know, I really, I'm interested in background of music, you know? Yeah. Like, that's why I look at like documentations out of the 80s because I want Heaven 17 was sitting in the studio doing this track, how they were thinking, it's just not enough to listen to it. I want to have some background. So I assume everybody wants that. which is not the case. I talk too much. I hear that all the time. I'm sure this will do wonders for your reputation. Yeah. And the radio was for me a great way to talk. Of course, always the radio people were standing behind me. Hey, your two minutes is over. You have to let the music run now. I always hated that. And as Evo Sonic was over, I started... a radio show with Pauli together in Frankfurt on kind of this official Hesse Rundfunk radio. We did this for three years. So much fun. Thursday nights. You know, we always, some DJs who were playing Friday nights in Frankfurt, we managed to talk them into flying in Thursday nights. So we had always great guests on the show. We were always talking. super long you know we basically use duct tape to put it over the red light which indicates you should stop talking and I really like that and then but that was over at some point and I was like there was radio stations on Ibiza that were still I love to do radio with so we produced a show every week to run it in Ibiza on a radio station which maybe it was running at night and maybe 10 people were listening to it and at some point like we I did this every week you know putting a show together and at the last radio station that would run it is a station on Ibiza and at some point I was like, why don't we just do this as a podcast? Like three years ago or two and a half years ago, why don't we just do the same thing as a podcast, you know? It's so easy. I do the work anyways and we just set it online and then more people have access to it. And that's how the podcast came about. It's just sort of a natural progression, I think. With the label, now you did Tommy47's album. Are there other artists that are sort of... becoming CLR artists that are really becoming really associated with the label that you kind of want to build up with the platform. Yeah, there's definitely Monologue, for example, and Brian Zanhaji, who's been our reliable life act for years now. The three of us actually share a whole kind of a studio let's call it complex you know we have our own studios but it's all in in one story of a house and so there's a lot of interacting going on and we influence each other of course but it's amazing for the label work you know you can first they know other people again who do great music so get into contact for example Empty Set Sasha Monologue came to me he's like hey listen to that stuff that's really out there so I started to contact them and they were like oh really you're interested in our music what isn't that a little bit our music is just processed noise and sinus waves that are put through plug-in I'm like yeah that's cool I really want to release something like this so there's a there's we have a great cell of of in in the middle of in the heart of Frankfurt where we share our studio spaces and and have a good connection and so this is basically the core but there is more you know there's I don't really necessarily take it from the point of view that I want to work with people who make great music for the label I want to work with people that I get along with that I like and then eventually the music will be cool too and if not I tell them so there's for example Juan Pablo Piazza Argentina he's been really amazing lately just has a coming release now on uh, stroposcopic artifacts and, uh, there's stuff we was visiting me in the studio there's stuff we're gonna be working closer together but I don't really have a plan it just basically works out I think if you little plan of course we have with release plans and everything and where we want to get with a label and things like this but then again I don't really have a big business plan I think you know if there's talent coming up like Tommy with this album and everything. If I had a big plan which lasts two years, there would have been no room for a guy like Tommy just to suddenly appear with this great music to do this album and to do this, you know, and then to... I think that's the great time in the digital age. You don't really have to plan so far ahead because... have a track and you release it and we're still doing vinyl of course but the vinyl always takes longer now you know it actually it's you know it seems like it's much more like the early days of techno in a way in that you know there was less of a business plan and you would get a record you'd put it out yes very quickly yes And as it became more and more professional and distributors were getting involved in all of this stuff, you had these release plans that were six months a year out. And now with digital, it's back again. Except the sales are not the same. Well, I used to lose all my money with failing distributors. Now I don't make it in the first place, so who cares?
