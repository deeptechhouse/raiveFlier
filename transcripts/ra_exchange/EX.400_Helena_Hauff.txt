Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. Our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Mark Smith and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. So this week marks the 400th episode of The Exchange. You might remember that we marked number 100 with Ricardo Villalobos, 200 was with Sven Veit and 300 was with Larry Heard. For number 400, we've got Helena. A German DJ and producer who's taken the scene by storm over the past five-odd years. She feels like an essential subject at this time. As dance music steadily becomes an ever more slick and cynical industry, Huff feels like a beacon of authenticity. Her sound is marked by often ferocious strands of electro-EBM and techno. But the uncompromising approach hasn't stopped her from becoming busier than many of her more palatable contemporaries. For a top-flight DJ, she's remarkably relatable. She seems immune to the charms of fame, which is further endeared her to her fans and admirers. For someone with such a relaxed demeanor, you might think that all of the success has come down to random chance. But Halfa's placed all her energy into getting where she is today, and as Will Lynch heard when he traveled to meet her at Hamburg, if it all ended tomorrow, she'd probably go back to working in a bar. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges at residentadvisor.net, and follow us on SoundCloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Helena Houth is up next. So this is where you make your music, right? That's your studio in the next room. Yeah. Can you sort of paint a picture for me? When you're making a track, how does it kind of come together in terms of your routine and what does the process look like, you know, if I was a fly on the wall? I kind of get started. I either have an idea. already what I want to do and then I try to get that into sound or I just start plating around and normally I start with drums or rhythm and then I see where it takes me and there's something there then I start recording it and yeah so I jam and then I start recording it at some some point Am I right in thinking you have kind of like a tight array of machines that you like to use? Like you use the same few machines on most of your stuff? Yeah, I don't have that much stuff. So I always use the same machines and try to get new sounds out of them if possible. Or I don't have much space, so I can't. I would love to have more synthesizers, but I don't. have more space. And what are your go-to devices back there? A8, an MPC 2000, Juno, Juno 60, and Alpha Juno, and a 33. Naturally. Yeah. I guess on a simple level, just what is it about? those machines and also the kind of small simple setup that works for you it's pretty um intuitive and very simple to use and i i started making music on a computer and i didn't really like it because i I had too many options and it kind of confused me at the beginning. And then when I started buying machines, they're so limited that you can only really have one sound. It really helped me to focus and get something out of them really quickly. It seems to me like you have kind of an interesting relationship with technology in the sense that there's some that you don't like. And there's some that you have a very deep affinity for. For instance, I've read you saying that you just kind of don't like computers. But then at the same time, it seems like machines have some kind of special magic for you. I don't know, would you say that's true? Probably, yeah. I like machines, it's true. I like technology, but I don't like all of it, like you said. I mean, I never really got into computers. I was at university and I did some, like a programming course, C++ programming. And I get it, but it's just not my thing at all working with computers. And it was probably the way I was brought up. I didn't have a computer up until 2007, which is quite late. So I had my first computer in 2007. What is it about the kind of, you know, the essence of a machine or, you know, like a drum machine or a synth that kind of speaks to you or that appeals to you so much? Like, for instance, I read about... Doppler effect concert that you went to where they exited the stage and the music kept playing with no performers visible and that's sort of struck you in a way what is it about that that you know kind of grabs you I just thought that was a very nice picture like the machine taking over and the human isn't actually there anymore I don't know what it is about machines sometimes it's it's it's just the look of them I'm going to be honest like I mean sometimes I just like looking at them I I don't particularly like looking at computers unless they're really old. Though I don't really have a retro fetish or anything like that. I don't know, I think it's more simple than that as well. I just never really got the knack of computers. I don't really understand how they work and also the fact that you can do everything with them. I find it kind of confusing and I think for making music I just need limitations to keep focused. Me personally, I mean, it's not a sound thing because I know so many people using computers making music. great stuff and it sounds fantastic. It's not that you can't get the sound of a computer or something. It's just the way you work with machines is completely different. I really like it. And the computer seems to interfere with you too much. I feel like it's very distracting and the machines are just there. They give you something back, like you program them and sometimes there are sounds that you didn't expect. coming out of the machines which I find really interesting you don't necessarily get that with a computer unless you programmed a mistake or like make it made a mistake programming it then you you will get like like a surprise but in the machine even if you don't make a mistake that that can be surprises and I find that quite interesting it's almost like machines can kind of have a their own will or like a mind of their own kind of kind of yeah i mean computers kind of do that as well because when you type something in a computer and you've got like a program that um corrects your mistakes or not mistakes. I mean, when I write an email and this program sets in and it's like correcting words and correcting names and it's actually making it wrong. It's like it obviously has a mind on its own and it's rather annoying. But I mean, sometimes it's helpful when you make a spelling mistake and it automatically corrects it. I was listening to your Essential Mix when I was on the way down here. And I had this thought that electro almost kind of seems like a, I don't know, you could say like a celebration of. just machines themselves like it sounds utterly utterly machine made or it's very very mechanical you know yeah but it does sound computer made as well i mean a computer at the end of the day is a machine somehow and i mean a lot of especially in electro a lot of producers use computers and it's very tight very very uh what's the word futuristic and stuff you know i think electro is a I love it so much because I feel like it's a celebration of all the amazing things that humanity does. And at the same time, all the horrible things that we do. Like, you know, it's like really brutal and it's got this... this sound of like destruction and stuff. And at the same time, it's got this futuristic, like we're flying to, into space, we're flying to the moon. You know, it's like, it's got all those, all those elements in it that are very human. Yeah, it's weird. Because on the one hand, it's like machines are like a human achievement, kind of, they reflect human ingenuity and whatnot. But, yeah, listening to a set of pure electro, you almost kind of imagine a human-less world or it feels like it's like a world of machines or world of robots or something like that. Yeah. And also, I mean, we build all those machines and we build weapons and stuff, but it seems like we're not really capable of controlling them. And I feel like that electro reflects that quite. like this kind of all the great achievements of like humankind and then we're just too stupid to control it we're too intelligent and too stupid at the same time somehow it's something that maybe makes you a bit of an outlier and club culture is you outspokenly dislike like happy music or you know really positive stuff when people are describing your music the words like dark gritty Pete Tong called it ear splitting But then in the end, it's also that's, you know, only within the world of club music. Like it is still fun, dancing music. But does it feel dark or gloomy to you or does it just seem, you know, sort of ecstatic or, you know, how does it how does it feel to you, I guess? I don't know. I mean, I get that question a lot. that sound that kind of sound or that kind of style of music just appeals to me it appeals to my ears I just enjoy listening to it that's what I want to hear when I'm in it club that's what I want to dance to that's what makes me dance and all the all the other things just I don't I mean I don't like it I just don't like that kind of funky happy sounding stuff I just hate it does it ever make you feel kind of out of place like at certain gigs or in certain yeah totally of course I mean yeah it happens to me a lot that I have to start playing after like someone just playing happy disco music for two hours and I'm like what the hell I'm gonna do I'm just so far away from it it's it doesn't really make any sense to me I mean I see why people are into both sides of of Dan's music but I'm not. But it seems like that, you know, you're pretty willing to stick to your guns. Like, it's hard to imagine you coming on after someone playing disco in house and starting off with a disco track or something. Not really. I mean, I try to, honestly, I try to. I listened to it a lot and I bought house records and stuff and I really tried to get into it and tried to understand it. And for a while I was kind of into it. I mean, Hamburg has got lots of house and stuff and the scene is or used to be quite big and vibrant and the parties were always great, so I loved being there. But I just realized it's not my thing. I don't get it. It's just, it's not me. The first time I saw you play was probably five years ago or something like that at this point. I called in Poodle and you played back to back with D Cosmo from Lux Rec. You were there? Yeah, yeah. Oh, shit. But that one, it was interesting. I remember you did the interview with the Poodle people and stuff and you were there. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we never met or anything though. Anyway, it was funny because that was pretty much my first impression of you. And my memory, at least, is that the music was like almost everything had vocals and choruses and stuff. It was all kind of dark wave. you know, dusty old synth music, but I'd never heard, my friend and I were saying, we never really heard a club set like that, that it was, that there were hardly any. sort of standard club tracks that all seemed it was hours and hours of these strange sort of shadowy synthy pop records or something and then it was kind of interesting when the Helena Half that I came to know had quite a different sound I guess it's still the same kind of universe but I did a back-to-back set with someone as well. Yeah, sure. But yeah, actually, something I was wondering then was like, it was a long night and I didn't recognize anything except DeCosmo played Pet Shop Boys. But aside from that, I didn't recognize anything. You still hold that against him. I was wondering then in the dance floor, and I still wonder now, how had you amassed all that music? Or how do you have hours and hours of, you know, strange, unrecognizable synth pop? Or, you know, how did you find all this stuff that now makes up your kind of signature sound? Minimal wave release, a lot of that. We didn't just play like... synth pop and wavy stuff we played a lot of that kind of little bit dreamy wavy acid house thing like like in the style of his label of uh daniela's label um looks like and there are there's so many records out there releasing stuff like that. I mean, now, you know, we played some old stuff, but we played a hell of a lot of new records as well. And you just have to search for records. I mean, it's like, that's what DJs do, I suppose. It's like, I just spend hours and hours on like trying to find new stuff online or in record shops. Or being with people and then you show music to each other and you're like, do you know this? Do you know this? Yeah, sure. So you started producing like not super long ago, like five years ago or something like that. I started producing 2008, but I kind of stopped and then I started buying hardware in 2010, 11. And I started making music with FX from Hamburg. We did the Black Sides project and we both were kind of... At the beginning of learning how to make music, it was kind of cool to be two people and, yeah, figure it out together type thing. And that all came, it was sort of like, if I understand it correctly, you're in school and you had a... realization that you wanted to make music instead of analyze you're studying music I was at art school at the time actually I studied fine arts and I don't know I didn't really get it and I I was into going clubbing and I was like I want to be a DJ I don't know I want to paint pictures I'm all right thanks I want to be with people and play records and stuff And then I thought, OK, I have to study something because they tell you you have to do something and you have to have an education, which is true. You have to. But don't take my advice. Don't think like you shouldn't have an education. But I thought like, OK, you have to study something. I realized I can't do it. I'm not interested. So I stopped. But it's probably not the way you should go. I was just lucky that it ended up here. But yeah. So what was that process like of kind of beginning to make music? Like how did you learn about the technique or how did you learn about... the machines and I just bought them and played around with them and so it took me type thing I mean I didn't I never read a single manual which you don't necessarily need for the machines that I've got was it hard to Was it hard to amass kind of the gear you needed to properly make music, like to make a record? Or, you know, a lot of stuff's kind of expensive. And, you know, how did you sort of get to the point where you had a studio set up? I mean, the first thing, a friend of mine from the Lieber Detail label, he sold me a 303. and I got an MPC. It's still not mine. I don't know if I ever have to give it back to this guy, but he never asked for me to give it back to him, so I don't know. I didn't buy it. He just gave it to me. He's like, yeah, you can have it for a while, which is like eight years now. So I had a sampler, and... a synthesizer basically and that's two things you can make music with already and then the rest just came came later and how'd your first record come together it was on actress's label yeah How did that connection happen? I met an actress. He played in Hamburg at Prinzenbar, which is like a small club. I don't know if there's anything going on now anymore. Yeah, I played support for actress and then a year later his labor manager got in touch and they wanted me to play the... record release party for for his album in London at Plastic People yeah that was that was that but I was actually already in touch with um Bunker Records and they already had the the tracks like my my my Bunker release was supposed to come out before the the other one and um but it just took longer so yeah at the time were you Surprised at all that, I mean, it's kind of a killer debut to be on actresses label. I mean, did it seem like it was, did it feel like it was happening fast or were you surprised at sort of how well it was going? I was kind of surprised. Yeah. I didn't really think it was going to be so quick and I didn't think it was going to be actress liking my stuff either because I was, you know, like Bunker didn't really surprise me because that's the kind stuff I was making, you know, like acid techno. And actress, yeah, that kind of surprised me. But yeah, I don't know. In general, you've sort of had kind of like a stellar rise. And especially considering you got started on it all like not that long ago. I guess it might be kind of a weird thing for you to answer, but I'm just kind of wondering, like, what's driving that momentum? Or, like, do you have, you know, a crazy work ethic or a very determined person? I think it's a mixture between a few things. One is being lucky, right time, right place. I played support for actress. If I would not have done that then... I don't know, you know, maybe I wouldn't be here. And then also I was obsessed. I am obsessed. I was obsessed with DJing. I mean, and making music, but DJing definitely. Like when I first got my turntables, I couldn't stop. like every day I was on there trying things trying to get better and I think you have to be a bit crazy to get into this I mean this it's not like you just play some tunes and you get into it you know like I was I was obsessed I wasn't doing anything else that's probably helped it seems like you really dove in like um quit school did you have like a job or anything else at the time or were you just completely dedicated to this whole thing um I had a bar job I mean you have to make money somehow but that is kind of cool you know like if you work work in a nightclub or something it kind of you have a lot of time to make music and stuff and it's at night and it doesn't interfere with your your other things like djing and stuff you're quite flexible you know you get a gig and you can say oh can i work on monday instead of saturday or something you know and you you attended bar at golden poodle right yeah um in general was that what was it like kind of being part of that community or did they does that too feel like kind of a stroke of luck probably yeah I mean, I started DJing there before I started bartending. But yeah, I met a lot of really cool people there that are very inspiring. Yeah, I mean, it's good to have a community to share music with people and to kind of, yeah, you can't do it on your own. I mean, I'm a very social person also and you can't just sit at home. wait for things to happen you have to be out there and meet people and having this community is quite obviously quite good yeah sometimes it seems like there's often an element of cosmic luck or something like just that you would be in the same city as golden poodle where there's kind of a you know perfect venue that hardly exists anywhere else for the kind of stuff you want to play That's hard to imagine. Yeah, right. But I mean, it's not necessarily like cosmic luck or anything like that. It's, you know, for a lot of people, it doesn't work out at all. And they live in Hamburg and they try really hard. You know, it's like, it looks like that when you look back at it, but that's with all those success stories, you know, you look at them and you're like, oh, everything fell into place. But that is like one success story and then 100 unsuccessful stories, you know, where everything looked like it was going to fall into place and it just simply didn't. Of course, it helped to have that place. I mean, no question. I don't know if I was somewhere else in a different country or something. It might have been much harder. But then I was, as I said, I was obsessed with it. So I would have probably tried to find those places. I mean, the places didn't necessarily find me. I found those places as well. You know, I went out and searched. When you said you were seeking those places out, what do you mean by that exactly? just had this idea in your head of something you wanted to hear and you were searching for it? Yeah, totally. I mean, I kind of got into this kind of club thing. As I said, I was obsessed. I just needed to, I was going out pretty much every night to some place to meet people, to hear music. And then when I started DJing, I tried to play as much as possible. I played everything in every small bar. in every festival where people make me stop because they didn't like the music I was playing. I mean, it's... I just had to do this. I really wanted to do this. And did it all start with that kind of epiphany in art school? I don't know, were you doing music when you were younger at all? Or did it start with the DJing thing? It kind of started with the DJing thing. I learned. I tried to learn how to play the piano and the violin when I was a child and I was really, really bad at it. The last time I picked up my violin, I tried to play it and the string hit me straight into the eye and I was like, OK, I am never going to touch that fucking instrument again. Not good, really. And I never thought that music was going to be my way because I was really, really bad at it. But when I was a child, I used to record loads of stuff onto cassette tapes. I know that a lot of people at the time did that because it was the easiest way to... listen to music when you're like with your Walkman or something or share music with people or whatever you did. But I did it quite obsessively. And I mean, you could call those tapes, mixtapes. I mean, it is somehow a DJ mix, but not really. But it's probably, that was probably the start. You're still kind of expressing yourself with other people's music, kind of. Yeah, I mean, it was for my own home listening purposes. I didn't think of it as any kind of an art form or anything like that. But it was probably, looking back, it was probably the start. I was doing stuff with music and I was enjoying it and I was spending time doing that kind of thing. What kind of music was it back then? It was mainly guitar music. Like what kind of stuff? Nirvana and... The Cure, some terrible things. I remember like I was into Franz Ferdinand and the Stooges and Queens of the Stone Age and Caius and that kind of stuff. Was there a turning point where you kind of like got bitten by this, you know, this bug of the music that you like now? Yeah, I mean, I enjoyed. electronic music when I was younger, when it was on telly, when they had like, on Viva, when they played like the Love Parade and some electro clash. I remember seeing The Hacker and Miss Kitten on MTV or something. And I liked that, but I didn't know what it was. And then the first time I really... I really got into it was when I bought a CD by Radioactive Man, his first album. And that was like, oh my God, okay, this is it. That's all I want. This is the best. thing ever like it was oh my god this is great and yeah that was probably somehow a start I was playing that that was the only CD I had back then and I was playing that over and over and over again you can't imagine how many times I played that CD it was crazy or do you have a feeling of why it kind of uh struck you so dramatically? Because it's exactly what I'm into now. I mean, it's kind of weird. I found something by accident that is exactly my taste, which I still have. I was searching for other things. I was listening to other music, but this is what I came back to. It's probably a lucky accident. It's just totally my thing. And yeah, I don't know. I mean, I think it's something that is kind of different about you as a DJ. So on the one hand, like I was saying earlier, you actually play a pretty broad range of stuff. But there's also such a consistent spirit to what you play. Like what you're saying is your thing is, I feel like that's much clearer for you than it is for a lot of. other DJs, you know, just there's such a particular kind of atmosphere and energy or whatever. And also your willingness to kind of stick to it. Even though, like you said earlier, there were times when people. screamed at you to get off the decks or whatever. Do you consider yourself kind of like a stubborn or defiant person or is that way of kind of sticking with what you like, no matter what the reaction is? Is that like a quality you have in general, would you say? I... I don't know. It's with music. I mean, you can play me 10 seconds of a track and I can tell you whether I'm going to like it or not. Pretty much. I mean, I think a lot of people are like that, actually, but I'm very much like that. I couldn't play anything that I didn't really like. So I always just played what I was into. I mean, at the beginning you try to find things and it takes time till you really understand what it is that you like and you try things out. And sometimes it takes time to understand things as well. Sometimes you have to listen to a record more than just once to understand how good it is. So I might have played things in the past that I would now think like, ooh, like why, why? But at the time it was like new and it felt right and stuff. So it takes time to kind of like create your own style or something. But yeah, I could never play anything that I didn't really like. So I had to stick to what I was into. And sometimes, I mean, when I started, that wasn't necessarily that popular. I mean, it still isn't necessarily that popular. If you're no one and you're booked as a warm-up DJ somewhere and you play on a 40 BPM electro and it's a tech house party, you're just not right. I mean, it's not going to work, is it? Have you been that person though, like back in the day? That happened, yeah. I mean, I wouldn't necessarily, I would have probably tried to play stuff out of my collection that is a little more like the rest. you know, like try to, to fit in. I never tried to play something that didn't fit just for the sake of it or anything, you know, like I would always try to kind of adapt, but within my sound, within what I've got. And sometimes it just, it doesn't work. So you're a hundred percent vinyl DJ, right? Yeah. You just. a month or so ago published an article about kind of how hard that is. How do you find it out there? How much of a challenge is it for you? I feel like it's getting a little bit better, but that might be because I'm higher up on the lineup. on the bill and maybe people people are like well if Helena can't play that's pretty bad you know she's the headline so we have to take a little more care about the the setup or something I feel like it's getting a little bit better but I do get into trouble every now and then mainly feedbacking problems. Have you had like a particularly, did you ever like have a disastrous? Oh yeah. What's like an example of something going really bad? I remember I played this one festival and I put the needle on the turntable on the record and the needle didn't even stay on there. Like the... The feedback was so, and the vibrations were so heavy, it just went immediately. And they came and they had some concrete blocks, I don't know where they were. They weren't under the turntables already. They had those concrete blocks there. They put them under the turntables. The left turntable, absolutely fine, solved the problem. The right must have been too close to the base or something. Right turntable, still the same problem. Neither was going to go immediately. And then I started playing on just one turntable and announced the records. Like, I'm going to play this one next. And then they had more concrete blocks and then they brought a couple more concrete blocks in and then the right one worked as well, but I only had one hour to play. So until that was figured out... a mix, two records, and then they were like, I'm very sorry, but we have to close now. This is the end of the patch. It was like, this is great. I have had it once where I just stopped where I said to the other DJ, I was like, do you want to keep on playing? He was like, all right. because it didn't work and the sound guy said to me, I would just turn the volume right down. I was like, that's not really a solution. And it depends. When I feel like they're trying their best to make it work. try my best to deal with the situation and if it's just playing one record at a time and announcing the next one and playing with one turntable I'm gonna do it but if I feel like someone's not really trying and sound people being really arsy what am I supposed to do? Sure yeah In those moments, you know, where it becomes quite challenging, do you ever think like, fuck it, I should just use a USB stick or what makes it worthwhile even in those moments? I don't know. I think it's just my love for... chords I just it's my thing I when I when I started DJing it wasn't actually it wasn't just about the music it was about the music but it wasn't just about the music it was about the medium as well was about turntables I just love working with them and I still do and I can't see myself using CDs it confuses me I can't remember any track titles like how on earth am I going to find anything with this little wheel and the I can't remember names you know I can only remember records but I can't remember names I don't know what I'm playing I wouldn't want to do it just as simple as that and normally there are quite simple solutions to make the turntables work I mean quite often it happens that I start and there is feedbacking and I realize it's not working you can always take like empty water bottles and crush them a bit and put them underneath in most cases it solves the problem I have done it with empty plastic glasses uh you know like drinking glasses and crushed them and put them on it worked It doesn't always work. It's not always the solution. If you only play for one hour, then there isn't really that much time to find solutions. But you can find them and it's not that difficult to set up turntables if you have. a little bit of an idea. I mean, there can always something happen. I mean, sometimes the Fitch Pater isn't stable and you just realise that you can't mix as tight as you normally because it's... It's like erratic and you can see it on the lights as well and stuff. If it's not too bad, you can work with it. Of course, you're not going to be as tight as you normally are, but you can work with it. seems to be fine normally I try to have a sound check if I can if I have time for it and it seems to be okay at most places but then every now and then you do get into trouble you mentioned earlier that a kind of I guess you say a luxury that you have now is that if you get to a certain level of I guess you could say popularity you're taken seriously enough that something like playing only vinyl and also playing the music that you play, you know that people will kind of accommodate you, I guess. Was it hard getting there or was there a long time where, you know? It did and it still does sometimes. I mean, as I said, sometimes you're booked right, wrong time, wrong place. Sometimes the turntables still don't work. I mean, just the other day I had a... I had a problem. It was just like a table in the middle of the room and people were bumping into it. And it's like, it's not going to work. And yeah, there were parties where it was really difficult and I didn't enjoy myself. And it still happens sometimes, but it's part of it. I mean, you can't always be brilliant. I mean, that's when it's a job, you know, like. When something doesn't work, I'm like, okay, this is my job. I just have to get through. I mean, it seems like you have a pretty good attitude about not getting too thrown off. I mean, don't get me wrong. When I'm there, I get really pissed off and I'm really, really hard in hiding it. You know, you can always tell by my face when I'm really, really pissed off. You can definitely tell. can't do anything about it it's just that's the way it is as long as they pay me i'm all right but the good thing is like now i turn up and the people that come to the party normally want to actually hear what i do rather than the other way around so that's a uh kind of like a clear advantage of um you know being the kind of act that people come to see specifically is you can just be yourself and that's what everybody wants. It seems like you have more artistic freedom, kind of. - Yeah, on one hand, yeah. On the other hand, then you get booked with even bigger people, and then again, you're just like, not the one that people pay the ticket for. But it's like, yeah, I don't know. It's just one of those things. Sometimes. It goes really well and everything's great. And sometimes it's just not and it's okay. It's just the way it is. And everybody, every DJ knows that, I guess. This seems like maybe it doesn't bother you too much. Like the idea of, you know, presenting something that not everyone will like straight away. Like I always thought a lot of, you know, a lot of club music is... literally, you know, kind of designed to be liked. Whereas what you do kind of has a little bit more of a take it or leave it attitude of like, this is my thing. Maybe you like it, maybe you don't. I don't know, is that how it feels to you? I know what you mean. But the thing is, I find the stuff that is designed to be liked way more offending than the other stuff. Like if something is just there without really wanting anything, without really being anything, without really trying anything, when it's just like this thing of... one bass drum the whole way through like on one tempo everything sounding the same with a little bit of like poppy melody I find that rather annoying to be honest and you know people say like oh yeah everybody can kind of like that it makes me so angry like I don't think I mean there must be other people out there that find that rather But I know what you mean. It's probably like I'm a bit weird. You know, you sort of, to me, feels pretty quick. Went from just doing like your residency at Golden Poodle and whatnot and kind of being, it seems to me, like sort of like a local phenomenon to, you know, playing festivals, doing the essential mix and winning the, being awarded best essential mix of the year. Has there been like a difficult side to that or this kind of? level that you're on does it does it what are the complications that that come with it or was there maybe something that was easier before that's harder now no it's it's pretty easy I mean it's probably like if if anything but I don't know actually people probably expect you to be absolutely perfect every time because there must be a reason for you being so big So you have to be really good and it kind of puts pressure on you, can put pressure on you. But then I'm not sure that pressure might have been on me even before, you know, it's a different kind of pressure. You have to prove yourself and have to be like, look, I am actually really good at this. And now it's like, oh, yeah, you know, I'm really good at this. You want proof that I really am. It's like it's more or less the same thing, probably, I guess. But yeah, you just have to sometimes I feel like you have to deliver every time. And sometimes you're a bit tired and the set is not going to be as perfect. Or sometimes like the turntables don't work and the set is not going to be as perfect. And most people wouldn't know what's like especially the the record thing they don't they don't necessarily see it i mean if there are like needles jumping it's quite obvious but then if if the pitch fader isn't stable no one's gonna gonna really notice that it's just like oh mixing isn't very very tight or something you know and um i think people expect the higher you level you're on the the better you must be and it obviously doesn't necessarily work like that i have a much better time now than i did five years ago because people come to see me and want to want to hear what i do and that's great does it uh feel weird to you at all that um you know, you would find, you know, in some cases kind of like a mainstream audience, like the BBC Essential Mix. Like, is it surprising that, you know, there turns out to be such an audience for... for what you do? Well, I don't think the BBC audience necessarily liked my mix. You know, that was the people from the magazines and stuff, they liked it. I don't think, I think there were quite, sorry, quite a few people out there that just absolutely hated my mix. And that's fine. I mean, I can't expect everybody to like it. I know it's not what we talked about earlier. It's not as easy to listen to like other things. And if you like easy listening music, then you're probably not going to like what I do. It's too much. But still, you know, just that the BBC wanted you to do one is already... Oh, yeah, that's pretty cool. Yeah, and I mean, I love the music a lot and I think it deserves a wider audience and I think it deserves more attention because it's great music. And so I think if something like The Essential Mix can do that and gets... if it can get some more people to get into this kind of sound, then I think that's pretty cool. Basically, there are a few things with kind of like your approach to being a DJ that sort of seem like basically go against like the conventional wisdom or whatever. There are certain ways where you're like just kind of uncompromising, but it works out quite well. Like the music that you play is... sort of like an unfiltered version of just like what you love or it seems that way and then you don't bother with social media and stuff simply because you just don't want to and many artists would find that an obligation but you just don't do it and it works out fine and is that all just kind of like going with your gut um or pretty much yeah I don't know I just I make up the rules and I follow them you know I like If I want to do something, I do it. If I feel like, nah, I don't really like that kind of thing, I'm not going to do it. And I don't necessarily have an explanation or an argument for or against something. I'm just like... doesn't feel right, don't want to do it, don't want to be involved or, yeah, why not? Let's do it type thing. And so, yeah, it's probably, yeah, just gone by my guts. So you're very much in this, you know, kind of dove in the deep end and even a full-time artist. And now this is just what you do. What would happen if it all ended tomorrow? You know, what would you do next? I don't really think about the future much. I just do things and see what happens. I don't have a plan B. Like, if this is over tomorrow, I would probably start working at some kind of bar again to make money and be unemployed. Get money off the government. Thank you. you
