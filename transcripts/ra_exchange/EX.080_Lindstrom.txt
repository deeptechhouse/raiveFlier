you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Norwegian producer Lindström may be known primarily as a purveyor of space disco, but his new album surely puts the lie to that sort of pigeonholing. Six Cups of Rebel is a Prague Fantasia, an album in the spirit of Todd Rundgren's genre-spanning 70s masterpieces. It's a wild and adventurous ride, one that challenged Lindström to produce music in a way and a style that he didn't know how to do. style that he had never had before. And in the course of our conversation, I found that was the key theme of his career overall, the constant push to make something new. What's Oslo like? Well, it's not that big, I guess. I've been living there for, I don't know, 15 years or something. I'm originally from a smaller town, Stavanger. So, I don't know. After 15 years, you get to know the city. Has Oslo changed over the years since you've been there? Well, I mean, I don't really consider myself as a part of the musical scene. Not even the music scene, just the city itself. Well, yeah, I mean, I guess. But I've been changing as well, so I'm interested in different stuff now than when I was moving there. So now I've got family and I'm not really doing that stuff that I used to do, I guess. When you first moved there, was it sort of for the music? No, I was going to the university. So I was actually trying to quit music because I just didn't think that it was possible. I mean, I was kind of dreaming to work with music, but I didn't see it as any possibility at all. So the first, I don't know. four years or something, three or four years. I was just studying. What were you studying? I don't know what it's called in English. I got four years at the university and I don't know if that is the same as some kind of a degree, I don't know, master or I don't know. But I was studying literature. uh religion and uh yeah like usual uh and you were still doing the music stuff on the side as you were doing your studies or you actually gave music up completely yeah i did actually i i actually before i moved to oslo i sold all my records and uh my equipment. I didn't have that much but I had like a Rhodes piano and a synthesizer and I played in bands in Stavanger and when I moved I just decided that I was gonna focus on the like grown-up things. Getting a degree and just start living a normal life. What changed? What brought you back to music? I think I was just, I'm just completely obsessed with music. So it was just impossible for me to stop doing it. So after just a few months, I just started buying records again. It was buying records that kind of got you back into it. You didn't join a band or anything? Yeah, I did after a few years, but it was just not working really. So I think I was kind of, before I moved, when I moved from Stavanger, I decided that I'm not going to play in any bands anymore because, I don't know. I was kind of just tired of all the quarreling and organizing rehearsals and stuff like that. So one of the things I did was just to buy an acoustic guitar and started playing in my room. So, yeah, I didn't really, I wasn't really looking for any bands or anything musical when I was, especially not together with anybody. So, yeah, I guess that's why I, after a while, I just decided that maybe I should just buy like a four track or something, which I did. and then I just started thinking different about music because I think I've always like when playing in bands I've been always having ideas not only for my part like my musical part I used to play the Hammond organ in bands But I had a lot of views. I really wanted to influence how the whole band was sounding, like the drums and the bass and how the songs were. How did the other members of the band like that? Well, usually there's always somebody. There's always, I guess. I guess most of the guys didn't really mind because maybe they realized that some of my ideas were actually pretty good. So when did you start, I mean, making more electronic stuff? You know, you said you had this acoustic guitar and a 4-triple. Yeah, I... I met this guy who told me that why don't you just work on a computer? Why don't you just get a computer and start working? He told me he could get me some... some like sequencer applications and stuff to work with and I didn't know I hadn't really worked with computers at all so I didn't know how it was working but I became interested and it happened at the same time when I started to realize that I just I was going out with friends, like partying and having fun, going to nightclubs and dancing. But I didn't understand any of the new music that was being played. So I guess sooner or later I just decided that I... And I really want to kind of dive into this kind of new music and try to understand what it's all about, because a lot of it didn't really make any sense to me. Were there DJs that you really looked up to? No, I didn't know anything about the DJ culture or nothing. I was just like... going up to the DJ booth and asking if they had anything like James Brown or something that I knew from but they were just like probably laughing at me and playing you were the guy making their requests yeah I guess Yeah, so I decided that maybe it's a better idea to just try to understand how to actually make this music by buying the devices and equipment that... or that people used to use for making that kind of music. So I bought a sampler and also a computer soon after. What sampler did you buy? I bought an EMU. It was one of the, I think it's called E6400 or something. It was pretty expensive. And that was about the only thing I had. And after, yeah, I connected it to the... to the sequencer I got from my friend and the computer and just started. Yeah. And also, what was the first thing you sampled? Like, I find that interesting. Like, wow, here, like, well, I really need to use this. Actually, I, it wasn't the first time I, I own the sampler. I actually had one before when I was. when I was in high school I got a Roland something S10 or something one of the cheapest ones from Roland But I didn't use it other than just playing, like sampling my voice and just playing with it as I guess everybody did in the 80s. I didn't really think of that it was possible to just sample bits and pieces of others' music and work from there. I didn't know anything about hip-hop or nothing. So yeah, I guess the first thing... Well, after I bought the EMU sampler, I knew what kind of possibilities there were. So I just... Actually, I remember I bought like a three CD Ninja Tune compilation and I just started trying to make. similar kind of music as I heard DJ Food and Amon to Beam were doing. And I bought a lot of cheap secondhand vinyl, stuff that nobody wants, easy listening stuff and just sampled that kind of stuff. I mean, it was probably... It was not very interesting at all. When did you first feel like you got it? Like you had something like, oh, wow, this is something that is me rather than me trying to do other people's stuff. I don't know. I think. I think when, I mean, I guess I got the sample in 99 and I think I spent probably like two or three years just trying, like making an album that never, of course, happened. I mean, it didn't get any release. I didn't give it to anybody. But it probably took me like three or four years before I got feedback from people. And that was also after setting up my own label. I got feedback from other people that... the music I sent them or the music that I released was was they were liking it and they told me that it was different than a lot of the other stuff and I kind of realized that wow So I didn't really kind of understand that. It wasn't about copying everybody else. It was more about trying to do something on your own or try to do something unique or something. Who did you send the music to? Well, I remember one of the first guys I met in Oslo was Steve Cody. from London. He was promoting chicken lips i think uh and uh i gave him some songs and uh and i guess the next week i heard back from him and he told me that well this is really interesting and uh maybe we can maybe i can yeah he he actually just proposed that uh he released some other stuff. Were you surprised? Or did you feel confident that he'd like it? I don't know. I mean, well, actually, I'm... I'm forgetting something now. I actually did music under another name before Lindström. I used to have a manicure called Slow Supreme, and I released music on a Norwegian label called Jazzyd, and I actually put out... an album and a few 12 inches and I guess actually that was when I got feedback from people that my music or at least one of the songs a song called Granada where being picked up by a lot of the new jazz DJs at that time Giles Peters and then Rainer Truby and yeah some New York people and I think maybe maybe after doing that I mean I was I was actually trying to copy whatever I heard I was kind of just like like a copy machine and listening to people, and oh, so that's how it's supposed to sound. But I didn't have the knowledge to make it sound that good. And also, I guess I was just fooling around, sampling stuff, and just doing stuff without even knowing the rules. how to make dance music or how to make a track like like that for djs but uh um i guess like in in retrospect i've been thinking that maybe because i didn't really know anything about how to do it maybe that's why it sounded fresh for people because when you when you know all the rules and when you know exactly how to do it It doesn't become any good at all. Yeah. I think a lot of your music is you trying out things that you're trying to make a prog record or you're trying to make a pop record because you're coming at it from a different angle, it sounds. completely original in a way yeah I mean I think it wasn't it wasn't after many years I realized that actually this is actually maybe my fourth this is what I'm supposed to do rather than i mean it's it's also more interesting for me to to push the limits and to challenge myself and maybe other people as well by doing something different every time and by doing something by not just copying what i've did in the past just over and over again What was the biggest challenge on the new record that you made? Well, there's always so many challenges. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, it's always a challenge to decide what kind of record or what kind of album or what kind of songs I'm going to do. In this case, I decided very early that it was going to be an album. And also, I knew that I wanted to do something different from the... crystal album and also the where you go album that i did before that um so i was just like trying out a lot of stuff before i kind of uh decided that this is the way i want to go this is the the direction i i want to what did you try out and dismiss Like a lot of stuff. So we were never, uh, you had the Bob Dylan album, singer songwriter album that you're trying now. No, I didn't. I mean, everything, everything was, uh, it was all about, I mean, I, I didn't want to make anything like really epic long and, uh, and, uh, like space, uh, kind of stuff. because I really felt that I've already done that and I didn't really want to do it again. I'm kind of, I guess I'm a little afraid of doing that, the same music again, because, like, the Where You Go album, and I mean... some of the stuff that I did on fidelity. Uh, you seem in all the interviews I've read, you seem very adamant that you don't want to repeat yourself. This is like a big thing. It's very important for you, but I wonder. if you don't feel like, you know, oh, I put out where you go, maybe I could do something a little bit different with that and try to, like, or I have more to say in that same style. I mean, yeah, um... The thing is, every time I finish an album, I get so tired of that kind of music or the album. So immediately after I've, I mean, even before I do like press and even before, I mean, even before I started like promoting the album, I've already. I'm already doing something different, something new. I'm always working on something new. At the time, the most recent album is actually hitting the streets. So what are you working on now? Well, I'm trying out new stuff. Trying to figure out what? is next. Well, I mean, I, I realized that, uh, I don't really... It's not important for me to do something completely different that I haven't done before every time. But after doing... I mean, this album is kind of weird and crazy and all over the place. And because of that, I knew when I was finished that next time I'm going to do something really different, like really maybe simple and maybe much more accessible and maybe much more, I don't know, streamlined. You're going to try to write a hit. I'm not saying that. I don't mind writing a hit music as long as it... as long as I'm as long as it's like my style but I'm not I mean with the Cristobal album I I wanted to make like a pop album but with a with a some kind of a twist. I mean, I guess some of those tracks were, it wasn't, I wouldn't say it was like radio hits, maybe in some countries. Yeah, it was picked up by Cadillac for an ad, right? Yeah, I know, but I'm not sure, I'm not really sure if it... Of course you don't hate those. With that idea in mind. But I was watching that ad today actually. And I just thought to myself. Yeah that's a pop song. It's exactly. It was so weird. Seeing that my song. Or that song with a commercial. Because it just. It feels so wrong. With my. It just. sounds and looks so stupid uh that track uh on that commercial and uh and i guess i don't know if other people are actually seeing it that way but uh it's probably just because i did the track or i did the song and uh um I don't know. I never made it for a commercial. It's just so weird to... Did you have any thoughts when they asked about it? Oh, I don't know. Yeah, I did. I guess the usual thoughts is this like... Is this what I... wanted to do and uh and the thing is i i spoke to i spoke to my management and my record record label um and everybody of course was saying yes of course you should do it i mean of course you should do it all the business people in your life were saying yes yes but um i don't know i'm I think it's different when you... I mean, it wasn't the track that I made for a car commercial from the beginning. Of course. I think that's different. I mean, if they like the track, I'm fine. I mean, it's the same. Ultimately, it's just like a... one more channel to promote your music in a way. And if that track reached out to some people who never would find out music... I suppose it also... The money from that... Helps you have the freedom To make a record like the one you just did Yeah I guess it does I mean I really don't wanna Try to I really don't I'm not aiming I mean Obviously, I wouldn't put out this record, this new record, in the hope of getting a new Cadillac commercial, because this music isn't going to be on the next Cadillac commercial. So, I mean... Yeah, of course, I consider it, I see it that way. I mean, as long as I can, like being able to release new music and it's, I mean. It seems like that's all you really care about is just getting the space to work nine to five to make music. It is actually. Yeah. It is. What is it nine to five? I mean, is it just like work for you in a way? Obviously, it's pleasure, but it is just a job. Well, like I always work nine to five. But. I don't consider it work. I mean, I always try. That's also one of the reasons why I don't really want to kind of get in the same, I don't know, work. Like doing the same music. I mean. That would feel like work. Yeah, because that's also one of the reasons why I just have to do something different every time, something fun. It's all about kind of just having fun, really. And I mean, the thing is, if people... When I used to have a proper work, like a day job, I was always thinking, oh, I'm not really looking forward. I mean, everybody feels like that. The thing is, that's what's really important for me, to look forward to going to the studio and make music. But I don't think, I mean, working from 9 to 5 or working from 9 to 4 in the night, it doesn't really matter. I mean, the thing is, it's like, I realize that music is my work now. I'm trying as hard as I can to consider making music the way I used to feel about music. Like after doing schoolwork, I was always like, yeah, I can do music. So it is really important for me. I really don't. I mean, it's time to stop when I'm really hesitant going to the studio and don't really want to. when I consider it as just like a work when I just got like a, uh, a lot, a lot of stuff to do just, uh, because I have to, uh, the new albums complex. Well, yeah, I guess it is. Um, it must've been tough to like know when to stop with certain tracks. I assume with so much going on. I don't know. I... I'm not sure if I had any problems with that really. But I mean, the thing is, it's always easy for me to start something, to just sit down and, okay, just like clearing your mind and start doing something without knowing what it's going to be like. And that's what I really wanted to do with this album. That was like the approach to just getting down to work and starting writing the songs and recording everything. I didn't want to... I just wanted to feel... free and not working in like towards any specific direction or something I was just thinking like the wilder the better I like like okay this is kind of getting a little bit boring now I have to throw in something really crazy stuff something like that What was the song that you wrote and said, oh, this is how I want this album to be? I wrote a lot of songs. I never write anything. I never finish anything before I know if or... what I'm going to use it for. So I, I, I wrote like a lot of stuff over probably like a year or something after the Cristobal album. And, and, And in that period, I just decided that these are the tracks that is kind of in this direction that I want to go. And then I just started kind of putting them together and see if they work together and if they sounded good together. And then I... It does work quite well as an album. like yeah that flow into one another yeah that was uh that was uh that was what i i wanted to do i wanted to do an album like an album album not just a collection of tracks or uh something and uh i wanted yeah did you have to like fit endings though songs in so that it you know went directly into the next one did you have to like change things or Well, I guess when I'm doing an album, it's always kind of like a puzzle thing. No, I'm just working on everything at the same time. Gotcha. very early I'm thinking okay this this song or this can be like a good intro and maybe this track could be number three and then I need number two which has probably what does the number three sound like I mean I'm always thinking like side A, side B, even though nobody probably cares anymore. I mean, the album isn't, I mean, I was, I was visioning the album to be like, two sides like side A and side B and I was kind of hoping to fit everything into like a single vinyl but everybody told me that you shouldn't do it because the quality of the sound would suffer but it doesn't really matter really but that was how I kind of visioned like the album when I worked on it. Todd Rundgren did a remix. Yeah, that's kind of wild. It seems like amazing. Yeah, I was actually just... The thing is, I'm not really listening that much to contemporary electronic music. Actually, I'm trying, but I always find myself... going back to the 70s and 80s listening to stuff instead of the new stuff and I was asking my friends like Prince Thomas if he knew of any good people who could do like a remix of any of the tracks and he was like telling me a lot of names that like I guess like obvious names or typical names and then like people who've done remixes yeah and then he was like But hey, why don't you just ask like Todd Rundgren? Because he knew I was a big fan. And I was like, yeah, well, yeah, well, maybe. And I mentioned it to my management and the record company. And they were like, yeah, actually, I know one. I know his manager. from for some reason uh joe kim from small town told me and uh he told me that he was gonna email him and uh and uh yeah so that that's why it actually happened uh what is it about his music that you like so much Well, it's mainly that he's making just like pop music with a twist, I guess, or with a... I mean, he was really going far, far places in the 70s, especially before like the Utopia stuff. But he was always like, especially those albums from the mid 70s or early 70s. There's a lot of just like a regular pop music, rock music. But he always kind of takes it to places that nobody else did, I guess, who were making that kind of music. Like he produced one of the Hall & Oates albums that as far as I know... they don't really consider that as one of their albums anymore or something. It's called War Babies. And it's really... He put a really strong signature on that album. almost making it his own album and I guess his voice isn't that far from the whole notes or Daryl Hall But I just like the way he is challenging the pop music format or something. He does a different thing every time. Yeah. And it's very similar to your own philosophy, I think. Yeah. I guess that's why I like him. I mean, he's been inspiring me to, I guess, do similar things, I guess. Because I just realized that... nothing is so boring that following an artist and they're doing the same album over and over again and nothing really progresses and after a while you just think like oh there's a new album by somebody but I'm not really sure if I bother listening to it or checking it out because it's probably the same as last time or is this I'm kind of I don't really like that you also mentioned Lou Reed in another interview certainly in the 70s and even now with that Metallica album doing something different every single time I really like that people are doing that just because I don't see the point in just repeating yourself over and over again. Why should you do that? I don't know. It just gets boring for other people and probably yourself as well. You can do it for probably like, I don't know, five, six years of three, four albums. But after a while, people will just like... I've heard before your first album was great, the second one it was okay, and then it's just like downhill. You called this, in reference to Lou Reed, your metal machine music. Well, that was, I mean, I haven't probably... listen to the metal machine music maybe just parts of it I also mentioned Evangelis Bob Bush and the thing is I it's more like I really like those two guys for doing that kind of stuff like for doing something completely different than that a lot of people will probably hate them for I mean The guy who was releasing Chariots of Fire, like, I don't know, six, seven years later, he did, like, this crazy synth experimental album, which is just, like... totally bullshit in a way but uh at the same time it's just like a lot of courage courage to do that um i also why do you think that it feels like courage to do that when it should just be like obvious almost yeah i don't know that you wouldn't want to repeat yourself it's i don't know i don't know how other people are uh thinking i mean A lot of... Somehow I got the feeling that a lot of people are kind of saying stick to your guns and do what you know and do what you're kind of... do the stuff that you've been doing before that people know you for. If you do something different, then you're kind of digging your own grave or it's like suicide or something. You're going to lose a lot of fans and stuff like that. But I believe that if you're... If you're able to do that, to release a lot of stuff over, I don't know, two decades or something. People like Frank Zappa did it, a lot of weird stuff. But you can always hear that it's Frank Zappa who is actually making that music. And I believe that after... That's the most interesting thing. about the new record to me is that even though it doesn't really sound much like what you've released before I was like that's that's obviously a Lindstrom album somehow yeah I mean that's that's that's what some people have been telling me as well there's like when I'm playing some music to them, they're always saying like, oh yeah, I can really hear it's you. And that's, I mean, I take that as a compliment, kind of. I mean, sometimes, sometimes, no, but sometimes I wish I would be able to just make music and kind of... hide my identity and do something that nobody really can hear my signature, my sound signature on the music. But I've been kind of realizing that maybe it's not possible. What do you think your sound signature is? I don't know. I mean, it's hard for me to say. I'm always working on... from when I started working with music, I've always been, maybe because I'm a classically trained pianist, or I mean, at school, I don't really play anything more than for a few releases, but... I've been really obsessed with chords from the beginning and especially when I started making electronic music after getting a little conscious about what I wanted to do and how I wanted to make music to kind of stand out from everybody else. And for me, everybody else in the early 2000s was all the deep house that was just made on a sampler and just one disco sample or something, just in one key and just drums and bass and just real monotone, repetitive music that was just really boring. and I just wanted to bring something more I was inspired by listening to Sal Soul and like orchestrated stuff and and I guess maybe some of the a lot of the stuff that I've been doing is is based on like at least more than one chord and There's always like maybe, I mean, I guess I'm not making minimal music. It's always a lot of stuff happening. And Tartario told me recently that... hey everything you you you make sounds really like uh kind of orchestrated or uh uh like everything like like uh i don't remember the word he was using but uh i guess he's right it's like he also mentioned like the guy from Mongolian Jet Set it really you can really hear that it's like it's really arranged and a lot of work in the details and like in chord progressions and melodies and is there a lot of work in the details yeah there is I really enjoy doing that. So maybe that's why. Yeah. Yeah. You mentioned sort of all this kind of monotone music, which works really well in clubs. And you've had club hits, but... When I go see you play live, it's always sort of different and maybe is not your usual live set in a club from a producer. And I wonder, it's interesting though that you're booked in this context all the time. Is it tough? Yeah, it is sometimes, actually. But I mean, I've been over the years, I've been always thinking that, OK, sooner or later, I'm just going to enjoy this as long as it lasts, as long as I'm getting booked to play clubs and festivals and stuff. And sooner or later, I just know that it will stop because the promoters will understand that. This is not what works in clubs and I'm always doing stuff the wrong way. I mean, many times I realize that the resident DJs before and after me are doing a much better job than me for the crowd. At least that's what it looks like from my perspective. But I realized that maybe I've been kind of slowly realizing that, okay, maybe I'm going to have to keep on doing this for a few more years. No, you keep getting booked. Yeah. So I guess maybe I'm doing something right. And I think, I mean. I don't really go to any clubs anymore. I didn't really do it much when I was younger either. I mean, if I was hearing music in a club the same kind of style the whole night, I would probably be really bored. And I guess maybe somebody is thinking as I would or as I am and thinking that, oh. what is this music this guy is playing? This is really different, really weird or really crazy. I think it's good that there's different music going on in clubs and festivals. it's different because people are just there's a lot of different genres but in clubs it's sometimes hard because I don't really do any minimal music or I don't do that I don't build up sets as a lot of djs i guess and i think but i think it's it's important to just do it my way i mean um i don't i don't really want to adapt to or change uh the way i'm i'm doing it uh i think it's important to just be true to yourself but at the same time do you do you have aspirations especially on this new record like to have a band or something well not really yeah i uh i stopped doing that when i was young yeah um and uh i'm kind of seeing a lot of djs i saw prince thomas yeah at oya festival and he he seemed to be enjoying him I think he really enjoys playing, like having his band and thinking, because he's been a DJ for all his life, more or less. So you've been in a band, you know what the hassles are. I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't know. First of all, I don't really... When I made a track, I want to keep working on something else. I don't want to go back and practice on that track and make it work for a band and stuff like that. I just want to keep moving instead of focusing on what I've done before. Are your live sets coming up, are stuff from this new album going to be in there? Yeah, there is some stuff from this album. But the thing is, I've been realizing that when I'm actually promoting... a new album um it's been like one year or one and a half years since i was actually playing these songs uh out in clubs uh or promoting them myself uh so when i'm actually playing now i'm i'm i'm actually really tired of those songs so i I rather want to play the new stuff that I'm working on. And that stuff is really different from this album. So I know that my management and the people I work with don't really agree with me because that's probably not the way you're supposed to promote a new album. Sure. I mean, in clubs it's not like really a big problem because in clubs people are used to listening to new music and like they don't really, I mean, as long as they recognize the style or the sound or the feeling of the track, it's good. But if you play like new stuff on a festival maybe. then people will just think that, oh, I haven't heard that track before. This is boring. Let's go somewhere else. It must be tough to balance. Yeah, it is kind of tough. So that's why I'm kind of doing something in between. I'm doing some new tracks, some tracks from the album and some of the old songs that have been... reworked. I mean, I realized that sometimes I just have to do that even though I really don't want to do that. But the main music that I'm playing now is the new stuff that haven't been released yet. so and which i find really uh it's i mean i mean it has to be fun for me as well so i mean after you made a track uh it's really important for me to play it like the next day so uh Tonight I'm playing stuff that I actually made yesterday. And I guess... Do you feel it's important to test it out on a crowd, the stuff that you make? Because I feel like it sometimes wouldn't be at all. It's not really important to test it. I mean, it can be interesting to... Or even on just a sound system. Yeah, I mean, that can be really interesting. I'm not really testing stuff just to see if it's like working. If the crowd reaction is good, then oh yeah, I'm going to work more on it. Or if it doesn't really work, then I'm like, okay, I'm not going to do any more work on this. You don't seem like the type of person to worry too much about that. No, and I mean, that can happen from time to time. time that one night the track goes really well with the crowd and next night nobody really bothers so It's hard to think that way, but I think it's really... I mean, for me to be having fun when I'm playing, I really have to play new music and not just the new record. How do you play live? What do you use? I'm using Ableton Live. Have you been using it? for all your live performances through the years, basically. What do you like so much about it? Well, in the beginning, I just needed an application that I may be able to... to perform the thing is when i started my label or actually when i yeah when i when i since ever since i started releasing music i was djing uh but uh at one point i just realized that a djing is uh i'm not i'm never gonna be a good dj Especially when I started touring after doing the album with Prince Thomas, I realized that I will never get... as good as him right so uh well he's a he's a tough person to compare yourself against it should yeah but i mean i it was very natural for me to compare myself to him when we were traveling together so i just said okay i'll leave that to you yeah i'll leave that to you and then i'm gonna do something different and uh or something that you don't do and uh and i realized that uh uh I actually had more control or more fun playing my own music live, especially by using that application because it allows me to be endlessly creative, much more than... I could if I had like just like records or CDs. How much work is it? I mean, how much work are you putting in during a performance? Well, I really like to be able to... I really like to... I mean, I think what I'm doing is probably... I mean, it's not like totally live for sure. Because, I mean, that's kind of... I don't really know how to do that. Because in my music there's... there's so much stuff happening so it's hard to kind of do that live uh if i was like making minimal music or something it would probably be easier to just kind of just do some kind of like don't have any initial plan or something and just kind of see what happened but uh uh for me to perform my own music... It's too many chords. Yeah, I know. I mean, even with a band, it would be hard. Yeah, but so it's probably something in the middle. I'm more or less... performing the songs and everything is obviously recorded already it's like I divide all my tracks into like five five stems with drums bass guitars vocals synthesizers maybe and then and then Ableton enables me to do a lot more to improvise within the songs more than I do when I work in the studio I'm not using Ableton in the studio What do you use in the studio? I use Logic Why do you? Because I started with Logic so you just know it in and out inside and out yeah and it's been like I've been thinking that oh it would be nice to use Ableton in the studio because it's a very different way of visualizing visualizing music maybe and also i i guess i i would be making music different by using it because it's such a different sequencer than uh maybe that's the next album to make something completely different and you just put yourself in a different environment. The thing is, I'm kind of scared about new technology. I really, I really, I mean, it's been taking me like, I don't know, six, seven years to, to be able to understand what I'm, what I'm doing now in, in like the, the possibilities in, in Ableton. And, and, I don't know if I'm... I was switching from... That's like boring technical stuff. But when I was switching from Cubase to Logic, I spent probably a month or something just to... Like that transition from one sequence to another. Even though they are really similar in look and feel and everything. So... And I don't really, I mean, we don't hear from you for a year. We know what's happened. Well, I don't know. I mean, I, I kind of like using Ableton for live and then I using Logic for studio. I, it just works and I don't really need to change that. And, I don't know. I think if you depend too much of your creative musical output on the technological or the tools you're working with, I think maybe it's easy to get lost in technology. I think it's important to always have like a musical perspective. First of all, I was actually working a lot of, uh, with a lot of hardware and stuff. I bought like a, that was prior to, uh, to this album. Uh, I had the studio full of drum machines and synthesizers and tape machines and everything. I tried to hook up everything. And after a few years, I realized that my technical knowledge is so bad. I just discovered that all the stuff just died for me. Or it died... I was like... Coming in the studio one morning, I was turning on the synthesizer and it wasn't working. And I was like, I don't really know how to fix it. Or the guy who is fixing stuff for me, he's too busy. And I just realized that this is killing my workflow and the creativity. I guess I've been actually getting... I've been going back to the way I started working with music, just with a computer and not much more. So I feel Space 2 then is coming up. I mean, the thing is, I don't really... I don't really know if working with... I mean, for me, after working with a lot of hardware and trying to work on tape and stuff... after doing that and just going back to working in the computer was such a relief and just like wow everything is working all the time and nothing no problems whatsoever and I believe that the way I'm working with the computer now will be very different from how I worked before like five six seven years ago anyway because uh my perspective of things is uh is different now uh i've been listening to a lot of different music and uh What have you been listening to? You said you're not listening to contemporary. Well, a lot of different music. But you're not listening to electronic music, contemporary electronic music so much. Well, I'm not listening. I guess it kind of boils down to that I'm not really listening to... music that is similar to what I'm doing myself because I don't really I always find it really interesting when you put out an album and like the where you go and everyone was like oh you must be listening to Can and you're like no not really Well, everybody was very hesitant to come in here and be like, so you're listening to, you know, prog rock all the time. Because I'm sure you were listening to like, you know, folk music or something. Well, I think it's kind of fun. I mean, it's pretty obvious. Sometimes it's pretty obvious where the influences are coming from. You don't, I mean, it's like. Okay, I haven't been listening to Jean-Michel Char when I was making that album, even though a lot of people were thinking that maybe. But it's no surprise that I was listening to a lot of like Manuel Göttingen and Tangerine Dream and that kind of... I mean, I... I don't really sit down and like, like try to, of course, copy or try to like rip off people. But, uh, I, I, I just listened to a lot of the stuff on a, on a, maybe if I just like the feeling, uh, I, I just feel for doing something similar or something. What does this new album feel like? For me? Yeah, for like old albums in your mind. Not that you were listening to them, but that it has the same sort of... My album? Yeah. I don't know. I mean... I wanted to make an album that was... First of all, I wanted to make it sound different than... Did I say that before? well I really wanted to make something that maybe some people would like think oh this is really weird I don't really understand this I don't even think I like it and maybe they will just leave it for a few years and then they will pick it up after a few years and again and I think well it sounds different now No. No. No. No. No. Thank you.
