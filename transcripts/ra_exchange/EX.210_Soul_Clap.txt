Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, our series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Will Lynch, and I'm the Associate Editor of Resident Advisor. For Soul Clap, the last five years have been extraordinary. In 2010, the Boston duo shot to stardom for a number of reasons. There was their fun-loving DJ style, which combined low-slung house with pop, funk, and R&B. There was their partnership with Wolf and Lamb, which pushed both duos forward and gave us a rare double-disc edition of DJ kicks. And there were those notorious edits, which made DJ weapons out of pop songs by artists like Laidback and Kanye West. By now, Soul Clap have reached an interesting phase in their Their touring schedule has relaxed a bit and they're spending a lot of time in the studio. Later this year, they'll release a record with funk legend George Clinton, one of their all-time heroes. On a recent afternoon in our office in Berlin, I talked with Charlie and Eli about where they came from and where they might be headed. I wasn't there to see it, but... you played with George Clinton. Like your slot was Soul Clap plus George Clinton at 230 or whatever. Yeah, I was just curious, like what exactly how exactly that worked this is a was a performance that we've been working up towards for a long time and rather than i think the typical soul clap tag team i decided i wanted to sing backup eli kind of held it down djing instrumentals and george sang and emceed Charlie, Saadi Ali. Saadi is George's nephew and George's granddaughter, Tanisha. Candy Apple Red also sang backup. So it was cool with George and then three backup singers. What was really interesting was that we were trying... for weeks to get a hold of George to figure out how we were going to do it because we were billed, but we hadn't exactly figured out the show. Eli and I had an idea of what we wanted to do, but we wanted to run it by George. And George was off touring. He was in Ibiza doing the Dance Music Awards thing there, the IMS. It wasn't until we were on a private jet from upstate New York to Detroit with George that we actually got a chance to discuss what was going to go down. And he was just like, oh yeah, we're just going to feel it out. And then when we were actually up there on stage, he's like, we don't really know what the fuck we're doing, but here we are. You know, it worked. It was cool. We did one of our new songs with him, which was great. And I mean, just the crowd was, it was pretty incredible just to be there. Hand on my shoulder. George's hand on my shoulder. Doing One Nation under a groove. Pretty crazy. Yeah, did you spend much time with George until then? Yeah, yeah, we've spent a good amount of time with him now. We had some time with him in Tallahassee, where he lives, where the studios are. And then we had some time in L.A. when we were doing the Red Bull session. And this was, what, the third time we hung out? Yeah, I mean, we've been to Tallahassee twice now. But he wasn't there the second time. But he wasn't there the second time. And we also spent some time. Eli got to go to the show in Boston. Yeah. We were both at the show. Oh, yeah, we hung out in New York. In New York at BB King's. Part of this experience meeting George Clinton has been a... long-running documentary that we're kind of tentatively calling the Funk Summit, where E-funk meets P-funk. So to do a lot of this, there's been these interviews going on. In BB Kings in New York, we finally got our sit-down with George interview. And I think at that moment, we kind of transcended into a friendship out of this kind of working relationship into a friendly thing. I think he finally, we start understanding each other. I think definitely it really felt like we turned a corner for this. Detroit thing like just the leading up to it hanging out with him the discussions of what was going to be and then the performance and after the performance was all really just we really yeah finally understood each other I think You guys are making the documentary? This guy, Chris Tarantino, is making the documentary. He's actually the one who linked us up with the P-Funk crew initially via his friend Chuck the Funk Fishman, who is this Jewish kid. He's older now, but when he was like 16, he ran away from home to tour with P-Funk. And George put... his nephew, Sadi, in charge of taking care of Chuck because they were kind of close to the same age. Sadi's a little bit older. So he's like, who's this white kid I got to take care of now? So he's like driving with Chuck everywhere. And basically they became like brothers, like best friends. And so through Chuck, we were introduced to Sadi. And Chris, once he heard it was actually happening, he just really, you know, he followed us down to Tallahassee the and then to LA and also on this trip. So. He's kind of like, you know, he's a friend of all of us. So it's been very organic and natural. Not like camera in your face. More like, you know, just hanging out and catching the moments. It's been almost two years running. More than two years running this documentary. So we haven't seen any of it. So it's exciting. He's working on editing it now. I think it's going to be great. We're putting the release out in the fall. Ideally, the documentary is coming out at the same time. This is all going on on our end while with George Clinton, there's a new George Clinton or Funkadelic album. It's a Funkadelic album, right? I think so, yeah. It's a Funkadelic album coming out called Shake the Gate. That's also tagged onto George's biography, autobiography. That's titled, Hey, George, ain't all this funkin' kinda hard on ya? Oh, that's the other time. I DJ'd the book signing party in Manhattan. The book's not out yet, though. So that was like, what, a special preview thing? It must have been. I think the signing, even though the book, yeah, even, you know. They're kind of a mess. They're a mess. You know, yeah. It's what you would think that it would be like to work with Parliament Funkadelic, you know? But what's so cool is, like, they have this really family vibe, you know? It's like George, his actual family, but then, like, the whole band family. And it's really similar to our whole crew love thing. You know, everybody looks out for each other. Everybody tours together. Everybody makes music together. So that's been something that's been, it's really special to get to see that and see that they've been doing it for that long, this long. And George has always been so committed to his people and not just, I'm George Clinton, fuck y'all. It's really cool. Were you consciously like inspired by that family vibe? Does that have any influence on the crew love vibe? The crew love thing has kind of built itself outside of that. But I think it's been inspiring to see that. And in a funny way, it made us value our crew even more. We've been welcomed into that family, and that's really great, and we love spending time with them. But crew love is our real family. It's like our brothers and sisters. It's made us value the crew love thing even more. Another parallel is the many different names that represents the same Parliament Funkadelic thing. Like, one, it's Parliament Funkadelic, it's George Clinton, it's Bootsy Collins, Eddie Hazel, whatever. Pete Funk All-Stars. Pete Funk All-Stars. And similar with us with crew love, like, you know, one time we're soul clap. One time I'm lonely. See one time he's bamboozle. He's Eli gold. There's baby Prince who is also got it from Wolfenlam, et cetera, et cetera. There's all these different names and clever issues, but it's all the same creative source. You know, that's cool. Why does that work for you? you know, why does that strike you as like the way to do it? I would think that, you know, it's an opportunity to explore different sides of yourself and kind of satisfy all the different creative needs. Yes. I guess you guys have been this family unit for a while, but since you have a lot of freedom inside that family unit, you know, there's a lot of room for possibility and stuff. Totally. Not to mention that both. Wolfenland philosophy and our philosophy for their record label and ours and our artists and their artists is just to kind of do what you feel. Just like, just do you. It's never been a pressure for a particular sound. It's encouraging exploration and, you know, experimentation and risk-taking, but in everybody's own way. You're not, it's never like, you should do this. It's more like, this reminds me of this, or this inspires what you're doing now, makes me think of this. Why don't you listen to it for some inspiration? And then the next time you want it to be something totally different. You never want to go in the studio, trying to do the same thing each time. And that's really, I think. All the artists push each other. That's what's so great about having this family is because we're comfortable. There's no ego involved. So we can be honest and tell each other how we feel about the music and really continue, push each other to continue growing. Do you guys still have that, you had the wire, right? Yeah. The file sharing thing. We still got the wire. We still got the wire. You know, it's more on Dropbox now than you send it. We still send stuff through, you send it, but I mean, I think it's more like, it developed more into like kind of an email list, message board, something where we just kind of send funny, funny YouTube videos, talk shit. and then send music when we have cool music that we want to share. Definitely a lot of shit talking. You know, like high school jokes, toilet humor, toilet baby humor. It plays a creative role though, right? Like you send each other like stems and stuff like that. Yeah, well, it definitely happens that, you know, if someone's sharing their stems for someone to remix or like has a new track, anybody can, anybody. crew can download it so if you hear something that inspires you you just start working on it it's not like uh it makes it very loose and i guess the shit talking and everything also serves kind of a creative role that it's like you're all you know still buddies all the time even if you're not you know if you haven't seen each other in a while and stuff yeah you maintain this kind of stay connected to go back to george clinton for a second yeah you know in a way i'm sure you're um used to this kind of thing by now but I imagine it's a bit surreal that your lives would have led you to a point where you're collaborating with George Clinton you're comparing your you know your crew to the way his crew works and stuff like I don't know it seems like you guys have been into this stuff for so long it's does it feel strange that you know you're just working with George Clinton on stuff when I was when I was 10 11 12 I was in summer camp and um Hancock, Vermont at a camp called Camp Kill Elite. And there was a camper band and my two camp counselors, Ben and Dave Harris, introduced me to. Parliament Funkadelic, and we had a camper band that was a cover band. And I was, I had the role of George Clinton. So it's been in my life since preteen. And the thought of, I mean, we definitely paid homage to it all the time with E-Funk and the E-Funk mixtape and just the idea, the inspiration, E-Funk, G-Funk, but to actually break through. And like be down there, like to have Saadi knight us as, you know, Funkadelic. It's like complete, like beyond any dreams. Yeah, it's strange. There was actually a point about a year and a half ago where I felt like I had achieved any goal that I could have ever possibly wanted out of. a career in music and I really needed to like think like what the fuck else I want to do like with this career. It's surreal. But I think now it's just, exciting because now we get to work with all these great musicians that also got to touch the grace. For example, we were just hanging out with Amp Fiddler and Amp was touring with Parliament Funkadelic. for, you know, a while there as the keyboard player. Or in New York, we were hanging out with Lady Kier from D-Lite. And D-Lite used, you know, members of Funkadelic to tour those albums. Bootsy was all over it, right? You know, there's this great umbrella of amazing talent that's gone on, you know. 40 years. That's cool. It's making our sound really exciting. There's going to be a lot of cool music in the next year or so. I mean, this is like, you know, it's all these studio musicians being able to have real, real accomplished musicians on the, on the tracks. It's a whole new, amazing step. So that's like a concrete thing. come out of it for you guys is um you have all these connections for live studio musicians yeah well not only that but we've recorded the ep that we that we're doing with george some of the songs will be on his album and then you know there's some other ones that are special for the ep but the other times that we were recording in tallahassee with the younger musicians that are aren't necessarily in Parliament Funkadelic, the band, but they're just kind of hanging out in their studios, like young vocalists. And some of them are the kids of Funkadelic band members or their friends. Yeah. As well as active members of the band, like, for example, the keyboard player now, Danny Bedrosian, who's also from Boston and went to Berklee. which is a cool connection. But like he's just laced us up with just all that nasty synth disgustingness that's going to be really prominently featured in a lot of this music. like forthcoming kind of have to figure out how to make it fit together and how to release it but it's raw all the raw materials it's dope it's so dope it's like you know variety of tempos it's dance it's you know more poppy funky r&b it's great Do you kind of feel like you're at the threshold of sort of like a new period for Soul Clap, for your crew? I think so. Yeah? I feel it a lot. It's inspired me a lot to explore singing on our music a lot more and kind of just going for it. My balls have grown. They're big balls now. Big grown folks balls now. How are your balls, Eli? They're still the same size. As long as they're not, as long as they're, you know, hanging in the right way. They're still distended, yeah. From where I stand, it seems like you're painting a picture that's pretty different from the past five years or so since things kind of took off for you guys. I've seen you mainly as DJs. It seems like you're kind of entering into a more... you know, complex, like, I think we've been working, we've been working really hard with the whole crew love thing with Wolf and Lamb to kind of dig our own little path away from just dance music, just club music. I mean, like our album. was really an attempt to do that. I don't know if we accomplished it fully, but it was like our first pushing out into actually writing songs. And then in the show, you know, the crew love show is a big part of the concept is that it's a hybrid of a party and a concert. So there's all the live performances and there's, you know, DJ interludes. And then there's a party, the DJ party at the end. So I think it's, we've been working really hard to, to be more musical and to be. deeper than just club music. And I think now finally this is having all these opportunities that have come together in the last two years, I think now we're finally ready to pull it all together into a new phase, to a new stage. Yeah, I think that's really well said. And I think also I definitely get ahead of myself with the excitement of the P-Funk thing. And then, you know, in kind of sitting here realizing that. so much of that the next phase has to do with being inspired by the rest of the crew love guys and watching the development of like no regular play or you know the new young guys nick monaco and navid azadi like coming out of their DJ background and taking it to the stage. That's just been really just amazing. Pillow Talk also, just watching them become monsters. Gremlins. They've become gremlins. Actually, they've always been gremlins. It seems like you always kind of compare it to other DJs. you always kind of had club music a little bit at arm's length. I remember the first mix I ever heard from you guys a long, long time ago in Boston was like... kind of like pop and R&B and playing like R&B tracks at Watergate and stuff like that. It seems like you always kind of wanted to, you know, you had this other side of things you were trying to bring into the picture, you know? It's really funny. I mean, we spent so much of the early 2000s forced to play hip hop and, you know, more pop music in clubs in Boston. And we were always trying to sneak in house and sneak in dance music. and now the world is so flipped that it's like you're always trying to sneak in slow music. You're trying to sneak in old-school hip-hop and R&B and pop in the same way that people sometimes look at you funny, in the same way that it was in Boston, in the opposite way that it used to be. It's really ironic. It's funny that dance music has so taken over the world. How are you finding the dance music scene in Boston these days? It's really vibrant. It's great. I mean, there's still a lot of the same problems that were there before. There's no mid-sized venues. There's almost no venues still that do dance music on the weekends. They're still scared of it or not interested in it. I mean, sure, you can go to a club, a bigger club and hear EDM, but like... And you get little sprinklings in there, like maybe Club on Stroke at one of these more bottle service cheesy clubs or stuff like that. But the underground is still really underground. That's Boston. At least the powers that be are a little bit more supportive. Like Eli DJ'd with the new mayor of Boston. The Menino's out, the old mayor. He's the new mayor of Boston. His name is, oh shoot, how am I forgetting his name? He's great. I mean, he's totally, clearly he's doing it for reasons to stimulate business and actual economic growth in Boston, but he's open to the arts and the creative and the music. He dropped the ceremonial first beat at Together Fest. That's when I DJed with him. Did he scratch with the CDJ? Yeah, he was scratching a little bit. It was funny. Yo, he's got crab scratch style. So it's a really positive step. However, you know, they tried to pass a resolution to extend the bars and clubs till 4 a.m. And it was still heavily overturned. So it's Puritan town, Puritan state. When did that get voted out? That was like a few weeks ago. Yeah, even though Marty Walsh is the mayor's name. Shout out Marty Walsh. He was pushing really hard for it, but city council. So, you know, it's tough. There's always going to be the same struggles there, I think, because it's such a student-oriented place, very transient. People come and go. So it's hard to actually build something really long-term. But, I mean, musically, it's really incredible. And now there's finally artists getting recognition and touring the world, like John Barrera just had that amazing piece. on RA. I was so happy about that. And Khan is really killing it now. He has his own edit label. He had his album on BBE. So he's touring more and more too. So I'm actually getting goosebumps thinking about him. So it's really exciting. So more important than anything, finally, electronic musicians from Boston are getting global recognition, which is such a huge step. The Wednesdays we used to do also is like, it's like doing well. It was like ghost town for us for years. Unless you had a big DJ, you know, and you just did resonance. It was, it was impossible. But now it's, there's like nice crop of young kids. Good looking, cool, down for fun. It's great. And it's just like, you know, townies. Is that still Midweek Techno? It's called Reset now. Randy Deshaies kind of took over when we left. When did you guys start that night at Midweek Techno? Well, what was it called before it was Midweek Techno? The thing is that Wednesday at Phoenix Landing had been going since the 90s. Yeah. As a electronic music night. It had gone through many different resident DJs and styles. And like each time kind of the torch was passed, it got a new name or new. Pat Fontes. Before us was Pat Fontes. And it was shit. But it was a really sign of the times, though, that like saying techno in the in the name. Of the night was, you know, that's like a move away from what was dominating, which was kind of more like the early 2000s, like Derek Carter. Bumpy house. Bumpy house. I mean, that was when we were looking to Berlin. We never had been here. And looking to Europe and all this really post-minimal, you know, like when it kind of went really housey. Parlon was incredible and really experimenting and adding this real warm, live feel to it. And so we were like, oh, well, this is the... techno this is different this is underground i always think about like you were saying before there's these challenges that are always be there but it's almost like you wonder if there's something particularly inspiring about what you just said like you're in this place and you're looking over to europe and the fact that you don't even have that much firsthand experience like maybe almost makes it more gives it more mystique or like kind of captures your imagination a little bit more or something you know definitely i mean i think we really looked at wow berlin wow, we would have DJs come who are living here, you know? just thought it was like you know this cool electronic music paradise which it kind of is so it's cool i mean i don't think i've lost any of the mystique once i was here you know i still at least those first few years was really everything's just so much happening you could see anything do anything anywhere so cool yeah people definitely will talk shit about things changing, getting too popular, but you know, it's still pretty wild over here. You know? Yeah, I think it's interesting, like the Berlin Panorama or whatever, Bar 25, to someone that has never been there versus like in your imagination, like that's almost the most inspiring thing of all. And that's, you know, people that grew up in a place like Boston, that's the thing that keeps you going, you know, is this sort of like idea of like, what could that possibly be like? Yeah, there was definitely a few years where it was like that. We just didn't have any idea. Eli, you're back in Boston now, right? I was back in Boston. I actually just moved to New York. So we're both in New York now, finally. We can finally get in the studio and finish our next album. It's really exciting. Does it feel like you're kind of settling back down after like a crazy few years, or is it still kind of the same tempo? Well, for me, going back to Boston, I mean, my wife was in graduate school. So that was definitely a beginning of settling down, like, you know, a year and a half, two years ago, and we moved back there. And then when Charlie moved to New York last April, that was the beginning of your settling down, right? And I think for the last couple of years, we've really... you know, we didn't get into this when we were super young, we were already almost 30. So I think we pretty quickly realized that we needed to be a little bit grounded and not just tour all the time. If we were going to build a little longevity and like focus on music and focus on doing it right. Rather than just. going, going, going. So it's been a slow learning process of how, you know, we still want to be playing lots of shows and enjoying it and flying around and sharing our music, but also having time for ourselves so we can really enjoy it, you know, be rested, be healthy. I'd say quite personally that I burnt my... I found myself out in the first chunk of our early career and I was desperate for something to cling on to and just relax and also get that grounding. But I feel like also like a new wave of curiosity to explore some of these amazing places that we've now been. a few times. Like we just got to South Africa. Finally, we're really cracking Asia in new ways. Like there's a lot of, for me, I think also just like a lot more exploring and it's a lot more fun again. Hitting new markets is so cool. Getting to play a city for the first time. Really, that's a feeling you can only get that first time in that city, right? I mean, you can never really recreate it. You can find a place that you love playing and that you make a lot of friends and you enjoy going to. But that first time is always such a mystery. But shit, man, when you never unpack your bags and it's just going, going, going, like, it was pretty crazy. It's a crazy lifestyle. Well, and you were like spending part of the year in Berlin and part of it in Miami or something like that. That was great, though. I mean, getting the amazing Berlin summer and the beautiful Miami winter. Yeah. We're trying to get more time in Miami. Yeah. It's good. Yeah, you said you didn't really get started until you were almost 30, but when you say you didn't get started, do you mean like properly touring a lot? Yeah, well, we started touring, what, like 27 that year. That was it, so that's like, what? Five years ago or so. I mean, we had been, you know, doing our thing in Boston. We'd been throwing parties. We'd been writing music since around like 2006. Like seriously since 2006. But then, yeah, the crazy touring started in 2009. Yeah, five years ago. What made that kick off? crazy cosmic luck. I mean, a lot of right place at the right time. I mean, Wolf and Lamb, really. Yeah, like we had put all this hard work in. We'd been struggling so hard to DJ. We'd been learning, learning. Boston helped us build this foundation that was really unique. That no one else has this combination of dance music and pop music in the same way that we do. From DJing all these clubs in Boston. And then, you know, everybody knows shopping malls and weddings and all this stuff. But then the moment where Wolfenland was basically looking for their next step out of techno and minimal and bringing soul into dance music. And we met them right at this moment when we had started getting really good at writing edits. So this connection, right when they were, you know, getting our label of the month and blowing up, we came together. And so that timing when I think the whole industry was looking for this, an infusion of a new sound. And we linked up with a crew that was the right platform and that made so much sense personally and creatively. And that was what really kickstarted it. That first edit record, that Love Light and Conscious that Wolf and I put out on Wolf and I'm Black. was really, I think really what it was that kickstarted us. I would say also just like the Hail Mary past was extravaganza. That's kind of when like the world really got behind. That edit. Yeah. And I would also want to shout out Gully from the Geist Agency because she just... She saw it in us. She blew us up. Yeah. And she's done that for a lot of big names in dance music. She's an expert at taking a new talent and exposing them. And she's definitely one of the best in the game. So we got really lucky. about DJ malls and weddings and all that stuff. So when you guys were younger and you didn't have, you know, your foot in the door on like, you know, good gigs and whatnot, what, I mean, well, maybe you're saying playing Macy's is not a good gig. Well, I guess I'm just, it's interesting to me. Like, um, when you're playing weddings and Macy's and stuff at that time, were you thinking of it? Like, we want this to lead to like eventually playing fabric or whatever, just where you're just screwing around. There's so many steps that want to, it's like such a long process. I mean, like I started doing mobile DJing, you know, when I was 15 years old, I had a DJ business. And I never had another job. I've worked in a drugstore near my parents' house so I could save up and buy my turntables. After that, I've never had another job other than DJing. Wait, so you're saying drugs and music is all you know. Drugs and music is all I know. So it was like, this is just what we did to survive, you know? Before we were doing SoulCloud, we had another production company with another partner. And we had a moment, this was around wait a second. And Charlie and I had always been into house music and that was our connection. That's how we came together. But then we were also doing the mobile thing as our business to make a living. And we realized, we said, wait a second, do we really want to be some 40-year-old bar mitzvah DJs? Like, the direction we're going, if we continue in this direction, sure, we'll be DJs, but it's not what we imagined being a DJ. you know I mean at that time too there wasn't this global culture like people touring the way they're touring it wasn't this dominant music so I mean sure It would be a dream to play these clubs, you know? I don't think we ever imagined it actually happening at that moment. It was just like, okay, well, let's make music. We need to make music now. It's the only way we're going to have a chance to do this beyond just playing in these parties in Boston and these gigs in Boston. So we sold our shares of this DJ company, this mobile DJ promotion company. So sorry, so the mobile DJ thing is like people would hire you to play it, you know. their event right we were like an entertainment one stop because we did everything from mobile djing to bars and if we were lucky nightclubs promoting doing the promotion and bring the people but promotion for clubs as well as tanning salons like anything any marketing that would hire us like we would work Hustling or just hustling? We were hustling. We also had like equipment rentals that we would do. Yeah, go set up speakers for people. We would have internship programs for Northeastern University students to come in that wanted to be in the entertainment industry. we were scraping but I mean it's cool it seems like you know you got kicks out of that like just fun we were in our early 20s it was really you know it's fun it was good to be self-employed we were throwing like underground house events in Boston we started around that time like early 2000s too so that was like on the side but this is like our partner would always yell at us because we throw this party and lose money yeah You're like, what are you doing? We're like, we have to do this. So finally, we just needed to have our creative side. We're like, you know, fuck this. We've been running this business however many five years or something. And like seriously for five years. And we had to see what would happen. We said, okay, we're done with this. We have enough connections to DJ malls and stuff like that, which isn't terrible. And we can do during the day. So our nights and get in the studio every night. And so we spent a year like that before the edits and everything, that kickstarted. We put out records on Airdrop, more like kind of like housey techno stuff, techno-y house. So that was like the step. We accepted that we weren't going to achieve anything serious, you know, anything really creatively rewarding and artistic if we continued on the path we were on. And so we decided to risk it and go on this. And if it didn't work out, we were like, well, we're going to try this. If it doesn't work out, maybe we need to find something else to do. But luckily it worked out. It really worked out. And then the Wolf and Lamb thing was you guys were just hanging out at the Marcy or something. It was just like you met them socially. First, yeah. Zeb was actually hitting on Charlie's girlfriend. Yeah. There was this festival in New York called Mini Tech. Yeah, it was there. You were there? Yeah. That was a terrible, terrible weekend. Mini-wreck. We like to call it mini-wreck. Our boys from Airdrop, well, Henry from Airdrop, was working, helping out, doing a lot of the logistics. And, you know, these were the people that first believed in us, Paolo and Henry from... from airdrop. So we were there hanging out. Henry had his foot in the door in New York and, you know, we had seen wolf and lamb t-shirts maybe like on people. Like I promise I'll change t-shirts. What's in lame? Or since when did Jews make techno? like all the slogans at the various American electronic music festivals. But wait, the first time I heard of Wolf and Lamb, I was searching the internet. We were trying to like maybe do music for hotels and restaurants, you know, like musical programming. We thought maybe this was a business we could explore. And I was just Googling to see what the competition was. And I found the Marcy Hotel. I was like, wait a second. These guys, Wolf and Lamb are doing this soundtrack for this hotel. I didn't realize it was fake. You know, it was like, no one really does the first time. It was like the Wolf and Lamb website looked like a hotel. They had the Marcy Hotel actually like separate website and the Wolf and Lamb site. And it said music by Wolf and Lamb. So I was like, oh, wow, these guys are doing music for a real hotel. This is cool. And then I And word was like there was an after party in Brooklyn at the Marcy. And I remember going there with my ex-girlfriend at the time. We were kind of like, are we hanging out? We're hanging out. All right, we're going to the party. I remember I went in the wrong door and I went into what was our friend SM and Etsy's apartment, which is on the second floor, which is now our friend Brandon and Smirk and Itamar's apartment. And I remember going in there. There's nobody in the apartment, but there was a half smoking joint sitting on the counter. So I stole that shit right away. And I was like, whatever. Went downstairs. And yeah, Zev in his like very Zevy, like kind of sleazy way started hitting on my, on my ex. But that was like, that's the door, the door that opened. Cause I was like, oh, I've got this guy's attention sort of. So yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, there was like, you know, who are these guys? These elusive characters. you know, there's like, you know, at the time it was Gotti and Zev. There was, you know, Lee Curtis DJing. Sean Reeves. Sean Reeves. Seth Troxler was like, Wes, Seth, when are you going to play? Oh, play later. I'll play later, you know? And then out in the, when they had the courtyard open. Like all types of dance music people were there. It was really a who's who of the entire industry at that point. There was Martin Boutry, I remember. Local Dice was there. Maybe even Richie walking around because of all these people that had flown in to do this big. This was one of the first big underground festivals in New York, even though it was a complete fucking disaster. Yeah, we should clarify. The main thing is that. Everyone flew in to play this festival, and the festival hardly even happened. Half of it got shut down and everything. So there were all these DJs walking around New York looking for something to do, and they all supposedly converged on the Marcy Hotel. This was one for the history books. So we never met Gotti at that night, but we met Zev and gave him... the edits, the Love, Light, and Conscious. We started talking on Skype, right? And then sent them. And then at that time, they were really exploring meeting new artists and all this stuff. And this is how they did it. You know, they would be Skyping with their friends and with other artists that they met. And that's how we built our relationship initially. And this was before they actually put out the first record on the label. They just had the digital label. And then they put out that Lee Curtis record. And we did a review and giveaway on our blog. So we were really focusing on the Soul Clap blog as like a, you know, music hub. Then we heard No Regular Play. And then they heard our edits. And they started a whole side label just to put out the edits. That was it. I think at that time, Wolf and Lamb's big record was A Side of Penis. Yeah. Which I think if anyone hasn't heard that, they should go check that one out. I still play that one sometimes. It's cool. I guess that was like the fall or something? 2000? Yeah, like maybe September 2007? 2008. 2008. So how did you notice that sort of things picking up momentum? Like you release these edits and then like you just start getting like good offers. The edits came out in May 2010, which was also Paolo had moved to Europe, right? That summer he was moving back to Europe after going to university in the US. And he was like, okay, I'm going to organize you a tour in Europe. So that was our first time we came to Berlin. That was like later on in that summer. And he had organized it really off the airdrop releases, getting us recognition from that. Then all of a sudden people heard these edits and the whole schedule filled up with gigs. So that was like the combination of the two, Paolo putting in that groundwork. But also simultaneously through Wolf and Lamb, we had built these new bridges with Sean Reeves, who we had booked at our night in Boston and with Seth and with Lee and Ryan. And they were doing Soul Shower. And we would work all weekend on these edits or these weird tracks. and then send them over on Skype and then we'd get like feedback immediately because they were like, oh yeah, played your edit at Soul Shower. At Club Division there. That was their Tuesday night they did for a long time. So that's, you know, I think they helped us out a lot. Seth playing our records at Sunday School in Miami. That WMC, every party we went to when they were playing, they would play at least one of our records. records any of those guys so that was huge for us and then also i remember lee curtis playing both of the edits at at the movement festival in detroit yeah so like you know That still is big, you know, getting the DJ plays. Yeah, I just remember it was funny because I moved to Berlin around the same time. And then I remember when I saw you guys, whatever, Miami or something, it was just like when we last seen each other, like none of this stuff had happened. And then it was like less than a year later. And you were both like, you know, you were visibly like really busy touring international DJs. it was just it was kind of surreal it was such a big change had taken place and in a really really short yeah from may from may 2009 when we put out the edits to may 2010 we went from you know no one really knowing us to crazy that next summer 2010 we moved we lived in berlin for the summer and just went all over europe japan it was a crazy summer So you feel like there was kind of this like crazy, crazy momentum. Is that sort of like, is it still going? Like, do you still play gigs at that rate? Or are you sort of like, you know, getting into a more relaxed rhythm? I think we've chosen a more relaxed rhythm. However, we're grateful and fortunate enough to still have a growing demand that I think is even diversified into like. larger festivals and more commercial like possibilities. That's a whole nother conversation, like whether or not to, to accept or not. But yeah, I mean, um, We've got some loyal fans out there, so we're lucky. Is it hard to know how to play it? Like when you're in the midst of things taking off like that, you know, is it confusing? Like how exactly to proceed? I think that, you know, Charlie hit the nail on the head, like with Gully and then also with Gotti and Zev, who are like the most patient people probably in the entire music industry. You know, they're always preaching, just wait, just wait, don't rush it, just wait. Don't worry about it, it's going to be okay, just wait. And Gully, who always made sure that we were taking the right opportunities and not every opportunity. Having those people kind of as mentors, as guides. I think helped a lot. I think me more than Charlie, like I really have a strong vision of staying independent and I don't want to say underground because that word is so limiting, but like independent and just creative, you know, and like that being the number one priority. Like I always knew that and that having that support from, from the Wolf and them guys and Gully to, to do that. and not just take every opportunity and just was really important. I don't mean Charlie doesn't want to be creative. No, but he's right. I always understood this. I always had faith in this in a way that. I've really dreamed of selling out for like my whole life. So, you know, win casinos, like come see about me. I mean, like, shit, man. Back in 2006, when it was like, okay, are we going to do this? Part of it was, look, we're never going to take another fucking request again. Like, if we ever have to do something that's not... I got the tattoo. If we ever have to do something that's not, like, that doesn't feel right. that we don't like it, you know? Cause there's a lot of DJs out there that, that will say that they don't like the music that they play. Like that's a real fucking problem to have, you know, it can be difficult, successful, you know, DJs. That's like, yeah. Money DJs. Like. It's already difficult enough sometimes to not want to be touring, not want to be out late at night, but to not even like the music you play, that'll suck your soul dry. You guys want to name some names? Yeah. You know, Bugs Bunny, Sylvester. Yeah, I think it's a very real thing. Like, I mean, if you're playing all the time, you've been doing it for years, it's not guaranteed that your relationship with everything is going to stay fresh or that you're going to stay as excited as you were when you were younger. you know, he's still, it's how you make a living. I had an interesting conversation with Craig Richards, who in my opinion is like one of the greatest DJs. Like he's just magical. And he was like, you know, honestly, I've never really given a shit about being a DJ. And I was so inspired by that. Like he just doesn't even fucking care. And it's, I think by just having his mind on other things, he's just fluid. He always is kind of in his own little creative zone. That's why Craig's so good. Yeah, something you guys said earlier, you said the Funkadelic crew is like... there's this family of musicians and there's like their kids become musicians too. Is there a part of you that feels like you and the whole crew love crew, like you could just turn into this extended family over the years. Like you could just sort of chug along like this, you know, forever and ever. I hope so. Yeah, it feels like it. Eli, you're probably going to have kids before me. Maybe you should. set them up with some turntables to kind of go back to this like what you were saying about the pace of everything like i said we're already in our early 30s early mid 30s and like you know i'm married definitely plan on having kids some point sooner rather than later and so i actually talked to there's a lot of djs that have kids that are that are still touring or finding other ways to to balance it to still make a living but once you're on this path As a touring DJ, it's really hard to swing in other directions. You know, you can start a label, but you're never really going to be able to put enough work into it for that to be something that's going to make money. And everybody knows labels don't really make money anyway if you're going to put out music that you like. You could, you know, maybe go into radio, but how do you make a living doing radio? You know, like you could be a producer, but for me, it's more like, I mean, I love, I love making music, but I love DJing. This is, I'm not trying to go into producing some artists I've never met before or something so I can pay my bills, you know, it's tough. So once you're on this path, it's like. It's figuring out how you can continue on it, but also be a normal person, you know, also have a normal real life beyond it. What was I going with this? I don't know. That's the whole name of the game. I mean, I think it's a challenge that all DJs face when they get to a certain age, especially if they want to have kids and everything. Anybody who travels for a living, right? This is like where you hit an age, you hit a point. You always really want to enjoy what you're doing, right? And you also really want to enjoy the traveling part of it. And that's why that balance, like going and be present is a big part of it where are we i've given up on being normal you know i just don't think it's possible anymore we've seen too many weird things you know i on the flips i wouldn't mind producing artists that's like seems like a joy I feel like the possibilities are still pretty limitless, which is a good place to be. We just had dinner in Ibiza before playing Pasha, and Kevin Saunderson was one of the DJs, and he was there with his son, who's now like 20. Dante, yeah. 20, 22. And they're actually DJing tag team as a father-son combo, which I thought was really, really fucking cool. That must be so satisfying to like be on the road with your son and like play gigs together. It's pretty cool. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, there's definitely hope. Thank you.
