Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. As one of the preeminent chroniclers of UK bass music for the past decade, Blackdown... has had an enormous hand in explaining some of the fastest-moving genres to the wider world. As the label head of Keysound, he's been responsible for connecting many of those dots through a discography that reads like a who's who of bass music. Scream, Genius, Starkey have all featured. In addition to his own productions alongside Dusk, I talked to Blackdown about his twin passions, writing and music, earlier this year in, where else, London. *music* We had dinner the other night and I was, after a minute I was really surprised in a way to learn that you started out into techno and you wanted to be a techno journalist when you came to London. Yeah, I don't think a lot of people know that. I was also really into drum and bass, but my love of techno predates my love of drum and bass. And it's probably going to look quite bait that I'm saying it now for Resident Advisor. But it seems topical thing to bring up. And if I was to go on an interview and say things like, I love M. Plant and I love Robert Hood. And I love Carl Craig and I love Jeff Mills and all those things. Well, I certainly loved them a lot in that period. It would look a bit suspect. But people can come to my house and see I have Axis 8B and the mono box and all the implant releases. Atlezz and all the basic channel records because I love them and then so yeah I'm not gonna deny it but I did sort of fall out a lot with Techno and I think that should be also qualified I'm not I don't really buy it anymore and my relationship with Techno was I loved it really in the sort of mid 90s it only came up on a discussion i was having today online i loved it in the mid 90s but I realised at a certain point that I was loving it backwards. I'd started buying Detroit records and going backwards and working my way through the classics. And I also loved the stuff that was coming out at the time, like Implant and Axis and those things. But I was also more in love with the euphoria of UR and Carl Craig and Derek May and Juan Atkins and the rest. And I realized at a certain point that I had kind of consumed all the classics I could find. So you get back to Shari Vare and Jeff Mills and all that early. really early stuff even before mid 80s Detroit and I felt like I'd consumed them all and that was enough for me so and this coincided with a bunch of things happening in my life moving to London and really understanding the context of London music in its context totally changed my musical outlook. Also drum and bass getting a bit tired and there being, as I said in conversation with you, there being wanting to be a music journalist which is why I sort of started out with my... of them, beyond just buying records. And there being at least two exceptionally great Detroit techno journalists in London, of which if you wanted interviews with the top boys, you needed to join a queue, of which I was nowhere near the beginning of. And they were Jonas Stone and Tom Magicfeet. and they were very, very good at what they did and it was quite good that I came and fell in love with other things because I probably would have got nowhere with that avenue. I also came to reality with techno. I fell. When I came to London and started to understand multiculturalism more, well I loved the music and the vision of this place that was far away and alien to my culture and also quite capturing, which was Detroit. For all its good and bad bits, you know, the Highlander Project and White Flight and all the things that surround just the music. I found the scene started to be quite... monocultural and I'd moved into a multicultural and I found that really hard there. That thing that stuck in my head was of Robert Hood playing a hip-hop record at the beginning of the set and getting booed and this seemed insane to me and probably insane to him. So They're something I've built from and I don't totally consume that stuff now. It's very interesting you mentioned the Robert Hood getting booed thing and how when you take Grind for instance and how it's received in Detroit. Because obviously I assume a lot of the people who were really into techno at that time didn't. realize the context of electrifying mojo or something. Yeah, that's the name I was looking for. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Because the stuff you hear about with the Bell Bill 3 and stuff and that soup that they built, that creative soup they built Techno up, seems really diverse. And I know it was a kind of maybe in some ways. I'm not saying, I don't know, it just seemed musically diverse. I mean, the bands that Geoff Mills were in beforehand and things, and then being into, as well, European experimental bands, bands not produced as, you know, a craft book, and all these types of things. And then you get to techno-purism, and it was just... It's an avenue that you get, the road narrows, at which point there's nowhere left to go. And I just had that road blown apart for me by coming to London and discovering pirates and a route of where jungle had come from that I wasn't by the time I got there. to London Jungle wasn't the kind of 93 creativity that it had been. It was Garage by then and I fell in love with that massively. I guess it's one of the reasons why I love the beginning of Dubstep because Horsepals Gorgon sound on Temper 2 sounded like basic channel Garage. Because when it comes to music, it's really gaga. And that was a marrying of two or three of my favourite sort of things. Garage, Detroit Technos, a bit of the Berlin basic channel-y type stuff in there, and the sort of jungly spirit. it was pretty much perfect for me. Do you remember when you first heard that? Well, I don't remember literally the first time I heard it but I just described the effect upon me of hearing it. And there are many critical people, critics that argue that that was a sort of failure of Garage, Garage got worse. and they have some I understand the construction of their arguments I just can't deny that I loved all those musics and I found all those types of music in that record and other records around that time like the LB stuff and you know LB had basic channel records and I don't know how many garage producers I was in his studio I went to his studio many times in like 2001 hung out with him and he had the basic channel records some of the basic channel records there and he likes them and so that's a connection for me you can't just say to do with it, whatever. Some people try and argue with garage. Was that LB and horsepower sort of the first? that you got into. I mean obviously it's the beginning of the scene in general. It's not the first music I was into. I started listening really intensely to music in the mid-90s. So I went backwards as well. I used to buy the music magazine MUZIK which was a really good publication that Dusk and I both were really influenced by. And I used to buy it and read the reviews and if the review was amazing I'd buy the record but also I'd buy all the records they referenced that said it was as good as that. So then you use that as, you know, journalists like to mention all the things they're inspired by and the number of times the record's compared to Kraftwerk, the number of times the record is better than Kraftwerk is quite rare. So I was like, okay that's cool but I'm going to go buy the Kraftwerk out of Do you remember there were certain journalists names that were quite influential to you? Well... Or was it just the magazine in general? Quite a few of the staff are quite... There's a guy called Callum who's a review editor. He went on to become a lawyer. And there was a guy called Tom Mugridge, I think. and I don't know what he did Rob DeBank was the club's editor he's obviously still on Radio 1 and does all the best of all parties and yeah I don't know and Frank Tope was the heavyweight reviewer and he's still around house sort of dawn but I don't know I don't know if those particular journalists particularly influenced me beyond what they were writing about there are other people later on for instance my writing style I've read more but they didn't work at music magazine per se who were those writers that you feel like has influenced your style over the years massively I've um There's people I've worked with and people I've read and argued with on forums. And there's a cluster, there's different clusters. I mean, Chantelle Fiddy I worked very directly with in the early days of Juice magazine. And Juice magazine was set up to cover Garage, but Garage collapsed and we ended up just writing about all the first... grime and dubstep and what would go on to be funky so she and I had a real sort of musical connection at that time and whatever any verse I've gone on to do I will always remember you know each day would be covering each day would be like oh this is a new group called Nasty Crew oh this is a new group called Roll Deep oh this is a thing called "Oh, there's a new guy called Digital Mystics." "Oh, there's a Dizzy album." "Oh, Dizzy's been stabbed." It was just such a series of amazing things to write about. In terms of influencing my style, I don't know. I think a lot of people know a lot of these bloggers and writers. I read a lot of Simon Reynolds, I think most people did. I spent a lot of time, long periods of time talking to Steve Goodman. He was alongside Chantel, probably the person I spoke to most in the last decade. People know him as Code9 now. He was a journalist too, he wrote for Juice and he's a journalist and he didn't spend a very long time doing it but we spent a lot more time. talking about music and I think that influenced me pretty immensely more than probably anyone else. He's wrote a lot less than a lot of people but I think he influenced me personally a lot more in his thinking. and there are other good bloggers over the years. I mean, a lot of the places like Descensus and Ilexa, for whatever the banter of them, they're useful for collections of smart people thinking in cool ways about music, even if you don't agree with their point of view on music. Sure. Tell me about Deuce. How did you get involved with that? So, Deuce was the offshoot magazine of Knowledge magazine, which was a sort of drum-based bible for a long time. And I can't remember exactly how I ended up writing for them, but I remember getting a call. I can't remember whether I wrote for the Jungle side of it first or they just came to me straight away, but they said it was my first and probably only proper journalism job, music journalism job, and I was their news editor on both magazines. So I sort of had 15 pages to fill on both of them in the front of news cuttings and so on. And it was sort of a two-person business run out of Hackney Wick. and pretty ideal location really for dealing with East London music. And Sean Settle was the main features writer. And we just, because the Dew stuff was, they were a drum based magazine and they were trying to corner the garage market and kind of grind them, dubstep. But these things were really small concerns and it was just unviable. So it went for, I don't know how many exactly a number it was. It got into double figures, maybe even 30, I don't know. I'll have to check. But it eventually was unviable and had to stop. But the stuff we did still stands the test of time. I think because the artists, you open it now and you've got all this Dizzy and there's Little B and I did the first Tinchy interview and I thought when he turned up he'd send his little brother and now he's like the biggest selling urban artist of the last year or I think it was last year. you know more urban UK sales than anyone else or more sales than anyone else I don't know it was insane uh and the list goes on Kano um all these artists that went on to be huge need to be wily dizzy um Scream, Banga you know Code Nine was writing for them So it's a hotbed and we were just given a little reign to go and find them when we had a great time doing it Did you ever think I mean when you were coming to these people? They would get As popular as it is that they would become pop stars I think the Grime Guys always kind of wanted to, and one of the beginnings of the Simon Reynolds' slightly induced backlash to Grime was that it didn't become that popular and quick. They wanted that. They all wanted to be successful. It's just only later that the Grime Guys worked out how to do it. Is he? did it by himself and it was proved not to be a formula that could be reproduced by others because Dizzy is utterly unique and actually he's gone on to sell even more by basically taking paths that are quite similar to the paths that the guys and Graham are now selling like Skepta. Tinchy Strider and Tiny Temperance and other things. So it wasn't clear. Dubstep's a different story. Dubstep was a small, tiny, ugly urchin that nobody wanted for five or six years. I mean, by six years, I always start, you know, I started doing Dubstep in 2000 because that's really, or 2000, yeah, 2000, because that's when... The ghost sound and ghost horsepower, artwork, Forest Jay, those kind of Z-bias. Really four, five, six camps, that was it. And those guys were making a darker form of Garage that definitely felt distinct from Garage. And that went on as a small cluster that was basically incubated by a few key kind of people helping it survive for many years. never ever ever felt that it was going to work and I didn't care I kept going and I loved it and it was a brilliant part but there was no inkling I remember Steve Goodman saying to me, "It will find its market." I just didn't believe him. I don't know if he quite knew how true he was going to be. It's not a zero-sum game here because he was burying it, but still, even those times, and that must have been about '03, '04 when he said that. You know, people would say, it was attacked from all sides. Grime guys were like, you're all sock. Brakes guys were like, it's too slow, it's too boring. Garage guys were like, it's not garage. You know, everyone from other things, brakes guys, there was all these intersections. Broken Beats guys were like, it's not kind of, you know, smart enough, or in inverted commas, smart, you know. They were running into their kind of modal chords and stuff. And there were all these interactions, Bugs and the Act played forward. Brakes guys, it's the Brake Step, Brakeby Garage sort of thing that went on, just a parallel faction. You know, the Grime guys, actually the Grime guys eventually came around and were actually quite influential, but, you know, if you can pick off all those things, they basically, for a long period of time, they said it would never work. And so, the idea, to read the original question, that... Did we think it was gonna be this big? No. I mean, I think some people might have wanted it to be. I think everybody wanted it to be big DJs, but I went to dozens, if not hundreds of clubs when there was... I knew everyone in the room, everyone that knew everyone in the room, you know. I went to Black Sheep Bar in Croydon. And there were a couple of nights at Black Sheep Bar in the recording room where there were more people behind the decks than there were on the dance floor. And there were more people behind the decks. There was as many people behind the decks as by the bar staff. And if you took them out, there was basically nobody in there. There was one of the Black Sheep Bar ones where it was like, Mala, Loafer, Joe and Ice. scream. I can't remember. I mean, there's a combination of those sort of types of people all just playing and there was nobody there. And there was one I didn't go to because I was playing football and I spoke to Kodine afterward and... it was referred to as the dancing robot night because they didn't have anyone to dance with but they had this, somebody brought an automated robot that went in circles to the music and it was sort of symptomatic of how the fact that it was just so ludicrous. Now I remember Mala playing Forgive off Dubplay which is one of my favourite Mala productions of all time and definitely in the top four or five. And I tried to sign it. And what happened is it came out on Deep Medi a few years later after I tried to sign it. And I remember him playing it and it was just an absolute thing of beauty and wonder and the screen was flipping out and I was flipping it out and there's just nobody there. So, you mentioned the other day about the Shackleton interview, you were saying about there weren't that many people that thought it. By the time Shackleton got to it, it was certainly the stuff he's talking to at Plastic People. I mean, it was ten times what I'm talking about in the beginning days. So they had ten people. It was 40 or 50 people. I remember seeing Slimzy play at Plastic People. and um philip sherburne run into the middle of the dance floor again and he was the only one on the dance floor to slimzy it was like this is like oh four or something like sims he's like one of the most influential grime d but he is the most influential grime dj of all time um and certainly one of the most influential london djs anyway so i don't know what i don't want to make a value judgment on there was nobody there but it's just a historical fact that it was this small insulated scene that nobody wanted anything to do with so to back to the original point do we ever think it was going to blow up no But you were still covering it in the magazine quite a bit. Yeah, I mean the juice folded. Colin the editor said it's just not working. People don't want to buy it. Which is fine, it reflects the fact that dubstep was totally tiny and grime was not commercially successful. And magazines, you know, they're basically print magazines, they were increasingly becoming very difficult economic things to run. They were hit double-sized from the music industry. because on one hand mp3s were coming along and people weren't buying so much music and then also they weren't buying music so there was no record company sales so people couldn't afford to advertise and the internet was also being hit but because there were forums and other things to where to consume music you didn't need to buy a magazine anymore so music magazines began to evaporate and that's around that time I started vlogging so I guess after a while I just shifted my influence my focus from from writing for Juice and that sort of stuff to blogging really. And actually, oddly, Chantal and I managed to end up getting blogs in the same week completely without consulting each other. And I only got a blog. because I wanted to see how easy it was to register for Blogspot. And there I was. The blog has gotten quite big. I mean, it's sort of a nexus, I think, for a lot of different people. Yeah, I don't really know. For many, many years, I never looked at the pages. I looked at them the first time, I think. about six months ago and I started it in 2004. So it's not bigger than Dovesip Forum or anything else. But I try to be profoundly selfish with it. I'm very rarely influenced by other people asking me to write for them. Partly because I don't have time and partly because I like to be. I only write about things that I truly, truly am willing to say I believe in. And sometimes, very occasionally I will help people out if there's sort of a key time that they need to write about something. But usually often when it makes a really interesting interview. So I often... I will cover it, but broadly I'll only ever write about someone if I think it's not necessarily interesting but the time is right. And blogging was super liberating. Maybe people coming up now who've only known this world won't really appreciate it, but I... Chantelle and I toiled away at Deuce magazine and felt like we were the only ones. In parallel, there's... cluster of ground bloggers like Simon Reynolds and Jess and Jess Harvell and Simon Silverdoll Circle and a bunch of those other guys they were blogging in their own way as well and it did feel like nobody was listening and when I started blogging I suddenly got much more I felt like I had much more feedback and it was super liberating because it felt like you were getting your word sort of voice out there. I mean similarly with Gutter Breaks there's a Kigo who I sort of saw as a peer on the dubstep side you know and it really gets the word out there in the way that we were trying to reduce but you know you're sending sort of 2000 copies and you know it doesn't reach many people. You mentioned you know catching people at the right time with interviews and doing pieces I mean can you... In your mind, are there two or three pieces that you were like, that was the exact right moment to catch Dizzy or something? Yeah, Dizzy, Wiley, Berry, all those three felt right time, right place. When did you first talk to him, Dizzy? Dizzy, I was tracking from about '02 and then I think I did a big interview with him early in '03 but it might have been the end of '02, I'd have to double check. It's on the archive of the Hyperdub.net website as well, when Hyperdub was a magazine. My interview with Dizzy is there, it's archived. I think it's on riddim.ca. You can find it. The same applies really to my feeling towards that tour. my interview with Wiley which was about 2003 as well I did two of them two really massive interviews with Wiley in about 2003 and those three interviews are probably my favourite interviews that I've ever done all the time I felt like you could just see the DNA of Garage being just ripped apart and the base pairs being thrown out of the room and then somebody else bringing other base pairs in and just building a new organism and these guys were just incredible the lives they were living were so different from mine and so distant and it was speaking both about amazing music being being created like literally changing before our eyes and then also they were talking about lives and cultures and communities I'm not from and I don't and ways of living that I didn't know about and that's what I think is one of amazing things about music is that bridge that you can connect with people. Like talking to you over dinner last Friday, like I never met you before but we talked for four hours and the same would be with Dizzy. we would have something to talk about and I would learn more about where he's from and what he's about and I've learned a lot about the things that people from different classes and cultures and communities in London that I learnt more about those lives and understand them better than maybe people from my background or a background similar to mine that don't do music and I see that as profoundly powerful The funny thing about you asking about Detroit was when the beginning of Dubstep was coming around, I looked really to the kind of grand narratives of Detroit. People talked about the Heidelberg Project and they talked about UR and the waves of Detroit and so on. One thing that really frustrated me and motivated me... as a writer, one into the other. Nobody was talking about this amazing music coming out of London and that started throwing me into my blog and to Deuce magazine and interviewing people like Dizzy and Burial and LB and people like that. And I very deliberately was like, why are people celebrating all this Detroit stuff? This stuff is equally here. What is the grand narrative? And trying to think about what it is to all those darker, edgier, garagey genres, ex-garagey genres, all the threads running between them and so on. And that's really... formed the basis of a lot of my writing for many years. I think some of that has started to dissolve now, but that central theme of darkness and edge and decay, I don't know if it's so central now, but for a long time that wove through so much of what I was writing about. Did you consciously, when you were writing about it, sort of feel like you had a responsibility to sort of... of build a narrative almost or at least impart a narrative. I don't want to make it sound like I made it up. but I wanted to see, I wanted to represent the cultures and the traditions that were here and hold them up as high as the ones that were being celebrated by British journalists from overseas. - It's very interesting, I guess, because for me living in the Midwest, when that grime and stuff first started hitting. It was this alien thing and I wrote friends and they sent me tapes and I was listening to it in the car and I was just like, I can't believe this is going on over there. It's the same other, you know, because it's not there. But here's the great other, right? This is what I'm talking about with the bridges. People, and I did this long series of interviews with Nico Hogg, this photographer who's amazing at photographing parts of London that nobody else wants to photograph. Nico Hogg on Flickr, have a look for him. Please link to him. He's a genius. And so this other thing, cool, right, Detroit, it's miles away from London, it's some other thing, out of the planet. But actually, there are bits of London that are other to many Londoners. And I just became obsessed by it in this thing of like there being concentric circles of people, like holding patterns of planes above each other when they never met. And what music allowed me to do and journalism and DJing and everything was to cross those things, like those glass ceilings I wasn't supposed to go through. The people in, you know... my background didn't know I had a connection to who I was talking to and you can see how it comes out in the media, a lot of misunderstanding about pejorative terms and just totally demonising different parts of British society and music has allowed me to step over that and to understand better the way different communities function and to make lesser value judgements about them. It's really key. So someone like Nico Hogg, if you look at his photographs, he goes places that other people don't go in London. I mean, you know, let's celebrate them. And there are many people who live in certain bits, in the affluence of London, who never leave those and don't understand that there are other bits of London. And London is really jumbled up and people live on top of each other. It doesn't have concentric rings like Detroit did of white flight and segregation and like maybe the States did. Excuse me if my generalisation is so clumsy because I know that different cities and states are different. But generally the lows are lower I understand in the States and the highs are higher. And London is deliberately town planned or whatever so that it is all jumbled up in places. But yeah. There were still these glass walls in cultural walls where even if you could live on top of each other, you wouldn't know each other. Like the train, the monorail that goes over Shadwell, that goes into the city, that takes all the high-end executive bankers into the Canary Wharf and stuff, goes over Shadwell. which is one of the grimiest things. It goes over like 20 feet. And you look down these Victorian decaying buildings and just pass through them and there's no connection. I've always found this really confusing. I don't know if you'd trim in the Isle of Dogs and you can just see the massive Canary Wharf building glowing there right near his house all the time. And yet there's no way anyone's ever going to give him the life chances to work and earn the kind of money that people were doing in the city. So I love the music that comes out of life. but it opened up doors for me in a really different way and I've absolutely treasured that as much as I have just the music. It's like cultural tourism if you just start doing the 'I like going places I don't belong' stuff but it's building bridges with people in a positive way and I find that really amazing. Did it become apparent that you needed to start releasing things yourself? Or was that always the... plan that was always the dream yeah I don't know it's quite DIY I mean or necessity so you mean releasing our own records yeah well and starting the label yeah well they came out the same thing really which is I think many people started so we started writing records or trying to produce some sort of 2000 2001 like most people we spent a lot of time talking about it and not actually doing it me Dusk and another friend of ours who ended up not even doing it And when we first went forward at Velvet Rooms, which is the old place it was, we suddenly were dropped into this ecosystem where basically most people in the room were producers or friends of producers or wannabe MCs or DJs. And I felt it was the journalists I was contributing, but it became apparent only up to a certain point, and things were being driven forward by the producers. It made you want to produce and so all many, many of the A-list producers in dubstep that you could name, certainly for a very long period of time, had come to that and either already were producers and wanted to be part of it or became producers. Either way, it was a very competitive kind of environment. So we were part of that, yet we weren't good enough for a long time. And we knew, and I just was in my head of like, well, we'll just wait and we'll get better. We got to a certain point, which probably wasn't good enough, but it was good enough to give finished tracks to people. And we wanted to be on Temper, and we wanted to be on other record labels around. of time and the stuff wasn't a good enough standard and then it got better and we still didn't get on these very, you know, the records weren't selling at all and even the best artists couldn't get releases released quickly and you had to self-fund them and they lost money. So like everyone else really, almost exactly like Hyperdub, we started out of necessity which was No one else would do it so we do it for ourselves And that was actually a profoundly useful thing as your destiny is in your own hands and so Pinch gave me a recommendation for a distribution deal and by that point it was 2005 and stuff was starting to slightly pick up so people outside of Dovestech had heard of it. So people were curious about getting involved so at that time it was relatively easier to get a deal. So it started to furrow so we were lucky enough and... We got a deal, a P&D deal, and yeah, released our first record. So it's necessity in DIY, really. - Do you look back on that record? Do you listen to it still? - No, I haven't for a very long time. I think I like a lot of people, your early productions. you a little. The drums on Submerged were way too thin and I didn't know... I wanted them to be like LB drums and you listen to them now and they're really not. I can go into the Sonic EQ compression reasons why they're not but you know I'm proud of that first record it was definitely the best thing we'd done after a sort of five years work so that's cool but Yeah, it's a starting point. I had a teacher in school that said your first idea that you have of anything is the worst one and everything else will be better than that. And it made me a pessimist, but I feel like that. You have to start somewhere. and get on with it. And when people say to me, "I want to learn to produce," and what should I do, the first thing I say to them is, "Make lots of music." And it sounds like a department of the bleeding obvious, but do it a lot because you'll get better at it. And all the other things are then iterations after that. It's the same way as writing, of course. Just write as much as you can, as often as you can. But I do think with that first record, particularly Drenched, it set the scene for a lot of the key sound stuff, the atmospherics and the rain and things like that, and grime samples buried in dubstep records and things that we built on for Margins Music and that developed. like just tweaking stuff, like setting the template. There is actually a reggae sample in Submerge that we almost never did again after that. But in Drenched, there's little samples of Dizzy. It's part of the thing where we very rarely want to sample records or vocal samples outside of the UK. Not because we're trying to be some sort of nationalist crazy dudes. It's just that it's like part of this, we want to be part of this continuum. and rather than reworking US rap records and stuff, which Jungle was endemic of that, it was Paris One samples and all these sort of things, and it was actually, no, no, we want to do this thing that's uniquely ours, and part of that was we understood the key role of the voice in music, but it had to be, if we wanted to represent something from London, it was... It had to be a London voice, so in a cool way. And Grime was that perfect thing, even in a dubstep context for us. So there's a sample from a Dizzy record. one of the few ones where he lets his acapella free and Dusk and I were chopping it and I think Dusk noticed that it says not a lot of braining blah blah blah not a lot of braining like thinking and Dusk cut the beginning of it off and then just used it and it just says braining And then the track has rain samples in it and stuff, so it's that sense of a dirty, decaying city that we used a lot in those early records. And it's just got Dizzy saying, Pitchdown saying, rain in, but he doesn't say it. So there's little fun things that you love about early records, but I think we made better ones afterwards, but then most people do ask Chloe for a bite. Thank you. Do you like explaining what all is going into these records or do you consciously decide to keep things to yourself? No, people don't really ask, but I like it. I listened to a lot of electronica in the mid-90s. I was a big Black Dog fan. I'd encountered a lot of that, all that Warp stuff. And one of the things I'm very clear with dubstep is I didn't want to be that when it came along. One of the things that frustrated me about that general era was the kind of anonymous, sort of techy... digits, almost like the invoking of sci-fi or computers for computers sake, all these very techno-y angles to them. This really influenced I think the Keysound art and the vision for that with that and we wanted to I wanted to tell people about the constituent parts. It was the opposite of things like the Global Communications album that hasn't got any track names. Oh, I'll let the people imagine. No, no, I want people to know what I'm thinking about. So, you know, we did say, as much as possible, explain in a blog about it, write about this, put little quotes and stuff on the records. you know, add a little sort of hints and things and yeah, I felt very strong. I didn't want this anonymous faceless technobolics, as they say. I did want there to be narratives with people and humanity and stories and lives and bring as much of that as possible into it. Rain, spaces and yeah, those were all the things we were interested in. I liked all that. It feels very personal in a way. I wanted it to be personal. I wanted to evoke a space and a place. I mean, maybe it's not, you know, it's not literal, it's not everyday, but imagine a place and how people will imagine it. Like, as a kid, I imagined Detroit. I wanted that for London. And that's what we tried to do. With the other artists on the label, if you can just talk about in general a couple of them, what is it about them that really is so important to you? If there was a tipping point with the label at about 8th or 9th release when we were busy writing music and I suddenly deciding on what I should, realised what I should do is widen the remit, the conceptual, what I felt that album was about, widen it and so don't just be quite literal about it. Yeah, we can release other people's music. And it started with a Genius record, Genius, Wiley, Rico and Breeze, all role deep legends and pay to go legends. These are people I super looked up to and from London, so the chance to release the record was just brilliant. Yeah, great. Probably my favourite remix by me. And then it kind of built from there organically, you know, things like the Starkey record and so on. Okay, he's not a Londoner, brilliant, but it's a grime record. It is a grime record. One of the best grime records never made in London, in my very biased opinion. I put goods on it by contacting him and so just try to build that. Generally what it's built into is a kind of collection of people who have different takes on this London thing, whether they're literally from London or not. it's irrelevant now um so you asked me to talk specifically about some of the artists i mean i i guess the first really really key artist for the artists of able lhf and in a relative terms they're quite late in the cycle we're nearly at the 20th release and they were like 18 19 but if anyone catches that spirit of pirate london the jungle the garage all these spaces and twisted headspace is it's them. You know I've worked really closely with them, much more than is probably visible yet so far. I mean, you know, all their stuff. I help them, if I give them feedback on how stuff is written. We mix it together in my house, and so I engineer it and they help with engineering and say, "We want this." And yeah, so yeah, it's been a full 360 thing, you know, a range of the folks who go along and do all that. I haven't taken the shots for their two releases so far, but yeah, so it's properly involved with helping their sound because I believe in it so deeply, I think. they capture a spirit of... Well, I don't think they specifically relate to 2006, sort of. 2005 dubstep thing, but I think there's a spirit of that in what they do, but also a really unbound free sort of thing. There's much about, I think there's much about Sun Ra and the Brain Feeder stuff and far off distant places as they do London as well. That freeness is always what dubstep was about for me and was about for many people. So, yeah, I think LHF are great. And all the artists on the label I've tried to build connections with and make a kind of camp where people interact with each other. Cowton, who comes from sort of the techno angle, he's been sending me music for like five years. It's now on that direction, but before it was like Youngster Half-Step as Narcissist. Grievous Angel, we did an amazing job remixing our album in this much more widescreen, Ableton Redux version. Who else? Scratcher, before he really blew up with Hyperdub, he did an amazingly scary grime record with us and we did a kind of like dark and deadly refix. I'm out. And then it gets into Sully and people like that, LV. And they're all people I think, I see it as like a kind of field, like in the physics sense. So you have different positions like, you know, in that field. So Grime and Garage and Dubstep and Techno and House and like all the kind of pirate, like a pirate field. And I'm trying to find records that zigzag between them, not just are exactly on the money. So Counten record is not really a techno record. The first one is Stasis G-Mix. And it's not really a basic channel record, and it's not really a garage record, and it's not really a dubstep record, but it's somewhere all between those, and that's what makes it really interesting for me. In fact, Stasis, the original 4-4 mix of Stasis, I said to him, it's quite cool, I like the vibe of it, but it's too much like one thing, and I'm not looking to release just one thing. What about a two-step mix of it? That'll have a third thing, and then it'll be kind of not quite any of the previous, and he did that one evening and came back to me. The next one is the... Yardman, which is a kind of, it's by Ballistic Beats, who are normally a grime duo, but they're just influenced by dancehall. And so it's like kind of that one drop rhythm kind of culture, but at 140, it sounds like live instruments, but it's them playing, and it's got loads of the kind of yard influence, and grime emcees on it, like Rico and Badness and Jamaican. be. So it's not a grime record and it's not really a Jamaican one-drop dancehall record and it's really not a dubstep record but it's somewhere in between those three that I'm really excited about and it's just got a really cool vibe and it's the kind of thing that other people wouldn't put out because it isn't a smash or it isn't a crowd batterer and I don't care. Do you find that that's been a problem that you're not putting out bashers? Sometimes. Somebody asked me about this recently. 40DL asked me about this when I was trying to introduce him. And he switched it around instead. sound why don't you? I guess for me it just never occurs to me they're not club records. Records that only work in a club I find a bit boring sometimes. They can be just a bit too functional and predictable and moronic. And stuff that's just too noodley and you can only listen to in your bedroom is often too noodley. And I have this kind of constant that it has to be both. And sometimes it swings a bit too one way and sometimes it swings a bit too up the other. But I have to be able to listen to it and enjoy it as a piece of music at home and also be able to play it in a club and it has impact. And that's what we're trying to do. And if it goes beyond those two different parameters sometimes, or too far beyond them, it's kind of lost it for me. It's either... you know, whatever, like I said. So, that's good. But these kind of dynamic tensions are very key in dance music, you know. It's like the 4-4 constriction, or at least the 4-4 time signature. And it's like, yes, you could make 17, 2 1⁄2, like, dubstep. But, you know... It's not that clever to be that clever, you know? Needlessly obscure loses a lot of people, and even the stuff that Keysound is doing is probably obscure by most people's standards, so you don't want to get off too many tensions. So it's a constant tension, but these tensions often create amazing results. totally free music can be truly extreme. I don't know if I'm looking for total extremes. I'm looking for something that fits these amazing criteria. You said also you have a few albums coming up. Yeah, the ones that I can talk about, well, I mean, I've talked about the LHF album. I would hope that will be finished by the end of this year or the beginning of next because there's so much music going on to it. Quite a labour-intensive process. But it's positive, the stuff they're doing, so I'm feeling very excited about that. But more close to home, the first thing is the LV album. LV, through their associations with Hyperdub and stuff, I don't think they've really got some of the credit of the records that they deserve. They're so talented. And so they've got an album coming out with this vocalist called Josh Eden called Roots on Keysound that's coming out on the 2nd of May. And it's their first proper album. Well, I mean, obviously I'm entirely, completely, utterly biased, but it's a thing of wonder. Josh is all the way through it on every track. Sometimes he gets four syllables and sometimes he's entirely got, like, verse, chorus, verse, chorus. They're chopped into pieces in large parts. There's all these crazy kind of detuned synths and odd vocal hooks and like... almost like the Duke logic of cutting out vocals but applied to Josh and I don't even know if it listens to any G but it sounds a bit like that to me in places. There's none of the G drums and those are the kind of infectious quato rhythms and it's got a proper narrative to it. There's bits of it where you imagine Josh going to clubs and storming out and there's bits where he's breaking up with girls and then he's not. and some of it's just really joyous, and some of it, one of the tunes, I mean, it's like some sort of hands in the air rave record. And if I'd just been sent that, I would have been like, what? But in the context of the album, it's brilliant. Speakers spit primary colors, it says in the record. and speakers spitting primary colours but it's just a great visual imagery and it just loops so yeah I'm really excited by it I'm really it's really coherent in a way that it's just so hard to do for albums and I've written one you know and I've listened to hundreds of other people that coherence and that sense of narrative is just from a series of constituent parts it's really hard to do And there will be other albums this year on Keysound, but they're not really ready yet enough to talk about. The other thing around the time of the LP album is a collaboration between Zeb Bias and Steve Gurley called Roll, which is kind of a dark, funky record. It's pretty cool having two of my heroes on, you know. on Keysound, Zeb Bias was one of the very absolute foundational dubsteppers and Steve Gurley is proto-foundational dubstep because he was basically super quiet and silent when that was really Zeb Bias and LB were having that dialogue that was becoming the foundation of dubstep but they all referenced him as being an amazing producer and the stuff he'd done in the couple of years previous really stand up in that time so I'm honoured really and you know I like funky but I don't know if Keystone's right for the totally vocal stuff but the kind of dark or slightly edgy sort of building dubstep record it's perfect you know Gurley as well, he was Ted Bias' mentor and he was in Foul Play and all the Jungle things and you know, it's a true honour. You know you've mentioned a lot of genres but I think that's the first time you mentioned Funky at all. Yeah? In this conversation. Well it's been a retrospective interview. Are you excited about it? funky at the moment is that yeah I mean I listen to it a lot it is the next It's part of the next wave of these genres that began with Attic House and went through Jungle and what people refer to as the hardcore cartoon. I find it problematic at the moment because I don't find enough of the records that I like, but I listen to it a lot. At worst, it's sort of mediocre, and at the best, it's amazing. which you can't say for dubstep, you know, and you can't say for a lot of genres. So some of it just gets too safe for me and too kind of vocal and polite. But some of it's just amazing, absolutely. There's the rhythmic. I love drums. I love programming drums. I'm addicted to drums. I'm bored by boring drums. You know, I see them in my sleep. And so... You know, the funky stuff, you know, all the off-beat soca snares and then the flip... All the programming is brilliant and then, you know, the way they play the vocals. When it gets it right, it's amazing. But I don't personally think, and I've argued this and been shouted at by many critics, I don't personally think it's going through a purple patch at the moment. And I'm told I listen to the wrong records and I listen to them and I don't hear what other You have to listen to be honest with yourself with these records. I find that very frustrating with critics that make very, very long elaborate arguments and why I listen to the record is totally terrible. And maybe that's because they have different tastes in music than me, or maybe it's because they prefer making long elaborate arguments. But sometimes I think it's the latter. I'd like to like more funky records than I do, but I'm happy with the fact that currently there's still a few cool ones and they're good. And it remains to be seen what's going on, because the current thing in London is this, on the Pirates, amongst that demographic, is this really housey house, like this, straight. Dennis Ferrer, dressy garage crowd stuff, except without none of the rudeness of garage. It's just a really straight house. And that's what a lot of people in the pirate culture listen to. And it's fine, except I've heard loads of that house, and it's just a bit tepid for me. So it's cool. I'm not going to be involved with something else. The cycles of ownership will continue and become something else. And I thought that was going to happen with... some of these guys, but it doesn't look like it will in the short term, but it's just a bit housey sometimes. - From a kind of sort of outsider's perspective, it feels like going backward in a way. - Well, Code called it a holding pattern. My friend Emma Warren, who's someone who gave me one of my first breaks in writing. On Saturday she called it "Sorbet" because it's like the kind of palate cleanser between different genres. So maybe that house stuff is that. And it seems to happen quite a lot with hardcore continuum genres. At a certain point, it subsumes itself back into these big sort of megaplexes of other genres, then bites a piece of it, says, we're going to, like, the cycle of ownership says, okay, you can stop telling us what to do now, especially in America, and to a certain extent, Jamaica. And they said, we're going to have our bit of it. We're going to do it our way. We're going to twist it. We're going to take the methods of production and the tools and apply them to our sonics and make this London thing. And that's what made Jungle, and that's what made Acid House, and that's what made UK Garage, and that's what made UK Funky. So I'm hoping that will happen to the house. stuff but right now there's a lot of kind of very sort of tasteful uh trad sort of house stuff going on and that's cool you know because uh you know there's various agendas with certain things and making sure clubs are safe and being sophisticated and smart and dressy and i'm not going to quiz i'll just personally for me and i've come from the lineage where a lot of these genres the thing they have in common is that rudeness and a lot of that doesn't have that reason.
