The day is new. One, two. Hello and welcome to Resident of Pfizer's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident of Pfizer. On this edition of the Exchange, we'll be taking you live to Montreal, where over the course of the next few days, we'll be talking to a number of artists performing live at the Mutech Festival. We're calling it the RA Live Exchange Center. and we're hoping you'll enjoy this particular chat with Marc Leclerc, aka Acufin. One of MicroHouse's biggest names, Leclerc's sample-happy house full-length My Way is a touchstone for many. Nowadays, he's recording more and more under the name Horror Inc., though. I talked with him in front of a live audience on Thursday, June 2, 2011, the difference between the two, and much more. A young man named Marconi managed to make the Atlantic Ocean cross the Aegean Sea. you We recently ran an interview with you on the website. It was kind of focusing more on what's going on now. So I wanted to do a little bit of talking about the past. Did you grow up in Montreal? Were you born here? I was born. I was raised here. I lived pretty much all my life here. When did you first start getting into music? Was it a brother or your parents or something? No, actually, no. I was brought up in a home where there was not so much, I would say, musical background. My parents were listening to the radio, pretty much, you know, and no brothers, no sisters, so it pretty much came together on my own. And what were some of those sort of formative influences? Was it going to a show or going to a record shop? No, I mean, we always had like a little turntable in the house, you know, and my parents, of course, had the worst record collection possible. But I always had fun playing with a double tape deck. I was a very early age doing some cut and paste with tape decks, taking the whole Elvis records and Pericomo and trying to make some mishmash with that. But yeah, so it's been always a lot of music on my part because I was seeking on my own. I think the fact that the music in my house was not so much appealing. I was very curious to go and dig and seek and see what I can find that would interest me. Was hip-hop something that was sort of first for you, that cut-and-paste aesthetic? No, actually, hip-hop was a long time. after that. I would say hip-hop, I discovered hip-hop around 86 with Public Enemy. They came to Montreal for the first time around that time and my roommate actually went to the public enemy and a me show and filmed it and went on stage with the guys and had a lot of fun. And he brought back the records home and I listened to it and it was something that was really appealing to me. I wouldn't say the new hip-hop gangster rap is not my cup of tea, but the old school hip-hop is definitely something that I've really got into and I even tried to do some myself. I've got some experiments at home. How did those turn out? It turned out pretty good, actually. Yeah, I'm waiting. That's another project. You'll see it in 10 years from now. Was it the music that was appealing, or was it the lyrics, or was it both, the whole package? Both, of course. I mean, initially, when it started, there was a more political speech. It was more politically engaged. Of course, I'm a big Gil Scott Heron fan. I mean, rest in peace. And I went to see him last year, and of course, he was the godfather of hip-hop. known from, you know, I've heard his music many years before I've discovered hip-hop. But yes, hip-hop definitely, yeah, politically is very well. And the, was Public Enemy sort of that first group for you, or were there other groups around there that was also? It was, yeah, for sure. It was around the MC, of course, like the usual, you know, there was I'm a big Beastie Boys fan, I gotta say, very much into what they're doing. Not a very political group in their early days. Not political, but, well... I don't know how we can look at politics really. Political can mean various things. I think Beastie Boys in a way was kind of manifesting something that let's say Negative Land was doing also. There's a lot of cut and paste. I've always been into cut and paste artists very much. And around, even before this, you were also listening to sort of classical music. Steve Reich and a lot of classical I would say before contemporary music I was listening to a lot of classical music a lot of Russian classical musicians like Alexander Skryabin and Shostakovich a lot from the more romantic period like Franz Liszt Chopin and then Debussy How did you run into this stuff and sort of appreciate it? Because for me, drawing those connections... Well, first of all, all sorts of music always interest me. I'm not fancying one over another. I think music has been something I've been embracing as a whole, all my life. And I've discovered all that music, actually. On my way back from school, there was a record shop next to my house. I always took my pocket money and go and get some records. I would just pick some stuff at random just to discover stuff, and I still do that today. day. Every week I go shop for vinyls. I go shop for vinyls, but not necessarily electronic music. We've got very nice record shops here in Montreal. Beatnik and Primitive on Saint-Denis, who are carrying a lot of jazz, funk, soul, Motown. Contemporary music, abstract music. And the classical stuff, it seems like Reich made a really huge impact. Reich, yeah, actually, it's funny. I've discovered Philip Glass first. First album I bought was Koyaanis Kwezi and the Glassworks. And I was just stunned by it. I just, I couldn't take it. It took like endless walk on the street, you know, and just listening to that music. Just could not believe, you know, that this was actually man-made. It was so, as I said in an interview on Resident Advisor, it was like all elements of nature unchained, but still this pulse, constant pulse. And Reich came after, but Reich became my favorite. definitely, yeah. Musically speaking. When you were first starting to make your own music, can you talk about sort of that process? Like, what was the music that you were making and when was it? Yeah, the first music I was... First of all, I was playing in bands when I was... From the age of 11 to the age of 16, I was in bands playing guitar, some keyboards. It was kind of ska, jazzy music. And then after being in bands for four or five years, I got a little bored by writing everybody else's parts, you know, like play this, play this. I was like, I might as well go on my own. And then electronic music just happened at this time. I discovered... My cousin of mine actually introduced me to Devo. It's funny because everybody thinks like, oh, Kraftwerk is probably like Akifens influence, but I think it was more influenced by Devo. And so I had my first sequencer and first synthesizer and started doing some loops, kind of like Steve Reich loop. And I had like four... a four-tracker like a Tascam, and I was just doing loops and loops and loops. Do you remember when you got the sequencer and sampler, what were the first things that you were like, I want to loop that up and see what happens? Well, to begin with, when the first sampler came available, the first affordable sampler available on the market, it was the Ensoniq to Mirage. And it was pretty much like a cheap version of a Mellotron. So it was like ensembles, you know, and strings, and not so good. I mean, at that time it was very impressive, you know, when you were like 14 walking into a record music shop and try that. And then later on I started sampling, I would say around 87, 88, I was in a band in Montreal. called Atomic Kitchen Gravity. I don't know if anybody remembers that. Anyways, it was very psychedelic, kind of very much influenced by the residents, I would say, because these were people I was really looking up to at the time. Did you wear an eyeball? No, no, no, but we had some pretty crazy setups. Yeah, I don't want to go into that now, but it was pretty insane. But yes, the first thing we were sampling from, I think, on my part, was from an Exotica record, like Esquivel and Paris Prado and that kind of stuff. And obviously Throbbing Gristle was doing this sort of Zotica thing. Was that an influence as well? It was part of it, for sure. We loved Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV. When we came to Montreal, I went to see the show at Fofonelektrik. And who came up with the name for that band? Was that you? Anomic Christian Gravity? I think we all came to that name altogether. We're three people actually. One of the people is actually a DJ here in Montreal called Christian Miron. It was quite interesting. Were you a good bandmate? We were excellent bandmates. We were actually roommates. We were living in this tiny apartment on the Plateau Mont-Voyal. Anyways, that's another story. So you eventually went out on your own, sort of doing experiments. When did you first start coming up with things that you felt like, maybe I can put this out? Did it take a couple of years before you felt comfortable with the stuff that you were making? Well, let's put it this way. I've never felt comfortable. I don't think I'm never ready and I'll ever be ready. But it was in my mind to release music, I think, for several years. I was working on music on my own. bands and definitely you know it was not only in my mind but in every musician I knew in Montreal to in their mind to release music the only the only issue I think was the fact that there was it was not easy to to release record as it is today pretty much anyone today can can can release, put a bit of money in and release a record. Back then we would release tapes. We'd go from store to store and leave them there in consignment and see if people would listen to it. Was it just the cost of putting together the record? No, the infrastructure was just not there. There was nothing in place. Very few artists made it in Montreal at that time. I guess I can think of men without hats. I can think of... There was janitors animated. There was a few artists here who made it at the time, but it was not easy. And then this is, I think this whole thing changed when Mutech came into picture. And I guess MUTEC acts kind of acted as a kind of infrastructure for a lot of things to happen. Yeah, MUTEC built some bridges. Can you talk a little bit about the years, I guess, directly before the festival? Was this still a situation where you're like, I have this music, there's no real way to get it out there? Can you repeat the question? please the years just preceding the festival yeah obviously people were doing stuff to sort of create the festival you know doing things wondering sort of from your perspective especially like what is what was this time like you know in the years sort of building up to it was did it feel like something was going on something was going on definitely we felt something was uh was in the air i mean I knew Alain from UTEC for 20 years, I think. We've been discussing this a long time before the festival took shape. It was a very slow process, but once the ball was... Once the thing was launched, then it just like... I don't know how to say that in English, but anyways, it just... Sorry? Yeah, snowball. Had you already put out records on Trapez and other labels before the festival started? I started releasing records actually a long time ago. I started in like in 94, I believe. I was in a duo here in Montreal called Juicebox. Some people remember that. It was house music. And then I had a personal project called Noise Slacker, which was more industrial, kind of an effects twin. FX20ish and then after Mutech happened in 1999 but before that it was a media lounge. Mutech was part of like a window and a media lounge to to present some artists, some local artists, and some people, international artists as well. And yeah, I think this is when it all started. And when did you start the Acufant project? Acufant project started exactly the same year as Mutech, actually, in 2000. And what was the impetus behind it? I mean, had you not been doing in the other groups that you wanted to sort of explore with this? No, Akifan was actually... How can I say? I wanted to come out of the dynamic, the group dynamic with Akifan. I just wanted to be on my own for a while. And since then, I have to admit, it's been difficult for me to collaborate with other artists. This is something I really want to do in the future. But Akifin, yeah, seriously, I mean, when I think about it, it was definitely... a way of getting away from the whole group dynamic and trying to compromise all the time. I just wanted to come up with my thing and don't have to... When you made the first couple of songs, did you feel like, okay, I'm on to something? It just came really fast, really quickly. I moved to Windsor for like a year. just before Mutech happened. I got my first PC before I was working with Atari. Very good, very good. But anyways, I started making my first pieces with this PC and not really knowing what I was doing. I was just listening at the time to what was happening in Europe, you know, and I was, I don't want to say I was trying to emulate. Of course, I was inspired by what was going on. Who were some of the artists that you were listening to? Time, oh my God. That's a very good question. I cannot think of it right now. There's so many influences. But it was mainly, I would say it was mainly Detroit and Chicago in the beginning, for sure. And with the first couple of releases you were cutting things up quite a bit. The whole cut up thing came into place when I came actually to MUTEC the first year. I was staying with a friend of mine and had no synthesizers or no sound sources available. And so I decided to take the radio and see what I could get out of it. Was it quite a painstaking process? No, it came very naturally because the whole cut and paste method for me was always very present throughout my life, not only as a musician but also as a visual artist. I've done all my studies in visual art and I was very much into collage. ready-made and Kalawrekski. So I was doing lots of mosaic with pictures I would pick up from, I would get from magazines and papers. And so for me this aesthetic was still there and I just applied it to music. My Way was dedicated to this artist. Jean-Paul Riopelle. Thank you. He seems to be obviously quite an influence as a visual artist on your musical work. Yeah, he's one of those artists that I really admire, not only because of his work, but because of... because of the tenacity he had, because of all the efforts he invested in his career, and because he was very determined. And he is still to that day our most renowned painter around the world. He went to France when he was young and met with André Breton. and came back to Montreal and spread the whole surrealism seed here. And then there was a movement here in Montreal in which Jean-Paul Riepel was, which was called The Automatist. And it was... We could say it was the surrealistic cell or the answer to surrealism in Europe. You mentioned to me earlier that he published a manifesto as well. I mean, Paul-Emile Bordure, a painter, was teaching at l'Ecole du Meubles here in Montreal. was actually the man who wrote the manifesto. Riopelle, among other local artists, co-signed it. And when this was launched, it created like a whole turmoil in the cultural community. What was in the manifesto that caused such turmoil? They were opposing to the presence, the strong presence of the clergy, the church in the culture. And they wanted to dismantle everything that was... was in place and to build a new foundation for abstract and modern art pretty much. - And do you feel like back in the early aughts, late 90s, that there was a similar sensibility, not necessarily a manifesto being drawn up, but like among artists? electronic music artists that sort of were tearing up some of the old rules and pushing forward. Absolutely, absolutely. But I think that what was in the Refus Global could easily be applied to any... any moments of history in which there are conflicts like we're living these days, politically, socially. What was the conflict back in the late 90s in Montreal in your mind? No, I'm just talking about the whole political situation. around the world, you know, I think we're all aware that there's a race on the right side, you know, and that the conservatives are, you know, gaining a lot of space here. And so, yeah, I think it would be time to maybe to get something like that together again because the culture is one of their last, one of the least last concerns. Can you talk a little bit about the writing of My Way? How long did it take? What was the process? Was it all quite quick for you? It was a bit of both, actually. When I started writing my way, it was bits and pieces. I've had like 10 pieces that I've started. It was like bases. And I went in the wood and decided to retract myself and go in a remote place. where I would not be disturbed. I had no television, no telephone, no way of communicating. And so I went there for, I was there for about a month, I would say. But there was two weeks of very intense struggling, because I had those 10 bases, and I didn't know where to go with that. And I've tried for a while to work on each. piece, you know, separately. And finally, it all, after two weeks, it just clicked. And I've just started working on every piece. every day just a little bit until I got the result I wanted but then I had to come back to Montreal there was a whole mastering process also but all together it took about a month and a half I would say to put together were you surprised at the reaction very much very much very much I it's still very hard for me to comprehend what happened exactly Because I've always been doing the same thing, you know. I was making music for years and I was not expecting anything anymore. I think pretty much, I say I could pretty much bet on this, that things started happening because I did not put so much concern or preoccupation into it anymore. I was, you know, I got nothing to lose anymore. I was not making much money. Let's be honest and do what you really want to do. I think the response to me was like, yeah, that was the... The response people gave me was, yeah, you were honest with us and we appreciate it and we're on board with you. Did you feel like at the time that that might have been the last thing you would do if it didn't really take off? You said you were not earning very much money. Was it kind of a last ditch? Yeah, but it's always a last ditch anyways, you know, I mean. If my way would have never picked up, I would have continued. What else could I do? This is what I do best, is make music. I would like to come back to graphic design at some point, to come back to visual art. And I'm actually in the process of going back to it, but it would be more as an illustrator, like to illustrate kids' books. This is one of the things I would like to do in the future. Have you been doing much illustration in that? I've been doing a lot, yeah. Many years ago, though. I've stopped for a long time. When the music started happening for me, I was not so much drawing anymore. And I would say that when my daughter was born, I started drawing some more. Because we would spend some time together sitting at the table. And she would be like, hey, why don't you draw me this? And yeah. Choose an inspiration to do that stuff again. Yeah. What is, you said, you know, early on that you were doing more collage type things visually. Is that changed over the years? When you come back to it, do you feel like you're starting in a different way? I'm always starting in a different way, but the basis is always there. Yes, I will always keep on doing collages. Because for me, I never wanted to limit myself to the tools and the things I've had around me. And I think... For sampling, for example, the sound bank is the world, is everything. So for picture, it's the same. You can go in magazines, you can take pictures, I mean you can go in any sources and find something really interesting. And it's interesting to do collages because you can really take matter or some sources and put them in another context and give them like a second life. another meaning yeah with the sound bank is the world I think it's an interesting idea it seems like of all the music I've heard you still very much sampling is always going to be that base of things But has the technology that you've been using otherwise to make music changed much over the years? Are you pretty set in your ways? of what software that you use. I've been using the same setup for 12 years. I mean, I respect people who are always looking for the new softwares and the new gadgets. I don't think I have the patience to learn something new. For me, I've never seen myself as a technician. I've seen myself as a creator. And for me, it's important to have... quick access and to be able to materialize my ideas very quickly. I need to be spontaneous. And with a lot of software, I cannot find my... I have a hard time being spontaneous. It's funny you say being spontaneous, though, because clearly you're a perfectionist as well. Yeah. So you have this spontaneity, but then... you have to look over it for years to make sure you got it just right. The first action is spontaneous. When I start doing something, when I start recording samples, and when I put them together, it's spontaneous. But then afterwards, yeah, for sure, there's a lot of... I call that almost like being a watchmaker. I have an uncle who is a watchmaker and I used to look at him when I was young and he was playing those tiny instruments with his big magnifying lens and I've always liked that. I love precision. I love mathematics and intuition combined together. This is why I like the work of Moritz Escher very much. But there is a messiness in a way, especially to my way, that feels very spontaneous. And I'm sure it's quite hard to figure out how to balance these two things, keeping that original feeling of just... feeling going out, but also this precision. Not so much. I would say because after fiddling for so many years, doing cut-up, you end up with a method of working that is your own, and you get shortcuts, and it goes really fast. It's like anything else. I'm sure a surgeon makes a surgery quicker after 10 years or 20 years. Pretty much the same, yeah. Does it feel too easy, though, to have a process like that? Does it feel like cheating almost? No, it doesn't. No, it's not that it's, well, yeah, of course it made things easier, but it leaves me more time to think about something else that I could add. Let's go back a little bit. The beginning of MUTEC, you mentioned it was building bridges, which I've also used that phrase when talking about MUTEC. I find it really interesting, certainly bringing over all of these European artists to the festival in the early years. meeting all these Canadian artists and building these connections between people and obviously releases coming out on European labels. Can you talk a little bit about the first couple festivals and some meeting people and these moments? It was magical, seriously. I don't want to be corny and use the word magical, but it was really magical. finally meet with those artists that we've been listening to for a couple of years on records and would come up to me or to other musicians, local musicians and start exchanging and being like "hey I like this record of yours" "oh yeah well you know this" and it just realized that it kind of like It kind of debunked that whole stardom idea that we have in mind that put artists on a pedestal. It's just like we were all there for the same reason, and we all realized that we were all struggling for the same reason, doing the same thing, but they were living abroad. Yeah, I remember someone saying, seeing Vladislav DeLay just walking down the street in Montreal, it's sort of like, okay, he's a person too, rather than this guy who's created these magical recordings. It was fantastic, and we made friends with most of these artists. That's the beauty of it. Not only we saw them at MUTAC, but they actually desired to come back the following years. And we stayed in touch, and they invited us over. And yeah, we fell on each other, definitely. One of the things about the festival, I also think it's a little bit different than other festivals, is the fact that... bring people in for four or five days rather than it just being a tour stop so that they're going to see other artists as well while they're here? Well, I think primarily I would say the first thing that makes MUTEC different from other festivals is the familiar side of it. When you play other festivals, you feel like you're just going there to play, cash, and leave. At MUTEC, the fact that the festival was built around the community, I think it was very important from the beginning that this festival was meant for the community, to promote the local artists. I think everyone in this community felt a responsibility, a duty, to be close to the festival and to take care of the guests, the people who were coming in. So when you come to Montreal, when you come to MUTEC, I mean, you can meet Alain, you can meet all the people who are... handling the festival. You can meet all the artists. I mean, most of us, we're all close to LA. It's a family. It is a family. After the first few years of the festival, there's a compilation on Force Inc., I think, called Montreal Smoked Meat. That's right. Which seemed, at least... To an American, it was sort of like there's something going on in Montreal kind of moment. And I think that's a lot down to the fact that there was a lot of distribution for 4SYNC in different places that might not normally get certain records at that time. But that was very special because that was the first time that 4SYNC was establishing an office out of Frankfurt. And at the time, John Barry, who was, I can say, scouting for Forcing, came to the first year for the first Mutech. And he... He started recruiting artists from here. And he was so pleased with what he heard here, he felt and he saw the potential that was in Montreal, that he decided to establish office here in Montreal on Saint Laurent Street. He stayed here for a few years, and I think that really helped. A lot, actually. Was he living downstairs from you at some point? Yeah. No, he was living upstairs, actually. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Same building. I helped him getting his first apartment. Yeah. Obviously the Forsync thing, the connection to sort of get those records out to Europe and to North America as well was a big thing. Was in your mind that sort of one of the bigger aspects of, you know, spreading the gospel, so to speak, of Mutec and Montreal? Yeah, I think it was all of that. It was Mutec and the artists. But yeah, I think everything was, I think we were ready here to have something like that. Was there something that, listening back to that compilation, everyone's kind of doing something. It's quite a bit different. Was there, in your mind, a Montreal sound around that time? It's been always difficult to define the Montreal sound because Montreal sound is all over the place. And I think this is the main particularity. I think this is the strength of the sound of Montreal. It's not a formatted and homogenized sound. You can sense in Montreal that the influences are coming from all over the place. We are an island. We're just located between Europe and the States. And so we've got influences from America as well as Europe. So I think that's what makes the sound of Montreal. scattered but I think it's what makes it so rich and so colorful also seems like France has or at least French culture has a very large impact on what you do yes and no I would say I mean I think the music we do is I don't think I see a French or an English influence in the music we make. I mean, if you listen to steel, I mean, also my friends are English, and we all do something which is kind of complementary or similar. I think it's the recycling, actually, I think, which is very... which was one of the trademarks of the Montreal sound. A lot of recoup from... various sound sources. Moving forward, obviously, after My Way, you know, there's a lot of success. You're touring quite a bit. At least from an outsider's perspective, it seemed like you pulled back at a certain point. You released a record under your own name, as well as quite different from what you had done in the past. Can you talk a little bit about the genesis of that record? You mean a Marc Leclerc record? Musique pour pas commencer? This record actually I started working on I would say around 2001. The reason why it took me so long to release it is because I really want... It was a record which was kind of complex in my mind because... It was a tribute to three women, three close friends of mine, who got pregnant at the same time. And being the only father in my surrounding at the time, it meant a lot. Our generation was finally spreading and projecting itself. in the future. So I really took the time and didn't want to rush things. I released two of the first pieces on a local label, Oral. which was handled by Erik Madsen, which still exists. That was the second release of the label, it was on a 12-inch. And later on, it took a little while, I put the project on the ice, because Akifan was taking a lot of space at the time. And so slowly I got back into the process. And when I felt the project was ready, I gave it to Mutech. And we released it. And I was quite pleased and surprised by the response of people. I was very scared when I released that record. When you've been releasing a record with a certain sound and people are used to it, you're almost afraid that when you're going to release something new that people will not be interested by it because the other stuff before was what they wanted to hear and they want to hear that over and over. So is that why you chose to release it under a different name, under your own name? Yeah, well, the fact that I used my real name is because it was closer to myself. Acufan, to me, Acufan, I've always seen Acufan as a big lab. It's a big playground. I just go there, I go in the sandbox and get messy, you know, and that's it. Mark LeClair was more like a tribute to all the artists that inspired me throughout my life, like Steve Reich. And what is Horror Inc., then, the name you'll be performing under at New Tech this year? The Horror Inc. alias? is as old as Akufen. It happened in 2000. I didn't release so much stuff under this moniker. because I wanted each piece to be special. Also, I was trying to define exactly what I wanted to do with this project. At the time, it was very much inspired from horror movies. And then the more in-depth I got into that project, the more it became like an introspection. And I realized that a lot of the melodies that were created, generated in that project came from dreams I had, came from very specific memories I had of my past. and then it became much more personal. And so, and the response also was very good. A lot of people who did not dig Akifen liked Horror Inc. So it's also a way of reaching another strata, another category of people. What sort of horror movies were an influence on the early? I've never been a fan of the... blood buckets and uh now i'm um i was well for me hitchcock is horror i would say this could be one of my one of my main influence in that project uh david lynch the coen brothers so just suspense rather than the actual gore no i'm not no i've never been to gore no I'm more about the... I call that the dead angle horror. You don't really know what's going on. You know something weird going on, but you don't know what exactly. It's kind of an unhealthy atmosphere, but it's kind of disturbing, but you never know where it's coming from. So what should we expect from the live show coming up? Is it something to dance to? Is it something to... Something to dance to. The pace is not very fast. There are some percussions, but it's... It's very cinematic, very moody, very melodic. The melodies are, it's kind of a crossover between jazz, classical. And how long have you been working on the live show? Is it something that's been in the works for a couple of years now? Yeah, well, I mean, the pieces, I had a few pieces ready, pieces that I've released previously on labels like Perlon and Haunt and Revolver, and there's some new stuff. I really don't know what to think. I think people will be the judge. With Acufin, is there anything on the horizon with that, or is that something you want to bury once and for all? I saw that question coming. Obviously, Akufen became sort of a burden for me for a while due to various reasons, personal and reasons related to my work. I'm extremely grateful to have had the chance to make a living from my music and to have such amazing people that I met and who told me that they enjoyed my music. After my way, I felt like everything revolved around a couple of pieces for a lot of people. And I knew I was capable of more, and I wanted to do more. And that's why the Akifan project remained on the ice for a long time, because I just didn't know what to do anymore with that project. I thought I really reached a climax with that. I just wanted out on a good note, on a high note. But then lately I went through my hard drives at home and I was like, yeah, I gotta release that. So it's gonna be a second Akifan album and it's gonna be probably the last one, but I will release it. And we can expect that. I mean, I owe it to people. Seriously, I owe it to people. I've promised it, and I don't like to have empty promises, so I'll release it. And we can expect that in 2015 or so? About that. No, next year. Next year. Excellent. Well, I wanted to open it up to any questions from the audience. Does anybody... You don't have to. Sorry, we didn't talk about this explicitly, but your philosophy of dancing, because dance music is what you primarily make. under these names. So how you feel about dancing in a sort of cultural sense, how you feel about it in your own body, how you manifest rhythms, how you think about the dancer as your audience when you're making tracks, and how that works. It's a very interesting question. I love to dance. I'm personally a dancer. I think the music I make, when I make it, I try to make it as if I was someone from the audience, from the outside. So I'm trying to put myself in somebody else's. position, you know, and see like, how would I react if I heard that on a dance floor? But I've always had a problem, a slight problem with the functionality of the dance floor. I think people have a problem being dropped. in uncertainty when there's no percussion anymore. And the crowd's always stressing you to bring back the percussions. In my mind, I don't want to bring it back. I just want to surprise them and just remove all references and at some point, you know, catch them again when they least expect it. It's, I don't know, it's like a bungee jumping or a... Yeah, I don't know. One of the things you said in the RA interview is that an ideal is to make... music without a kick drum basically that kind of can allow you to keep dancing. I've thought about that for many years actually. And I don't know. I mean, I don't know if DJ would play it without a kick. Would probably figure out to put another songs over, you know, to have the... but for sure I would love to do a danceable record with at least no kick drums and the sounds, only the sounds that would be used would create the groove of the music instead of having... for me it's like being in a box. Sometimes it's nice to just break out of the box and just float. It's interesting to hear you talk about art, politics. You have a lot of knowledge, deep knowledge in the arts locally, internationally. and not only in music, art history. And you were saying you admire Riopelle for his tenacity, his art and everything, but also for his political co-signature and everything. You, as an artist, would you like to get more involved on the politics side? Can you talk a little bit about that? I would definitely love to get more involved. Maybe not in the music itself, but more in the structure of the community, definitely. My music is apolitical, I would say. but there's definitely a social context in which the artists are right now and I think I would love to get together with not only musicians, this is something I find very hard in our times is that all different spheres are separated. painters are on one side, musicians are on one side, dancers. I'd like at some point that everybody gets together and we put something, like a manifesto. I would love to do that. But not only coming from me, but coming from a lot of our other artists. I don't think I have the answer, I think. It's a community thing. I heard you before saying you would like to do music for cinema. You would like to do visual arts again. How about doing music for choreographers, contemporary dance? I did in the past, actually. I did music for choreographers a few years ago. But it was not my... That was not my place. Choreographers are people who very much know what they want. And I didn't feel... complete freedom. Hey, I was wondering if you do improv online with other artists around the world and what your experience has been with that lately. We did Nero Niki here a few years ago at Mutech. That was my only collaboration with an improv group. Was it geographically networked? No, we did it in Montreal, actually. We didn't do it via the web. We did it locally here at Musée Josporé. You said earlier that you want to collaborate a little bit more. Do you find yourself finally softening up that you've done the solo thing for long enough that you're like, okay, now I'm ready to let people back in, so to speak? No, there are things in the air. I definitely talk more with artists these days, and I'm really willing to try. It would be an achievement to be capable of doing that. The problem with me is, and I... I admit it in all humility, I'm a control freak. There's nothing I can do about it. And it's been really hard fighting this. I know exactly in my mind what I want, and to have someone coming in the process and adding something, it makes me twitch. I'm like, ugh. It'll happen. I would love it to happen. It'd be a lifetime achievement. Yeah, seriously. You've talked earlier about using for 12 years the same gear. What is exactly this gear? I'm sorry? The gear you're using. Oh, yeah, yeah. I don't know if I want to talk about that. You know what? I can talk about it with you if you want, but it's just that I've always favored... people, personal initiative, to find their own method of working. I think this is very important. What is good for me is not necessarily good for everyone. So, I don't know. I've been always a bit reluctant to that. I don't mind sharing it. It's not a matter, I don't want people to know how I do things. Just that, me personally, the reason why I appreciate an artist is because I don't understand the way he made his music. Artists, I've always said it, speak with their own language, speak with their own encodes. And when I cannot decode their music, this is fantastic, this is magical. I have to abandon myself when I listen to music. And a way for me to find abandon is to not be able to recognize what's been done, how it's been done. Are there certain artists that are making... music right now in the electronic music sphere that are making things that are hard for you to decode that you're really enjoying i mean atom heart uve schmidt has been always the artist that left me clueless i've studied his music inside out i mean seriously uh he's probably to me the best electronic artist, the most interesting, I would say, because he does not impose himself any boundaries. He's really doing what he wants the way he wants it. And yeah, it leaves me completely clueless. I read a pretty disturbing article from Marco Carolla, who was stating that he... didn't find there was any new generation artists that were actually contributing to the electronic music scene. So what do you think about this kind of statement? That's his problem. Yeah, but... And in terms of that, do you have any new electronic generation artists that you're interested in or that you've heard? I listen to a lot of interesting music. The only issue is the fact that we don't have much record shop left in Montreal who carry those records. So I hear a lot of stuff, a lot of demos I receive. But it's hard to follow. It's really hard to follow these days. Because I'm not much going online. Personally, I don't favor shopping online. I've never done it. I was very much aware a few years ago. Now it's very difficult to follow. But definitely I would love to see a record shop in Montreal open. again. Even if it's not for selling records, it would be a meeting point where we could have a computer station where we could go online and listen to music and buy it in the shop. It was the act of going in a place, gathering together with friends. I remember when my friend Vince had his shop in Montreal, we would go every Friday evening. lock the door and buy some beer and listen to music all night, you know. There was something fantastic about that. And we don't have this kind of like place where we can all get together, you know, and listen to music and discover things together like, oh, I heard this, listen to this or listen to that. It's been very hard in Montreal, I think, to not have a record shop. We have a few, but they cannot order so many records anymore. They have to compromise. Any more questions? Well, thank you, Mark, very much. My pleasure.
