Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Ryan Keeling and I am the editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Terry Francis, whose career can almost be summarized in a few words. Wiggle, Fabric and Tech House. Wiggle is a London-based party that Francis runs with Nathan Coles and Eddie Richards, a party that recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. at its 23rd birthday. Fabric is the world-famous London club where Francis has been a resident DJ for the past 18 years, and Tech House is the sound that Francis played a key role in developing back in the mid to late 90s. The genre tends to mean something very different these days, but... Back when it was simply a hybrid sound emerging out of London, Francis and the Wiggle DJs were key purveyors of this sound. Francis gave me the lowdown on each of these facets of his career when he stopped by our London offices earlier this summer. You can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and also catch them on SoundCloud at r8-exchange. The exchange with Terry Francis is up next. you Okay, so there's a super simple biography on your Discogs page. I was going to use parts of it to try and tell... the story of your early life. Okay, yeah. Your early career. So it begins with the line, English DJ and producer. True. True, yeah. Born in Epsom. True. True. And birthday 28th of the 7th, 66. We could leave the 66 bit out, couldn't we? I realised the other day as we were talking to my mate and next year I've been DJing in clubs for 30 years. 30 years? Yeah, it's quite a long time, isn't it? Just have a party. So it was Epsom I know through horse racing. Yeah, yeah, Epsom's horse racing. That's just where the hospital is. I live in a place called Leatherhead, which is famous for traffic jams on the N25 on the radio reports. Junction 9, Leather really oh really yeah that's about it really so what sort of place was it to grow up it was a lovely lovely place to grow up you know proper kid stuff climbing trees and running around and coming in when it got dark and then you get to about 17 and it's just so shit boring and you just you know there's not much to do for that age group and just sort of wanting to start going up London going out you know clubbing to Dingwalls and different things for Kiss FM we were putting on when there was a pirate radio station so there was certainly no nightclubs or pockets of guys music activity we had a few I mean I started doing a night in a place called Hamilton's and it became really popular it was like a a wine barn had a basement it was like a you just get a mixture of rockers in there and you know by a bit of smoke in there when you're a kid, you know, and that sort of, that one of them sort of places. It was a, but it got really popular and it was accused to get in and, in the basement, it was, that's where I got my first gig from, on the coast, basically. Oh, sorry, this was in Worthing? This is in, this is in Leverhead in a place called Hamilton's and someone heard me and asked me to come to Worthing to play Ah, okay, okay. So you never know who's listening, do you? Do they really, I suppose? Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, I'm trying to link this back to the line. So the actual line says, in 1990, he became a resident... at Stearns in Worthing is that accurate? Yeah that is accurate might have been a little bit before that might have been 89 I'm not sure but yeah great club classic old sort of everyone played there you know from the early sort of Slip Matt and sort of the hardcore guys Pig Bag and Dr. Desh Gashay that was around them too there's loads of old DJs that played there Mr. C and Eddie Richards Eddie Richards heard me play there he asked me to be on his agency and that's when I started getting more work basically okay that was the connection so just to clarify for the people who haven't heard of Worthing it's a pretty small town right on the south coast yeah it's a pretty sort of older crowd I'd say And I think the place now is like a tea rooms on top of the hill. But I mean, it was a guy called Mensa and it's called Interdance. It was a crazy, crazy night. It was a big underground sort of dugout venue underground, you know, big old disco, you know. And then it turned into a rave club with lots of floral. beetle a beetle cutting half of the decks inside and that sort of stuff quite sort of crazy sort of set up and quite colourful place so what did you kind of learn there was that really in your sort of developmental stage would you say yeah still learning I suppose you know I still I had no intention of being a DJ, really. I was a roofer by trade, and I've always bought music as I grew up. And I had some decks, and then someone asked me to play in this wine bar, you know, because I had some decks. Probably the only person in the leatherhead to have decks at that time. And a little sound system, nothing great. Yeah, that's why I just started doing it, and then it just went from there. I had no intentions. going to Worthing to be a resident or this sort of happened and all about the sign of recession kicked in and started losing the work was thin on the ground so it just took over from roofing really and so that was around like early 90s yeah late 80s early 90s yeah okay so you actually um went into roofing as a profession that that was like it wasn't just some something you fell into it was just how I fell into as well my dad got me a job before I left school and I just started doing roofing. But I'm quite pleased I got into DJing because roofing was a bit of a rough job really. So you were quickly able to make money off it then? With DJing? With the DJing, yeah. Yeah, I mean, obviously when you're younger you don't need so much really and then there was a lot of parties at the weekend going on that were outside and free. I wasn't going to clubs in London, we were just doing parties outside in the woods and stuff and so you didn't need loads of money. I just spent all my money on records. Was it pretty easy to get away with back then? Yeah, it had its moments but then I suppose it got too don't really care unless you get a complaint and they was doing a lot of dues on the Ministry of Defence land so it was out of their jurisdiction so they had to go get a court order which you couldn't get until the Monday by that time you've had the party so then they changed all the law repetitive beat law and whatever Did you wind up going to any of the iconic ones the sort of bigger parties? Yeah, a sunrise, energy, biology. Yeah, then I got more into the sort of little love parties that Mr. C was doing at the time. I think it was groove pressure. I think it was groove pressure they used to do. I'm not sure it was. And then they went on to the end, you know, and whatever's happened at the end. Sort of precursors. Yeah, yeah. I mean, they'd been doing parties for years, the Tink Street parties and stuff. probably the first people in London to start doing them really out of thought. So in your view, were all these big outdoor events that people like to sort of mythologise, were they as good as people make out? They were fantastic. Breaking the law. Breaking the law outside. Everything was new. The music was new. The actual... concept of going outside dancing was new to everyone it was just fresh and exciting you know you've been a bit naughty by doing it and all that to the buzz you know yeah yeah sure who were you into back then I mean Eddie Richards has always been my favourite DJ evil Eddie Richards even though he's not evil at all he's a real lovely man smiling yeah I know he's I think he's I think it's at the Camden Palais when he's doing it with Colin Fave it's a Halloween thing here's Eve Lady Richards and it's ghoulish Colin Fave or something and they're just stuck he's one stuck and it does suit him and that we always laughed he's got a pet bat he brings with him you know slides around the room Right, I've got another line from this biography for you. It says he also used to work in Swag Records. That's right. Yes, that's true. Whoever wrote this is very telling the truth. It's a Croydon shop. It's a Croydon shop. Yeah, it's got history, that shop. It used to be my price before where Colin Dow and Carl Cox worked in there and Luke Slater all worked there. So I used to buy my records off. And then I was like going to Vinyl Zone in Fulham, which is Jazzy M's record label. But yeah, it turned into swag. I was there for nine years. It was a bit of a reputation for sort of selling on the ground. Tech House music, I suppose, but it wasn't called Tech House, and it was just house and techno mixed together. Yeah, yeah, sure, yeah. So would you have kind of famous DJs at the time coming into Squag? Yeah, I mean, Mr C, we had Nigel Benn, who started DJing, used to come in there, just park his massive car outside and get a tick on it, didn't really seem to give a shit, and just drove off. And he was a really nice guy, Yeah, we had a lot of the underground DJs. Dave Mothersole worked there as well, Richard Gray. But, I mean, those old school names, you know. Are you still kind of a record shop guy these days? Do you get to go much? No, not really. I download my music and get a bit sent to me. And, you know, because I travel, I use WAV. You know, I just take WAV and a USB stick now because I just find it easier to just travel with and getting in countries and stuff, you know, without any hassle. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. I mean, it makes a lot of sense. Yeah. All right, I've got another line for you. It says, promoter and resident DJ of Groove Kitchen. and Wiggle in the mid-90s. Also resident DJ for Freaky Disco. So I guess loads of people will be aware of Wiggle, but maybe not Groove Kitchen and Freaky Disco. Groove Kitchen was a thing by a guy who ran Groove Pressure Records. I mean, it wasn't a long-lasting affair, really, you know, so just a couple. of parties really so it wasn't really a residency house but but uh what's robin ball who used to run groove pressure i've done a couple of tracks on and stuff and um what was your one uh freaky disco freaky disco that was uh the cross Oh, okay. So that would have been sort of middle of the 90s? Yeah, getting a little bit more that way, yeah. So we're probably getting on to mid-90s now and I'm starting to get my first grey hairs through being up too late at the weekends. So Freaky Disco, is that title indicative of what was going on there? Yeah, it was a freaky name and it was just, yeah, it was good music, you know, just a... I think it was Kenny Hawks and them sort of people, you know, and Luke Solomon. I think them guys were there. But there were some good DJs. I think Craig Richards played there a couple of times as well. Okay. For the same guys. So was the Cross kind of a notable venue by that stage? It was a bit cheesy at first. Okay. We had the more commercial end of things going on there. But then... Well, it was a mix, really, I suppose, you know. It was a mix of things going on, but it had a more commercial side of it and it had some good parties going on. I mean, it's hard to remember the name of the parties these days, you know. I don't blame you. So to bring Wiggle into the conversation, you had an event a few months back in Brighton that celebrated the party's 23rd anniversary. And it's obviously, I mean, it's extraordinary. Probably older than a lot of people that go, you know? Yeah, yeah, fair point. It was a real good older crowd and a lot of people come out to Woburg and a real good crowd. It was there to have a good time and dance and it was just really nice to see and it was a really good turnout. Did you get some young faces as well? Yeah, I mean, you get some, probably dead people's sons and daughters. but it's still going strong you know people make a lot of whooping noises and you know just silly dancing going on and just fun you know people go for the right attitude and don't take it too seriously but it's serious music you know it's good music so do you think that's always been the case this sort of idea of not taking it quite yeah I mean the music's always been serious but music's been fun isn't it some people I think you know trying to be cool ain't cool is it you know trying to be cool time because you're too busy trying to be cool you know i mean and um but should that say um it's a difficult thing you have to fight against in london yeah well yeah that moodiness really i suppose moodiness can be a thing in london where you go to go outside london people sort of seem to be a little bit more relaxed and that you know but i'm just wondering what what is it that's kept you and eddie and nathan together all these years like what how would you explain it it's of me and he's going to show me if I don't stay friends with him. Oh, it's the dirt, is it? No, no, we're just good mates. Nathan's in Ibiza now, and that's why we haven't done so many parties, really, because Nathan's in Ibiza, and it's just, you know, he's organising things and finding venues, and Nathan was our venue finder. And we're all busy, you know, and Eddie's travelling a lot, and I think after 23 years, you can't do it once a month still, you know, just make it a special occasion, because a lot of the people who used to go don't come anymore pool. with us really. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you were going monthly for a long time. Yeah, a long, long time. Yeah, we used to make all our own decorations. Every time I had different, every, every, every party had different decorations. We'd go and buy polystyrene sort of wig sort of holders, you know, them hanging from the ceiling and paint them up. And it's, I used to really enjoy, you know, get a bit of arts and crafts in it. Yeah, yeah, small touches isn't it yeah yeah um i mean do any of the parties like really stick out in your mind being like, okay, yeah, we really nailed it on that one? There was a few, you know. It's hard to remember the good ones, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, sure. I mean, 23 years worth of parties, they do sort of mingle into each other, but we've had some fantastic times. I didn't have a very good start. The first party we was ever going to do was in, this guy was going to get us this... penthouse mansion right been over some wolf in right right near the thames and um we didn't realize that the the london marathon was on that and we couldn't get to the party to put the system in because it's all blocked off the roads were all blocked off so we had to find a venue within two hours to do a party and i managed to find this um old lock-up thing in camden just wiltson cars out it was like a like a garage we were some cars out and done a party on the greasy floor and just spontaneously which has turned out alright you know back then it was you didn't put your best trainers on to go out you know you went out and had to dance and get your trainers dirty yeah I'm just trying to imagine doing that these days yeah now I see everyone to their own I see some people going out like they're going out for dinner with their parents they've got high heels and like you know sort of shirts on and are you going to dance all night in them things or what more of you than me you know what I mean So it's obviously going to be really tough to do a career retrospective with you without mentioning the term tech house, of course. But I guess first I was wondering if it feels like an accurate summary of what you and Wiggle have been doing over the years. Tech house was more of a sort of a mentality and a state of mind, you know, an attitude towards partying, really, rather than an actual genre of music. And then it suddenly become that because... I suppose magazines need something to sell and, you know, the new name and whatever, you know, Tech House, Deep House, Minimal House, you know, whatever. Basically, it was just what I can remember. Everyone has their own little story on it. In swag, people were coming in, what is house music with techno influence. or acidy and I mean then there was breakbeats playing breakbeats as well not cheesy breakbeats just quite deep breakbeats and it just turned into it's easier to say have you got any tech house you know it just sort of come from there that's all I remember so yeah so you would go as far as to say that the tone was coined in swag well I don't know you know some people say they've done a mixed tape called tech house years ago for that but whatever yeah of course whatever you know You know, someone wants to claim something or other. You know, it's, you know, I don't know. It's hard to remember, really, but that's where it came from for me. But it was all house music to me then. But it was, you know, sort of rhythm is rhythm, you know, that sort of stuff, a bit more techie stuff as well. Yeah, yeah, I understand. Abe Duke was really into it. A bit of harder stuff as well, you know. So it as well you know and so there's um yeah it was just a good music really it wasn't really a policy it just might play good music you know i mean would you describe what was going on in the sort of mid to late 90s in london actually as a scene or was it just kind of a you know a few groups of like-minded people who were you know maybe pushing in a similar direction it went a bit a little bit flat for a little while and then there was a party starting up called Heart and Soul that was part of my sort of evolution of what happened in my world. And then Wiggle come off the back of that and so did Kerfuffle, Whoop Whoop. There's loads of little parties come off the, you know, this good little on the ground scene in weird little... Weird little venues, you know, outside in mansions and whatever, you know, and all sorts of different venues. And it was really good times, really, you know what I mean? And then she went back more into clubs, I suppose. It was harder to get venues and it just changes all the time, doesn't it, really? Yeah, of course. There was actually a pretty interesting list that you'd put together for Dummy Mag. They'd called it the 10 best tracks that gave birth to the London tech house sound So you had things like LFO vs Fuse, there was like Harry Chantler, Virgo, Suburban Knight in there. I was wondering what the shared qualities of the tracks that you picked, would you say? Is there anything that binds them together? I think they've either got a bit of funk or they've got a bit of soul to them, even if they're heavy or even if they're deep or whatever, they've still got a bit of funk or soul to them. They've got a feeling to them and they're not just banging nosebleed music. They've still got a bit of feeling to it, I think. Yeah, I mean, would you say your taste was sort of responding to things that were going on elsewhere in dance music at the time? You know how these things come about? Sometimes it's a response to something. Everything feeds off each other, doesn't it? And you sort of enhance it into your set, what you like, that part of the elements of it, you know? And also an extension of I'm an old soul boy and I like funk and I like soul and disc boogie. I've got the Dingwalls, you know, listening to Norman Jay and that sort of thing. Paul Trouble Anderson. So there's a lot of Boogie I was listening to. Lonely Listen to Smith and that sort of stuff. Expansion. Yeah, sure, sure. So it's sort of an extension of that as well. Just like an evolution of that, you know, but with a big kick drum behind it. And a hi-hat. I was thinking about when I was preparing for this, I was thinking about the sets of scene of yours over the years. And I don't know if you'd agree that there's any truth in this, but I always felt like one of your signatures, and maybe this is something Nathan does as well, but having a tendency to pitch up records quite a lot. In the mid-90s, we were playing pretty fast, up to 130 or something. But things have slowed down a little bit again now, which maybe it's just I What was the mix you put out in like 97? I'm forgetting the name of it now. Architecture. Architecture, yes. So I did a BPM on that. That was too fast. I did a BPM on it earlier. It was like 138 or 9 or something. Yeah, a bit of it, yeah. It's too fast, actually. I don't know what happened there. Something went a bit wrong. I'm sure I recorded it slow at that and it just, somehow it just got, it was all but it is fast I mean I pitch it down if I play it you know if you pitch it down it sounds great oh really really that's interesting speed tech house i mean it's um it's pretty interesting when we're thinking about um the way the term's headed uh you know thinking about the modern sort of not interpretation of it but how you know people perceiving it so you've got this like abitha thing and people associate tech house with these huge clubs in abitha and then at the same time you've got these groups of like producers and labels in Germany and Romania and places like this who are like kind of picking up on the things that you guys were doing back in the sort of mid and late 90s yeah I got a message on Facebook from a girl who works in a record shop in Germany and she just found an old track that I'd done and took from her and they're seeing that old stuff from the sort of late 90s and It seems to be coming around again, you know, sort of maybe like rare groove or something, you know. No, no, I mean, I've definitely been noticing swing, you know, and people who are making music, you know, there's certainly blending elements. together but they're very much being seen as like people are on the kind of cutting edge of who were doing this you know house thing you know this definitely seems to be an influence i mean have you sort of noticed a renewed interest in your early stuff yeah definitely yeah um i've got i've got a gig to do in Pickle Factory which he wanted me to play a 90s set you know oh really with Pure Science who was who was he still is around but he'd done some amazing tracks back then and stuff and still is but he's got an album out I think Give me a little plug. And yeah, obviously off the back of this, you put out your first album. Well, yeah, it's a couple of months ago now, but you, so there was some tracks from the early 2000s on, there was Hallucination Limited and there was some other unreleased bits. Yeah. Just really wondering what made you decide to go for it after. Well, I was sitting on them tracks anyway, and it's quite a good story. actually. There was a girl that was working in a pub next door to me in Leatherhead, sunny Leatherhead. she was going up with this guy called Ricardo and he was a singer and she would work behind the bar and they'd go off and do like cruise ships and that sort of stuff, you know, sort of George Benson sort of style and stuff and she was a dancer and they was together and just talking to her, we agreed for them to come around to have some dinner because my ex-wife got on really well with her and Ricardo's really nice and we just appeared upstairs and done. track in one night and he is a bloody good singer man really good singer and he turned out actually being Eddie Freddie Mercury in We Will Rock You in the West End production you know the musical so he obviously had a good voice you know what I mean he's very wide range and I saw him on The Voice once as well I just can't remember And I've lost contact with him. I just got his number recently. I got a call because he knows about them coming out, but we've obviously got to catch up, obviously. But he's a cool guy. I'm not a greedy person, so we come to an arrangement. You know what I mean? dead tracks really they was out you know done on a long time ago but they still sound really right and bless Chris he was really into them and he's been sitting on them for ages always wanted to put them out and had this idea of doing some old and new stuff together and yeah put them out good for him and he's had a lot of attention off it really especially his vocals you know and he's got in it gets can get more airplay I suppose with a vocal in it can't you know rather than just a track you know it's a bit more accessible you know so do you still play any of them? every now and again I might do but I don't like playing my own tracks I was going to ask you that actually that was probably a better first question maybe I don't like I don't want disappointment or something I'd rather listen to someone else play them than me, really. And plus, these old tracks, they're cool again, but when you've made a track, you've heard it so many times, you're pretty sick of it anyway yourself. So you go back to it a couple of months, you can play it again. So you mentioned before we started recording that you've been working on some new stuff and there was a vocalist involved, you said? Yeah, Sam, Blonde Bearing Black. she done a track it was quite a big track with Mr. G erm called Precious Cargo last year. It's come out on Definitive, and I love the track. I think it's a beautiful track. And I was just playing it in the Zoo Project in Ibiza, and she'd come up and said, I sung this track, and I didn't really hear her properly. And I was like, well, obviously she likes it or something. I thought she was saying, you know, because the music was loud. And then it came out, and I was like, really? You you know and so yeah just stayed in touch with her we decided to do a track Hold The Free it's called it's like a it's not an obvious message but it's about Fabric chatting and coming back open again with her writing the vocals called yeah North End Project So when you were saying about the vocals, it's more of a kind of coded symbolism sort of thing? I suppose I think I could sort of Related to is a bit sort of murk sounding, you know, a bit sort of Ralph Falcon, Liberty City sort of vibe to it. Big sort of grindy bass line, a bit distorted. Well, yeah, I mean, I let people see what they think. So rather than bigging it up too much, I like it. You know what I mean? That's the main thing. Yeah. All right. So we should definitely talk about Fabric. But before that, I wanted to actually read out something you said to the Sun newspaper of all publications. This is at the end of last year. So you said, I think that my recent 50th birthday summed up what Fabric is really about to me. Hannah, who turned 18 last year, now comes regularly with me to see me. Sorry, to see me play. and is now part of the regular crowd at the club. So you're referring there to your daughter. Yeah. Yeah, has she been sort of interested in what you do for a while? Yeah, I mean, they went through their stage when they were sort of, liked their pop music and stuff, but I had them sort of liking... Roy Ayres, everybody loves the sunshine when they were kids just because it had birds and bees and honey and sunshine words in it and they liked it, I suppose. I got actually Hannah to say when she was two, the Spice Girls are rubbish, put them in the bin. And she got a hold of that really quickly. It was just good. But no, they are interesting. She comes along, she goes to a bit of drama-based stuff. The youngest one's going to come out. She was gutted because she was 18 a week before Fabric's shot by the authorities. And then they made it over 19, didn't they? So she had to wait another year. So she was, yeah, wasn't very happy, really, about that. Have either of them potentially got a career in dance music ahead of them? I don't think so. I don't think so. Rosie Singh, she's a grade seven singer. She got exams for singing. So we're trying to hook up to do that over the years. It just hasn't worked out so far, but there's always time, you know. We're only young. I mean, but were you kind of saying with this, quote that there's a almost like an intergenerational thing that's at play at Fabric it's obviously been open for a long time now and I think as well what I was trying to say is like kids have grown up with house music and they know house music and I think house music come back around again a little bit because the generation of the kids coming again were the people that first started going out this sort of like-mindedness, I suppose, and they've grown up with listening to this music, so they know that music, so I think it's sort of got really another bit of energy behind it again, you know, because the kids can relate to it and stuff, and you need fresh people, don't you? Yeah, I was going to ask you, actually, how do you think Fagbrits have been able to... renew itself over the years? I think because they've sort of always been sort of leaders, not followers really. And now that's hard because there's more and more competition and more and more people doing that tip of music, you know, so there's a bit more competition these days, which is healthy, you know, it's all cool. But it's tough in club land at the moment, you know, a lot of clubs are having a hard time. time which is because the general atmosphere with the bomb threats and stuff and the terrorism but I don't think it's just that it's a bad time in this time of year anyway you know with people on holiday and exams and there's pounds strong isn't it people want to come into the country and whatever so I think it's just a real mixture at the moment it's making it's making quite tough in London I think for clubs Yeah, I did want to get your thoughts generally on where things are at. Maybe just to first ask you, what's the mood been like at the club over the last few months? I mean, it was obviously not so long ago that you had this very, very tumultuous period. Well, I mean, they've cut back the capacity, which is... more security, so there's expenses going up and not as many people coming in. So, you know, they're not having an easy ride of it at the moment either. But I think the actual atmosphere-wise of it is great. I think it's not very good for your financial situation, but the atmosphere is better because there's more room to actual dance and stuff, I find. I find the atmosphere has been great in there, you know. Especially like last Saturday when all it kicked off in London Bridge. Yeah, of course. Obviously, there was not many people there, which there wasn't many people anywhere in London, I think, you know. But since Easter, it's been a bit quiet. And since the Manchester thing, you know, and I suppose, you know, I remember the Brixton riots and my parents not wanting me to go to Brixton, you know. Yeah, sure. And then I suppose, you know, I've got the people that come and... they're 19 and leave their parents and they sort of say I'm going to go to London tonight oh no we don't want you to go to London you know it probably makes a lot of difference for people going to London you know I mean did you have any personal takeaways from the whole fabric closure saga you know if you ended up feeling a certain way about the state of things I think the whole thing was a bit of a knee jerk reaction in the first place I think it's people power, eh? You know, it's got it back open, really, down to people making a fuss about it and donating some money so we could fight it, basically. So, I mean, it's amazing, you know what I mean, all that response from it. And it's really nice to know that people power works sometimes, really. But I think everyone's learned a bit from it. You know, it's control yourself a bit. And it's cutbacks as well, man. That's a big thing at the moment with cutbacks. I got in a taxi the other day and I was with this embankment noise officer and he had been laid off because of the cutting back. So they haven't got the people to come around to sort of test if you're too loud. So they'd rather you just not there. You know what I mean? They just The whole system's struggling at the moment, I think. And I think if the club's not there, it's easier for them just to police things, you know? Yeah, you see. Driving down numbers. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think it's just a mix of things, really. I think they wanted to try and push that area up a bit. When we first went, it was an industrial hub, you know. It was just nothing there at all. Now you've got sort of £3 million penthouse, got things on top of roofs. It very much feels like part of the city, doesn't it? Yeah, yeah. Obviously, people, you know, they don't want people peeing up their door in the morning, do they? You know what I mean? Which is fair enough, you know what I mean? I wouldn't lie like that very much either. But, I mean... I think people are all right. You get the odd idiots around, you know, everywhere, don't you? Yeah, I suppose it's inherently a messy endeavour, isn't it? Yeah. Opening a nightclub. Well, you go out to drink and, you know, have a good time and get excited, don't you? So you're going to stay that way when you leave, I suppose. Chatting and you don't realise how loud you're being when you're... It's the smoking ban as well. It 200 people chattering and having a fag, it makes a lot of noise, you know. And it's the same with pubs. I know pubs get a lot of complaints because of that, not because of the actual pub, it's just because people are outside chatting in the summer, you know, and it carries, you know, and people just seem to want to moan these days, don't they? You move next door to somewhere and moan about it, you know. It's probably why it was cheap in the It's just like, I just don't get that. You want to move into the trendy area. Yeah, yeah. And then worry about, and then moan about the trendies. It's, you know, you get a 200-year-old pub and someone moves next door to it and they moan about it. You know, and there's one person's enjoyment. It's upsetting 30 people's enjoyment. You know, it doesn't make sense, does it? That's sort of disproportionate. Yeah. Don't question to finish on with you uh you've been playing at fabric for 17 years now 18 this year 18 this year yeah in october isn't it middle of october sometime yeah i was going to ask you to summarize your 18 years summarize your experience for us tricky you know it's tricky like again remembering individual nights it's just been great you know it's been a pleasure to be able to play music i like in a club and for 18 years and I think it's definitely been a strong influence to the scene over the years and London scene, even the world, you know, and sort of led the way a bit, you know, for many years. You know, now it's still in the way. It's still up there, but there's more people to compete with. It's been amazing.
