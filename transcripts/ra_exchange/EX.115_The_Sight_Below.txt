you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Todd L. Burns, and I'm the editor-in-chief of Resident Advisor. Rafael Anton Irasari records what I guess you could call ambient shoegaze under the name The Sight Below. Those two genres have dominated his listening since his teenage years. and somehow find a perfect union on his evocatively titled albums Glider and It All Falls Apart. In addition to his work as an artist, Irizarry is also a curator. He recently began a festival called Substrata. an event which brings artists like Biosphere to play intimate shows and lead outings among festival goers to learn how to properly make field recordings. He also offers similar expertise with booking for Decibel, the Seattle festival where we recently hosted a few RA live exchanges. What follows is our conversation at Decibel 2012. It seems like you've had quite a relationship with Decibel over the years, a very intimate one. How long have you been involved with it, actually, even outside just playing here? Or was that the first time you got involved? No, I mean, I've known Sean Horton, who's the founder of the festival for... close to eight years and first time I planned in Seattle was because Sean booked me here 2005 so and I've been involved with the festival since 2006 in some capacity either doing curatorial work or doing something you know so. What a curatorial work? What does that mean in the non-abstract sense? What have you been doing? Well, in the non-abstract sense, it just mostly involved me and Sean just sitting around, kicking it, listening to music and thinking what would be cool to have, you know? I mean, at least several years ago, that was the case, you know, as the festival grew and became more established and, you know. I guess more professional in that sense, you know, then things evolve and we start to work with a lot of agents and, you know, it just became more, I guess, professional would be a good word. I mean, Decibel Star is a really small grassroots thing, you know. And it has definitely evolved. It's the ninth edition, so it's a testament of that. I assume he brought you on for the experimental side. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. But also, back when I was... really involved with it because at one point I was really running things with Sean for like maybe three or four years and I was also really involved with the techno scene as you know so I mean I did bring a lot of techno people as well you know Echo Space for example or obviously things that tend to relate in some shape or form to you know, my own music in a way, but not necessarily. So was there one particular artist that, you know, you brought out for the first time? It felt like a real, uh, you know, wow, this is a moment. I never thought I'd get to see X in Seattle. Oh, yeah, man. Like, maybe five or six years ago, we had Robin Guthrie and Harold Budd. And I'm obviously a really huge Harold Budd fan. I just did a compilation with Martin Jules where we... of paid tribute to him and I got a chance to meet him in 2007 or 2006 I can't remember right now but it was really wonderful you know and the show was incredible and and that was quite quite nice you know to be able to and I've remained in contact with Harold you know ever since and It's quite neat to have those connections, you know, and obviously Decibel made that possible. Tell me about the first time you got in touch with Harold's music, because obviously he's a little bit more obscure than the usual Brian Eno types. Was it hard to get a hold of that music when you were... growing up? No, I had older friends so you know I was lucky enough I remember somebody when I was maybe I don't know like 16 or 17 or something like that like him I mean I'm old so but anyway somebody played me some I believe it was actually one of the Brian Eno Harold Budd collabs may have been like Patil Mirror or The Peril or something like that and I was just like blown away because I thought wow this is just absolutely incredible and you know I kept listening to his music ever since and you know his solo works and more I guess classical oriented works as well because a lot of his early really early work like his first release on EG Editions had that more classical approach to it and even some, I guess, Middle Eastern-ish kind of influence to it. So it was quite an interesting combination. After all those years and you finally meet this person and you have this kind of idea of how this person might be or you have a false... What was your idea? Well, you have this false perception. Perhaps you will think of this person like, oh, he must be really very quiet. gentlemen or whatever and you know sometimes with some artists you meet them in person and you know the perception that you might have because of the music it's completely different right I mean we were just talking about B.B. Dubb you know who makes really beautiful quiet music and you know he's a quite energetic you know fella so but when I met Harold he was just exactly like his music I mean he didn't really talk too much and every time he said something that was really important, and just a phrase or something, it was like, oh, okay. Kind of like that person that sits at a table and doesn't really say anything at all throughout an entire conversation, and then he opens his mouth and it's just like, whoa. Like, incredible. What was it about his music? You said that you did a compilation tribute to his music. You curated it. What was it specifically about his music that you felt like, this is a guy who needs to have a tribute done to his music? I think, for the most part, he's been criminally underrated. you know, throughout the years. Like, it almost feels like, you know, this great body of work is just there, but it's one of those things that very few people really know about it. So that's one. And second, at least personally for me. I was quite surprised to talk to other artists, you know, and be talking about, you know, things that we liked or whatever. And a lot of people mentioned his name, you know, and that was quite interesting because if you listen to some of the recordings that he did in the 70s, you know, and you listen to some of the stuff that happened. today within the modern classical genre of music. I mean, it was incredible. I mean, the guy was doing this like, you know, 30-something years ago, and when you can play one of his pieces right next to anything, you know, being done today, and it still stands the test of time. And, you know, personally, I think that I will... like to think that somebody will listen to something I did many years from now and still think, oh, OK, this sounds OK to my ears still. I have this theory that, personally, I'm not really interested in music that provides instant gratification. How do you know, though, immediately that-- you're going to have to listen to it 20 times and you're going to eventually get something out of it. Because this is exactly how some music that I really adore, like this is exactly how I came to that realization after listening to it several times, you know. I guess that Harold Butt would be a bad example because I absolutely like his music. The moment I heard it, I thought it was fantastic. But other things, like, you know, they've been an acquired taste, you know, like when you have a really good bottle of wine or something. And I think, like, nowadays we have. you know, instant access to anything that we want. We just think about it, Google it, and it's there within like, what, five minutes or something like that, you know? To me, we can acquire a lot of data or files or whatever you want to call it, but we don't really spend the time with it. We don't really listen to things and let them sit and let them grow on you. Back in the 90s, which is most when I did my, again, dating myself here. writing most of my, you know, growing up as a musician and I guess as an artist or whatnot. I will sit with a record and I was really poor as well so I didn't really have a lot of money so I'll have like the 10 CDs or something or five LPs or whatever and I had to listen to those and keep myself entertained with those and inspired by those and you kind of it lasted much longer, I think, that relationship with music, where you could have memories form from the relationship to the music. So, for instance, if I listen to some artists that I still listen to, like Slow Dive or Brian Eno or whichever, I can pinpoint. particular place or a particular memory related to that, you know. And I think that gets lost quite a lot today, you know, because of the abundance that we have, you know, and so much content generated, you know, you can't really keep up with it, you know. It's crazy. What do you associate with Harold Budd's music? Is there a certain place or time in your life? I think when I think of like very like early listening at least, it was a time where I didn't know shit and I think there was that kind of like like bliss from just, you know, maybe thinking that you know a lot, but you don't really know anything, you know? So there's that kind of bliss, and this is kind of like how I relate back to it. You know, I can listen to the Plateau of Mirror and think about, like, you know, be super impressed how, like... I didn't really knew what was doing the sound of like what I know today. It's like, you know, processes like synthesizer or, you know, the reverb effect that they put or whatever the technology. is because now I know. Has that lessened your enjoyment of certain things? Sometimes it does, but especially the production-wise things. But I can listen to this and think, man, back then I didn't really. thought about any of this stuff, I just kind of like heard things and just enjoy them for what they were and didn't really over analyze them perhaps or you know like they were just there, they just existed you know they were. And I think this is something that I can associate when I hear those records. I remember you saying in an interview about My Bloody Valentine's Loveless that, oh, I heard this elephant sound. Yeah. I just want to try to figure out how to recreate that. Yeah, I still try to emulate it. I have a patch on my Max for Life, and it's called The Elephant. what it is is just a looping device and I can try to think of This elephant sound. One time somebody came to me after a show or something like that and they said, man, it sounded like, it was like the sound of dinosaurs rolling over and collapsing. And I thought, wow, that's a really interesting description. Maybe I should rechange the name of my patch, you know? And like my bloody band had the elephant and I have the dinosaur or something, you know? So it's all enormous. creatures basically with you that's what you're trying to create with your music um i suppose so in in a way sorry my point though is that it seems like live it is very powerful experience. It should be a powerful experience. I had a really interesting conversation during Substrata. We had this panel. This is the other festival that I started, right? And we had this really interesting panel discussion, and it was mostly about noise and different things, you know, with the physicality of sound and what... not and I think that what was really interesting the conversation was how somebody and I can't remember who it was it might have been Tim Hacker or maybe Daniel Mensch I can't remember right now but somebody brought out this kind of like quasi religious aspect of like a live performance you know and I think dad you know, when you have an audience and they're listening to something simultaneously, you know, it creates this kind of like very primitive kind of almost like ritualistic kind of thing going on. And if you go to like really intense concerts, like for instance, like Swans was here fairly recently. I've seen it a couple of times. I mean, their sound life is just brutal, you know? It's like going into a sweat lodge or something. And I thought, you know, when you see the audience and everybody's trying to cope with the rawness of the sound, you know? And you can see people just either closing their eyes or just like... you know, oh my god, like this is incredible. And I think it almost feels like, you know, if you were to see, and I don't want to get too like hippy-dippy here, you know, but if you look at like very, I guess I wouldn't want to call it primitive either, but if you look at other cultures that have this kind of community-oriented, tribalistic way. You have this sense of closeness communicated through the sound and the music they create. For instance, there are some places where you hear groups of people singing all at the same time, and this is a really powerful thing. When you have a group of people that are perhaps unrelated or they don't know each other. I get kind of that feeling of the live performance, you know, when you're listening to music at home, you're pretty much either by yourself or in close company of close friends. or relative or significant other. So there is that experience. And then you're at a concert and you're full of strangers, surrounded by strangers, and there's that experience. So I think to be able to translate the work that's recorded... or what you did in a recording and then bring it into a live context and it's a complete different beast altogether and I think for myself as an artist to keep myself interested, I really don't play anything off a record that's been recorded, I just view it well. People wanted to listen to a song, they could just put it on their player at home, on the record player and just stay there and not participate in this experience. So when you have an actual live performance, you want to create this collage that, and by collage I mean the sound, the physicality of the sound. the audience and this kind of like dialogue and at the same time when you see sometimes people's reactions you reciprocate and then you have this feedback you know it might get louder maybe quieter there's an interaction of some sort you know and that to me is quite powerful with live music you know. How important is the physicality? I mean, I think this morning I was listening to your music on my laptop and it was very soothing. It was sort of like this Eno-esque, ignorable but interesting type of thing. Yeah, like ambient music, yeah. And then it's very interesting to me that so many producers and musicians like yourself talk about when they want it almost as loud as possible. immersive experience. Is that the same thing for you? It just depends on the type of concert. It depends on what you're trying to do, really. I mean, I think... For instance, if I'm doing a piano concert and working with a piano, and I think it makes absolutely no sense to have a piano at 120 dBs. I mean, that doesn't really-- it's kind of pointless. At the same time, if I'm working with a lot of textural elements and I want to create this kind of dinosaur or big layer, I definitely want to have-- bass frequencies that you can physically feel, not just their day. You want them to be in your cavity, like nasal cavity, their chest, and that kind of thing. If I have high frequencies, I don't want them to be piercing, as in I need to cover my ears, but I want... to be sharp enough that you're getting a kick out of it but you're not like okay I need to cover my ears now having said that I think If you were to compare the sound and other things that we do on a daily basis, you know, like today we have sunlight in Seattle, you know, and that's, I mean, it's not a very common thing here, but today we have sunlight, right? So you may need sunglasses to be out, you know? It doesn't mean that you can't really enjoy the sun, having the sun hitting your skin or... or what now you just put maybe some sunblock and some sunglasses and you keep moving, you know, so there's this kind of duality to it, you know, but I think a lot has to do with what exactly you are doing, you know, and, and if it makes sense and if the context is right, I think it's all about the context, really. I mean, I wouldn't want to listen to like sun on, you know, a small little PA, you know, I want to, I want them Do you usually know before going in to a show what you're going to do? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I think, like I said, instrumentation has a lot to do with it. If I'm doing my piano-style music, which I haven't done in a very long time, but if I'm doing a concert like that with a pianist or a small string section, I don't want that to... I wanted to have dynamics and when it gets loud it should be loud but also like I said, I mean a piano at 120 dBs doesn't really make a lot of sense, you know. A guitar at 120 dBs, you know, doing quite, at least to my ears, you know, doing a fairly reverberated, delayed... signal that makes sense to me you know distortions make sense to be loud you know although distortions could also be really quiet you know like there's incredible records are barely audible you know and this is fine too silence is a really important powerful thing you know one thing that I talked about when when I was running together strata was you know Sometimes when you have a really quiet moment in an audience, there's always somebody who coughs or somebody who tries to make some kind of bodily noise or something just to fill in the blank. It's because we're so overexposed to noises all day long. We kind of need to fill that space and we feel inclined to do so. Having absolute silence is fantastic, you know, just listen to your surroundings and just, you know, slow down for a couple minutes, which we desperately need, you know, we need to. slow down a bit, you know? Tell me about the idea of the Substrata Festival. Why was it needed in your mind? I think, like, at least, like, what I'm trying to do with it is just build a community that is interested in advanced sound proposals and things that are not necessarily either popular or... happening at all. I mean, obviously there's Decibel and there's some overlap with some artists, obviously. But that's not the focus of the festival. The festival is a fairly prestigious and fairly large event. For those who don't know, sorry. Can you just explain what is Substrato Festival? Substrato is a three-day event and a very focused event. It only has... one venue, one concert, three to four artists per night, two nights. And then on the third day, which is a Sunday, we do a field trip and we go out with one or two artists and a bunch of participants, very small group. I think we had maybe 20 people this year. Last year we had 15 or so. And we go out into the field and we do some field recordings and we kind of spend time doing something different as opposed to just sitting in a venue listening to music. You know, you get a chance to... see how an artist works and also spend some time talking and seeing what their process is like. Who's been some of the artists who have been some of the artists involved in the field trip? Last year it was Biosphere who was doing the field trip and this year we had Lawrence English and Scanner and all super different artists, super different approaches. It must have been quite interesting to see how different the approaches. Yeah, absolutely. That was quite interesting because, for instance, Geir is quite a reserved fella. He's quite quiet, very Norwegian. Yeah, I guess, you know, that's, you know, if we want to do the stereotype here, right? But yeah, he's a fairly quiet fella. And then, you know, you had somebody like Lawrence English, who's a very chatty fella, you know, and very knowledgeable about... techniques and process so you can compare it to for instance like Gare's thing was mostly about aesthetics and and you know what do you mean aesthetics like aesthetics you know how he uses like a location as part of his creative process like it's you know like a lot of his recordings are based on film recordings is done like somewhere you know he had that record that he did when he was in Tibet you know like and and so on so on right and other artists might be more like process based like like Lawrence for instance like his he's tons of field recordings work and he's been to some really incredible places like Antarctica and things like this you know that not everybody get to go and he can use it as part of the composition itself like biosphere will do but also he might just use it just purely as trying to show an audience or listener a location. He wrote a book, for instance, about sight listening where he was in Australia. And it's just that, it's just field recordings from areas and where you can listen to certain kind of birds and things like that. So it's kind of more functional approach to it, I will say. And then you have somebody like Scanner who, I mean, who... start his career by literally just hacking into people's phone conversations and recording them and using them as part of like an aesthetic. So it's just three very different approaches to what they do. For instance, Scanner doesn't even use any kind of high-end gear. It's just like his philosophy is about capturing the moment. So a mobile phone will do the trick. You can use your voice memo and record something interesting, as opposed to having a complex eight-channel. you know, a microphone 360 surround sound recording of a place, you know, which is something that Lawrence will do, for instance. It's very complex and quite interesting in its own right, but very different. So there's that contrast, you know, and I think that's an important thing, just to keep it interesting for people who are attending, for myself, for people who are coming back, you know. It's good to have. that difference, you know. Is there one that you prefer? I mean, you're using field recordings as well? Yes, absolutely, yeah. Yeah, I didn't, I mean, I think... everybody there's space for everybody and everybody has their own approach so i i just don't what have you used though in your own recordings i mean i use whatever i can get my hands on so for instance uh as an example i was on a cab about two or three weeks ago and I had the weirdest cab driver ever. It was this old lady. She was maybe in her 50s or something like that. And for some reason, out of the blue, she just started to talk about how she conjures dead people and stuff. And those who know me know I'm a staunch atheist. So to me, this is all mumbo jumbo. I have absolutely no concept of like... you know, afterlife or whatever. And she's just telling me this whole thing. And me automatically, I just took my phone and just hit record. And I just recorded like maybe like 10 minutes, the whole length of the camera. She's talking about how, you know, her dad will come back when she tried to conjure. but he wouldn't come to her, she went to her brother. I mean, it was just really strange and really interesting at the same time. She had all these interweaved stories, so it was almost like watching a film where somebody's just blabbing about something. That's just a mobile phone recording, but the content is just gold. It's incredible. Other times I've had the opportunity to go to do projects in different places like Jerusalem, for instance. I did a fairly large project there and we recorded quite a lot actually for a whole week. We went around all the different neighborhoods in Jerusalem, like the Muslim neighborhoods and the Jewish neighborhoods and the Armenian quarters and the Christian quarters and whatnot. for that I was using really good quality microphones because I wanted to capture something else, I wanted to really use it for an installation that was more about the location So you really wanted to have something that when people listen to it, they can really clearly hear every single detail, almost as if you were at the place. Not that you were, but you know. How did that project come about? That was something that came to me, and it was six artists. And it was supposed to be an exchange between Israeli and American artists. And myself and Keane from Mountains and Greg Davis were invited. And they asked us to come. And actually, I had met Keane before. I hadn't met Greg before that. And then we met with Rens Lavin, who's an Israeli artist from Tel Aviv, and two other artists, Ido Govrin and Yair Yatsioni, who is also from Tel Aviv. I believe both are from Tel Aviv, but I'm, you know, sorry guys if I'm... Screw that one up. But anyway, we got invited, and the idea was that we were going to go around the city and record the different facets of what the city of Jerusalem is. Because as you know, it's a really multicultural place and conflicted place and all these things. Who went there and we spent like a whole week Phil recording things and I think the interesting part of it was that we will go to a location and it'll be all six of us or all three of us whichever the group was and from the same location you had either three four five or six different points of view and That made it really interesting so so we could have been at the wailing wall for instance And you know I capture something and the other person you know almost like when you go and take some snapshots You know and you're with your camera like taking pictures and you compare You know what each other did and that was quite interesting because after we're done with it the whole installation was like six different rooms and in a art gallery and each one of us will be running the sound system with our fill recordings and people could walk through it and go from one place to the other and at one point the interesting part of it is jerusalem is built kind of like in this strange tunnels that run through the whole city they call the tunnels i mean they're not really tunnels but they're kind of like this really crowded areas full of shops and things and they might have this like rooftop thingy or whatever and they call it the tunnels and when you move around through it you hear and you I mean it's incredible because you're going from one place to the other you know people are speaking Arabic or Hebrew or whatever, or English. I mean, it's just this collage of things, you know, and it's also concentrated. So when we did the installation, you had, like, people could walk, and as you walk in, things will be blending as you were moving, but they will change. and it was really, really nice. I thought that was quite an interesting experience and it was quite fantastic, I think. How do you make a good field recording? Well, I don't really know what a good field recording is. Like I said, if we're talking sound quality, that's completely up to the eye of the beholder, right? I think for me, it's all about the moment as well. Like I said, I was in this cab and it was an interesting conversation. I could be out and plan to say, oh, I'm going to go field record up in the mountains today or whatever. And I don't capture anything that really interests me. I just spend the whole day just having fun hiking. or something you know I didn't really capture anything that I will use or something you know so it's all it's like almost like going fishing but for sound you know like sometimes you find something really cool and in other times there's just nothing you know it's about the experience I think yeah I mean the question is purposely vague but I wonder It's like that 4 a.m. in the morning after party. Yeah. It's starting to kick in. But you do say that, you know, you know it when you hear it. You know when you have something good. And aside from, you know, this 10-minute cab. conversation where you know you have something really interesting and good how do you know when you've got something that's usable of the variety of like what lauren singlish is doing yeah it just depends like for instance when we went to the substrata field trip this year uh it was kind of strange because the first location we went to was quite there's really nothing going on you know And the most interesting thing actually I found, and this is completely subjective obviously, but like we did this exercise. We were just standing, there was a group of 20-25 people, whatever the number we were. Hopefully we didn't miss anybody on the trip. We were standing in this area and there was this big openness to it. We just shut up for five minutes and we were just going to listen. like no gear just coming and listening to this thing right we're just standing there and i think some people were actually recording they wanted to record and whatnot you can hear like perhaps some birds or whatever leaves and all of a sudden like you start to hear this like hiking group It was this guy, and he was an older fellow and whatnot. And the first thing, he comes past by us, and he's like, what are you all doing out there? And I think Lawrence replied really politely, like, oh, we're just listening to things. And this kind of like, you know, there's obviously a person I've never seen or had. no idea what the heck we're doing there so obviously you know they had to ask questions or not and Lawrence kind of just give them a really academic explanation you know kind of like okay just shut up and continue moving or whatnot so the guys walk in and I guess I didn't really notice this at a time but my friend Chris did a recording of the whole thing. So when I heard it back, the guy was actually, you could hear him talk. And he said something about like, what a bunch of freaks or something like that. And then he started to bang on things like, and then he said something like, well, that will wake their ears up or something like that. And I thought, man, how typical of, you know, somebody who doesn't know something. And because they don't know, they don't feel comfortable with it, so we need to intrude just so I feel that I'm in power here. And I thought that was like so interesting, especially from like an American perspective, you know, that kind of like, you know. righteousness in a way, you know? I thought, what a dick, you know? It must have made for a good field recording, though. It was fun to listen to. This will wake your ears up. Yeah, it was interesting because at the time I didn't even notice it because you couldn't hear with your bare ear what he actually muttered. But with a microphone, like amplified and whatnot, you can actually hear really clearly what he said. And I think he told it to his son or something like that. And I'm like, well, that kid's going to grow up right, you know? Just bully everybody around you, you know, that's great When did you first start listening for things like this? When did you know your your your change in a way? Um, that's a very interesting question Honestly, I can't even remember like I mean I don't want to say oh, yeah I was born like this or something like that because it's total bullshit, right? But like I honestly don't know. I think the moment I started working with sound and really working with it and listening to things and not just like, oh, here's something that sounds good or whatever, but really listening to and studying the frequency relationships and how each frequency is a kind of a musical note and things more. theoretical aspects of it. I think you start listening to all the details, you know, of things and you pay more attention, you know, and as I continue developing, you know, my skills as an engineer and I start to work, I do a lot of mastering work at the moment, you know, and for that kind of work, it's all a really specific technical. kind of work where you listen to things and you're really listening to details so you can hear, you know, you really train your ears to, you know, hear a room like this and know exactly, you know, where that 25... 100k frequency, you know, it's coming from or whatnot or you know, there's for instance right now like this kind of weird low rumble in this room like I think it's like a 50 hertz or something like that like rumble maybe yeah, on or about like probably lower 48 or something like that and I can hear it, you know. fairly clearly actually so and it's mostly because you train your your ears you know you're trying your ears to like learn the difference in volume you know like for instance for most people like a 1 DB to DB volume difference won't really matter to them I could totally tell like when something is like one or two dbs i was actually this is a funny story actually i when i was in berlin recently i was having dinner with uh stefan betka who's a really well-known master engineer and he records under the name pole right correct yeah and uh so we were at this restaurant and It was at the time that all the games were happening, you know, all the Euro Cup streams and whatnot. And, of course, there's a television with a football game everywhere that you went. So we're at this restaurant, and we're sitting, and there's a television not so far from where we're seated, you know. And Stefan, he kept looking quite annoyed. by something, you know, and I couldn't tell what it was. And finally he just stood up. He just went and turned on the volume of it and he said, there's a 3,000 hertz frequency that's coming out of the television that's really bothering my ear. And I swear I couldn't, I mean, I'm not such a good mastering engineer, I suppose, because I couldn't hear this like 3,000. K frequency he was talking about. Maybe my ears are completely busted from listening to music so loud or something, but I couldn't really hear it, right? But yeah, he just went and walked, and then the owner of the bar or something that came, and he was like, oh yeah, but there's... this frequency that's really bothering me. I'm sure that was an interesting conversation. It was a really interesting conversation trying to explain to some bar owner why this 3,000 hertz frequency was a bothersome to this master engineer or whatever. And I thought, well, that's an interesting... When did you start mastering? about four years ago or so. Was that an economic decision? No, I mean, I thought I had friends who were master engineers, like Andres Tiliander, who's a master engineer. other friends that I know and you know when I was kind of starting out making my tracks and making my music and whatnot like a lot of them will master things for me just to like help me out kind of like you know give me pointers or say hey here's this track and you know like make it sound right or whatnot you know I thought you know I would like to do something like that kind of like help other people that are you know doing things and whatnot you know now that i know a little bit about production you know kind of help out and and i started helping friends out you know and then from there just start to to grow you know so what sort of you know skills have you gained in doing that and applied to your own music? For once, you kind of learn to separate frequencies better, so you know when you're mixing, if you have a really nice frequency separation, you're making... everybody's job easier, you know, it translates to your composition process as well because then you start thinking before you even go into the sound palette you kind of start thinking like what will clash what works well together, you know, and you kind of I mean, it's not a rule because I mean in reality there are no rules you can do whatever you feel like, you know, if that's your You know one one man's distortion or one man's frequency clashes another one's statements. It doesn't really matter. It's all relative, right? It's just what feels right to you as an artist. Do you feel like your music has changed, though, in certain ways since you learned some of these things? Yeah, I think so, a little bit. For instance, when I did the first record, Sight Below, that I did for Ghostly-- I did it in a really rudimentary fashion. I just recorded guitars and a little kick drum and something like that just to keep the time, and it was all live. And I made this error where I didn't really, like, multitrack it. I just had this looper or these looping pedals or whatever, and I just put it all together into this mixer. that mixer went into like a stereo out and that stereo out went where I recorded everything so well it sounded good when I was doing it and it was fun to do or whatnot more like a catharsis in a way but like when the label asked me oh can we get some stems to like do some remixes and whatnot. Stems? I said stems? How the hell am I gonna get stems to these people? Like I don't really have any stems because it's all it's just a two track you know there's no there's no multi-track so so that was quite challenging and I thought that created a problem actually when we tried to do this kind of stuff. So I think luckily a lot of the tracks didn't even have a beat, so it was just a file. So for instance, I sent Gare one of the songs, and I literally just took the unmastered version and just sent him the track, and here's your stem, or whatnot. And I remember for, this is quite interesting actually, for Hendrik, for Panta do Prance, he asked me for the same, and I sent him the same thing, I just sent him the guitar file or whatever, you know, and EQ the kick drum out of the track or whatever. But then he wrote me back and then he said, there's a little, like, this click sound going on. Can you send me the file without the click sound? And it's like, I can't really remove it. I think it leaked from the, you know, from the microphone when I was recording. You can hear it from the headphones, but, you know, you can't really hear it in the recorder. I just made something up like that, right? And then... Yeah, and then like I just took like a kick drum sound and made like a little 4x4 loop of it. You know, say, oh, here's the kick drum for the song too, by the way. And I just kind of made it up as I go, you know.
