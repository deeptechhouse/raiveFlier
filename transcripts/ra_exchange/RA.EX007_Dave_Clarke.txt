Hello, and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Will Lynch, and I write the news at Resident Advisor. During this year's Amsterdam Dance event, I had the chance to sit down with Dave Clark, one of techno's biggest personalities. In his nearly two-decade career, Clark's impact on electronic music has been massive. He forged a blistering techno sound with his red 12-inches and helped spark the electro-clash revival with his World Service Composition. By reputation, he's an eccentric bad boy, a former punk and licensed pilot who mostly wears all black and never shies away from speaking his mind. I caught Clark in a very professional moment. He'd just led a panel called The Do's and Don'ts of Digital Promo, which was every bit as technical as it sounds. Once it ended, we found a quiet spot in the attic upstairs, and Clark brought me up to speed on where he's at these days. you So yeah, I just saw you, you know, moderate a panel on a pretty technical DJ industry, electronic music industry topic. How did you become, how did you get to a point where you were moderating a panel like that? How did you get so interested in those issues? Well, first of all, I live in Amsterdam, right? Second of all, I really... Raise and respect the Amsterdam Dance Event. I think it's probably the most important dance event that I've ever had the luck to go to and you get business done here. So you see people, there's some great gigs going on. but a lot of people in town and because of the way that the whole thing is arranged that a lot of business gets done. So doing panels is a logical next step if you live in the city and I'm always interested in looking underneath seeing what can happen maybe things can change and as a lot of DJs that come from then and where they are now there's been a large change in for example delivery system and what I'm looking for is something which is consistent, effective and good for everyone and so that's how I come up with a panel like that because I'm thinking where are we going to go because you know getting new senders isn't much fun, logging in different with different passwords isn't much fun, you can have to log in with different passwords or you send it with your postman. So I'm looking at a way where we can go forward on that and that's why I'm interested in stuff like this. So how long have you lived in Amsterdam? I've been here for a couple of years. And what drew you to the city specifically? It's not Berlin. What drew me to the city? My first international gig was in '89, I think. And it was actually here in Amsterdam. And it was the first time I flew on a plane. to a gig, first time I ever did a gig outside of England and I looked at this place and fell in love with it but I didn't have any money and I just had dreams and I always thought that one day I'd come back. And I did and I'm very happy that I did because it's probably the most beautiful city that I've ever had the luxury of seeing. The culture here is splendid. The lifestyle here is really good. I don't need to drive a car. I don't even think about cars. I have a tram pass. I walk. I have a bike, I have a skateboard. It's all local and I'm right next to probably one of the best international European airports. So for the weekends, it's a 12 minute taxi drive. to the airport or I can get the train which runs really reliably if I'm not too tired and I have an incredibly good international airport where 95% of the flights actually leave on time because there's seven runways to leave from. So for me it was a no brainer really. So you don't fly yourself anymore? No. You need to keep up the hours. Oh, to keep your license. You need to keep up the hours to keep a license. And I just don't have that many hours as it is anyway. And I learned to fly primarily because I was always taking small planes. And I thought, hey, what happens if the pilot pops? So just cover my ass on this. And also, it's interesting. I have to admit that the most professional environment I've ever been in is... conversing with ATC at traffic control. Very, very professional, very to the point. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Can you expedite in this maneuver? Can you do that? Can you do this? Like, yeah, it's all clear to you. It's just nice. Yeah, it's relaxing. It's almost like playing chess. You're single-minded, you don't think about anything else, so it's kind of cool. And you said one of the things you like about Amsterdam is you walk, you ride your bike, you never even have to think about cars. Yeah. Is our environmental concerns something you're kind of preoccupied with? I'll do my best that I can, I mean I kill the planet every weekend by flying I can't help that unless I don't do my job and if you're a true, true environmentalist you don't pay for fucking planting trees you just don't do it, alright? You just don't do it So I do the best that I can, like all the lighting in my house, well 85% of the lighting in my house is LED. So I've taken it down from whatever it was, like maybe 4,000 or 5,000 watts to just a couple of hundred watts. So I try my best, I'm always recycling. The recycling now is coming up to the standard of what it was in England, which is kind of cool. I just do the best with what I can but know that I tear up the planet every single weekend with the amount of electricity that I put through base. And I just know it's not... If I was to put my hand up and pretend that I believed I was Moby... And I'll be full of shit because basically Moby's full of shit anyway because he's flying everywhere anyway. So, you know, I'm not going to become a hypocrite on that. I'm aware of the issues and I try my best within what I do. And how did you become interested in that stuff? Do you feel like you have a particular interest in environmental issues? Not a particular interest. It's just, it's, I suppose it's an efficiency thing. It's not very efficient to buy a drink out of something which is made out of metal, which probably has a shelf life, the metal itself, in its canister form of maybe 30 to 50 years, for gratification. of five minutes of drinking a Coca-Cola. So it's not very efficient, so try and throw that back and get it recycled. I don't know, I think it's probably living in England for a while because England was very, very into where I was from, recycling. I mean, actually, my old home city, Brighton, was the first... time they voted for someone with green in the whole country so that's the first green MP who's in Brighton now which is really really cool. So living in a fairly left-wing city sort of brings that into you and you're aware of stuff like that. I just do my best, but I'm not an environmentalist. And I read in an interview you said you were disappointed with basically the options voters had in the UK. You said you wanted a more socialist option. Can you just talk a little bit about that? I can. but I'll be honest I don't really care so much anymore. The first kind of Twitter's I was doing on my Twitter was like "oh fuck this political system over there" and then someone quite rightly said to me "I hate these expats always voicing their opinion it's not their concern anymore" and I was like "oh that hurt" but you have a point. It's not my concern anymore. I still find certain things shocking about what happened in England. But they couldn't even get my vote over to me in Amsterdam. They fucked that up as well. So, you know, I didn't even vote in the last election because the UK civil service never got the vote to me. So, yeah, I mean, English politics, I listen to them, I know what's going on, but generally I'm not that interested. Do you feel like you've kind of always had a political streak though? Yeah, of course. Absolutely. I mean, I lived in Brighton one day. Everything was political to some degree, but I actually remember waking up in the morning having to cycle past as well as on the way to school. hotel being bombed with Maggie Thatcher in there. So there's always been politics that are happening down there. We're always fighting racism down in Brighton, always. So you're aware of it. And when you come over to Europe, even though England is in Europe, but it's separated by water, so in some ways mentally it's separated too. you start to see more right-wing politics that would not be allowed in the UK. For example, with this Geert Wilders guy, like the English version of him, although not as coiffured, would be Nick Griffith, I think, from the BNP. He got voted out of his own constituency because no matter how shit the English press is, no matter how biased, how Murdoch-based they are, to their credit, they will not allow anyone to have any good opinion of a racist. They just won't allow it. And that's one of the good things. Whereas when you start coming over to Europe, it's less like that. And these people have more... So overall would you say that kind of like the way you grew up, maybe the music you were listening to sort of put you in a state of mind that you're still in, in terms of political or social opinions, stuff like that? I don't know. I miss the political overtone of music. That's gone from hip-hop as well, as far as I'm aware. When we were listening to hip hop in the early 80s there was a very big political overtone in there from more commercial but still great things like The Message. Outro Music And now it's all about bleep and bitches and whatever. It's not about really too much political stuff. You don't really get BDP anymore or Mr. Lift and stuff like that. It's not really around anymore. That's what I miss. I don't know if I'm shaped by the music. I was shaped by the country, I think. And do you ever feel like... electronic music, dance music is kind of lacking a little bit of political content? Yeah, always. I always think that. Do you think it's strange at all that you would end up as a DJ, given that fact? No, because I don't think I'd make a very good politician. Because I'm not diplomatic and I don't think I'm a very good politician so I think I have to sort of become a DJ because that was... My calling, that was what I wanted to do from a very young age when I was working in a shoe shop even. And they said to me, you know, what are you going to do for the rest of your life? I was like, yeah, I'm going to travel the world. I'm going to play music. Yeah, right. And maybe I didn't believe it myself, but it was a dream. So I didn't see any other way. And one thing that I thought was interesting that you said in the panel You said the good old days or the bad old days, depending which way you look at it. What do you mean by that exactly? Well, I got a load of shit when I switched over to digital DJing very beginning of this century, I think about 2000, 2001, whatever, because the technology was starting to become cool, usable, so I switched over to CDs as a bridge because I knew that they could be encoded digitally because they already are. And I've got a load of shit for doing that people say how much are they paying you for putting this the knife in the back of vinyl and stuff like that and So I'm very aware that it's a very polarized view there's like a dateline of good old bad old days and good old bad new days. I see both. I see the standardization of the bad old good old days as something that was very very useful and I see the flexibility of digital in the good old the good new bad new days as very very useful too. But a lot of people are very, very... you know, this is where I sit on this and it's like think about where it's going. I've actually started buying vinyl again which is quite weird. Basically I've just started buying old new wave stuff that I only had on 7-inch that I'm buying on 12-inch just to recapture some of those memories and it's a hobby now as opposed to a necessity. It depends on how you look at it, you know, half empty half full. Are there any things about like the old days that you feel kind of nostalgic about? Yeah, the ease of setting up the club. And even that was a fucking difficult thing sometimes because no one could even set up needles properly. Setting up in a club, you would just turn up with two boxes of vinyl and the DJ that was on before you would move to the left or to the right and away you go. And now every single DJ brings their own technical solution to the program, which is fine at festivals when you have roll-on and roll-off rises, but when you're in a small underground club... That's not easy. Luckily I have someone that does it for me. And I always try my very, very best to break down if there's a DJ after me, whether it's a named DJ or a local DJ, it doesn't matter, to break down so that they can start immediately with no interference at all. It's really important to do that. But that's one thing I do miss, the ease of coming into a nightclub. And obviously, yeah, that's something which is a shame that doesn't exist anymore. I think it will happen again, though. I think at some point that would just be like some fucking glorious piece of technology that everyone uses, plugs in like a thumb drive with 300 terabytes of music and away you go. I'm sure that will happen. What about in terms of like the atmosphere of the parties and the music or anything? They change, they go up and they go down. There's no particular golden year that I look back and think that was the best time and now it's shite and now it's better than what it was. It really depends. I mean, Lowlands this year, for example, was as good, if not as good as the time that I first played it. So no, I don't really think... It's changed for the worse or for the better. I think certain areas have definitely changed for the worse. Geographical areas, and Ibiza is one of them, I think it's completely gone up its own arse. I mean, it was really on its own arse anyway, but it's completely up its own arse now. It's not a place that I ever really want to visit professionally at all. But you know, I think Europe as a whole is very very healthy, very very interesting to play and I think some other territories have dropped off but I think that's a natural progression of the way things go. I always get a bit confused about America. I can't understand sometimes how the music was adapted there and did so well there and a lot of it came from there and then years on there wasn't really any... incredible, consistent scene. There's events, but there's no scene. And I find that a little bit bizarre. From where you stand, does that strike you as a cultural thing in the US? Or do you think it has to do with the laws or what the clubs are like? I don't think Joe Biden affects any of this yet. It always would have been that way. I just think it's the way America's built. Here you have cultural centres, yeah? People interact and stuff like that. Especially in Amsterdam, because you're not in cars. And I think in America, everything's in a car. Everyone has the same stinky air freshener fucking Christmas tree hanging from the car. You have to drive there, you have certain bridges that don't allow buses over, so... the poor people can't come over. You know, the whole way that it's been arranged because America is such a big geographical country, spread it out, separate people, suburbanise, and you don't really get any feeling of community. I think that's the difference. Whereas in Europe, you definitely have a feeling of community. I mean, I'm saying this from someone that's never lived in America. And it's just a visitor's perspective. But, you know, apart from maybe New York. apart from maybe San Francisco, I can't really think of a community vibe that's there. What are some places, like specifically in Europe, that you think are really good right now or say like really have that community feeling? Amsterdam. I'm so happy to be here. It's the best geographical move of my life. What's the scene like locally? That's the funny thing. I don't actually dip my toes too much into scenes. I tend to keep away from it. I play an episode maybe two or three times a year because I don't want to do it too much. But culturally, excluding music, I really enjoy being here. With music, I think it's a very healthy scene because there's lots of adaptation of music here. Radio is very, very healthy in Holland. The club scene is pretty healthy, although it's more event-based over here, so people are more into... And you have to understand why. I personally think it's because a lot of people live in houses that are quite small. And while it's Cheselach, they actually want to get out of the house because the sun's out, so they want to have an outdoor life for maybe a couple of months as well, and I think that's why festival is quite big here. In general, what are some projects you're involved in right now? Radio. Very heavily involved in radio. That's a very important thing for me. Like I was saying in the panel, I'm not bullshitting. I get a very, very big buzz. at playing people's music, especially if they're not known, you know, and then maybe I see a comment that they're really excited or Twitter. It's like, it's what it's about. And I'm not doing it because I like or dislike the person. just for the music. So radio is a very big thing. And where do you DJ online? Or where do you DJ? In terms of radio, I mean. Oh, radio. It's in Ireland on National Radio, it's in Holland on National Radio, and it's on iTunes. And so do you feel like you're transitioning from club DJ producer to more radio? No, I'm not retiring if that's where it's going. Oh no, no, that's mean. I've always enjoyed doing radio. My first radio was in Brighton in the 90s and then I did some stuff on BBC Radio 1. I was too specialist for them and I understand that, that's fine. But, I've always enjoyed radio because it's a completely different medium. It's about you giving something back. You know, you're searching and travelling music and you're giving something back. You're hopefully putting out stepping stones for people either by listening to new music they've never had or people, you're playing their music and they're thinking, oh, this is good, it's encouragement. Just in the same way that I got when John Peel was playing my music. It was a massive, massive encouragement and it helped me get further and further and further. And that's what I hope it does. So you see it as kind of like... Community service. Yeah, perfect. That's exactly what I was going to say. Yeah, completely, definitely. I'm lucky that because my music that I like and that I play is... challenging and I'm lucky that I actually have national radio on my side so you would say there's a pretty different like buzz so to speak in radio DJing than there is in club DJing yeah totally it can seem a chore when you're going through 1.76 terabytes of music that week but when you get through the other end there's no feeling like it's like fuck I'm getting away with it again And you're playing all this new music. And it's just, it's just so cool. You know, sometimes you get a link on YouTube, it's like, what the fuck? And then you give the artist, can you send me a wav of this? And it's like, Orlando Vaughan did this track called Illegal in Detroit. But because he spent time over here, it's like, so it's like kind of, Dutch as well. I was like, wow, this is really interesting. And so he went out and kind of like, yeah, yeah, brilliant. And it's just really exciting. What was your entrance into radio or why did it appeal to you to begin with, like back in Brighton? Because I never heard music on the radio that I liked for almost the whole programme. I love listening to John Peel and when I now like looking back about John Peel it's like some of the music that he played on the radio I fucking hate it right but I got to like some of it and that's kind of cool I think it's just I don't know, just wanting to get that music out. It's like, listen, you should listen to this. It's important, yeah? It's interesting. It's going somewhere. It's not the same stuff that you hear during the day. And I just remember playing, like, Masculine and United on radio in Brighton. I mean there was a time when I played in Brighton and I had a dog, a fine rider, a German dog. And we played in the basement and they actually had a club sound system down there just hanging over. So we actually just put the club sound system in for this radio broadcast at 2 o'clock. The police came round. Right, because there was so much bass people were complaining. My dog shat himself because of the bass. I didn't know this at the time. It's just the vibe. It's just like being alive and doing stuff like that. I mean like I interviewed Richie Horton back then and he was like, how do you do that? Because he obviously listens back to his own interviews like most artists do. And because I actually did an interview with him down the telephone line and put it through my sampler and edited it. And And it's just important to get that music out there because there's a lot of bland, in my opinion, bland music and it gets a lot of airplay and There's a lot of good music out there that doesn't get that. So you feel like you're filling a gap? Yeah. Tell me a little bit about this scene that kind of fostered you as a young musician or something, the scene in Brighton and everything. Who were some artists that you knew? What were the parties like? And what were some early experiences that made it click for you? being playing hip-hop and being canned off a hip-hop jam as I used to call in those days with with cans with the longer shelf life than the joy they got by playing hip house and acid I remember that quite clearly and I remember playing with the jungle brothers and true mathematics in 1987 perhaps in Brighton and playing house and acid after them and they were getting canned for playing our house you because like all these big boys in the Buffalo stance like what the fuck is this shit no we came down here for like other stuff Outro Music I remember going round to Carl Cox's house and using techniques for the first time in my life, thinking I've got to have these and you know, Carl is physically quite a big guy. and the mixer that Carl had seemed much bigger than the standard 19" rack mount mixer. It seemed to expand massively and I remember struggling keeping from the left to the right because I think it was a big GLI mixer. And I remember going round to his little house by Brighton Station back in those days and him sort of giving me a chance and playing. like the reason why I used to play really really fast loads of records all the time is because no one ever used to give me a chance right so I was like fuck it I'm going to play all these records in one go and I remember playing at Hove Park Tavern I think it was and Carl gave me the chance of playing half an hour and I think he regretted it because what I did was like I must have played like maybe 40 or 50 records really really quickly really really hard and then he had to come back on after me but it was like I've got to do this I was never sort of like wanting to be like okay here we go so I remember that and yeah I mean there was some good old days and some bad old days actually you know the scene in Brighton was interesting, had the Zap Club down there, which I played at quite a few times. And then all of a sudden the rape scene happened in the UK and I never got involved in the rape scene because to me it seemed more about drugs, bouncy castles, I've said this many, many times, and music was secondary. It was all like a social experience as opposed to a musical experience. And so, you know, that's when I started making music because I wasn't getting any DJ work because no one was asking me to to DJ that, but I wasn't seeking to either. So I started making music. So you've really, as far as I can tell, you've really stuck to your guns over the years. You just said when the rave scene happened, you didn't adjust to it, you didn't even participate in it. And I feel like there are other examples of that too. I know you weren't crazy about the whole minimal wave and everything. Really? But I guess, what do you think, what was it like to start? you're seeing things sort of ebb and flow and you just stuck to the same thing. I don't see it as a choice. I know a lot of people see it as a choice, like I know that, and it made me wonder what they were doing in techno, because they just immediately jump to something else because it's trendy, as opposed to they feel it, or because they're worried about their work level. And I understand that people have to earn money for their families and stuff like that, I understand that, and if you can do it doing something you sort of semi-enjoy, perhaps it's not so bad as doing something you don't enjoy. I don't actually think bad of Richie at all for being completely minimal because I believe that's where he wanted to place himself, what he wanted to do. And an artist should have the freedom of doing what they want to do without having shit. And I believe he went where he wanted to go. But I also believe a lot of people went there because they thought, "Oh, what's happening?" Blah, blah, blah, and just move over. It's not even a choice. I don't think I can live for myself. That makes it sound like I look really down on minimal, and I don't look really down on minimal. I look... You look down on the fad. Yes, exactly. I'm not a fad guy. But it was never a choice. It was like, hey, there's still all this good music. Why should I not play that? It's crazy. Why do you think you ended up with the style that you have? Like, what influences, you know, made that so clearly your thing? Because I was lucky enough at that point, we go back to Brighton again, of growing up in a town where... My sort of group of people would fight against racism. And we also were in a massive melting pot, cultural melting pot of listening to all types of music from mob, punk, reggae, ska, disco, gay disco. I used to spend a lot of time, this sounds terribly wrong, I used to spend a lot of time as a young boy in gay discos because the music was really interesting. You'd listen to stuff like by mainframe sort of like we're Trevor horn left field productions Along with you know like everything Thomas high energy of course and then you Bobby O productions of divine Which are really good and then you sort of figured out how that fitted within house because obviously house came from favorite gay background as well And it was just a big melting pot, so you just absorb all this stuff. And so, you know, the first 10 or 15 years of your musical life are probably your most formulative, where you absorb everything, and you then become the part of that, where you want to go. Which doesn't mean that you're closed to new things, because it makes it sound like you're scared of the new world. You're not. You just know what you like. and I listen to a lot of punk, a lot of rock, and it seems natural for where I'm at. Yeah, and I read somewhere that you said bands like I guess kind of like post-punk and proto-punk, like it was made like Bauhaus and The Damned and stuff like that, that for you that was really like exactly it or something. Why that music? I wish I could explain that. because then I would hold probably the greater complexities than the gold particle in a way because I don't know why it happened, where it happened. Maybe at some point in your life your brain is still formatting and just before it formats the final block everything's set into a catalogue B-tree and it's done. I don't know. I was just a little bit too young for punk, I think. And that's something that I think is quite important because had I been the teenager that went through punk, I think I might have grown out of it. I don't know. But because I was just a little bit too young, I couldn't quite touch it. I couldn't quite have it. I couldn't quite get that because, you know, yes, I could gobble on the street. but it doesn't really make you a punk, so you just take in the music and the UK subs. And the first time that I actually saw The Damned live was two years ago in Holland. Amazing. Really amazing. MUSIC PLAYS . One of the best gigs I could have been at because I knew all the words and everything. It was fantastic. So it's really really good, but I don't know why. I think there's, I mean, what I like about the dance music is there's a political overtone. You know, the church doesn't mean a thing. It's just another way of being right wing. I've got nothing against church. I need people to go there and show their... And I think... When you're nine years old, eight years old, and you're listening to that, you're thinking, okay, that's not what being taught religious education is called. And that's kind of cool. Devo or just cooking. And that's interesting. With Bauhaus... It suited the time because you're sort of like a bit moody aren't you? You're a teenager going through hormonal changes. It works well. But then when you actually study Bauhaus and you study Tones and Tales afterwards and Danny Lash, Killing Joke and stuff like that, there are some masterpieces there. Absolute masterpieces, beautifully constructed music with depth, using technology to the best that they could at the time and it still works. Do you think in terms of vibe or energy, that music still carries over into what you're doing today? I don't know. I drive less. When I used to drive a lot, I used to listen to that music all the time because you have to get through traffic jams and you live all the time. So I drive less. I don't listen to that music so much. I have one of these things now, which actually means... I actually more consume things I don't have time to watch on television than I actually have time to listen. But in a way I can see some of that sort of filtering through in some of the more modern groups, Black Lips. Even Arcade Fire to some degree. It would be very trendy and very nice. I hate Arcade Fire because it's so popular. But there's some really good stuff they're doing. I don't particularly like the way that maybe they present themselves on stages if they're entertaining their parents and they can play every single instrument. Aren't we clever? But some of the music, and it's always about the music when it comes down to it, the music is actually interesting and good. You know, Grinderman can be fun. Nick Cave. There's just a lot of great music out there. So how old were you when you first got into that post-punk stuff? Eight or nine. Oh, the post-punk, the after stuff, like the Bat House. Just all that stuff. No, I mean, I was buying music, listening to music when I was about eight or nine. Always. I mean, my mum had a shitload of disco records, which I'm now getting the digitised versions of CDs and stuff like that, really rare disco records. I was friends with a kid called Simon and we used to listen to Dudley Moore and Peter, can't remember his last name now. They used to have like really sick humour that sort of kind of, it was like Monty Python on acid I think. Mr Spigot, you are auditioning are you not for the role of Tarzan? Yes. Mr Spigot, I couldn't help noticing almost immediately that you are a one-legged man. You notice that? When you've been in the business as long as I have, Mr Spigot. You get to notice these little things almost instinctively. I don't know if it was like I'm rebelling against what I'm at because my mother was always rebelling anyway so it wasn't really about rebelling against suburbia or anything like that. It was just political awareness and I think political awareness is not made available for a lot of kids now and I think it's important. I think that's why we have one of the worst natural situations is because of political apathy. Yeah, because I saw you said somewhere that you were hoping that pop music... would develop more of a political conscience. Because three years ago, I think, or two years ago, I was at ADE, and I said, what do you think is going to happen to England? I said, I think, and there'll be a video record on this somewhere if you look it up on Google. I said, I think what's going to happen in England is it's going to be like the specials that go down. High streets are going to close down, there's going to be a massive recession. Really wars closed, there's loads of spaces to let even in some of the most prosperous south-east of England towns. It was inevitable that that was going to happen. And then I said, I think from memory, I hope that pop music starts to become more politically aware. You know, when I say politically aware, I'm not talking about that stupid bouffant-haired fucking woman, I can't remember her name. Lady Gaga? No, not that one. That's a really stupid one. No, another really stupid one. M.I.A.? Amy Whitehouse. Oh, Amy Whitehouse. Right. She's political in the fact that she's sort of punk in the fact that she doesn't give a fuck and she falls out and overdoses on drugs. I'm not interested in that side. What I want is some eloquence disguised in a song. Like Ghost Town. Like The Damned. And I don't hear that anymore. And that's what's missing. And I was hoping, well, I was first of all hoping that it wouldn't really fuck up as I thought it would, but I was hoping that if it did fuck up... People go, hang on a minute, what's going on here? Let's become aware. And no one's become aware. They're only aware of what happens when it hits them, but they're not aware of the mechanics of why it hit them and how they could possibly prevent it in the future. And pop music... when written well, was a perfect carrier for that. Elvis Costello, Oliver's Army, all very good historical lessons, but also very good at saying, look, being metaphorical, take it from there to now. Where are we at? What's happening? Nothing like that now. Nothing. Do you think, is it just pop music or is it just music that many people hear? Or do you think more underground music kind of has some kind of obligation to be political as well? Okay, where do you spend most of your time? Berlin, right? Yeah, yeah. Do you see minimal as a political movement or a movement that is based around being self-happy and oblivious? I mean between those two, of course. It's not really political. The techno that I'm playing, I wouldn't say is really political either. It has edges, it challenges people, it doesn't cosy them, it doesn't make them comfortable. It challenges people, but it's not political. You know, underground resistance of old could be political until Billy Bob came up with that phone shite, yeah? It could have been political, but it's not political anymore. Maybe people want to get away from the fact that things are completely fucked. I don't know. I don't have the answers to that. I mean, all I know is that whenever I talk about politics at all... In the UK, when given the time and the space, people would hate me for it. Why? Why do you think? Oh, shit, shut the fuck up. Why can't you? No, no, no. It's just about music. It's about parties. We're living in a world. Let's be part of it. Let's have the music for the soundtrack. perhaps, but let's be part of it and let's see what we can do. But I will be honest that living in Amsterdam, not speaking Dutch very well, if at all, I don't know too much about what happens to the politics over here. And I have to admit that it goes contradicting to what I'm saying. I have to admit that actually it can be quite peaceful. Because I'm not so entrenched within all the detail and stuff, MPs paying themselves for duck ponds and stuff like that. I'm not entrenched in it anymore. And that actually can be quite peaceful, so maybe I'm sort of, I don't know, seeing the middle ground a little bit clearer. As we're talking, I feel like for you music is something... that's very important in a way other than just an interest or like you there's feels like there's something has a little bit of a political tenor and I don't know so just kind of a deeply political or deeply personal there's a deeply personal aspect of it for you. Is there anything you can sort of identify as a reason that you kind of, you know, attach yourself to music maybe as some kind of like relief like we were just talking about? Well it just saw me through some very very bad years of, you know, stuff that... kids in Western society sometimes have to deal with. And it helped me through and it gave me distraction and it gave me purpose. And I think everyone needs purpose. I think if you don't have purpose and you don't have drive and you don't have direction, I think that can be quite confusing and it's given me purpose for many, many years now. And, you know, I mean, there were many, many years when I had no money, no money at all on the breadline. And it helped. It gave me the strength to carry on and keep going forward. Helped in the sense that, like, listening to music, the experience helped you or also, you know, music as a career. The experience, it helped me escape, but it helped me escape with logic as opposed to oblivion. And I don't think oblivion and me are a good match. I think logic and me are a great match, if possible. As for the career, it's provided me with a career now for many, many years. I feel quite lucky for that because, you know, I left school very, very young and like a lot of kids. And I was supposed to then go to like a technical college and do computer software engineering because I was really into computers. And it never happened because there was no money to send me there. I had no money and then I just ran away from home. But, you know, a lot of kids do that. I mean, I think a lot of people would relate to you, you know, in a general sense, music having that kind of, you know, that kind of role of relief in their life. But for you, how do I transition into something that... this was something you were actually going to do? Was there a point where... This is for a lot of people. Whenever I do seminars and people talk to me about myself, a lot. You can play as you're the most talented motherfucker in the world, and maybe if that's true, you still need luck. Right place, right time, right scene, right country. And if I place everything together, there's luck involved as well. And I don't like using the word luck, not because I think I'm the most talented motherfucker in the world. because I'm not, but I don't like things that don't have mathematical formula that break down black and white. But I have to admit it's a lot to do with luck. It's the fact that there were record shops that were selling Chicago House from 1985 onwards in Brighton. You know there was a scene around there that hip-hop was coming through and clubs were taking the American sound. It's just luck all the time. I could have been in, I don't know, I could have been born in East in Germany at the time and then had to wait 10 years and then maybe I'd have been 10 years too late for my particular body at that time so it's luck it's placing and yeah it's a very strange combination What we're saying... Hard work. Right. You have to add in hard work because... But the thing is, like, the thing is about hard work, hard work doesn't get you the goal. And, in fact, you can throw... And there's a lot of people, I'm sure, who have been really unlucky which work very, very hard and never get there. But if you have all those elements involved, like, you know, a little bit of talent, hard work, a little bit of luck... then you can get to the next level. And what were some specific breaks you got? Like someone stepped in and helped you out or gave you a big gig or something like that? I only found out about this years later, but the first sort of club residency that I had was basically the club itself was run by my... Got parents, kids. I didn't even know that. I only knew that when I saw the got parents, kids at my father's funeral. that I realized and put two and two together and found out. But basically, I got that gig because... And then that helped me. That was a topper? Yeah. And that helped me. And, you know, doing Jungle Brothers, things were kind of cool too. And the fact that... bugged out who were then at the Paradise Factory in Manchester. The fact that Felix the house cat yet again didn't show up and they asked me to come up there and it was at quarter past five. On a Friday evening. And I didn't have any money. And I didn't have a car. So I had to hire a car. And the fact that I could get to the. This is where the luck comes in you see. Felix the house cat. Yet again not showing up. Car rental place. Just being open for 10 minutes. Just having enough money. to hire the car and pay for the petrol, and then driving up to Manchester and doing the gig. And those sort of things start building up and start happening and things going on like that. But you think it easily could have happened another way, basically? I wouldn't know. You can never say it's not a chemical formula. You just never know. I don't know. All I know is I was trying, working hard, giving everything I could give. Working very, very hard, spending all the time doing things, either musical, like building stuff, putting together equipment, learning how it works, DJing as best I can, DJing for nothing a lot of the time, hoping that DJing for nothing will actually get me to the next level. Carl Cox giving me... the availability of playing, I think, two or three bits for him. All this is just luck. And then it just fits together. Given, you know, all you've just said about luck... Do you feel like you're kind of at the tip of a series of achievements or does it feel strange to you? It only feels strange to me when I have to explain it to people. I don't look back that much on that. I'm not one of these DJs that plays their own music all the time. So it's not just about me, it's about the whole thing, the whole scene. I don't know. I know I'm not finished. I know I've got other things to do. Maybe there's another album inside me. I really don't know. Maybe in 10 years time, I'd like to think maybe I actually start because I always have to do something. Maybe I start teaching in university or something. I don't know. I don't look back at it in that way. Sometimes it's even difficult to remember where you were last weekend. So it's straight up a strange memory. I can remember things and people from certain things, but I can't remember where I was last weekend. So overall, I mean, you just said you feel like you might have another album in you, but for right now you're mostly focused on... Radio. Radio. So you'd say more than club DJing at this point? No, because apart from loudspeakers, I just remembered I was ill and actually unfortunately had to cancel, which is very, very rare. No, I've got bookings until June next year, so still going forward and still working and still doing clubs. So when you DJ now, you said you stopped playing vinyl and everything. What does your setup consist of? CDJs, other techniques or denons, and a mixer, Serato. and some effects that will change all the time this is in its infancy at the moment the iPad there's some great musical programs for it what I'm looking for is some like really good audio effects programs that actually can use the CPU in there and like they do a couple for guitar and I'm waiting for you know like Waves plugins I suppose stuff like that would be kind of cool to have on there so you think it seems to me like for you it's important to say like open-minded about new technology and stuff. But not adopt it for the sake of adopting it. You know, not like going, hey, here's a pacemaker, this is going to change my world. And two years later people are going, what was that? No, it's not about just being, adopting the first piece of technology that comes on just to jump on the bandwagon. It's about being open-minded and seeing how it works. Do you think there's a lot of luddite-ism or something in electronic music? It depends on which generation and it depends on the mentality of the person. Yes, there definitely can be. Some people definitely use vinyl still as an art form and some people use vinyl because they're lazy and they didn't want to move over. room between the two it all depends and so I guess from where you stand it sounds like you don't see much true utility to using vinyl you don't think vinyl would make a better DJ set or anything like that I touch vinyl it makes me sound really weird it's almost like touching the cloth of God or something I touch vinyl at my birthday party for the first time in maybe eight years. And it's a lot lighter than I remember that. Needle jumps a lot easier. I do remember that. It was nice. It was nice. I had DJ Bone at my birthday party and Alan Oldham at my birthday party. And it was nice because instinctively I could still spin the record like that and flick it on. Which is kind of weird. It's like, I don't know, it's made me feel like a basketball player and you can still do that Harlem Globetrotters. Wait, you mean you spin it on your finger and then flick it onto the platter? Yeah, I can still do that. It's really weird. And then I was in all the cross-hand stuff. It felt quite natural. I missed the tactile response. That I do miss, I'll be honest. Because there is a sort of showmanship around that. But it's not just that, it feels good. But it feels good because you did it for so long. But I'm quite happy. happy to trade that tactile response for having five, six hours on WAMS accessible to me. And the ability of not having to wait for an acetate or this, that, the other, you know, for new music. So there's always, wherever you go forward, there's always going to be a trade-off. you just have to be balanced in your mind. What is the trade-off? How does that affect me? Where am I going forward? Is going forward better than the trade-off? Well, I don't know. Let's try, let's see, because you can always go back. And I made the decision of vinyl because there were a few people that were using vinyl scratch back in those days, but the sound quality was awful. The hard drives were small. always causing problems and the technology wasn't stable. And I knew that with the technology, that with CDs, it's digitising all my vinyl, that I'll be able to incorporate that later on into a digital setup. CD, I've always found CD a bit of a strange thing because CD was like developed, I think, in... 82 or 79 was done by Philips made to fit a certain piece of classical music on there. But if you actually analyse the data capacity of the CD and the fact that you could actually encode 650 megabytes of data on there in the beginning of the 80s, something was strange there. I can't work out how that jump happened. And why did it take so long to maybe go for Blu-ray? Because obviously anyone that understands Isaac Newton and prism theory understands that everything's split in a certain way and there's more energy in the blue than there is in the red. Why did that take so long to come about? And it doesn't matter now because everything's SSD, solid-state, so it doesn't really matter. I find the CD a little bit of a strange thing that sits out there. It's like 650 megabytes. I mean, you know, most of us that even have personal organizers in the mid-80s were 32 kilobytes. So how did that jump of technology? That's a massive jump of technology. And why did it surpass Gordon Moore's law massively? And then how come it took so long for everything to catch up? Something wasn't right there. Yeah, kind of on a similar topic. Red, you said something like... you hope to see a democratization of digital technology? What do you mean by that exactly? Well, like I was saying in the panel, for example, I would like there to be one or two platforms basically very similar, delivering music in a similar capacity as opposed to you sending this, that, and the other, and blah, blah, blah. Because I think it's important to have standardization of some degree. or message, yeah, not the music itself but the way that the music is carried, the messenger. And if we can get that then I think that's going to help and push us forward even further. The democratisation of digital has already happened and the fact that many people can produce music now, whether they should or not is someone else's argument, but more people can produce music now with more power than was ever dreamed possible by Trevor Horn or any of those people. You really do not need a massive studio now. It's always nice to have a photo of you next to an SSL desk, but it's not necessary anymore. It's really not. Yeah, jumping back a little bit, there's something I forgot to ask you. So you said when you DJed vinyl, it was kind of fun to, you know, that feeling of like being so involved in all this stuff. Do you still, first of all, do you still, when you DJ, have that really busy style that you were talking about earlier? It depends. It really depends on the club and the people and the vibe. I'm very busy on the mixer. I've always been very busy on the mixer. But because I don't have to change a slab of plastic, locate that physicality has now disappeared from my set because it's not necessary. Because I locate from the computer screen what I'm going to play and then it just goes on there because of the timecode. So if you don't understand about technique and you think, oh, he's not as busy anymore. It's because I'm not repeating mechanisms that aren't necessary. But I'm still entrenched in what I'm doing. My BPMs have dropped. Like 1990s I was probably playing about 140, 142 BPM and now I'm sort of between like 133, 136. Do you think that has something to do with your technology? I don't know. I'm sure if you trace it back even further my BPMs were different in the early 90s. It just happens. I don't think it mirrors my heartbeat. I just think it just happens. What are some technological or just in general in electronic music, what are some things you're really excited about right now? iPad. I think the fact that it is a massive graphical user interface capable machine is going to change a hell of a lot of things. All of a sudden you don't need these little extra boxes that come along because you just have an iPad and bagging, but it appears as it is. You have all these buttons on there, so in a way the Jazz Lemur and all those sort of things are sort of not so necessary anymore because the iPad, which you can watch your film on the plane, check your ringtone when you're in the hotel, will actually do all this sort of stuff for you. And I think the iPad is going to change a lot of things Obviously new iPhones are going to change a lot of things when technology comes down to it. I'm concerned about Apple actually. What do you mean? I've believed in them for very long. I've been using them since 1993, 1994, maybe 1992, before they were the Atari. And there was a nerdy side to them, which is okay, but they have become a consumer electronics company now, and certain things aren't being driven through as much from a professional user base as what they used to. and some things are gaping holes and obvious mistakes. It's not as robust as it used to be from a professional point of view. I think it's changing things for the better from a consumer point of view and I think that's good. But I think they should spend a little bit more time having maybe a professional area. department leaders. I don't give a fuck about genius bars or anything like that. Or however someone's been sponsored by Weller to work in there with their perfectly placed hair and fucked up tattoos I don't give a shit it's I just want a professional vibe yeah I mean the biggest biggest excitement for me in technology apart from say like the iPad and these sort of possibilities are things like finally SSD side Now, I mean like my MacBook which I've had for ages, I don't worry about bass resonance anymore for the hard drive because it's SSD, I've got 500 gig SSD. It boots up in 8 seconds every single time. You know, I'm going to keep the computer clean and make sure everything's properly organised and the computer sort of filing system and everything. But SSDs actually were the biggest thing for me to get excited about, which makes me sound terribly nervous. But it's really nice. The weird thing is my father was so right. He was on BBC Radio in Brighton, like in the 70s. Where do you think everything's going to go? And he's talking about quadraphonics and stuff like that. Everything's going to be solid state. Solid state. Everything became solid state to a degree. So what is Solid State? No moving parts. So you have like flash drives and stuff like that. And he predicted that. Shame he never saw it. I mean he loved his retro wheels and stuff like that and his echo machines. But it's kind of cool. Maybe that's why we decided a little bit underneath because what he was saying 30 years ago, I don't know how many years ago, 40 years ago perhaps, 35 years ago. radio is now actually true and not just true but very reliable and very fucking good
