♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Bye. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. This week's exchange is with Jamie Roberts who makes music as Blaouan and it turned out to be a refreshingly honest conversation about his work and the techno scene in general. Among a few different topics he reflected on the post dubstep sound he was originally associated with and later worked to distance himself from. He explained why he thought it was a nonsense to pad out techno albums with ambient tracks, which he categorically avoided on his excellent debut album, Wet Will Always Dry. We spoke at length about the physical and mental demands of touring, and how he's still trying to find some balance in his lifestyle. And he told me about the steep learning curve of making music with a modular system. An approach he's only become truly happy with over the last year or so. For my money, Roberts has achieved his aim of becoming a truly original artist, something that was probably helped by all of his honest self-reflection. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net. and follow us on Soundcloud at ra-exchange. The exchange with Blauan is up next. So you are playing at Village Underground tomorrow night. Yeah. Tomorrow night, all night. Which I understand is the first time you've done a set of this nature, like an all night set. Is that correct? Yeah, in London. Yeah. In the UK I have. I've done other stuff in Europe, but this is the first time here. Yeah. A little bit nervous about it, actually. Is it eight hours? Yeah, it's a long time, man. I mean, the last long set, I did 12 hours at Berghain, but that's a little bit different. It's like time doesn't seem to exist in that place. I feel like Village Underground is probably going to be... a little bit of a different experience, you know? Yeah, I've often wondered about that because everybody says time doesn't exist in Berghain, but why is that the case? Okay, Village Underground, you're still in a big dark room, but somehow time just slips away at Berghain. Yeah, I don't know. I think mainly the booth is a little bit more private. At Village Underground, it's open. It's like a concert space. You've got this huge stage and people seem to be staring at you constantly, whereas in Berghain it's not so much. So as a performer it becomes a little bit fatiguing almost. Yeah, I find the whole people staring at you very uncomfortable. I think I'm more nervous about that tomorrow night than anything else. The length of time is not a problem, it's just being stood there eight hours being the focus. it's not it sounds stupid because you are but have you gotten used to that a bit more since you've been doing no in fact I think it got worse a little bit really yeah I don't know I'm quite a quite a a reclusive person anyway I don't really so I find that whole aspect of the whole job a little bit difficult you know so being the centre of attention has been a bit uncomfortable totally yeah that's understandable how do you go about preparing for a set of this length I don't prepare I can't I mean, I think the only preparation I've done, apart from packing my record bags, is maybe chucking four or five potential intro tracks and outro tracks, and that's it. Oh, okay. So I usually always have a set of intro and outro because they're the most difficult ones. Because you panic. You know, you panic at the beginning and you panic at the end. So it's always good to have a set where you're like, this is guaranteed going to work. You know, it's going to work. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see. So you're definitely not going to the extent where you're planning the stages of the night or something. You're completely winging it. Yeah, I mean, when... Because usually, like, the longest sets I play... usually at Burgand because the standard one is like four hours, you know. And I've tried it in the past where I've like labeled my USB sticks. I've done folders like one, two, three, and four. And it's just like, nah. You just chuck it out the window like the first hour. It never works. So I stopped all of that, really. Yeah, that's totally fair. Are you still travelling with a bunch of records? Yeah, a lot less during the summer. And that was the first time this year. A little bit because my girlfriend said, what the hell are you doing? And that's kind of realising it's difficult because half the time you're turning up to festivals, the setup's terrible, doesn't work, it's too dusty. and the travel and it's mainly because the travel situation during the summer is a nightmare I'm living in Berlin so always taking connection flights there's no direct flights usually and like losing having 30 minutes to connect a flight means that your records don't get on the next flight so it's pointless so yeah and now the summer's nearly finished I start back up taking records again Do you like CDJs? Yeah, I don't mind them actually. I am trying to sort of like go back to just playing records, but it's a bit difficult. I think it's a bit of a pipe dream at the minute. I mean, let's not get too bogged down in this, but are you experiencing the sort of technical issues that DJ seems reporting frequently? Yeah, yeah. You are, okay. Totally, man. Yeah, I mean, half the time, I have a list of clubs I know that the records sound better than the CDJs, and that list is slowly getting smaller and smaller. I don't mind that the vinyl sounds a little bit worse than the CDJs in the club because you can combat that but the main problem is that they're not looking after the turntables and when that happens then it's impossible to play and even if you have like one or two mess ups you just your automatic your instinct is just to carry it keep on the CDJs and then I've ended up bringing two record bags with me all the way thousands of miles for nothing It's a bit difficult anyway. Yeah, I understand. These are just standard complaints. Yeah, of course. I'm sure people have taken a lot. Yeah, I'm still baffled why servicing a pair of turntables is beyond most clubs, but there we go. Let's leave it at that. I was wondering where you think you're at with your development as a DJ. How pappy and comfortable are you feeling? Pretty comfortable. but it's only been recently that it's felt like that. Yeah, I'm not sure why, actually. But, I mean, I was, in my early years, I was testing a lot of sounds, a lot of... maybe a little bit more of a heavier sound as well than I'm playing at the minute and that has various problems that comes along with that, like sometimes people are not really into it or a lot of the records are old and sound crap, so that can make sets difficult. So I think over the years I've just subconsciously filtered out the music that's difficult to play. Not obviously, I'm not saying difficult as in like it's not challenging to listen to. I just mean that's physically hard to play in a club, you know. Got it. So that's helped me a lot, actually. I've kind of like found a place where... I'm kind of picking music that I know works in a club a lot easier than I was before. I usually pick a track because I thought, oh, that's wicked, that's a wicked rhythm, without actually thinking about the whole... how it's going to sound, you know, on a big system. So you think your radar's been sharpened? Sharpened, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. What's roughly the ratio of old and new music that you play in? It's like 50-50. Is it? Yeah. I mean, I try and not play too much old stuff now. There's obviously reasons for that. It's not cool to be playing just a full set of 20-year-old techno tracks. It's like, come on. I mean, even though I would love to sometimes. So yeah, I'm trying to play a lot of my own music. because I've been a bit guilty of not doing that in the past. Why was that? Don't know. Just didn't? No idea, just didn't, you know. So, yeah, that's kind of... Yeah, that's helped me a lot as well. People want to hear that, presumably. Yeah, exactly. They come to see you. Yeah, I was thinking, you know, I remember a few years ago, I was doing sets and didn't even play a single track of my own. And then I was thinking, why? I had no idea why I wasn't doing it. Okay. I mean, are you coming across new music that's exciting to you with enough regularity? All the time, man. Feeling good about it. Yeah, yeah, really good. I mean, it's even coming from corners that I wouldn't imagine, you know, and stuff. And a lot of people, since I started the label, and I, because I never used to even have an email address online, you know. So I kind of made a new email address and put that up. And ever since then, I'm... you know I get like four or five emails a day with like pretty good tracks from people I never heard of so it's all really fresh and nice so I'm actually playing a lot of a lot of people who maybe not even had a release, you know, which is nice. Yeah, that's cool. I'd seen in the past you described your mixing style as, I don't know what you said exactly, but like fast and aggressive, let's say. Yeah. Okay, is that still the case, would you say? Yeah, a little bit. Something I've tried to tackle. But why? Yeah, because, I don't know, I would like the music to breathe a little bit, because I feel like I'm sometimes not really giving the producers the time. I mean, there's so much effort being put into a record. If you're only going to play 40 seconds of it, what's the point, you know? So, yeah. But I suppose it's in the sort of lineage of the, like, Jeff Gales, Detroit, Fast and Furious. Totally, but those... tracks were just like one bar loops for five minutes you know and so you had to do that and now it's like people are writing such more interesting structures and stuff you kind of got to let the tracks breathe a little bit so yeah that that that kind of mixing style maybe doesn't lend itself to new techno yeah that's a good point that's definitely a good point I've, there's something I've definitely observed actually. There's, I've felt like I've spoke to lots of UK DJs who've maybe come up more through the like, you know, the sound system and the things let's say and start playing in European clubs more or maybe end up in Berlin like yourself. And it's something that report a lot. I've, I've had to slow down. Yeah, totally. Yeah, because I also saw the German crowd hate it as well. Yeah, I mean, when I first started playing in Berghain, I used to get... I used to actually... People come up to me and say, can you please let the track play longer? You know? Yeah, yeah. Is it? Right, okay. Yeah, so... And that would really bother me, like, a lot. Because I... it's just a strange thing to ask a DJ to do. So I was just like, yeah, that was a while ago. So yeah, probably like those few people who said... that probably had a massive impact on my DJ status. They're essentially like, will you just calm down a little bit? Yeah, it's like basically just someone coming up, just going like, you know, just be a bit more mature about this whole thing, please. I'm here to listen to music and not just watch you frantically switch tracks. So, yeah. But I don't know, I've always thought of it as a sort of nervous energy in a way. It's nerves, man, it totally is. nerves it was sorry to interrupt did you see did you see that stingray quote where he was talking about playing back to back he was saying like i really dislike doing it because i don't know what i'm doing with myself and it's the same with like mixing quickly he's just like I need to be busy. Yeah, yeah, totally, man. I mean, I definitely know that back-to-back thing. I usually stand off to the side because it's awful. But, yeah, no, it is. It's a nervous energy. Because when I'm going up to play a gig, I never really feel nervous, you know. And I think most people's nerves translates into the way that they play the music. and I think that's what happens. Because the actual physical, like, oh, I'm really nervous about this, never really seems to appear. But when you play it, then it appears like then. Yeah, so it manifests in that way. It manifests itself in a different way. Yeah, that's interesting. Did you play in bands before you got turntables? Yeah, long times ago. I used to play in a few things. Nothing really of importance, though. I mean, it is pretty interesting. stuff but I was just basically like a rhythm section drumming kind of thing using few drum machines and stuff but oh so you sorry so you weren't playing no I was yeah I was I was and then there was one particular band where I used to use like a an ER1 like a cog ER1 in conjunction with like drumming and stuff and That was kind of like when I was like 16 or something. So that kind of was like the start of me thinking, oh, I've got this drum machine can do everything that these guys in front of me are doing. I can't just stuff this and do it on myself, you know. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Well, what was the music you were doing in bands? It was, well, the last thing I was doing, it was kind of a bit like post-punk-y, synth-y, kind of. I don't know. I hate to say Joy Division, but, you know, it was kind of this kind of The Smiths ilk, you know, kind of stuff, but a little bit more harder. Yeah. Yeah. Do you remember any of the first records you bought when you got your turntable? Presumably you learnt on turntables. Yeah, yeah. It was only records at first. Yeah. Because obviously, like, buy CDJs are too expensive. Yeah, no. I mean, it was a few different things. I was buying... When I first could afford turntables, I was buying a lot of dubstep, actually, and a lot of that kind of stuff. And then I inherited a few house records and techno records, some surgeon stuff. I got a bunch of downwards records. And I remember when I first got them, I didn't really know how to take them, you know. And then it was like, when I actually listened and listened, that's got a little bit older. and that's when I kind of understood what it was all about. Yeah, I got it, yeah. Because I was young, you know. You were in Barnsley at this time. Yeah. How did you get Downwards Records? Well, it was just through friends and that, you know. I mean, you wouldn't get them in Barnsley, you know, but I mean, Barnsley's close to cities like Leeds and stuff, so it wasn't... you know it's 20 minutes to Leeds 20 minutes to Sheffield so I mean Barnsley sounds like in the middle of nowhere but it's not it's not actually yeah not really sort of a cluster of yeah it's in the middle of it all yeah yeah with the good record shops in like Leeds yeah yeah I mean we were we were going uh oh god I can't believe I can't remember the name I have to get back to me which is crazy I was going there for years um but Simon from Dimensions you know record shop he had it for years he's still going I think next to the car exchange and that's where we were getting a lot of our records from when I was younger yeah got it so are you are you still just picking up on the bands thing are you still listening to any guitar bass music these days No, man. I'm the worst person for listening to music. I was going to ask you about your listening habits generally. There is no listening habits, man. I'm a total music recluse. I go through stages, you know, where I feel like I really need to explore music and I do it very intensely. And then if I'm travelling or if I'm busy like I am at the minute, I have very long breaks where I'm not really exploring anything new and I'm not really like listening. I mean, I don't even listen to music when I'm travelling. I have a pair of those Bose noise-cancelling headphones. There's never anything playing. It's just to cancel out the noise. It's just like... I do that, yeah, I do that a lot. It's a pretty good analogy of my personality, really. It's just like, shut the noise off and just go to sleep or chill, you know. Okay, that's fair. But do you have it almost like a project? Like, okay, I'm in the music listening zone and I'm... going to just go out and discover a bunch of things yeah yeah usually I mean it's not happened for a while to be honest but I usually just have like this urge just to find new music and then I go and I really dig for it but yeah I have to feel like I need it and at the minute I don't so when I'm in the studio I'm not the type of guy who loves his own music but i enjoy making and listening to my music and i think i don't really want to influence myself too much so i really like cutting cut it out of my diet you know yeah okay so it helps me a lot so you just focused on you just focus on my own stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah okay yeah Okay, so after the Village Underground gig, you're playing at Berghain. And yeah, presumably you're going to go straight to the airport. Straight to the club, yeah. Cool. Is this type of itinerary typical? Typical of what it's like for you at the moment? Yeah, definitely. I mean, it's always like this at Burgheim because I usually play on a Sunday evening, late afternoon, so I usually have a gig on a Saturday and obviously that means that when you land, you've got like an hour to get to the club before you play. But it's also like in other places, you know. Summer can be a bit brutal. Yeah, I mean, I wanted to just talk a bit about the lifestyle generally, I suppose. I'd read that you said that you'd had some problems with it in the past, thinking that you'd taken too many gigs. The lifestyle generally was getting you down. You got into some pretty down spots with it, some dark spots with it. I mean, how are you feeling about the whole thing at this moment in time? A little bit more positive. It's still not like totally how I would like it, you know. It's... The main thing is I do genuinely find it... quite difficult for various reasons, you know. And my problem is when I see somebody who's doing probably even more gigs than me and they seem to be taking it in their stride. And I'm like, what am I doing so wrong? I mean, I know half the reasons I'm doing it so wrong, but it's just, it's coming up to like nearly nine years now that I've been like doing this. And my mental health and my mental, my physical health, I really, it's really... taking a toll with it you know it's like I'm super I super enjoy it and I'm still really I still excited to play gigs and stuff but I'm still also trying to find a way to to not basically burn out you know and that's quite hard have you developed any coping strategies not really no I mean definitely don't stick around at the party That's a good coping mechanism because that's half the battle, really. It's so easy to do that, especially early on in your career when you're networking. When you're young, you want to meet the people who are involved in this stuff and kind of make these connections and stuff. But now I don't really feel like I need to do that anymore and that's been a big help. I mean, is that something that you speak to other DJs about a lot? I mean, it just feels increasingly like you're hearing more DJs coming out and say, well, I'm not doing this, I'm not drinking. It seems to be more of a topic of conversation at the moment. Yeah, it's a big topic, man. Yeah, because it has an effect on... Every single person who does this for a living, you know, and it's... Even though you're essentially, in quotation marks, working two days a week, three days a week, they're brutal, those two days, you know. They can be if you're not treating it with respect, you know. And, you know, like, the lack of sleep is a massive factor, like, in the whole thing, and it's something that... I think out of any aspect of the whole job, the lack of sleep is the one thing that will come to bite you on the arse in ten years' time, you know? And that's probably where I've... why I'm feeling it, because a lot of the... When you're playing three shows a week and the travel's difficult, you're getting, like... four hours sleep in two, three days, you know, and then it's just, and if you have a pre, if you have, if you're not exactly the fittest person in the world, it's like, it just hits you really hard. Yeah, no, I understand. So it's a big, it's a big topic, you know, and I'm lucky I've got a lot of friends who are very good at it, you know, so I have some, well, sorry, some friends who, who and give me good advice, you know, so. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. But have you sort of gotten used to just not sleeping? I guess I'm asking this because I remember when we did that live thing with Arthur. Yeah. And you did like a demo and then we had a talk and you hadn't slept. I was reading the Future Music interview you did and you said, yeah, I haven't slept. I'm going straight into interviews. Yeah, you know, if you just normalised it at this point. Yeah, I mean, that was like five years ago, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's still the same. That's what I mean. It's like, you know, I mean, it's cool. In no way am I complaining, you know. And definitely I've developed this thing where, like, Monday to Thursday, I'm going to bed at, like, half nine some nights, you know. And then in the weekend, I mean, I can literally go the whole weekend without a single bit of sleep. And I can function for some weird reason. So yeah, I got used to it. Okay, but here's the thing. I'm obviously fully aware of the demands that are placed on DJs and I'm sort of fully sympathetic to everything you're saying and everything that is said on this topic. But the thing I always find difficult to understand is why DJs end up taking so many gigs in the first place. Yeah, sure. Because you're obviously in contact with the agent and, you know, obviously it's in the agent's interest to be. getting you into loads of gigs but you know the DJs are agreeing to the itinerary they have the final say man yeah sure no I mean it's money thing isn't it total money thing it's greed at the end of the day there's a lot of DJs I know just greedy as you know without swearing and it's not necessary man you know if you want to do it it's cool you know but There's a few people I've seen who just burn themselves out just for the dollar. It's pretty sad, really sad. Yeah, I guess there is an aspect in this whole thing that you can control, right? Yeah, totally. That is a huge topic in itself, I think, the greed. really because it's greedy it's a greedy job man yeah I mean do you think you've been guilty of that yourself I mean I've I was at one period I was like I never do more than two gigs a week then that slipped and then I was like but you've got two DJ gigs and a live set and then I was like carting around a record bag two live bags and doing like three shows a week a couple of years ago and then I was just like no I'm not doing that no more so I and then this year I was supposed to like take every fifth weekend off But then I did the album, you know, and my agent was like, you know, we can still do it, but it might be difficult and all this stuff. And that just went out the window. So, yeah, I'm playing every weekend this year. But next year, I think it's the year where I really finally just like, nah, every fifth week off, and then that's it, yeah. That would seem to make sense. So you've been living in Berlin for a good while now, right? Yeah, no, it's been coming up to four years. Four years. Do you miss the UK at all? No. Not at all. Tell us why. I mean, for that not to sound completely retarded, you'd have to kind of know me, really. Yeah. But, you know, I lived in London for seven years and I've struggled here a lot. And then I obviously come from a place that's not so nice. Coming from a place where you just feel like you really need to get out to a place where you just didn't know what was up and down. Berlin just seems like a paradise to me. So, yeah, I'm super happy there. Yeah, sort of a middle between the two things that you described in a way. How's your German coming along? Bad question, good question. If my girlfriend wasn't sat right next to me, I'd say it was great, but it's not going so good, man. Well, look, I saw the photos in the future music feature. It looks like you got a really wicked spot out in Berlin at Funkhaus. Yeah. Are you feeling pretty good and content with how the studio is at the moment? I mean, I've seen you say in the past you're just basically spending all of your money on gear, but where are you at the moment? Yeah, I don't spend anything at the minute. It's like it's all finished, so I'm out of that for a little bit. Yeah, I'm super happy, man. I love it at Funkhouse. I mean, I'm actually really, really happy that I got a space there. It's a really beautiful place, and it just feels like you're in the middle of nowhere, and it's super peaceful. There's a new energy there now because there's like a school, there's like an art and, no, a film and music school just opened up there. So there's a lot of students, a lot of activity going on. Like there's, the 4D sound systems just moved there and like there's some really interesting stuff. um yeah it's cool man yeah it's this is part of why i really really fallen in love with berlin because just having access to this stuff so easily is just brilliant you know something maybe that's a bit difficult here yeah there's a really like nice and slightly strange atmosphere in that building yeah it's crazy yeah it's weird i can't put my finger on it but the first time i went in there i was like this is different yeah it's different man and it's because it's full of really different people you know i mean like I'm one of the few techno producers there which you would be completely surprised at. You know, when I thought that, I thought this is just full of techno producers. It's not at all. Mostly bands. A lot of, like, fashion, online fashion shops and stuff there and just random stuff. So it's a nice energy, yeah. Yeah, good. So did you pretty much know what you wanted to do when you started writing your album? Yeah and no. Yeah, I mean, the basic concept of it, like I said in other interviews, and maybe I feel like I'm repeating myself a little bit, but it was kind of, I wanted to just do something that represented. what I've been doing already, you know, not necessarily like trying to push the boat out too much. And I'm not meaning that in a negative way. You know, I got a lot, I have a lot of people saying to me, you know, like, but like, why is it just like eight bangers, you know? And it's just like, well, who says it can't be? I found it really difficult to accept why people think an album has to be a certain thing. In some ways I understand, but the whole experimenting and maybe trying to push the boundaries of your sound, I felt is something that I would be more comfortable to do in a second or a third album. This was like basically to establish what I've done already. And that's kind of, that was the concept and that's what I already wanted to do. In terms of the sound... that came later yeah I see I enjoyed I think you said this is the future music you didn't want any of these ambient noisy wishy-washy tracks that people end up skipping anyway yeah I mean yeah that's a bit can you see why producers end up doing that I don't man actually I don't know why you would do that yeah okay like You know, and these one things is like, you have like this interlude. You're going to see an album that says interlude and it's like a one minute thing of, it's like, you know, you're wasting time on that album there. Like, why don't you take that minute and add it to something else or like make a full five minute. If you want to make this one minute track and... do justice and put it on an album why not make it five four minutes you know why not make it one minute I don't and that's the kind of thing I always really wanted to stay away from and I probably will I think because I don't I'm just not into that kind of thing yeah sure I think like a piece of music is a piece of music and one minute is not long enough for a piece of music so yeah Yeah, I reviewed the album. Yeah, I thought it was great. Yeah, thank you very much, man. It's a very nice review. Yeah, yeah. I wasn't fishing for compliments. No, no. But one of the things that I felt about it was there was a very consistent feeling across the tracks. And yeah, I was really wondering how you achieved that. Well, firstly, if you'd agree with that, and secondly, if you'd agree with that. Yeah, there was a big aim of the whole thing, really, was to do that. And the consistency basically came from spending every day in the studio. instead of, like, every few days. And I've said in other interviews as well, I attempted the album before this without this, like, every day in the studio kind of thing, and it didn't work. And this was the only time where I took the whole of January and February just to do the album, and, yeah, it kind of flowed really nicely because I was in there every day, so that's basically the reason. Yeah. Yeah. So this is pretty much what you've landed on at this point. I've got to do it in a block. It has to come out. It had to because I had like 50 tracks that I'd done before and you'd think within 50 tracks you'd be able to find eight or nine tracks that kind of would work. It just didn't. It was so radically different from one another. I was like, no, I can't do it. I have to just put all that aside. and do it all in two months. And that's what happened, yeah. Well, what about from a production standpoint? Well, just with the consistency. Yeah, well, yeah, but it's basically because, I mean, I'm writing a lot of stuff on a modular. I'd make a patch, or I'd have, like, a specific routine. And then I'd make a track, I'd say, oh, that works, blah, blah, blah. Maybe I change this a little bit and I make another one. So one track after the other kind of has some elements from the track previously in it, but different, you know? Yeah. And this is where the consistency comes from. Because previously I would write a track and then if I'd have to go out of the way at the weekend, I'd just tear out all the cables, turn everything off, and then come three four days later and in a completely different mindset and you know I have this really weird thing where I can't write a track if it sounds like something i've done before like too much you know um unless it's for a specific ep so yeah it never worked that way for me it's it's interesting really because um i suppose if you create a patch it's something unique and specific to you And then within that, you can just tweak that. So it already comes from quite an original place. Totally, yeah. And then you can... Yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, all the... Like, on the album, there's no samples or anything on it. It's all purely, like, generated from my stuff, so... It would make writing an album extremely difficult if you would decide to start from scratch every single time, especially the type of set-up that I have. So, yeah, just slightly rearranging things and tweaking things in a different way was... Yeah, I'm repeating myself, but this is what led to the consistency of it. You can have two tracks that are different, but somehow sonically they're the same. Are you imagining people or places that you're writing for? Is there any sort of particular emotion you connect to the process of making music? It's a difficult one, man. I don't know. Yeah. What's in your head, I guess I'm asking. Yeah, yeah. I'm not really sure, man. I mean, it all depends on what happens. like a lot of this stuff's a fluke, you know, like it's not like I've, I've gone and like with a track before the, the night, the, the, the nine, nine free track on the, on the nutrition one, that baseline was like complete fluke. Like it was just me in a patch and I started off, I was like, Oh, that sounds nice and wide. And then I just like messed the sequence up. We've mashed it with my hand. I shouldn't really be And I mashed it up with my hand. And then I pressed play and there's this absolutely killer bass sequence coming out of it. I was like, oh shit, I've got to record this straight away. And I did it straight away. I remember recording it and pressing play and I was like, and I knew it was like, I was super happy with it and it was just a total fluke. and that's basically how stuff happens it's not totally I'm going to give myself a little bit of credit but it's I mean because it's a difficult thing working with a module you know and sometimes that happens you know you just have this moment where something so good happens you're literally even scared to touch anything and you're like oh and you have to just record it there and then and that happens a lot actually yeah um so yeah what's the learning curve been like with the modular nightmare long process yeah i mean i i started building a modular back in 2013 and it's only like 2016 17 that i really feel like i mastered it so it's a three four year learning curve yeah well why'd you stick with it? because I don't know you spent so much money yeah I spent a lot of money but it's also I was playing live with it from very early on and actually in a live situation it worked it worked well from the off you know Like there wasn't anything I didn't have any anything negative about it that made me think off stuff I'll just use 909 or whatever. So yeah, and then in the studio, it was just too much interesting stuff like to get sonically i was getting interesting stuff but wasn't really been it wasn't really able to build like interesting original sounding tracks with it that came maybe two years ago was it just practice just practice man you know like and you get to know it you get to know how it works you know because it's i mean it sounds really stupid and without getting too technical about it all but When you're working with a piece of gear like a modular as opposed to a drum machine where even the stuff like programming the volumes of each part of the music becomes a challenge, that's when you know you're really deep in something that's not simple. Turning stuff down and turning stuff up on a sampler or a drum machine is simple. It's not simple on a modular, you know. And that's just the first thing you've got to think about. So it's just like, yeah. So obviously that's why it took four years because there's a lot to learn. I was wondering how important it's been to you to develop like a distinct style or a style that's your own. I mean, I think back to pretty much everything you've done and I think it's been sort of recognisably yours. I mean, have you been striving for that? Yeah, totally. Yeah. I always try to not sound like anyone else, really. And I think I got like a lot of the, I got the Hesel Audio boys to thank for that, really. I mean, it's very much. part of like their whole ethos, I guess, is like this trying, trying not to rip on someone else basically. And yeah, so it was always a big thing for me to be as original as possible. I was trying to come up with something. I didn't put this in the record review, but I was sort of struck when I was listening to you about Catalogue that there seems to be a lot of presence in this certain frequency around the mid-range. It's sort of like a... a crunchiness or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, even thinking about your new stuff versus some of your old stuff. Does that resonate with you at all? Yeah, totally. I don't know why. It's probably my ears or whatever. Yeah, it could be, yeah. I definitely know. I mean, I've damaged my right ear now just from playing too loud and having loud headphones on. And, you know, I mean, I'm... I'm in the studio now struggling because anybody who's listening to this, who's playing in clubs regularly or going to clubs, please wear ear protection because now I'm paying for it. I've got a 40 dB cut in my right ear. 40 dB? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, it's through an infection as well. I had an infection in my ear. Okay. Yeah, it's on its way out, I think. when I'm older. So, yeah, so now, I mean, that's one thing that scares the living hell out of me. And my music's probably going to suffer for it in the future. It's all right now. Yeah. I mean, but, yeah, so. Just before we move off from the... the sort of hassle related thing um i was interested to know if you ever missed the the sort of rush of like the post dubstep dubstep days you know where basically when people's uh agenda or people's objective was to come up with the maddest shit possible stuff yeah yeah i i hated it man you hated it yeah no no no because he was like yeah i mean I said in the... I can't remember which interview it was, but it was basically like, it was this thing where you're in the studio and you are literally trying to come up with something that no one else has done that's danceable. that doesn't sound like nonsense and is only like, you know, it doesn't have to fit with what your colleague is doing, you know. It's like so much stuff to think about and it was so stressful. Yeah. And so, so stressful, man. I'm even surprised, I'm so surprised at how much music I actually put out back then because I remember it being a really... really stressful time just to even come up with like you have a blank canvas and you're like well what am I supposed to do and the only answer was well anything and I don't know if that's so good to be honest yeah it's exciting in some ways yeah but yeah I mean do you feel like scenes and sounds that are based on that idea are always likely to have a lifespan. They're always likely to implode eventually. Yeah, yeah. I think it's like a process of fragmentation, you know? Like what happened... I can only speak from my experience and what me and my friends went through is... you got a little bit of popularity from what you were doing and then you was playing in certain places, you know, and, you know, like, then you end up getting a gig at Panorama Bar, for instance. That doesn't work there. And then you're suddenly like, well, no, and then you get another club and it's like, well, this isn't really working anymore. This isn't working anymore. And then you're starting to play more techno, you're starting to play more house. And then your other, I don't know, my other friends or colleagues, whatever you call them, are doing a completely different thing, but the same process is happening to them. And then suddenly you're all going off on different paths, and that's it. That's basically what happened, you know. Do you think maybe that part of the reason things maybe smoothed out a little bit was that... the DJs who were making this music got popular, had these experiences in clubs in Europe. Yeah, that's exactly what happened. And they were like, okay, we can retain some of the identity, but we need to, this doesn't translate. We need to make it work. That's exactly, that is literally the nail on the head. That's what happened, yeah. What happened with my group of friends, you know, you're making this experimental music, experimental dance music, you could call it really. And then... you're suddenly realising that this is probably not going to work anymore and if you want to carry on doing this and earn a living from it then you need to somehow I hate to say compromise because it's not really a compromise but in some way you have to do that you have to change and yeah I mean how stressful was that change for you I loved it man to be honest I really loved it because it was I always wanted to play house and techno records anyway and just purely you know because For me, it was like a pure form of dance music that will always work. And it meant that I didn't have to stress about being completely creative, like individually, have an individual thing constantly. You can have a framework. you can get more bookings, you know, and I mean, I'm not even ashamed to say that, you know, I want to earn a living from this. Sure. So it's just like, the whole, it's like, why would I stick with this sound that's just going to like, disappear? I didn't want to disappear with it, you know, so. Do you feel like the music from that time period has aged? well do you listen back to it it's terrible it aged terribly for me it has man I know a lot of people still like love it you know and that's cool But, yeah, I don't really, I can't listen to it anymore. No, it's difficult for me. No, I know you, mate. I'm somewhere in the middle, I think. There are certain, like, tropes of it, let's say, that just feel very, very of their time. But then, you know, if you were to do a dig, I would say, you know, you could uncover some stuff and you're like, yeah, this is it. Yeah, yeah, just I mean, I actually still really like David Pearson's sounds, old stuff, man. Some of his old stuff on Hessel's just... Like, they're really minimal stuff. That, to me, is so timeless. And then, like, the stuff that I was trying to basically rip on that... that's the stuff you can be like yeah just keep it back in 2010 stick there yeah obviously pretty settled into a groove of techno making playing techno I was wondering, like, how do you keep nudging things forward? Like, how do you... I don't know. I honestly don't know what I'm going to do next, to be honest. I've been trying a few things. I started to make... I'm playing a lot faster BPMs again than I am now. I mean, I was playing at 130 for a few years, but before then I was playing 136, 7. And now I've found myself playing a lot faster now, so I'm trying to make a lot faster music in the studio. It's not really going too well, so I don't know. What was the album on average? It was like 132. I think the average was 130. It wasn't too fast. But, yeah, so at the minute I'm just writing. I'm even trying to write some 140 stuff, but I'm not really finding the groove. So back to the drawing board. Are you getting a lot of demos around that tempo? Yeah, loads of stuff. Everyone seems to be really writing a lot fast. the stuff yeah so I mean I'm cool with that you know I think tempo is just a number really do you think you ever dust off those little side projects that you did yeah I've been trying to I've been trying to man I'm trying to do another boarding on adults thing that's like actually next on my agenda Didn't you play as bourgeois and adults recently? Yeah, yeah, I did, but that was an absolute disaster. Yeah, it was a disaster, right? So I packed, like, a massive bag of house records and, like, pretty, like, odd-sounding stuff. And then I turned up to the club and they were like... I was like, oh, yeah, they were like, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing some house. And I could tell the look on their face. They were like, Anyway, so I got in the club and I found out I was opening the room downstairs because it had been going all day. And then the guys were like, you know, oh, you can play techno if you want. I was like, well, no, you booked me to play as board young adults. It was at the school, sorry. And anyway, so then I started off first half hour playing house records and quickly learned no one wanted to hear that. So I ended up playing techno for three hours. It's just terrible. Because I mean, like, you know, and no offence to the guys at the school, but I could definitely, I think it was just like an exclusivity thing. Yeah, okay. That we were dealing with in Holland. Yeah, okay, okay. That's fair enough. But you see that as the house project. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's how I try and see it. I say, oh yeah, that house record I put out on Trilogy Tips, people are like, it's not bloody house. It's like, it's techno. It is to me. Yeah, yeah. I was like, to me it's house. And then is the, is the Kona thing like weirder? Yeah, yeah. I'm actually like started the whole process of doing another record for Guy Shifted. Okay. Yeah, that's, this is all for next year. Okay. so yeah it's a bit too late now how's everything going with Karen yeah yeah that question I like the look on your face man it's not a loaded question no no no we actually just in the middle of polishing off a six track so finally cool some new music out finally I mean it's one of them things man like I think we got a little bit too comfortable in our little live project you know and There was actually even a period where we were like, you know, maybe we don't even put any music out. We were like, oh yeah, we can do that. You know, super arrogant, you know, like, cause we don't have to put any music out. We were well known enough for our improv and it was just like, yeah. And now it's come to bite us on the ass a little bit. So yeah, yeah. So we're just, we're just in the process of finish off a bigger And yeah, I mean, we're still playing a lot of shows, really. But yeah, slowed down a little bit. Yeah, okay. I mean, I'd seen you say before that there was something a little bit missing when you guys got in the studio. Yeah, he's still like that. Like you had amazing live chemistry, but you find it really tough in the studio. Yeah, he's still like that a little bit. And I think if we hadn't got the live thing... I think we would be able to write music very easily, but because we've got, like, this huge thing that we're known for, like, hanging round our necks, when we get to the studio and we're trying to be all, like, a bit experimental and weirder... We're like, hang on. It's like, I don't know if the people who really know what, listen to what we're doing in the live thing are really going to get this. So, yeah, we find it a little bit difficult. I don't really know if you shouldn't be telling people that, but it's better to be honest, really. Yeah. And that's basically what's happened over the past few years, you know. It's like, we just really struggle to find that balance between... playing live and translating that in an interesting way that's not something that just sounds like was playing live but like yeah that kind of like meets in the middle somewhere and we've not really found that do you have like sounds that you have that you will come back to during the live thing yeah yeah sometimes but we try and start fresh i mean we we we were gonna like We basically said, if we're going to put out stuff that sounds like the live set, then we just record the live set and put that stuff out. And when we decided against that, we thought... well, let's just do it separate. Let's have the records their own thing. We do it however we want in the studio. We might not even use the same stuff, you know? Okay. And then the live, and just keep it separate like this. And I think that's been a, it's been a, it's probably been our downfall, but also I think in the long run, it's going to pay off. Because like, you know. I don't know. What we essentially do in the club is a little bit simple, you know, and I don't think that's going to really translate too well onto a record. So we have to be a bit more, be a bit more, has to be a bit more substance to it, I think. Yeah, yeah, that's fair enough. What do you make of Arthur's album? Yeah, it's great, man. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I was a bit surprised when he first sent it, man I think it's great, but it's the first music he put out in a long time. And I was like, big pair of balls, man, to be honest, to do that. Especially because everyone knows him from the Karen stuff now, which is like, I was pummeling techno. to do this and to think it's a really big step and I'm super happy he's done it and like I'm you know it's cool yeah super cool man yeah I just found it not funny but you know the fact that he'd predominantly recently been known for this thing with you which couldn't be more intense and then it was almost like this is just like oh it's like reverse man but I mean if you know him I mean, you know him a little bit. That's just, it's his character on the record, man. It's like, when I listen to it, it's like listening to Arthur talking to me. So it makes more sense to me, I guess. But to people from the outside who don't know him, you'd be like, what the hell is this about? But, yeah. No, I thought it was fantastic. Yeah, it's great. I'm glad he's done it, man. I said to him so many times, you really got some balls to do that, man. Because if I was in your position, I wouldn't have. dared to do something like that you know so fair play to him do you think you'll do anything with Tony Surgeon again I hope so man yeah I mean but that kind of like he was never a forever project anyway you know Tony's kind of this guy who you know he has a very specific idea about what he wants to do so um once we felt like that kind of thing had run its course and that were it but maybe in the future man you know i think it would literally just take an email for me to go you know do you want to write some music and he'd probably say yeah but i would just say i'm a bit too nervous to do it to be honest because i because i don't want to force this kind of thing i never really ask people to do music i think it really with us you know it wasn't like wow this will this will financially this would be great you know it was like it was the right time to do it because he was teaching me yoga i was seeing him a lot you know and i was actually going around to his house quite a lot so obviously we're like all right well let's get in the studio together and that's how it happened It all came after our friendship was developing. Got it. So it wasn't like, let's do the studio, then the friendship developed after. It was just like, really, just flawed naturally. I mean, what did you learn from him? He's been in it for so long. Oh, God, man, it's endless, really. I remember there was times we'd be sat on his couch just eating boxes of dark chocolates, you know, and his cat's just running around and he'd just... be just telling me all sorts of stuff I'm not going to repeat it it's quite long as well but he just has a very interesting outlook on music and the music scene in general And an absolutely incredible CD collection. It's like a huge, huge CD collection. CD collection. Yeah, CD collection. I was laughing about that. You think you walk into his house, it's just full of records. It's like, nah. There's just like a pile on the floor. It's just all CDs. It's like, all right, cool. But yeah, so... He helped me a lot, you know. And, I mean, I've said before, you know, Tony helped me when I was very ill. I got very ill when our relationship was, like, starting. And, yeah, he kind of, like, he put a lot of energy into me, you know. And I really appreciate that, what he did, like, for me in terms of just trying to get me on track, basically. Because things were kind of a little bit going, like... off the game a little bit. No, you were out for quite a while, right? Two years, man. Two years. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Two years. Two years I didn't release any music. I released some Karen stuff and whatever and I did the odd bit of projects and here and there but in terms of the solo stuff I was like gone. In general, my relationship with Tony was vital at that time, really. Yeah. Proper. Interesting. Thank you.
