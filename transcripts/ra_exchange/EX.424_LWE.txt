Thank you. Thank you. you Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange. This is our series of conversations with the artists, labels and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. What does it take to stand out in the world's most competitive clubbing market? By now, Alice Favre, Paul Jack and Will Harold, the team behind London Warehouse Events, have a pretty good idea. Since they started working together in 2010, the trio has been responsible for some of London's biggest and most distinctive dance music parties. A large part of this success has been their impressive knack for spotting potential venues. LWE's events at Tobacco Dock, Boston Manor Park, Printworks and old Fountain Studios all basically stemmed from one of the teams seeing the space and thinking wouldn't it be cool to do a party here. These days LWE is as much about helping artisan brands realize their vision as it is about LWE realizing their own. With clients including Elro, Arcadia, InnerVisions and Richie Horton. Collectively, Alice, Paul and Will have decades of experience between them, something that was obvious when they stopped by our London office recently to discuss their work and the state of play in the London scene. As always, you can find our full archive of exchanges on residentadvisor.net and you can follow us on SoundCloud at r8-exchange. The Exchange with LWE is up next. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Thank you. So hi guys, we'll just start by introducing ourselves. Hi, I'm Alice. I'm Operations Director for LWE. I'm Will Harold. I'm one of the directors at LWE and look after the booking. I'm Paul. I'm one of the directors at LWE and I sell tickets. You're all fresh, inverted commas, from Junction 2, which took place over the weekend. How did it go, firstly? It went really well. Yeah, very, very happy with it. We sold out three weeks in advance. The hype was massive and I hope that we lived up to the hype. Certainly from behind the scenes, I was very happy and I think the authorities were too, so big tick from me. I mean, from my side, with all of the artists and the general atmosphere and sort of music played, I thought it was great. There's some real standout highlights. Sonia Minear and Nicholas Lutz in the woods was incredible. It was such a great little stage, that, and I think they really captured what we were trying to do with it. Joyo was good afterwards. Tale of Us stood out. We made the warehouse a bit bigger. And that really showed that there's a kind of an appetite for some of that harder, slightly harder techno. And that was really positive. Just the spectacle of Dixon and Arm for six hours, kind of really getting some time to do that. In a festival environment, it's often one of the things that we set out with Junction 2 to not have the typical 60-minute sets that you find in other places and to give them that time to do what they do was really nice. And I think the real cherry on top was Adam and Carl. And they had, what, five hours between them, played 90 minutes back-to-back at the end. And that was, for me, that was kind of a real career highlight and was a real moment. The energy on that floor was next level. I think anyone who's there saw something really special and heard something really special. And I think it will stay with me for a long time. You guys are quite upfront in the description of the festival about the things that wouldn't be at the festival. So I don't remember the list off the top of my head, but I remember no VIP. was definitely one of them. No short sets. Yeah, no VIP, no short sets, no plastic tents, good sound and like-minded people and attention to detail. I think it's what we try to do for all of our shows. I think sometimes people book the line-up and they're really proud of the line-up. I mean, most people are promoters. We're the exception. We're promoters, producers and operators. So other people will hire a production company and it means that you're slightly removed from what your end product is on site. Whereas we start from booking the DJs and finding the site and really follow it through right through to execution. So, yeah, I do feel like our attention to detail is higher sometimes than other people. Do you think that's where things get a little bit lost in the festival experience? That there is a bit of a disconnection between people making the bookings and then, you know, maybe I was going to use the word vision, but, you know. the production company is a separate thing and maybe, you know, it's not harmonious or something? Yeah, sometimes. I think there are other promoters out there that also do a great job. I mean, look at Houghton last year. That was a massive success. I'm sure that... You know, Craig's the one that booked it, but the people that ran it, I think it was Gotwood that were behind it. And they're similar. They're promoters and producers and operators as well. And so they're very much on the ground. But I do feel that if you book a production company, however good that production company is, they're working on 12 other shows across the summer. All of their work is condensed into those. sort of 12 to 16 weeks over the summer and it's a very hard feat to understand 16 different shows worth of detail and to really understand what they want on site. So yeah, I think we've got a unique, there's something unique about doing it from start to finish. I think as well it's enormously difficult putting on a festival in London. Let's make no bones about it and I think actually If you had the best team in the world, it's really challenging trying to, you walk such a tightrope between the product you're trying to deliver, the fan, the customer experience, the authorities, the artist experience, and where all of those things converge as a promoter, you're under an absolutely enormous amount of pressure. People complain about sound at lots of shows and of course the promoters want it to be louder. It's the restrictions of neighbours and residents and those kind of things. And in some cases, rightly so, and in other cases I think there could be a bit more flexibility. But it's a very, very difficult thing to do. I think from our side the potential issues show when shows grow. Year one was a new experience delivering the show, but actually at a far lower capacity. And so as those shows grow in popularity and you set certain expectations in year one for how the show feels, year two the show, for year one for us the show lost an immense amount of money. Year two of the show was a great show, but still really didn't deliver financially for us. This year, the show sold out in advance, delivered okay financially. We're certainly not kind of buying new boats. To be honest, we're still paying back the debt from year one. Yeah. I mean, it's like, so what, we're going to be into year four of a festival? and we won't have made a penny out of it. Was that always to be expected? Was that always in the plan? No, I think shows like ours, yeah, I mean, I think we always over-invest in production, direction, the cost, the style of the location. These are expensive things to deliver, and I think as the capacity grows, that's where the growing pains show. And for us delivering this year, for me, one of the concerns was to see what would be the difference with the extra capacity on Did the show have growing pains this year? Yes, it did. Are there growing pains that took away from the show? No, but also things that allow us to learn to realise actually, I think the show is at the size it can be. And really, it's for us to kind of adjust a few tweaks, a few changes here and there to actually... actually deliver the same experience people had with slightly less people the year before. Last year on site, it was, again, it was a perfect year again. But in terms of egress, when everybody leaves, it wasn't the simplest. So for this year, our security bill was two and a half times what it was last year. We had 168 staff externally just for the weigh-in. And for when people left, that bolstered up to 210 staff externally. I mean, that's a huge amount of people. That's a mixture of SIA security, who obviously aren't cheap, traffic marshals, stewards. And then management. I mean, the different the distances between the front gates and the stations was a total of two and a half kilometres. And we had to cover that with stewards at least every sort of 150 metres. I think it's funny with the fact we had so much staff, all the bases covered, even on the day me and Alice. discovered another street another set of alleyways another potential route where actually no one going to the show would know they're there but local kids or people that live in the area would guess that if they climbed through that bush ran across the cricket pitch they could climb across the water and get into the show and suddenly it was kind of like oh didn't think of that one And yet we thought we'd covered every way in. Yeah. And so next year, you know, that's another £5,000 worth of... What's it like in the aftermath, though? Are you able to sort of toast all of the great experiences and the good elements of it? Or are you kind of fixated on the details and the tweaks for next year? I mean, what's that balance like? Straight after the show, I mean, these two had to go to the after party. I stayed on site. with my kind of core operations team and we definitely raised a few glasses. I was absolutely buzzing after the show. I spent a long time with licensing and the police on site during the show and they both left seemingly very happy and with talks for the future. So that was great news from my side. So I was very happy. It's a big hurdle. Yeah, a massive hurdle, especially from the year before, you know, there was a few grumbles from local residents and from the police and the council. So I think, yeah, we've ticked all those boxes for this year. And yeah, very much looking forward to next year. But I think from a... afterwards I think the next day afterwards you're on a massive high then you start reading the comments online and there's they're all generally really positive and I think people have trust in us as promoters the things that weren't perfect we will strive to fix next year we're not the sort of people just go oh well it doesn't matter we can make a bit more money I think it's hard to get excited on the day of the show I think the show, you see very little of it, really. I think you spend most of your time from our side going from stage to stage, talking to people, never really spending enough there to kind of absorb what the show is, but knowing it. Post-show, the next few hours or the next day, really, you get to reflect on the comments. You get the feedback from people. You start reflecting on your own thoughts from it a bit more. And it kind of sinks in that, actually, it was a successful show. And we kind of went out there and achieved what we wanted to. I was stood with one particular agent or manager on one of the stages. And I'd been with him for about five minutes. And I was like, I'm sorry, I've And I said, well, everything's fine here. So basically I just continue my roaming from stage to stage and just trying to look for anything that isn't fine. And if everything's good and everyone's enjoying themselves, I tend to move on. So it's kind of I spent, I walked the best part of 40 kilometers on the day and just kind of, yeah, I find it really hard to stay still. And if everything's good and the music's good and everyone's having a good time, generally I'm moving on. again comes back to the the fact that we're we're quite operationally focused and and all involved in that and and just i think all of us are just you know want to make sure that you can spot those things early if there's something not right you can tweak it and change it and and make a difference Yeah, I think you spend your show circling from stage to stage, like Will says. Really, you're never really spending too long there because the conversations you get pulled into, your brain is really thinking what's happening down the road or what's happening on that stage or is that okay? Or you're kind of going off to meet someone and sort something out. And the reality is you are constantly moving. I certainly had painful feet afterwards. talk me through the process of firstly finding the site and identifying it as a you know as a potential uh venue for a festival and then the bit afterwards like what's the process who do you speak to what are the steps that need to be taken to getting something like this off the ground this was as random as we we'd been looking loosely looking for a festival site for uh couple of years at least I would have thought and I think we'd committed that we'd always done things a little bit differently or we'd always felt that we'd done things a little bit differently to other promoters in London and we didn't want to enter a market which was already crowded and have a kind of another event which where you're just fighting over talent and there's not a point of difference and so that's why our hunt had gone on for for a little while and alice and i were driving down the m4 back towards dorset and we could went over the flyover towards the glaxosmith klein building and we see the treetops and some greenery and it was simple as just going hmm, what's down there? Dropping a pin. And I think they're new to it. You guys went back without me to go and investigate. I used to live there very near it. So my daughter had a third birthday party in the park. For me, I grew up in the area, so I used to cycle underneath that bridge with quite a few of my friends. I used to think it was a fairly decent place for an event. It didn't really actually cross my mind it was viable because in reality I know how residential it is. But, I mean, it is. Unbelievably so. I mean, I think that's what it is. It still boggles me as you walk into the site. walk past all the houses, walk through the gate. It is unbelievably residential. So how do you go about convincing the necessary people that... it will be okay. What does that look like? They never had a festival on site in that borough, in that location. Oh, no, they had, didn't they? Because didn't they have the... No, they didn't have a barbecue at Brightfest. They had like a charity event. They had an Australian barbecue in there. But what they didn't have was an electronic music event. So the reality of us approaching them was they really didn't know what they were signing up to. So there wasn't a precursor for us to work against. It's easy almost to kind of go in there and say, this is what we're proposing. This is our experience. Yeah, I mean also when the first thing you do is you look at the site and yes it is residential around there but once you walk in the gates and you walk under the M4 the other side of the site is one side of the GlaxoSmithKline building and the other side is a massive cement works and skies. huge kind of studios and offices, their HQ. So you've got like maybe a 360 degree circle. You've maybe got... 210 degrees that have got no residents around. So all your sound fires that way. I mean, the nearest residents are really, really close, but just the M4 blocks out all of that sound. And the sound underneath the bridge as well is obviously contained by the top of the bridge. But then as you get to the end of the bridge. it goes up a hill, so all the sound hits that hill and then goes up into the M4 again. So from a sound point of view, it's perfect. The only thing was year two. It was the first year that we had the HEX, the outdoor stage which Sonos hosted. And we had 50 mile an hour winds that were heading towards Ealing. So that caused quite a few complaints last year. And luckily we had no wind this year, so it was OK. And we reorientated the stage. So even if it had been windy, I think we would have been OK. Do we need to think about whether Paul's allowed to say the council didn't know what they signed themselves up for in that edit? The council had no idea what we were going to do. So with all of these venues you've used since the time you've been working together, there's no set process as such. These are places you're kind of hearing about or stumbling across. It's evolved, I think, a little bit. I mean, to start with, it was either hearing about or stumbling across that kind of thing. And now at the moment, we've got someone in the office who's, I would say, 60, 70 percent of their role is. just constantly hunting for new space, whether that's outdoor or warehouse locations or whatever. So how did like old fountain studios? That came from them. There's a lot of hunting and through a recommendation through someone that we'd worked with up near that site before. introduced us and uh yeah we'd actually seen the site previously and it wasn't available and then they put us in touch with the people who'd taken it on so yeah that was great to do some shows up there i thought the sound was amazing and uh and i thought we hope going to go back and do a few more there is there is definitely a certain element of stumbling across and being lucky to be honest with these sites i mean it's about tobacco doc was no more no more found but uh for me and alice walking past it sticking our head through the gates and thinking wow that would be a great great place to an event and then trying to kind of work out who we need to speak to how do we find work out the possibilities making a show happen in there Like Will said, spotting Junction 2, crossing over to the top of the motorway. We see pictures, look at maps, and if something jumps out, then we kind of try and go and explore it. So around the time Printworks was opening, I felt like there was a lot of talk within the London club community about the fact that this was coming at sort of not a moment too soon. People were really holding it up as this really significant new thing for London and it was sort of much needed. Why do you think people were saying that? What were people crying out for at that moment in time? There'd been a lot of sort of public closures or ends of eras. I think, obviously, Fabric was in the middle of its licensing issues, which have thankfully been resolved. There was... I can't remember the other place. It was just up here. Passing Clouds. That was all going on. And there was a lot of sort of hype in the media about... Clubs closing, clubbing dying, the usual sort of scaremongering. And I think this came along and was, I think there'd been other sort of big new ventures that maybe hadn't quite hit the mark. And I think this came along and ticked a lot of boxes and people were really excited by it. But I think a lot of it was just the state of the media at that point. Do you think that it was overblown, the reporting of the state of the scene around that time? I think It was definitely, the press fairly enjoyed scaremongering kind of what is happening with licensing. I think, to be blunt about it, there was a certain element of strategically taking what was going on out there. and converting into something that allowed us to launch a space because it allowed us to take bad news and offer good news in that space. And strategically, being in a building that was a press associate, building a print factory, adding that story into a bad licensing and launching the biggest license in London, suddenly you had... something that became incredibly press-worthy and by teasing teasing out the existence or the promise of this space it creates a lot of natural hype i mean i think we spent a good three four months prior to the launch which was inviting key press down inviting people down to see it allowing people to have kind of snippets of the building in mind before it got released so there was almost The story of that building came ahead of the announcement. And so it certainly helped it. Yeah, the seeds were sown for it. I guess it's been, I forget how long since you were, since you last threw an event there. But like, how do you reflect on the seasons that you did though? I mean, the last ever show thrown in there was the... the 1st of January 2018. I mean, that was the last show under our stewardship, really. From my point of view, it's something that I'm enormously proud of. I think that as a team, we created something really special. And I think with the two seasons that we did, it was something that was, again, a real highlight. And yeah, I think... quite happy to have done that moved on and looking for looking for new pastures did you have any personal highlights i think just any any standout shows i think seeing the first one personally for me kind of watching it watching it happen and start was a mixture of will it work with is it as exciting to to us as it is to other people okay um i think being there to establish it, put it on the map and kind of bring something unique to London to us is what's exciting. I mean, bizarrely, as a promoter, I find it exciting doing new things. And I do have to say, after the 20th show there and a consecutive week from my perspective, it was less and less exciting. But if I'd seen it... Individually, it was just as exciting. So I'm more inclined by less shows and split across alternative locations rather than in one building. Did you wind up in some sort of creative differences? Anyway, I didn't quite know what the story was. It created differences now, I'd say strategic differences due to a change of ownership and the politics behind the building. It meant for us what was offered wasn't why we stayed or didn't want to stay. Yeah, I think operationally it was a massive feat for us. It took up all of our full-time staff's, you know, most of their time. It was an extremely time-consuming project for everybody. Yeah, I just feel like going forward, they had a diff, they wanted to take a different pathway. Not necessarily, yeah, slightly creatively, slightly operationally. It just, yeah, it just didn't feel right to stay there. We very much run our business based on our heart rather than what our, yes, rather than anything else. And so it was better to part company at the time that we did. Would you say that there are any challenges in throwing large-scale events that are particular to London? I was thinking when you were talking about the exit, for example, from Junction 2 and, you know, you're thinking about the flow of people, you're thinking about people getting into the transport network. Does London come with a particular set of challenges, would you say? Yeah, definitely. But that's also why, I mean, if you think about it as LWE, we haven't... We haven't thrown a party in a unique space, i.e. not a club, that's been night time since, oh, I don't know, 2015? Last time we did... Apart from this Saturday. What's happening this Saturday? Well, last Saturday, Fabric. No, it's in a club. That's what I mean, in a club. We've done stuff in clubs that's late night, but everything that we do in unique spaces is daytime. That was partly a realisation, though, of the laws around sound and the density of population. So if you've got a big building... you're going to be surrounded by some houses quite nearby. And you can get away with that at a 500, 1,000-cap warehouse party because the power for the sound that you need is a bit lower and you can not annoy the neighbours too much or they can be a little bit further away and people are leaving. But as you get up to 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 people, you need, obviously, there's much more impact on the local environment and that's just harder and harder found Tobacco Dock was that this was never going to be a late night space. And so for us, I think that's one of the things that I'm quite kind of proud of. I feel like we're a big part of that shift to daytime parties. When we did New Year's Day, it was the first party we did in the tobacco dock, and that traditionally could be a daytime party. And then we did one in the summer, and that worked really well as well. And then the third one we did was Drum Code Halloween, and for us that was the sort of... It was the shift. That was the shift. And we were like, right, if we can make a techno Halloween show work in the daytime, we've got this and we've done it. And that was it. And it worked amazingly. And that's become one of our flagship shows. And I think that for us, that's when we realised actually we could hopefully sort of shift a little bit of the culture and a little bit of the pattern. And there was loads of other benefits in terms of... it became a little bit easier to book DJs. It meant that our relationship with other venues in London weren't as strained because we weren't going up quite as head-to-head with the other venues in London because we were in the daytime. And actually, in some ways, actually we were feeding some of the late-night economy because people were going out, then they were out, they wanted to stay out. Yeah, more DJs being available because they could double up to shows in Europe. So it was kind of win-win. Yeah, the neighbours are happy, the authorities are happy. It feels a little less edgy during the day in some ways. Yeah, I was going to say, do you think there's a different dynamic for the crowd during the day? People turn up vaguely sober. So it means you, yeah, and it, you know, a nightclub, you know, it's just a different environment doing something that carries on until 7, 8 in the morning, 6, 7, 8 in the morning. It's just been a different atmosphere. It's very festival vibes during the day, even if it's January or February. I think kind of without realising it also helped to... widen the amount of people who are going out once again. I think inadvertently it's where events are running from 10, 12, 11 o'clock at night or 6 a.m. I think you get to a certain age group and the reality is you're not staying out to those hours and you still want to see the artist, you still want to be in the environment, but actually you've got kids, you've got everything else. And when realising kind of doing stuff like Tobacco Doc and Printworks, the age range is quite varied. By being daytime, I think there are parts of our scene which are shrinking. I think there is an element of it that is getting smaller. By adding the daytime element to it, I think it's once again kind of added more people to it. There's more people going out. It's actually made it a stronger scene. So you feel like maybe there are less new people coming into the scene? Is that what you mean by that? I don't think there is as many people coming into going out as they used to for regular club shows. Right. Yeah, I think we've seen a shift from regular club shows to special events, and I think all of that's linked into a much wider sort of sociological kind of thing. everything from social media to iPhones and how people plan their time and what music people are into. And I think that what's really interesting in talking to some of the kind of like the, I don't know, some of the younger people in our office that are coming in is that some of them see sort of raving in inverted commas as the activity. And it's not, and they'll go to a drum and bass party, they go to a grind party, they go to a techno party. Whereas I think when I was sort of starting out and I was very much into one sound and my taste might have changed over a period, but a lot of these people see sort of, yeah, raving as going out and an activity they do at the weekend. So despite maybe the idea that there are less people coming into the scene, do you think the marketplace in turn sort of remains about the same competitive level? Or does it feel like there are more parties being put on year and year? I mean, from the outside looking in, London seems like an extremely competitive market. It's the hardest for me, booking talent-wise. It's the hardest it's ever been and the most competitive it's ever been. And the kind of the lengths you go to to secure the right talent on the right dates and it is more and more difficult feet every year. And I think what's interesting is how far ahead that we're having to book now. And we're talking about events right through 2019 already. And that kind of six to nine month booking window of a booking head is really pushed on. I feel like it's that maybe to clarify that, I feel like it's a... festival thing though as opposed to a club thing that it's not really the clubs that are fighting is it more that it's because there's only the same amount of clubs as when we were younger in London I think the festivals have played a big impact has a big impact on that And that kind of, I mean, talking to the guys at Fabric or whatever, that kind of removing from, I don't know, the start of May till the end of August and all the exclusivity that comes out, that has a knock-on effect for the clubs for sure. But I think there's also part of that culture where some of our events obviously got bigger and when shows were partied bigger. It's on sale longer. There's a longer lead time. There's a greater call for exclusivity. So, yeah, and I think that's something in some ways that's not a bad thing, because I think there's definitely some some artists that are totally overplaying this market. And I think that's that's one of the other hard things that we've had to start finding a balance on is is kind of you realize some for some some some DJs, you can see them. They've got a show on sale all the There's no period when you can't buy a ticket to see X artist kind of thing. And that has a big impact as well. I mean, do you think there's an antidote to what we're talking about? Or do you think that it would just be a case of the market forces will naturally dictate that some promoters will? fall off exactly that I mean I think one of the things that I I always find difficult is the people being blunt they kind of play at being promoter maybe their people have got they've got another job that pays them quite well and they decide they want to put a party on for a thousand people for some of their friends and commercially it makes no sense whatsoever and it that they they want to book ex-DJ that's their favorite DJ and so if they want to pay twice the going rate because that's who they want to book on that day and that that that has an impact on the market definitely and and it's something that that kind of I think makes sort of people who are promoters for a living it it definitely it definitely kind of winds me up because it's uh it it has an impact on on what we're doing and then It's very hard to go backwards from a DJ feed. They never come back down, do they? I don't necessarily think that it's the people playing DJ promoter either. It's just people trying to buy their way into the market. That's true as well. Because there aren't, I don't see that there aren't that many people playing at being promoters anymore. I more feel that the people pushing up DJ prices is because it's, this is why we attempt to find venues that have a USP because then you know that people want to come and play for you rather than it being about who can spend the most money to get said act. So you're saying, look, sorry, this is all that this venue can afford. And if you really want to come and play here, that's the maximum fee that we can allow. Whereas if you've got two generic clubs that are the same, or not generic, but two clubs that are the same size. Or two promoters in the same space. Yeah. Competing for the same talent, which is often the case as well. Yeah. And then it's just about who's got a bigger wallet, basically. And that's not good for the scene at all. I think we've kind of, obviously, the mass growth for social media but I think it has made the world a much smaller place and the It's kind of good but also I think slightly depressing to be honest. Whatever country you go to and whatever place you go, you have a very similar roster of artists playing. It's the same 20 acts isn't it? It's the same 20 acts that everyone's scrapping over and unfortunately the ones underneath that aren't necessarily... It's the hype acts at that moment or the really established ones anyway. It's not London that's necessarily pushing up the price itself. is people being paid in Europe, Germany, US is reflecting around us and they can go I'm being paid X amount here then you're going to pay the same amount of money. Yeah, sure. Yeah, the global market's definitely been a fact in terms of taking tying up DJ dates as well in the same way as we're talking about. I went on holiday to New York or wherever we went together basically and you looked at a poster basically and you just went Oh, wow. I mean, this is exactly the same as a party I see in London. There's no difference to it. Do you think it's the case that there's a relatively small pool of headliners? Yes. Again, a number of reasons, and I think, again, the kind of social media currency of those acts, and the hype spreads much faster. I see. And I think part of it is that the younger generation have quite a short attention span, and someone can be really hot for six, nine months, and then it dips away again. But I don't know. There's a lot of different factors involved in that. I think people are... People get caught up in the flow of things, is the reality of it. So if you look at someone playing big shows in Germany or wherever, or Berlin, or wherever it is, basically, they'll go... Suddenly a promoter goes in another country, goes, well, that artist is big, so I'm going to book them. And it has a natural chain reaction. Suddenly each place does the same thing because in each country you've got a different audience who's looking at another play's video and just going, oh, wow, that's the headline act. And suddenly that world gets smaller and smaller. And because people are so desperate to sell tickets and they're not willing to take risks, the reality is these... acts that they experiment in other places aren't getting a look in because it's a safer bet to pay more money to buy a bigger artist. So that's really true. And I think that's one of the things that's kind of hard about being a promoter is that sometimes there's people you'd really like to book because of what you're into, what they're doing musically. But if that doesn't translate or what you've got to try and do is then bring these acts through. and put them, you see what a big artist is going to sell the tickets, then you put someone else that you're really into that's not going to sell any tickets underneath them and hopefully try and sort of blood them and build their audience. But it's really hard. And often what you do is you do that three or four times, you build up an actor to a certain level and then everyone starts booking and a few goes through the roof and it's kind of pointless anyway. So all that investment and time kind of trying to build I wanted to think a little bit about the model you sort of established, which seemed to be almost immediate when you're doing the parties at Great Suffolk Street. So we touched on the idea that you are more than like a standard promoter. I guess we could say, you know, you get into it. Elements of production, you're very hands-on in what you're doing. You're producing shows for other labels and brands. I was wondering what was behind that decision firstly, and was there anything in your individual personal histories that led to that decision? I think the idea of LWE was that it was a kind of... Almost that we didn't quite have a music policy. And in some ways, actually, what we stood for was some of the things we talked about earlier. is that this kind of production, attention to detail, interesting spaces, the fact we did everything ourselves and some of it was working with people where they had established brands and that really worked for us. Since we've developed some of our own, but we still work with other people's brands and I think that's a really nice way to do it. And from my side, I'd come from a background of always booking a club. and so I'd always had the same four walls to book every week. So for me, the excitement of kind of working out what party you wanted to do and then finding exactly the right home for it. or the other way around is sort of working out what's going to work really well in this different space. That was a really exciting proposition for me, rather than just having to book the same club week in, week out. So I think that those things all came together from my perspective. I mean, I think there was, I mean, the birth of LWE, there was certainly an accidental right time, right place kind of element to it. as as kind of matter uh or matter matter basically kind of went under uh the reality was there was there were shows that needed homes uh and they fell into to us using spaces which were available at the time which is a warehouse environment and the the warehouse environment excited us but seeing as it worked it definitely created excitement of doing something unique in those kind of spaces, which led us on to doing more shows. I don't really think there was, at that initial point in time, was a real master plan of us kind of throwing a vast series of warehouse shows. It just worked. I felt like we... Which we were so strategic. We certainly were. Exactly. We... Yeah, I definitely don't think it was strategic. But it was probably about two years in that we went, oh, do you know what? I think that we're like a hallmark. We're like the facilitators for other brands. We never really put ourselves front and centre. You go to other people's parties and they're the promoter looking cool on stage and dancing with the DJs. I'm usually like unblocking a toilet or moving barriers somewhere. I am the least cool person at my party. the worst clothes and with my hair in a mess and dirt under my fingernails there's nothing cool and I mean you two are the same there's definitely nothing cool about either of you two I think kind of by we were lucky also or kind of right time right place from the point of view that actually at the time as we're doing this artists started out venues used to dominate the scene. That was the reality of it. It was a fabric show, it was a matter show, it was a ministry of sound show. It was dominated by this. That power slowly dwindled in Clubland, really, and started moving very much to the artist and the label itself. And so where we dropped in was suddenly by accident almost provided a very blank canvas environment for where it wasn't about the venue, it wasn't about the promoter, it was literally about the artist and the brand that came with it. It allowed us to provide something they hadn't been offered before. And we, I mean, all of the flyers, if you look back all of our flyers, our logo is the smallest thing on any flyer. You know, it definitely wasn't putting ourselves front and centre. It was more that ours was a little... like kite mark, hallmark at the bottom just to say this is produced by us so you know that by and large it will be a smoothly run event and you know that you know what you're going to have and yeah it was definitely about two years in that we suddenly realised that also the other thing is I find that If you start a brand, that brand's probably got a shelf life of about 10 years. That's kind of what we've seen with most brands. After about 10 years, you probably should shelve that brand and start something new. Whereas doing what we do, we don't have that shelf life. We can just move on to the next. brand or the next artist and we still continue. Has there never been that temptation though to sort of grow yourselves in the way that you are more in the spotlight? No. To make that sort of slightly more egotistical move I guess you'd say? I think the only temptation from my side and I think we've pushed it is for for there to be an acknowledgement of lwe being the brand behind these shows i think almost entering as a hub and a kind of a central part for it which drives and helps give people confidence and so we still do that and push lw to the forefront for a handful of shows you know new year's day there's a handful every so often that we do it and that's really just to for people to understand where it's coming from and to have that audience loyalty, that it isn't purely just a brand or the artist delivering that show, but that's more from the respect of it being good for us and easier for us to deliver those shows because people trust it rather than any need for us to have a new acknowledgement. for it yeah i guess i wanted to think about the sort of nature of throwing uh events in big spaces generally um i was just kind of thinking alice from a logistical standpoint so you've got sometimes tens of thousands of people would your events get that big Would it be up to tens of thousands? Festivals, yes. Yeah, the festivals, yeah. Nothing in venues. Yeah. So when you're thinking about elements like crowd control and security and just the general flow of people, does this thing come down somewhat to a process of trial and error? Like, how... How does that work on the ground? No, I mean, yes, there's always an element of trial and error. But generally, it's thought out from the start. I mean, I think one thing for us is that there's two things that I love, a sign and a one-way system. Those are my two favourite things. Put yourself in the psychology of your out. on a night out you're drunk you're not really thinking about where you're going you just want to get into the room to see whichever DJ you want to see and you just need to put yourself in that mindset try and never make people walk into each other that's why a one-way system is good because that just creates aggro and salmon swimming upstream exactly And signpost everything. Yeah. And I think sometimes there's things that people, you know, people look at the fact that sometimes we use tokens at our shows. They don't love that. But sometimes it's a necessity. Sometimes we have to make things a bit boring. But in the end, people do see the benefits of it. Why do you need to use tokens? What's usually the logistical reason? It's to do with cash management, really, and speed of service at the bars. So if you hand over a token, you are handing over something that is a complete transaction. You don't have to wait for any change. So that bartender is only serving you once rather than serving you, turning around, going to the till, and then coming back and giving you your change. And also from a cash management point of view, when you've got 180 bar staff on site, that's 180 people holding your money. Whereas if you sell tokens, that's only 30 people holding your money. Sure. And you can hire those people directly. It's just safer, easier for insurance, all those kind of things. And actually, I think we've proved... through the trials we did at Printworks that actually you might have to queue once more at the start to buy your tokens, but the speed of service at the bar is actually a lot faster with tokens than the other way. And we've also tried all of the RFIDs and all those kind of different things as well. And unfortunately, so far out of everything we've tried, and we're quite hungry to look at these different opportunities and find better ways of doing it, but nothing at the moment beats that. for us and it's it's a difficult wrangle sometimes in terms of the um you can see that some people sort of don't mind it some people definitely don't like it and it's but it's dead and there but there isn't an easy answer to it so it's uh it's one of the things that if you're if you're in a sort of transitory spaces that and you've got a large volume of people coming in to handle money it's kind of sometimes you've just got to be practical. It's also the solution that will never break so I would really like we've talked a lot recently about going to contactless payment or cards only But then what do you do if the whole network goes down? Nobody can pay for anything. It happened at field day. Yeah, so it's a very difficult one to do. Yes, technology is brilliant at the moment, but it's just not quite there. There are certain things as well that the RFID really works if you've got a camping festival. But on a one-day show, it's just so much admin for a person to go through to be able to turn up. get their wristband loaded up with money. Then when they leave, they have to try and get a refund. Maybe it's an after show thing. It's just, it's a lot of volume of information. I mean, like the other thing that we tried at Arcadia recently was reusable cups. You know, it's another thing. It's another. Yeah, the waste. Yeah, we'd love to not be using plastic cups at our shows. But what we found when we used the reusable cups, again, it's just too much information for a 10-hour show where people are just turning up. They want to have a good time. They don't want to think about whether they've got to hold on to their cup. you know, it kind of worked. But we found out that 33,000 reusable cups ended up in landfill. So it's like, you know, from the public's point of view, they think it looks great. But actually from behind the scenes, when you're really looking at the statistics, it doesn't necessarily work. And I think it's quite hard operationally with a lot of what we do is that to people online. They just see the bare bones of what we're saying. And actually, there's been so much research that's gone into something. And they don't necessarily understand the reasons why we've chosen the final route that we have. And yeah, so back to the kind of trial and error thing. Sometimes we have to go through a few trials. And sometimes there's a few errors. And then you realize that. Sometimes if it isn't broke, stick with what you know. Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, what do you think on balance is the most difficult thing about throwing an event in a space, in the spaces like you do? Yeah, I think those decisions operationally are really complex where there is no right answer. There's quite a few things that we've talked about, payment systems. cups, waste disposal, queuing times, number of staff, none of those things are 100% predictable. And on the face of it, it might look to the public, it might look like a simple decision, but actually there's many months that has gone into planning a certain decision. Also, sometimes finance comes into it. You know, I would love to be able to allow everybody just to have free drinking water all the time. be bust if that's what we did i think the space the spaces we use are because they're unusual locations that's exactly kind of the clue really is these things haven't been built to be venues they are they are spaces we're taking which weren't designed to be holding music events we we've kind of repurposed them almost and actually by repurposing them the costs are high the the the management of these spaces is a lot more difficult. I think, unfortunately, we live in a world where people do still kind of look at promoters and think there's some kind of fairly kind of clandestine reason for us doing something or slightly dishonest about it because it seems to have carried over. That is the thought. People kind of seem to be very quick to blame the promoter for something. they will kind of put the aspersion out there when you give the explanation to them, and it is the genuine explanation. They still don't quite want to digest the genuine explanation. I mean, it's a lot easier to explain how something works operationally when the building has been... planned and built to that kind of way but the way we do it you can't and there has to be reasons for it it was will's phrase that you said uh on another interview where you said uh never become a promoter you're the first person to get blamed and the last person to get paid And how about from the sound perspective? I mean, I guess we've touched on that a little bit. I mean, what's the approach on you guys' side? I assume, given the range of venues you're using, that everyone just has to be completely different. Would that be accurate? I mean, the set-up sound is different in every space we do. It's different in the spaces, different in the rooms in the individual spaces themselves. I mean, they all come back with different demands. I mean, for instance, the main room of a tobacco dock is what is a 16th century or whatever it is, kind of tobacco building, basically, which has a glass roof. So obviously has with neighbours just on the outside of it. So the management of creating decent sound there is a very different problem to sound in the car park or sound at Junction 2 or any other of the spaces we look at. Yeah, and over the years we've tried lots of different sound systems and we've just heard, well, we're always hearing about new things we want to try and it's just about trying to constantly get the best out of it and I think some of it comes down to... some of our preferences and the actual space where the residents are and all that kind of stuff as well. Technology is always naturally evolving, so we're constantly exploring what's better. That's a really good point. It's totally subjective. I saw one complaint from one of the stages at Junction 2. last year that said it was a bit too loud and it was too bassy and then someone else about three comments down said it was the best sound he'd ever heard and I think that sort of summarised it perfectly. I guess it's quite an easy thing to throw out there isn't it? Bad sound you know it's kind of a classic on 9.1. About time you should get yourself some function one speakers. Yeah, alright. Delete. Just fix everything. To be honest, I mean, I don't think their opinion is less valid than anybody else's. I mean, like what says it's subjective, you know. For one person what sounds fantastic may sound terrible to the next person. It's quite hard to have an answer for all. 100%. produced an event at Olympic Park last month. You've got a couple more coming up with Elro. He's also doing the Inner Vision show at the Royal Albert Hall in September. Yeah. Richard Horton at the Roundhouse. Richard Horton at the Roundhouse. Yeah. Max Cooper at Coco. Yeah. Max Cooper at Coco. So given the sort of size, you know, the scale and visibility of these shows, are you guys at all concerned that it's going to be difficult to continually like better yourselves? I don't think it's a competition for us to better ourselves. I think it's about delivering exciting content in different environments. I think, for me, one of the concerns at Printworks was, and one of the reasons that kind of powered our leaving, was the idea of doing so many shows in one space and actually kind of using alternative locations like the Royal Albert Hall, the Roundhouse, Tobacco Dock. fountain studios it allows us to to put on shows that feel look and are all different really it's just a bit it's exciting and allows us then to to to effectively not starve not not kind of oversaturate the market i guess or to kind of cannibalize our own ticket sales and i think we touched on earlier just about those things being exciting and i think that um Yeah, booking different spaces is always exciting. Hunting for new venues is always exciting. The idea of putting on an electronic music show in the Royal Albert Hall, I think there's certainly part of it, I mean, I think for all three of us, where's that? There's the... fuck, do you think we can do that? Which is really exciting. And I remember feeling that as the first time I walked into Junction 2, the main bridge stage is on an island and we had to build three bridges in order to make that viable. And it's just that kind of, this is amazing, can we make it work? And I think that's a lot of what drives us. And so as long as we can keep finding new challenges, then I don't think there's any worry about trying to surpass ourselves. Bye.
