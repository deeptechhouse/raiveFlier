- Eyes right. ♪ ♪ Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Rothlein, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Optimo member JD Twitch once called Belgium's club scene a forgotten part of dance music history. He was referring specifically to New Beat, a chugging blend of new wave, acid, and EBM that electrified Belgian clubs throughout the 80s and set the stage for 90s rave. A key figure in this sound was Romarone, a prolific artist who made reams of club hits and dozens of different projects. Fantasia, Miss Nude, Armani, Mr. White, and many others. Though he never considered his music new beat, Romarone's records embodied that era of Belgian dance music. and anticipated the rave explosion that was about to come. Now, some 25 years later, Romeroan is in the spotlight again thanks to Collected #1, a two-disc compilation of his club tracks. Earlier this month, he stopped by our office to tell Will Lynch about the old days and what he's been up to since. ♪ ♪ It seems that 1988 and 1990. You had a very productive period. Yeah. Why is that? Why? Because it came from also a very productive period, but in a whole other market. But a whole market that fell down like a carthouse. It was a bit after you had the Deutsche Welle, with groups like Gruppenbild and what was it? some names of them, Icebeer, Icebeer, all this. And then after you had a sort of Belgium success wave. It began a bit with the punk and then became new wave and it was a very explosive scene also with very much groups, very much gigs everywhere in the country. People liked it very much, festivals, but like everything it has a beginning and an end and the end came near, let's say, We began to see the beginning of the end around 86, 87. And what was changing, we saw it, but we were like tourists. We saw it happen. You're there with your group. with three lorries. One lorry with your equipment, a lorry with sound equipment, and then another lorry with light systems. You do it. For years it was always fantastic. You had a full house and then suddenly they came. 60 persons, 70 persons, 50 persons. And one of the other organisators fell down, the groups fell down, split it up. But there you are as a musician and you have invested in much things. very much musical ideas, you want to do something with it. And our record company who saw the thing a bit changing and they also didn't want to stop. And they were better informed than the musicians. They heard from, we are trying, we do our best, and our records don't sell nearly nothing. And this one, only instrumental things, basic, basic things. It sells, it sells, it goes in other country. And they let us listen to these things. Maybe why not? Because at the end of all the successful Belgian groups, they made a sort of experimental B-side. And we began to feel that the experimental B-side with Dub and all in it had more success than the A-side because it was more in clubs. And I think it was not such a big... change for us it was a bit the same spirit of of making music but yeah a whole a whole trench of the thing you let away lyrics no we're gonna let in bit down the lyrics we take a little sample or something it's enough to have an atmosphere and so we began to make in the idea fund we began to make sort of from i speak for myself in fact a sort of experimental dub directly and then you have a bit the hazard also of the slowing down the tempos of all also because of the reason of the dub slowing down the tempo makes that your sounds are very deep and a deep sound needs time. Quick music, you cannot do sound very deep. The bass needs time to sound. This whole coincidence and the record company who sustained it made it very interesting for us to work. So basically, it was partly on the advice of... your record label. So they basically told you, try dropping the lyrics, try making it more club, club tailored. also ourselves because we began also to amuse us with these other versions from our normal tracks in the beginning. My group was rather successful. It was called Two Belgians, Twee Belgen. We had also some discotheque hits and also there was a dub version from this also and a sort of instrumental version that also worked very good in discotheques. For this, it was already a little bit in our mind, not alone in Belgium, when you saw groups like Depeche Mode and they all began to put on their maxis longer versions of their single, instrumental versions on it, especially for the clubs. And I think... When we saw the radio is not following us, all the latest records, all these groups were made in their own genre, didn't pass the radio, and then for who are doing it, discotheques don't do it and the radio doesn't do it also. So it may be better to jump a bit on this train. for a period to try it out. And I think in trying it out, I think we found some new things, in fact, some things that we didn't expect even. I think nobody in the beginning took it too serious, but it came a bit as a hazard over us. Everybody, ciao, what's happening? happening here and also the the groups were replaced by this all these gigs that we played before a gig replaced by one dj with one dj he filled he filled the whole house with with very special for us unknown music or the nearly instrumental new wave music that we in the beginning it was a bit like that and i think They ask me much how it comes that this scene, that are nearly the same guys before made this pop music, began with this, for much people, totally otherwise sounding music. For me, it doesn't so sound otherwise. I think when you have versions from rather popular acts, from the... from the 80s you hear already the the big influence in it even the beginning of the new wave the beginning of the the the trance is is going in it in the way of thinking about music was was others it i think we were thinking in the spirit now we make a record it has this record has to be like you make film music or something. It has to sound for that reason. Like that. Very deep, very loud, very hard or something. Not too much vocals in it yet. music to be used. We didn't think about eternity for that way. It's very strange for me that just now all things, that there comes a little hype, in fact. And I understand the reason of it because very much acts like now in Belgium are made a crossover between the influences of the electronic dance. and also now acoustic instruments, voice on and normal voice, Again, lyrics on it. A good example for this is Oscar and the Wolf. I don't know if you know it, Oscar and the Wolf. They play huge festivals. They made a record that goes everywhere internationally. They win prizes. And you hear it and you say, yeah, surely also the slow ambient in it, the atmosphere of the electronics. they made songs with it. And for that, I think that we did not a useless job in the time. I think it's a sort of part from the puzzle in the evolution of thinking about it. Before it, it was undone. I remember the biggest organizer in Belgium, Torreut Wachter Festival. Wachter, a very big festival. He said... This kind of music, in the beginning that it had success, will never be on my festival. Never. Now with the half of this festival is that kind of DJ organized music. So you see that the mentality is very changing. So kind of what you're saying is at the time you didn't feel like you were making important art. No, no, really not. We tried to do it good. Surely it had to sound good. And even when it's minimal, the little part that has to be good. It's very difficult, but you don't have too much choice to to to variate this with a very basic minimal idea. You have to have a maximum of impact on it, maximum force of danceability in it. Only drum beat and some sort of riff that you have in it can be very, very powerful. And that we were looking at, and then a whole sort of carpet of ambient sounds above it. And it was sometimes very creative of playing with sounds. But for me, once the product was finished, it had to do. a job with the DJs for me it was we heard of it yeah it's good passing the Boccaccio is passing it and Carré that were the most important discotheques in this time then it was enough for us and then you hear yeah it's selling rather good time for another one it was a bit this mentality not for We're going to make music to be heard three years later. It was not the idea that we had. So do you consider this stuff you guys are making new beat? No. That's also a strange coincidence. The word new beat, I don't know from where it comes. From myself, I was much more thinking in the way of, like I said, on Oosthuis, Adrian Sherwood's dub, the very deep dub. reggae even then the old Detroit techno was my inspiration in the beginning the end of the new wave with very explosive synthesizer sounds that was why it became For me, new beat was too soft. I was always more thinking in a sort of punk way of using the synthesizers. I was also more guitarist and I wanted to make with this technology, make also the rawness of some punk records in it that I tried. In some tracks, you can hear it on this compilation. Like you have the acid drill that's in it. It's really... The first Dissasalaboom could be a guitar riff, in fact. That sound, for me, when they should call it, in that time they didn't call it also U-Beat. Now, in the general, because a bit of the sound of Belgium, I think, the compilation, they all call it together U-Beat. But for me it was more like, I don't know how, Techno House, for me it was Acid. not the drug way of the acid, but the sound of the acid, the sweeps, the sweep sounds in it. It was a way of fullness also, the little chaotic fullness that was in it. You may, sometimes the... The more foolish, the better it was. But it was not a foolish idea. Sometimes for some good foolish joke, you were working a whole week to get it good placed in it. Sometimes you got an idea in two minutes, but it was a whole week to place it good in your sound. Yeah, in that film, The Sound of Belgium, someone says that he thinks... The special thing about Belgian club music is that, um, It was more influenced by punk than other cities. I think the punk movement in Belgium was in fact the beginning of all the musical, the second musical move in Belgium. Because after the punk became a bit the new wave, directly after it, the new wave was directly following. And it are the same guys. who made afterwards this dance music. It's not music that's made by DJs. It was still... In fact, you have to say, it's music that's made by musicians without a job, who lost their job. In fact, the normal music that they made didn't sell, there were no gigs. So we were workless, they call it. Chômage. How did you first encounter... Belgium's club scene? When did you first get into all that stuff? I knew it always, naturally, yeah. But it was never my way, yeah. Even in the time we had hits and discotheques also, sometimes we played as a live group that you did, that existed. With two Belgians? With two Belgians, yeah. With two Belgians, we had some live gigs and rather big discotheques, also in France even. But afterwards there was music, yeah, like normally rave parties or something. Then we heard, in the beginning it was punk afterwards, that we played, the DJ met punk of New Wave and the things that were a bit of a crossover in this scene. Naturally we saw that the group was replaced by one DJ. One of the first who did this was Too Many DJs. The guys, you know it, I think, Too Many DJs. They were rather famous for remixes from all sorts of artists. Wait, when did they first come around? I wouldn't have thought they would have been already DJing back then. I forgot the name of the normal group, but because the normal group still exists. Soulwax. Soulwax, yeah. Soulwax guy, yeah. I think it was a side, also a bit of the same vision. It was a bit of side product of what they did. And the side product became more important than the group, in fact. And also much more international. That's strange, also for me. Maybe one of the things is, yeah, even in Germany, yeah, we are not the strongest in English language. So the less words you use, the more... success it can have internationally. Maybe for an Englishman it has to be very strange to hear Belgium singing in English, I think, and for a German singing in English, sometimes it passes, but it's not so logical, in fact. And I think this, the way that it falls away, it's not important. The language has no more importance. It were little samples or something, little words that everybody could say. It was much more the atmosphere, that it was very much more international. The first reactions I got afterwards always was from England, from the first one on the CD now, the Zaza La Boom. They began to ask me questions about Manchester DJs and how you did it and that. Is it a TB-303? Is it what synthesizer you used for that? It was a whole mystery around this record. And I said, what are they doing? They got mails from everywhere in the world, from Australia. I said, what's happening? For me, it was a very old thing, a long time past. Somewhere we had, maybe by coincidence, touched the just, I don't know how you write string or touch a string, you say it in English, I don't know. Struck a chord. Struck a chord. The right feeling that that touched people somewhere. We didn't think about that in that way. In fact, it was to be used. Music to be used, not more for me. For me and for myself, I speak. Because also much people ask, did you see each other much? Did you talk to each other? There were all sorts of teams. I think in the beginning we worked, we were only four teams who made all these records. I was a team, and then you had a team around Maurice Engler from Paracan, and then you had Morten Sherman Bellucci, Sherman from the Sherman Bank, and then you have Patrick Gleiss. And all the rest were more DJs who asked musicians around them. We were a team that were all musicians that played around and someone from the record company. Maurice was the guy from the record company, in fact. Maurice England. Roland Beelen also, they started it up, Antler Subway Records, it was the second label for this kind of music. So it started up. Did you enjoy going to the clubs yourself? Places like Boccaccio and whatnot? Enjoy? Yeah, I found it funny to see it once, but it was not my kind of nightlife. In fact, yeah, I was one generation older than all the people around me. It was nice once to see, but I went there sometimes to hear it, sometimes to hear the new vibes. And surely also, technically, how does it sound? What I made, you have the idea, you work with two little boxes, sometimes a little bit bigger, but when you hear it over there with this huge sound system, you have to think, oh, but I have to do it all, the basses must have much more deeper, and that, and that, and so. Sometimes I went there with a little cassette. I knew the DJ a little bit. Sometimes I could pass. He puts it two minutes through the other records. You can see she put a bit of the volume, that it was not so strange. And then you say, yeah, that I'm going to change. That has to be more louder. It was more like a study travel. Did you find the atmosphere impressive? I mean, a lot of people talk about how... Yeah, that's true. That was one of the first times I passed there was, I think, with Maurice Engler, with the Praga Khan guy, to visit him on some discotheques, some DJs. The first time when you hear and see it, also the laser effect and the whole show, it was the first time, but it was the beginning of the laser also, a little bit. They were creative, these DJs. It was not, I got a record and I put them like it was. They began to manipulate the velocity of the record. They began to mix down other sounds in it. Never you saw a label on a record, never. It was all with stickers on it. It was all very secret, always secret. They put speeches in it. I know one of the first I heard was, I have a dream. But when you hear, I have a dream from Martin Luther King, with a rather carpet of very strange sound around it. It was very, and the beat begins on it. It was not a political issue. It was just playing with the effects of the strength of a voice. So sometimes even they were not afraid to put opera in it, pieces of opera. they mixed themselves I found surely in the beginning they had a very creative job and it influenced us also as DJ what I did sometimes was to put me in the corner it was mostly the Friday night or the Thursday you had a very important you know maybe records the music man also a label for dance music and it was I think it was the Thursday that all the DJs came to him which club was it it was not a club it was a shop it was a shop music man and it was one guy like in a club playing the records and the DJ was there with his pint of beer His sign was left or right. When it was left, it was on his staple of records. Right was less good. Left, right. And then you saw all the staples from all the DJs growing. Sometimes it was interesting to hear, yeah, I'm choosing a bit the wrong direction, or here I'm very good. I even didn't know that I made this music. Sometimes I was there in the corner, just looking and listening. About those little flourishes the DJs did with spoken word and bringing sound effects. In a way, that's sort of what you ended up doing on your records. You like layering in. audio clips of spoken words yeah yeah that's that's true that's like i say that's the lyrics that were like sasa la boom it comes from it was only later now you have internet to look it up but it was a coincidence on a cassette you found a sort of charming voice yeah that's interesting and around this little charming voice you begin to uh you begin to make a whole track And then the problem was, from who is that charming voice? But it was a time, I don't think, even now it's passing and they don't make the James Brown samples from the drums that are used everywhere. It's a, ooh, ah, from James Brown. You heard it in very much records. It was a time that was not so straight at all. To be used also. It was also not for eternity. Everybody did what he did. Sometimes it was a bit too. But you could get away with it. No, not always. Sometimes there were records, no, no, no, that's dangerous. That you're going to do. The whole basic rhythm would be something. Also, you may replay it, that sometimes Maurice did much. He was very good informed about things happening everywhere in the world. Clubs in Manchester do that, that, that. It's selling very good there, there, there. And then at night, at two nights, he made another record, nearly the same thing. And he had more success with that than the original. They were working very, very quick, the Antler Subway. There were also four teams the whole time busy with doing these records. Like making bootlegs, you mean. Not for making booklet. That's a bit his scene. That was a bit partly his scene. Like the best example from that is the 101 Rock to the Beat. Normally it's Riz and Antonio as the original. And he made it in two or three days. And he had a much bigger hit with the cover. You have to cover. It was legal. It was legal. It was not illegal. It is reason Antonio are the writers of the thing. But royalties are for the Atlas of Wayna. I wanted always to make original things for my own. Belgium had a huge record collecting culture in the 80s, which you sort of alluded to just now. Were you ever part of that? Were you ever like a record freak back in the day? A bit, yeah. But you mean already in the dance scene? Yeah. Yeah. From the Dancy, not. I was not so, but I know it existed. People were really looking for the original, for the most original first pressings. I don't know. That's true. There was also surely, as long it was vinyl, as long as things came out on vinyl, they had very collectives of all these things. In this scene, I'm not. In other records before, yes. Sometimes I was proud of some record I found, but not so much, in fact. I was more... It could be sometimes one song could blow me away. How he did it, such a good thing. And the rest of the artists didn't follow so much, but it was more individually. So some projects really that interest me. Looking at the track list for your compilation, it doesn't look like it's the work of one person. There's about 20 different names on there. Why is that? Why? Yeah. Well, you have to see from where we come. We were musicians without work at the end of the 80s. And we had the opportunity to do other things. But for us, it was so in the beginning. Yeah, it was a whole other market. And we thought, yeah, maybe they don't need to know that I'm doing it. Plus the way that the media were not so happy with that, with this whole movement. The media didn't take it serious. And when they had people who normally they know... They were known in another circuit that one day or another they began to make things like that. We thought, we were all thinking, the more secretive it is, the better. And also, a Belgian guy is not, Belgian people are not chauvinist people. They don't have to see, oh, it's a guy from Antwerp. Oh, watch, one from Brussels. It's nothing. It's better to look, oh, it's from California. That's interesting. Oh, Berlin, Berlin. Oh, that's very good. Yeah, it's from Berlin. For that, I had one name, Romaron, the mostly used. And then people didn't know it. And they thought records from Italy, Spain, I don't know, Austria, America. They didn't know it. And for me, it was good that they didn't know it. And I looked for a sort of name that matched with the content, the atmosphere of the thing. Like the sleepwalker tracks are more ambient. I had some directions in it. 303 there that I made that could be a sleepwalker thing that I call Le Mystère so all the ambient ways and then the more aggressive things that are on it And I found it sometimes like Zaza Labouma tried one or three times to use the same thing. But for me, then it was another name. Not a very good commercial view. But I think the success was a bit in anonymity of the whole thing. When you should know it, oh, there's again this guy. That's also again this guy. It's very rapid finished. It stayed longer that way. People get sick of you. I think, yeah, yeah. It's normal. I mean, it's very common even today for electronic artists to use a bunch of different, you know. I think, yeah. I think. Do you have a reason for that? It's pretty much what you just said. We're going to change the interview. I mean, you sort of just. explain it yourself at least in many cases just there's more there are more things they want to release and they don't want people to get fatigued yeah yeah you have fatigue you have yeah it's time for another one another one he's doing also good work we have enough of this one maybe that's a bit in it yeah Still, though, you've got, what, 20 or more different names. Oh, yeah, it's possible. I never counted it. I think on the compilation, they're not all. I think when I did the compilation with the mental groove, a guy, Olivier Ducre, is the guy who had the idea to do it. I think we listened to 70 different or more, 75 different tracks. I had parts of it. And then we decided, no, no, no, no. And they were all yours, all those 75. Sometimes I heard it. That was like the first time I heard it. Plus also very difficult to find. which version we used in that time. Sometimes I found all other mixes and other versions and it was a whole job. It was in fact a whole job of a whole summer for me. to check all these things out, to find them also, to let them sound good. But they did a very, very good job at the mental groove remastering. For me, it sounds very fresh, in fact. I wondered how, because it was not always so perfect in the time I found, but now they did a wonderful, good job in the remastering, I find. When you were making all those tracks, what was your workflow like? How were you making so many tracks so quickly? For me, it was my job. In fact, music was my job. Not only that, but sometimes I had concerts in the weekend, but Monday morning after my breakfast, the day began with some track, making a track. And sometimes the night through, I had no children at that time. I could work. living very alone I could work as hard and as much I wanted without disturbing anyone as long as my ears could and the inspiration stays sometimes we had we had also deadlines for it when you want this record also it has to be finished end of the week otherwise we have to week a whole other week Also, the record company had to follow the whole thing. It was a very little company, in fact. They had to follow the whole market and the whole production process of this whole thing. And for that, yeah, I never made a mistake to make it quick for gaining time. It was also, I think we were proud enough, we let the product when it was really finished. And we were, sometimes we began totally, totally, yeah, it's not bad, but it's not that. And then it was not Chamonfou. It was really not that. The end became a bit with the whole commercial scene that began around the big click in it. That was a very good record, I found. The Confetti's This is the Sound of Sea is one of the most popular things in this time. But from then on, all people were beginning to think of imaging, an image for the project. Sometimes three dancing girls was enough. And then it was sort of, for me, a sort of childish playback scene that you created. I think this was the beginning of the end of the adventure of the scene and the experiment that was in it. They began to see it as a commercial thing. They were going from the one discotheque to the other. And then I... decided I don't belong to that scene that's not my music a really interesting thing about Belgium's club scene the 80s and all the dance records is even before it got commercial some of those records were selling a lot even getting you know at least a few got number one without any radio play how did that go for you how did your record sell I find myself one of the less successful in that time. Really, all the others had much more success than me. You always wanted that it works and that it sells. But I think it was a bit too experimental. We wanted to be... Even in that work, I want to keep the thing very serious, in fact. And for me, it didn't match with commercial success. It was made to be underground for me, made to be experimental, made to be special, made to be foolish. And sometimes in this record, we... Sometimes it was not bad, the selling, but it was compared to Sound of Sea or compared to Pump Up the Jam and compared to much other things, even Praha Khan things, it's one tenth or something. But that was not the market for me to try to get in this scene a very smash hit in it because you have to do so much. then you have to really play like the market wants. It's possible, but there are other people better than me. In 1994, if I'm not mistaken, that was the year you started a flamenco pop group. Much earlier. Earlier, but I think the first record, first vinyl single I made with is... Estaloco Project in 1990. That is strange, I did it together. I was, for myself, I was playing and singing in Spanish. for myself not to make records to do something with Spanish music and as job in the day in fact I made this dance records and the weekend already I only had little gigs with the Spanish music it was I could mix it very easy for me I could make this switch for me it was not such a big switch in fact music is music I tried to do the flamenco things good and I tried to make the other things good. I think you have to see it sometimes like a singer, David Bowie or something, or Mick Jagger who has to make film music. No voice on it. He tries to do other things. No guitar on it. He tries to do other things. But it sounds, it's matched with the film. I think, and you can take it seriously also. You can make this, it's like a whole other way of thinking, but it's the same person. For me, it was not so duality. It sounds like the flamenco was more... as you said, for yourself, and Romero was more of like a job. Yeah, because with Flamenco, I knew that it would be years to make one serious record with it. Before I had the level of working with that, playing gigs, yeah, it would become earlier, but I waited till, in fact, 1994 for the first CD that I made with it. I had to learn the language. I had to learn Spanish, write my own lyrics in Spanish. Between that, I had a selling market of dance music. I saw it a bit like that. Did you stay interested in dance music in the years since the 90s? In the beginning, not so much. But I always keep on following it a bit. And now surely because I have a son. Son is now 19 and he is completely involved in this music, in the electronic music, is making himself much tracks. Till now without record label or something, just also for himself. And from him I learn really new sorts of things, new artists. When he goes to a festival like Doer Festival, you have the big festival around Doer de Stad Mons in Belgium, I don't know if you know it. You have the Doer Festival. It's not going to the live groups. It's going to all the techno, how you call it now, I don't know. Techno DJs. Techno DJs and techno acts, in fact, sort of acts. He found that much more interesting than the live groups. He's influenced by the things that are happening now and with other methods. Now it's all computer, in fact. nearly no stuff like I saw today. All the old synthesizers that we had, all the old rhythm books, it's all in the computer now, really much of the things. But it's very interesting for me to hear and to see it also. For me the most interesting thing is the mixing of the two now. People find it normal that you can mix all these things. That you can go to a live concert and there's a whole techno ambient sound busy and there's a live group playing on it. And all these things I found the most interesting. The movements that are happening now, that's changing the way of making and listening for me. What you do with your music, is it only to dance? That's a bit changing. It becomes to the electronics of music. It's reaching ears from people who want more than dancing now. They want to listen. They want also some more lyrics on it. They want what you're doing with this music. And I found more and more you see this sort of projects that works. Like the best Belgium. Example for that is Stromae. I don't know if it's in Germany so known. Stromae, his first hit was "A la rondance". "A la rondance". It was number one in France, Belgium, number one in Holland. And now he had a smash record, a whole CD. Everybody thought it was a one-hit wonder with all lyrics. a bit like Jacques Brel, with the deepness of Jacques Brel lyrics, but on dance music. He's selling more than Daft Punk. So you have to look at this. Unbelievable, this guy. It's beginning at America also. And also with a whole dance attitude, he's trying to tell a story to the people, how he thinks about the world. Before it was only amusement. And now this kind of music is used to tell the opinion about the world and something becomes more and more serious, I found. It sounds to me like you probably consider yourself... a live musician at heart. It doesn't seem like you're ever that connected to DJ culture or the art of DJing or anything like that. Would you say that's true? I never did it. Sometimes I put a little vinyl on it and it would pick up. But I'm not a specialist in that, no. For me, it was playing the music that I respect. and it's very important and it's an art on himself to you have to sometimes to think like a DJ you have to think how to to get your public on your train to let them follow you for that I have not a talent I think I'm maybe not so the interest or so I have some examples but in two weeks I should have a blackout I think they have to be very good informed as DJ now to know all what's happening and following all the things I'm too busy with my own things the music on your compilation And one of the things people say about it is that when you listen to it now, it sounds kind of prescient. Like there are new records now that sound like something you made 20, 25 years ago. Does that seem strange to you? Is that surprising to you to hear that? Sometimes, yes, but maybe in another way, not. because even the things that I hear now, it's not so strange and not so far away from me. Things that always changed is the tempos. Sometimes it's slowing up, slowing down and going up to a very high level and going down. But the source of making, amuse themselves on music, to dance on the music is the same thing, I think. For that, and also what you have, now it's all with computer, but all the plugins on computer are all imitating this old synth that we used. All the old sounds are now sounding good. The Roland TR-808 is still the machine, and the 909, and the TB-303. They all try to have computer. Very good imitations, very good things. But in fact... You can say in a whole other way, you hear sometimes the same sounds. And for that, maybe for some people, it's not so much change maybe as that. Plus... you have maybe also the advantage that it was the real stuff. It was the real Koch and the real Roland and the real that you used maybe, I don't know. Also maybe that when you were making those records, that was a certain moment in time where a lot of people were inspired by this music. That was kind of the original explosion of all this stuff. Yeah. And maybe without knowing it, we influenced each other. We didn't know. We were all working apart, but we were following each other. We knew what came out and what worked and what didn't work. And we knew it all. And it's like, I think you have to see it, like when you saw the Beatles. Lennon wrote a song and McCartney... try to make a better song and then Harrison wanted a more powerful song. So I think the team was a bit, were a bit pumping up their quality in Conquerance, I think. It's always a good thing, I think. Everyone from the teams I talk about had their own speciality. The more commercial view, the underground view that I did more much with the guy from Verbalen. For myself, the things that I did together, it's Saint-Aubien or Verbalen or Bob, Eric Bob. For me, that are all the best tracks for me, the most. most inventive tracks. It was a very good musician from also before a very famous pop group in Belgium, Thyssematic you had in Belgium, now still the singer, still Arnaud, I don't know, it's in Germany, it's not so known I think. But he has a whole scene in France and all. But it was the bass player of that. And he was very, very good in manipulating the 303 from Roland. He was a crack in it. He was very good in it. What's your relationship with these tracks now, the Romarin tracks? When you hear them now, do you still like them or does that sound like a really long time ago to you? For me, yeah, but the only thing that I found, yeah, for me, after three minutes, I'm a bit sold out. The market asks tracks from four and a half, five minutes, sometimes six minutes. So yeah, you make it longer and it has to be used for the dance floor. So it has to enchain a bit sort of trance in it. But musically, mostly the most tracks are sold out for me. around three minutes. But the basic ID in every track I found is the one little good basic ID. And I think that is the reason why we didn't use the other 35 tracks that I found. Because there, the basic ID was not so good. I think you're working on 30%. of your capacity. Because 50% are normally lyrics and 20% arrangements, difficult arrangements. Other 30% that you're working with, the rhythm and the bass and the basic sound has to sound 100% good. for that we sometimes it's much more easy to fill it all up to fill it up and you're like wow what a record but that didn't work on the dance floor it had to be all very clean and very the bass drum had to be bass drum the hi-hat has to be high all very sharp and very explosive in fact And that made it sometimes very difficult to have to found a very good groove for it. And that thing I like in this record. When you say each track had to have one good simple idea, would that be like a riff or a little, you know, a drum pattern? Could you actually point out something in the track? Like that's the bit that makes it good? Where the compilation starts with... The basic track from the Zazalaboum record could be a sharp played guitar, in fact. It could be a guitar with a very special sound, but it can be very... knife-hard guitar riff in fact but it's played with a synthesizer but sometimes it was very difficult to find where it got his power to find the machine yeah here he has really the power we needed and to build the whole track around this one riff then it falls away then it comes back and then pulling like puzzles all together and then with the little atmosphere of a voice in it The TB-303 is something that I had. The Opus 303 is also a bit like that. Much more softer, but mostly it started with one good riff, in fact. Like the pop song. But then for the pop song, mostly you have a guitar in your hand. Mostly it starts with one riff. even with Eurythmics or I don't know, or Rory Gallagher in the time, or a blues artist. Mostly it's one thing that catches your ears, but now it was with a synthesizer and more obliged to follow some tempos. It was not too, too slow. I fell asleep in the discotheque or not too high or so, because then you hear nothing but more than... It was between... And then for the rest, you were rather free to do what you want, but it had to sound good and it had to stay danceable. I was alone in my room. Something grabbed me and smothered me. Bye. I was alone in my room. Something grabbed me and smothered me.
