You're listening to The Hour with Resident Advisor. The Hour. This is The Hour. You're listening to The Hour. This is The Hour. With Resident Advisor. Hello and welcome to The Hour. My name's Ryan Keeling and I'm the editor at Resident Advisor. The Hour is RA's blend of documentaries, discussion, interviews, and lots of other things besides. On today's show, Carlos Hawthorne will don a blindfold. before being driven to the secret warehouse where Arcadia creates their spectacular festival experiences such as the Spider which you might have seen at Glastonbury. And the sound artist, Maria Chavez, will be showing Max Pearl how she developed a performance technique called abstract turntablism, which involves manipulating a turntable and vinyl to produce all manner of fascinating sounds. But first, it's behind the track, a regular feature in which artists tell their stories. as the story behind tracks they wrote that went on to be classics. For this month's track, I'm going to quote a Discogs user called Sam H72, who in 2014 said, "Utterly original, game-changing stuff from Pinch. One of those tracks you can still roll out today, which will stop people in their tracks." Not sure there's a category for this, it's just atmospheric, timeless and exceptionally deep music. He was referring to Cavalli, a track that the Bristol artist Pinch wrote back in 2004. When it was eventually released, it helped establish Pinch as a producer and established Bristol as dubstep's second city. And as SamH72 mentioned, It's a track that seems to lose none of its potency over time, even 13 years after its release. Hi, I'm Rob Ellis, known to many as Pinch or DJ Pinch, and I'm just here talking today about one of the early tracks I wrote back in 2004. It came out in 2006 on Planet Mu called Cavalli. So back around 2004, 2005, early years of dubstep for me, we used to go up as a group of friends from Bristol to the Forward Nights first Thursday of the month and kind of fell in love with the music there. Decided it would be a very good match for the nightlife of Bristol and decided to start doing an event called Context which began in January 2004, putting on basically a kind of mixture of dub, electronica dubstep and then at the end of the night jungle and drum and bass. The idea being to try and kind of attract like-minded people to this sort of small new emerging scene that not so many people had heard about at the time. And you know, because it was such a small scene at the time, there was very little... In terms of releases that you could buy, I mean, barely a dozen or so records that were actually out, mostly of which on temper at the time, and then bits of instrumental grime and whatnot would fit in with it. It became very clear to me very early on that if you wanted to even play an hour-long set of this style of music, you had to get your hands on some dub plates because that's what the vast majority of all the DJs were doing. playing represented the new sounds so I got myself in the I'd say in the studio it was just a bedroom at the time with some hi-fi speakers and an early copy of Fruity Loops and started learning to make beats on a very basic level I made a couple of tracks early on. The second one was called Cavalli and I can remember actually the first time I played that one out on dub, it was in the first ever sub-loaded put on later the same year, 2004. It was kind of embedded in an excitement of being part of an early scene and a sense of openness about where it would all go. When I made it, I didn't have very much confidence in what I was doing. doing and you know I gave it to a few people to play out and funny enough I mean the first person to play the track out and kind of champion it a little was American DJ called Joe Nice. He loved it and then weirdly one of the only other people who cut it from the dubstep scene was N-Type who perhaps became less known for more sort of subtle or deep meditational kind of end of dubstep and represented a kind of harder, wobblier, more dancefloor sound. But yeah, I mean, you know, when I initially sort of handed the track around, it wasn't setting people on fire. And I was just thinking, okay, well, you know, that's a good start. I'll just kind of keep building on from there. It didn't come out until 2006 because... It wasn't for another year or so, I think, until Mike Paradinas, who ran Planet Mu, heard it and just hit me up out of the blue and said, you know, we'd like to put this out. And I was genuinely surprised, to be honest. And he said he was going to press 1,000 records. And I thought he was mental. I thought, no, no one's going to buy 1,000 records. But he did. It was a good call on his part. and helped me kind of take a little bit more confidence and positivity in what I was doing at the time as well. Do you know what? I almost never actually played that track out. For me, it's a very personal piece of music. I do have an emotional attachment to it very much. I think it's not something I listen to now and it's certainly not something I play out so much. But there's one main sound which is taken from a Cavalli track. and some drums that were kind of re-edited but then pretty much everything else is just short samples like drum samples and short atmospheric samples that have been re-pitched and kind of taken out of context essentially. I mean the reason why it's called Cavalli is not really in reference to one of the samples that's in the track. I guess around the time my younger brother, he was going out with a girl whose family is from Northern India and he told me about this music and essentially why she was passionate about it and what I loved about it was more, if I'm honest, the idea than the actual music itself so much because Cavalli is a very spiritual music but it's sung it's you know the Cavalli singer is the emphasis in the music but what I liked about it was the idea of how it's a spiritual form of music and the kind of head space is that the music was designed or aimed to kind of take you in. So for me, that track was my cavale, my little spiritual happy place or whatever you might want to call it that I was trying to evoke in the music. you I'm now going to hand over to Carlos Hawthorne, who's a staff writer here at RA. We arranged for him to be given a tour of the Arcadia Spectacular warehouse, where this production team cooks up breathtaking festival experiences such as the Spider. But to reach the warehouse, somewhere outside of Bristol, he was first asked to put on a blindfold in order to protect its exact location. I'm standing outside. Bristol Temple Meads train station waiting to be picked up and driven to a secret location about 30 minutes outside of the city. My destination is the warehouse of Arcadia Spectacular. They're a performance art collective that combines sculpture, pyrotechnics, music, acrobatics, circus and lighting to produce immersive performances on a grand scale. They've built several machines though the most famous is the Spider, a 50 tonne mechanical arachnid that you might have seen at Glastonbury Festival or The Spider is built from a mixture of scrap metal and unwanted industrial machinery, and it's a giant, 20 metres high and armed with flamethrowers, robotic arms, CO2 cannons, lasers and a 360 degree function 1 sound system. At the centre of The Spider, suspended above the crowd, is a DJ booth, which since Arcadia started in 2007, has hosted some of the biggest names in dance music. As anyone who's been to an Arcadia performance will tell you, it's one of the most breathtaking spectacles on the festival circuit. Okay guys, in order to keep the location secret, I'm now going to need you to put these blindfolds on. My name's Pit Rush. I'm creative director of Arcadia Spectacular. My name's Bertie Cole and I'm the technical director for Arcadia. It's getting towards the middle of May and we're in our warehouse and everyone is here working today, getting things prepped mainly for Glastonbury. Most of our equipment came back from tour a few days ago and there's a massive process of getting that out and cleaning it and servicing it and getting it ready for the next assault which is Glastonbury. So all roads head to Glastonbury. And what's a normal day like here? It depends what we're up to, really. Sometimes it's a proper brainstorming research and development hub. You know, wires up across the place and people hanging off them, working out what weights they can take and how they move and things like that. Sometimes, like today, it's kind of, you know, getting the stuff that we know back and fixing it up and getting it ready for another gig. Why the secret location? It's complicated. It's complicated. Yeah, I'd better not go into it much further. So why did you set Arcadia up? It came about through both of our journeys, which were kind of independently. sort of trailblazing through the kind of festival and party scene when we were younger. I worked for a company called Kayam which had the world's largest tensile structures, massive tents, and we used to move them all over the world for different events and parties and theatre shows and stuff. Did that from when I was a young kid so I'd been on the road for a long time and Pip worked with his brother and... various other different exciting outfits that were building big sculptures out of scrap and moving them around the world to different events. And we actually knew each other as kids and we'd grown up a little bit together and our paths kind of just joined at the right time. And we sort of realised there was massive potential in a sort of putting both of our skills together and seeing what was possible there, but also seeing what wasn't really happening at the festivals and parties and that there was another total different new way of doing things. I mean, what was that? What was lacking? A lot of things were quite linear and a lot of things were not that immersive. And a lot of things were kind of people weren't interacting with each other in the way. The crowds weren't interacting with each other in the way that they could have done. And we kind of came about with this concept of a 360 degree setup. which engaged people and brought them into an immersive atmosphere where they were completely surrounded by things. And we played with elements like fire and music and obviously the sculptures and working with scrap. And all those things kind of came together into a sort of melting pot, which kind of became Arcadia and created the experiences that on a small scale then are done on a massive scale now. Was there a community in the UK of artists and engineers bringing old machinery back to life? Well, some of my family, my elder brother and a lot of his generation were doing some quite amazing things, building sculptures, like rhinos and things like that out of old tractors, being brought back to life and driving them around and having a good time and turning up at parties and going nuts. So we took a lot of inspiration from that, but I think a big key to our thing was collaborating some of those skills and ideas with actual venues and more of an architecture. contextual sort of scale about how people are interacting with space and each other and combining the two worlds together. These photos on the wall are a bit of a hall of fame I suppose you could say. They're kind of a collection of pictures from our archives from 2008 on to now, so the last nine years. It's great, lots of funny characters, crew that have kind of been with us over the years and some of them that have gone on their way. Some ridiculous loads on. cars and trucks from the early years of us trying to pile as much stuff on there as possible various gas systems old mental cars and things we we've made over the years. These are the spider legs when they were being cut off the customs and excise scanning machines in a yard up north. That's quite interesting. That's the afterburner rocket top. Obviously just playing around with it but it would have been like a tank that sits underneath an airplane. That's the afterburner in its first year at Electric Picnic. Yeah, there's loads of fun pictures here. Where did the idea for the spider specifically come from? Part of our evolution is we built this... Big arena with lots of people coming to it and we were doing circus and we'd started stashing our lorries inside the stage and having our cranes, like the crane you see on that lorry over there, coming out the side of the stage, hanging aerialists off of it. and doing shows and we wanted to get the aerial potential much bigger so we were looking to build a giant tripod basically to get the rigging points up in the air and we went on this scrap tour and we found these. three big customs and excise scanning units, huge great eight wheeled vehicles, massive great things and we realised that we could take the backs off them and create three separate legs. Next thing we went back with some guys and ripped them off and brought them back down to Glastonbury and built this giant tripod and of course once we got it up in the air it was much bigger than we ever thought it was going to be. and at the time we were sort of uh we're just quite gung-ho about it so we got our existing 360 stage that we had um and we literally lifted that up with a crane and welded it on top of this tripod and it was this huge great mess of junk but it was really fun and really funny and that year we had the dj right in the top and uh the dj had to climb up a ladder and walk across a gangplank way above the crowd and like he was in a harness and stuff but Some of the DJs had turned up. We told them what was going to happen, but they turned up and suddenly there was a crowd waiting for them, but they just didn't have the balls to go up this thing. So over the next couple of years, we refined it. We put the DJ booth underneath instead of on top, which made that more accessible and they were closer to the crowd and that was really good and made space for people underneath and took this great big stage off the top of it and refined it down to the legs, which were already looking quite spider-like. So we went with the Spider and gave it some eyes and took the cranes off of the lorries and actually welded the cranes on top so we had a bit more sort of movement and stuff and got our crew up there operating the cranes and the aerialists on the cranes on top of the structure. So we actually never ended up hanging them underneath anyway. We ended up putting them on top. You know, these are such kind of ambitious ideas. Do you test them before? Like are there big kind of rehearsals for things? Yeah it's big big rehearsals a lot of it a lot of it we worked out as we went along on site. Obviously we don't do anything dangerous that we're not totally totally sure about. Yeah it's been quite a journey getting there but we're sort of in a realm now where yeah now when we do stuff everything's well worked out calculated and rehearsed and then it goes on site. How did you first get involved? with Glastonbury? Bertie and I have been going to Glastonbury since we were kids, really. So we've always sort of been part of the fabric. And we were lucky to meet Michael in the early days when we had a few plans and he sort of believed in us and supported us. How much do you remember about that first performance? At Glastonbury? Yeah, it sits very high in my memories, actually. It was amazing because we didn't really, we'd never really seen the full potential. We'd kind of visualised it. dreamed it and we thought we were going to create something that would have some magic about it but the first time that we switched it on and you know put some music on it and fired it up I mean it was incredible it was really electric people just flocked to it and we could see that something totally new had hit the scene and yeah it was an amazing moment for us. How many people are involved in the build for something like the Glastonbury show? Glastonbury is a monster for us we drag you know everything and all our people there. It's around 500 people and that includes everything that's needed to turn a grassy field into a massive spectacle and show. We've got welders and electronics technicians and gas engineers and a real variety of people come together for this time of year. Hi, I'm Matt, Arcadia's Special Effects Manager. I'm in control of all of the effects and anything flame based or CO2 based is mostly my area of responsibility. If they want fire coming out of it, that's what our department does. We've got all of this kit here. Most of what you see there is the flame heads. During the show we use these desks here to fire the flames. Hi, my name's Tim Smith. I'm the technical production manager for Arcadia. I look after all of our... lighting, sound, oversee with Matt the special effects systems. My daily responsibilities are usually to take the creative director's ideas and produce them across lighting, sound, effects and run the teams. On shows that ranges from the installation to the runnings of the show, running timecode playback rigs, scheduling those bits and that's pretty much it. What's your background? My background was rock and roll touring before I went to Arcadia. I then had children, wanted to settle down a bit and Arcadia's given me the base of my dream job. I get to blow things up, play with really cool equipment with really good people and tour the world. This thing, this strange looking thing here is one of our Tesla coils and we've been developing it to be able to run through various different frequencies which actually in the end allows us to play music. through it. It's really interesting it's totally new technology so Jeb's just testing it at the moment and you can hear it firing up. Go and have a play with it. Hi, my name's Jeb Hawkins. I work for Lords of Lightning and Arcadia as technical manager for Lords of Lightning and Arcadia's sort of main electrician, fixing, making everything work. And Lords of Lightning is a company that runs shows using Tesla coils. Tesla coil is a sort of machine that was developed by Nick. Tesla over 100 years ago that produces high voltage electricity so basically a lightning generator. We do a series of shows where we have guys wear chainmail suits that act as a Faraday cage and they can actually throw lightning from their bodies. What kind of steps do you have to go through to make sure that that's 100% safe? The nature of the way a Tesla coil works is it's very, very high voltage, so there's not much current involved in the actual lightning that people will see. And for this very reason, they wear a metal suit all around them that acts as a Faraday cage. So rather than the electricity running through the person, it runs over the metal and then out through the metal as opposed to the person. All this stuff on the corner here is sort of old relics really. They're bits of old sculptures and stages from days gone by. That's an old DJ booth from the Afterburner. It was the first DJ booth. That's the original that Pip and I made in a cow shed about ten years ago. It's quite nice to still have it around. And that's around here. So most of this equipment here is the afterburner, which is our smaller stage. And that's still covered in dust from Burning Man, all that white dust you can see on it is from the desert. You can see that those are the trees, which are flaming trees. We've got smoke that comes out of the pipes and flames that come out of the top. and the thing down there is the rocket which sits on the very top of it and a huge flame comes out of the top and that's made out of an aeroplane drop tank. Getting on to the more silly stuff that we built just for a laugh but is just being repaired at the moment. This is our sort of mobile stage. It's a six-wheeled amphibious military vehicle from the 60s, is it? Yes, it's a lot of fun. We got it because it was just ridiculous and a fun thing to have and we ended up converting it when it's all put together. These other submarine models you can see behind us. These form the back of the bug. So these are like shells. They fit round the other way and they go on here. The cab at the front of the bug becomes a head and then obviously the six wheels are kind of what motors it along. And we've... Done a few renegade shows where we turned up at festival, driven in, parked up in the middle and then the shells, two shells open up like a bug's wing. We have a DJ inside and a sound system and it's a bit of an undercover sort of Trojan horse way of kicking off a bit of party when no one's expecting it. So this corner here is our main fabrication workshop. So we can make anything in here. We've got hanging points up there so we can hang things right off of the roof and work on them around underneath them. Big saws and shipbuilding, welding machines and all this machinery here can turn bits of metal into kind of anything really. These over here are mini spiders and these are part of the Metamorphosis show and they are a sculpture of a spider that's fully robotic and it climbs or crawls across a tension wire across the sky with an actual person driving it and then it can go down and abduct different people from the crowd and move people around above the audience's head. They're really creepy and we worked really hard on the movement of them and it actually replicates a real spider. So it gives people that kind of chill down their spine when they actually look up and see it. It's got that kind of eerie arachnid feeling about it. Where do you find all these scrap metal and industrial parts? We've got some amazing contacts in the industry and there's a lot of disposal contracts where people dispose of things for the military and we're really lucky to get first dibs on a lot of that stuff. It changes all the time and we feel like the whole landscape in the last 10 years has changed a lot so it's not as easy to get things in the UK so we're looking further afield at the moment. exciting things are out there. Definitely when we started out part of the fun was sort of starting with nothing and just going exploring local called little scrapyards and pulling out bits and pieces and making stuff and there still is there still are tons of little scrapyards around with loads of little bits and pieces and it's a real resource and a real privilege if people can get their hands on and just start playing with it. Will you go to a scrapyard or an industrial area and look for something in particular? Have you planned it all out before and you're looking for very specific parts or do ideas come to you as you're there? That's the essence of it really, it's a whole chicken and egg thing. Quite often we've had a form of a, just a bit of an idea of a shape of something we wanted to make, sometimes for a practical reason or a creative reason, and then we've gone looking around scrap yards. We used to go off on the motorbikes for... for a few days and we'd go to loads of different scrap yards and see what we find and sometimes we'd just see something and a penny would drop and the design would change completely to something else as soon as we saw it and we'd pick that up. Working with scrap you have to let the scrap lead the design obviously you have to have a little bit of an idea of where you're trying to go. Arcadia hosts mostly electronic acts. I mean, what are your relationships with electronic music? We grew up with electronic music ourselves. I suppose we kind of grew up as the rave scene was kicking off and that's a big part of our kind of own kind of history and culture. And we kind of like to try and make sure that the Arcadia experience is experienced by a really good cross-section of people. And that's why we program a good variety. electronic music. We've played around and done some stuff with bands in the past and it's very complicated technically but we've had some good results as well but we've kind of gone down the sort of more electronic route more recently because it just works so well with all of our effects and when you get the right artists who really understand how all the effects work and it becomes a really creative jam where the two things work together and the artist and the music becomes one of the other elements which Arcadia fuses together in its experiences. What kind of music works best in Arcadia? I think personally for me, I think drum and bass and breakbeat and bass music is really good. The way it works, the two-step way it works and the big drops and things really give you some really good points to really hit the effects hard. One of the more exciting things that we did was putting Ronnie Size and Represent on the spider in Bristol and he's obviously totally made in Bristol and so we brought those two things together. And we spent ages organising and planning all of the different intricacies of doing that technically. And that was fantastic. We had drummers on parts of the stage, double bassists, we had MCs running all over it. And it was an amazing performance because it was live and we were jamming with it as well. And yeah, a lot of people said that really made their year. How important has Bristol been to you? Yeah, it's been tough. Totally amazing, actually. As a city, for us to kind of base ourselves, I don't think we could have found a better spot in the country. It's been incredible and we've forged some incredible relationships with... all of the different sort of amazing people that are there all the different skills and all the different scenes that are there whether it's circus you know fabrication all these different companies we're kind of part of that community now it's amazing i don't think there's many places you could do that you guys go to some lengths to make sure you're the work you do is kind of eco-friendly and has like environmental issues are important to you can you tell us a bit about that all of us as a company we really do care about the environment um I think the biofuel flame system was a really good statement just to show people that things can be done differently. And once you sort of get into the fact that the spider's over 90% repurposed and recycled materials, you know, the embedded energy in that is a really, really different thing to like a big set-built thing that's used at a festival and then just taken down and landfilled afterwards. our stuff gets used over and over again and because of that it's a really different sort of green footprint. This is a recycled vegetable oil we developed the world's first recycled flame pyrotechnic system and we now that's all come from chip shops in Bristol it's all their waste and we now in some of our shows we pump that through our flame system and that's what keeps everyone warm through the night Do you have any plans to kind of venture outside of music? I mean you know this thing would look amazing in a film in a science fiction blockbuster It's a great question. We don't really rule anything out. We're always sort of scheming with different ideas and stuff and it's been great as a journey in the music industry, I suppose you could say. But yeah, we're always sort of dabbling and thinking about different ways to apply what we do to other things. With Arcadia, at the moment, what we're doing is, I suppose, the essence of what we're trying to give people is a real... real real experience you know where you sit there and you can feel the shockwave of the flames and you can feel the heat and you can feel the energy of the people around you and you're actually under something that's real and 3d and and is a huge great lump of steel it's not just just you know a wooden facade on a bit of set kind of thing we're really trying to give people a quite a grounding earthy real experience and I think for Arcadia itself that's something that people have a real thirst for at the moment because everything's become so digital and everyone spends so much time online so we're really passionate about providing that for people. What are the extremes of people's reactions that you've seen over the years? When we first fired up in Thailand we did our test run the night before and we wanted to make sure that all the locals got a chance to come and see the show as well as the people from more inner city that were going to come out. So on the rehearsal night we invited a few thousand families, kids and adults and stuff who obviously had no idea about Arcadia, didn't have any connection, they'd just come to see what was happening. and when the flames went off on the first night, half the crowd fell over. A lot of them sort of ran away and grabbed each other. It was about the fourth or fifth flame that everyone realised it was all part of the show. And at that point, it was great. It was just endless laughter for the rest of the night, and it was a really lovely experience. So you might have seen the title of this month's episode and thought, what even is abstract turntablism? I'll allow Max Pearl over in our New York office to explain. You're listening to The Hour from Resident Evil. Maria Chavez is a sound artist and a DJ with a fairly unusual approach to the turntable. A few years ago, she published a how-to guide on what she calls abstract turntablism. It's a book of essays and illustrations that demonstrate these techniques she's developed over the years. Instead of the usual, like, beat-juggling routines or scratching, Maria's approach actually breaks the format open altogether. Often, she'll place a broken record over an intact one. 12 inch and then let the stylus ride over one and then the other as they rotate together around the spindle. Other times she'll drum her fingers on the record itself like a typewriter or purposefully swing the needle across the width of a record to get this zipping noise out of it. Most of the time she's only using one turntable which will be literally stacked with these weird found sound records that she picks up while digging. So Martia actually just got back from her home state of Texas where she was working on a new sound installation called String Room. And I figured that would be a great opportunity to pop by her apartment in Brooklyn and see where her practice is at these days. So I am here in the home of Maria Chavez here in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Maria, thank you for having me. Thank you for coming over. It's really nice to see you. So before we get to abstract turntablism, you just got back from Austin, Texas, where you were working on a sound installation, right? Yeah, yeah. I just had a solo exhibition with CoLab Projects in Austin, in downtown Austin. I installed a large-scale sound installation of piano wire where I strung from floor to ceiling, 17-foot high ceiling, so really big space. Also strung it from the cement pillars and made custom-made guitar picks and invite the public to come in and pluck around or if they want to bring in their own implements they're more than welcome to. It was really just an interactive sound sculpture for the city of Austin as a thank you because the city of Austin was a very important part of my life and we immigrated there from Peru. Lima and when we did I was only two years old and wasn't speaking properly and my mother took me to a doctor where they realized I had water in my ears and I couldn't hear for the first two years of my life and so when we were in Austin they discovered this took the water out and I heard my first sound when I was three in Austin so to be brought back as a professional artist to present something. I felt like it was more of a gesture on my end to give the city of Austin a gift. ♪ ♪ you So what we just heard was a record being played through two channels simultaneously using a double-headed needle stylus. And I was wondering if you wouldn't mind telling us the story behind this kind of crazy piece of equipment you have. Yeah, this was a double-headed needle that was gifted to me last year by King Britt. who's a producer, DJ extraordinaire. He even toured with Sade. Apparently these needles were gifted to hip hop DJs in the early 2000s. They're all prototypes. So I have number 50 of 250. You can see it there on the label. And this company, Rake, doesn't exist anymore. Only hip-hop DJs receive them because it was really for hip-hop turntablism. King didn't know what to do with it, and he just left it in the back of his closet. And then one day last year, he was cleaning it out, and he found it, and he just texted me and was like, what's your address? And I was like, what are you sending me? And then it was this double needle, and it's completely implement to expand on my practice it's completely opened a whole new world In 2012, you published this how-to guide for abstract turntablism. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense of some of the methods and the techniques that you describe in there. Sure, yeah. Well, for the piece that I just made for the intro of this, that's actually not in the book because it's, I guess now the book is considered abstract turntablism practices for one needle. So now the next phase is to make a more... cohesive book dealing with history of turntable mechanics and then how to ruin those mechanics and then how to implement two needles. But the original book was abstract turntables and practices for one needle and they're all techniques that I developed through my performance practice. When I decided to make the book the whole idea was at the time I was trying to set from it because the industry was trying to box me in and I was still more interested in trying to step out of that because I see the turntable as a tool that opened me up to what the world of sound and sound art really is but I still respect it because it was my tool to enter. So a lot of the practices have to deal with electro-acoustic sound qualities sometimes you hit the turntable it teaches you the different phases of broken needle and how to utilize them in the different techniques. So the different techniques have like suggestions like use a broken needle number four for this technique sounds best, you know, or maybe use a brand new needle number one for this one, you know, and kind of gives you a step-by-step guide to also being able to implement these techniques yourself. It was kind of a fuck you to the music industry for trying to push me into releasing recorded works, which I don't do with my practice. I haven't released an album since 2004. And also because I don't really see this practice as my own. I see it as a gift that was shown to me that I have my instincts and the talent to see and feel the instincts of how to react to certain situations and accidents that happen with the turntable. And because of that, I felt like it was important to share it with other people because it's ours ultimately. Because I don't do this on my own. I have to do it with you. I need you in the room in order for me to feel like it has meaning. And because of that, it's not mine. With my workshops, I use my book as a guide, so it's actually become really a lot more helpful with my lecture series than I originally anticipated. Normally with my workshops, we start off where we all perform a Christian Marclay piece called Record Players. It's a video. that we follow where the whole idea of record players is he wanted to have the record make sound without it being played as what it's meant to be played as. So you like flip it around. I don't know if you can hear it. You knock it, you rub your nails across it and you hit them with the other vinyl records and then at the end you break it. And then from the break, that's when the workshop starts. Because I really like to just cut to the chase and be like, okay, we're rethinking what this media value is now. Because people think that once it's broken, it's ruined. But actually, with my turntables and practice, it's a whole new world, a whole new language. And so from there, we start with the techniques in the book. that were all developed through chance operations. So we have the pendulum swing, which was actually an accident that happened in Mexico City in like 2008. They just threw the turntable in the airplane. I screamed and I was like, oh my God, my turntable's broken. And I went and it was. The back of the tonearm was bent. but I didn't have time to go and replace it, so I had to go and perform that night with this bent tonearm. And then because of the bend, the needle was actually gliding across the record in this really beautiful way that I could never replicate by hand. And then slowly but surely I was learning how to replicate it with other turntables, but really falling in love with it with the original turntable. And then finally that turntable died. And I was thinking, like, should I, when I get my new turntable, should I, like, bend the tone? I was like, no, no, then it's too much about me. It's about chance, you know. So Pendulum Swing is one. And then there's the Dragging Dagger. which is a very simple procedure where you pretty much just start from the spindle hole of the record and you drag the needle across the surface area of the vinyl to the end of the record. And then you do it without the motor engaged and you do it with the motor engaged and you practice with different pressure points. And that really changes the tactility and your relationship with the topography of the vinyl at the surface area. So yeah, it's different techniques like that or working with broken shards and how you implement it with different weights and things like that. So the basic framework of one of your live sets is like a layering process. Like you've got this platter stacked with vinyl and you're sort of adding and subtracting and trying out new combinations. Is that right? Yeah. Well, that's one of the many different techniques that I use. And they're kind of like my songs, but I never really know. where they'll start or where they'll end. But I know that the configurations of the two records always have a good energy between them. And that's one of the layers. techniques that I teach. So earlier you mentioned that there are certain pairings, duos of records that you find to be particularly interesting and dynamic in terms of layering them and making them interact with each other. Could you give us an example of one such pairing that you often turn to during one of your live sets? Right, and I actually don't know who it is. Because there's no label on it. It's like a 10-inch white album that I broke in 2010. I feel like it's much more valuable now as a broken piece than it was when it was whole. And then I like to put it with this record, The Groupies, from 1968. It's this producer that put four really popular groupies into a recording studio and had them. have a conversation about having sex with the Rolling Stones and the Beatles and all these guys. And it, to me, it's, it's a, it's a combination of like melancholy feminist conversation about like the past and how it's still relevant now, how women still talk about themselves and about others. And then it's also just a really sweet piece together. She got the prize. Yes. And now she's with the leader. The leader. Laura was the roadies. Well, they make a good couple. They're both groupies. What did she do? The only way she'll be happy. I walked in the room and she was right in the middle. Right there. They all did. It's nice to be seen with a big celebrity. It's not a big thing if they stay with you the next day. It means they might even like you. Nobody goes there tall. I don't. I can get into somebody mentally. How about when you get stoned and don't you get very aggressive? The old Mopsy road manager from Baku. Oh, he's violent. I just want to know. Yeah. I see you. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. So what we were just hearing was a broken record laid on top of an intact record, which was what was causing that effect where one source would cut in and then the other source would cut in and then we'll go back to the other source. How did you come to that technique? When I discovered it, I think I was 22, 23, that was like one of the very first things I ever learned. I call it the most valuable break, where the record breaks but the spindle hole is still intact, so it'll stay. And when it stays, then it's just a matter of hand pressure when it comes to actually... deciding which samples the needle will pick up on because ultimately that's what I'm doing right is just live physical sampling And that's what broken records are. They're just unintentional samples, physical results of unintentional samples. Whereas people now with digital choose what they want and then put them together in digital interfaces and formats. I do it live with just one turntable. Where would you say that you fall in that continuum between a live set and a DJ set? I feel like it's separate from DJing because with DJ culture, they want to play something that's intense. intentional and it's all about form and shape with music and so matching tones matching backbeats or not and same with hip-hop turntablism too they're not they're not necessarily trying to make these sample cut choices for for the sake of its electro-acoustic qualities as much as what's been recorded into the vinyl itself and trying to make that lock that into a known loop that they feel comfortable with manipulating. Whereas with me, loops are inherent to the machine. I don't choose the loops. I don't choose the tracks to be loopy. It's just that I'm on a rotating motor. The machine chose it for me and I'm just evolving with the machine. It's not like I'm choosing it to sound like this. And so it became a really interesting... philosophical conversation about what music and sound really are and the division between the two. I feel like this is unintentional sampling, which is a different form of looking at playback technology and manipulating it as implements for performance practice. With vinyl, you're so lucky because you have an exposed surface area. And so it gives you, it lends this opportunity to layer smaller sized. records on top of larger sized records and what happens is the smaller sized record blocks the way of the needle and so as you press different types of pressure on the smaller sized record that changes the loop of the blocked needle by like milliseconds which is actually really really impactful. I have two 45s here that I'll put on top of a 12 inch and you guys can hear the different loops that you can make with them. ♪ ♪ *singing* Thank you. *singing* ♪ Can you tell me a little bit about the EP that you have here that you curated? Yeah, well, this EP is curated by me. It's not a release of mine. I have a friend, Robert Dietz. He's based in Philly. And he used to be the storage manager of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. And I didn't know this, but apparently... The Philadelphia Museum of Art has the largest collection of Spinetta antique pianos in the world. So he had access to these storage units and some of these pianos are completely, you know, broken beyond repair. And one day he decided to go in there with a mini disc recorder and record the broken keys of the pianos. And so when I was there in Philly playing a show, we were hanging out afterwards and I kept hearing this like succession of keys, but they all sounded weird. And I was like, what are we, what are we listening to right now? And he was like, oh, this is. the piano keys from the, from the Spinetta pianos I was telling you about. And I was like, this is gorgeous. Like this is such a beautiful idea about deterioration. There's so many different levels of thinking about it and I want to perform it. So then we got in touch with Angus Taranowski who does in context, the label it's like limited edition, six inches. of Victoria Keddie, Shelley Bergen, really great electronic sound artists. And so it's cut on a plexiglass, so it's square. And when I began to perform it last year, this is the very first one, and I've been performing it for over a year now with the double needle, and it's a really beautiful piece. *Squish* so That's my techno. Have you ever had another DJ watching you perform and like totally freaking out because of the way you're just like a using these records? All the time. Oh my God, it's crazy. I'm like, really an object? You're gonna yell at me for it? I mean, like, it's mainly men, but I understand, you know, it's a coveted object. And, you know, and also capitalism and consumerism has really integrated itself into our society where things are so valuable, like even audio equipment is valuable. And I feel like there's... There's something to allowing destruction to participate in equipment destroying itself or listening to how it destroys itself because then it becomes more organic because then it... It becomes its own thing that has a glitch or something that another object doesn't have. And I feel like that in itself makes the deterioration a lot more valuable. But unfortunately, we live in this environment of fast fashion and just get it new. Everything has to be new. So I feel like, in a way, this practice is really challenging and unexpectedly political for a lot of reasons. That is a whole other show on its own. But I understand the grief. And it's really funny when it's an audiophile at a workshop. because it's normally it takes them like 15 minutes to get the courage to break the record but then once they break it their whole world is completely changed and it's almost like therapy I feel like the workshops for them to reintegrate and learn what the broken pieces mean to them now beautiful to watch He's glowing. She's glowing. That's it for this month's edition of The Hour. Thank you for listening. You might remember that we told you about Real Scenes London in a recent episode of The Hour, and I can tell you that the film will be released around the middle of June. It's been in production for almost a year, and we're pretty happy with it, so when it does hit the site, make sure you take a look. you
