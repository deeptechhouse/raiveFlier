Thank you. Hello and welcome to Resident Advisors Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters who are shaping the electronic music landscape. I'm Jordan Ropline, and I'm the tech editor at Resident Advisor. Few artists have brought underground dance music to as many people as Ronnie Size. In 1997, along with his group Represent, the Bristol-born Jungle and Drum and Bass icon released the double album New Forms, which received considerable critical acclaim, won the group the Mercury Music Prize, and spawned the massive crossover single Brown Paper Bag. The album might be the biggest bullet point in any assessment of Ronnie Size's career, but it's hardly the only one. He's run labels, amassed an impressive list of collaborations, and played festivals from Glastonbury to Coachella. When Joe Muggs caught up with him recently in London, Size was about to release Take Control, his first album of wholly original material in a decade, and a sort of comeback record from a break from the spotlight. They started off by discussing what he's been up to during the last four years, when making music has taken a backseat to some other critical aspects of his life. ♪ ♪ You're back in the game after a break from working, a break away from the public eye a bit. Are you excited to be where you are right now? Yeah, it's been a little while since I've actually feel like I've been this deep in the, you know, in the drum and bass scene and even in the music scene. It's great to take a step back. There is life outside of music, you know, you have family commitments and you have children and stuff and just the other week I went to see my son graduate and You know, these are some of the highlights of my life where before I think the music kind of just, you know, it was such a whirlwind for me, overtook my life. I missed quite a lot of the firsts, you know, just in my general life, not so much involved in the music, but just outside of my life. The last four years has been a great opportunity for me to be able to catch up with family and friends and to really take a bird's eye view and to you know have my ears open and listening to the new sounds of German bass and even just in electronic music coming through and rather than being so in it deep where you hear something and then you feel, oh, yeah, yeah, you know, I want to, you know, be a part of that. It was great just to be able to take a step back and even though I was DJing all the time, it was great just to be able to take a step back, to listen to the music, appreciate it and not feel like I needed to be. involved in the uprising of new music. Whereas before, when I first started this game and when I first got involved in German bass and dance music and the rave culture, I felt like it was my calling to be a part of something. And it was a great journey for me to be a part of. a unique group of people with 4Cycle and Dope Dragon to be a part of some type of like, you know, history in the making and to be a part of that journey made me who I am today. And to take a step back from that wasn't easy. It was something which, you know, you do with an open heart, knowing that you're going to come back and hopefully... still be able to, you know, be a part of that next wave of making music and to hopefully to redefine who I am and to get to that point where I feel like, you know, I do fill a gap and what I bring to the table is something different. So yeah, the last four years, family and friends and... And now it's, you know, back to business and looking forward to putting out some new music. Great. I mean, before we get on to what this new music sounds like and how you're delivering it, let's have a recap of how you got here. And I mean, it's a long story, but I really want to gather together the elements that made Ronnie Size and Full Cycle and all of these things. I mean, you grew up in Bristol, right? What were the sounds around you that drove you to be focused on music to begin with? There's an old saying, it's like where you're planted is where you blossom. And I'm very fortunate to have landed in a place called Bristol. And Bristol is where I've blossomed. I've been surrounded by a lot of my peers, like the massive attacks. Smith & Mighty and Tricky and Porter's Head and all those who come before and after I've always been inspired by so I was very fortunate to have landed in this whirlwind of sound systems and Technics 1200s and breakbeats and basslines and festivals and food and culture And I'm very fortunate that is where I was born. I didn't have a choice. I'm very lucky. I could have been born, no disrespect to Newport people, but two minutes down the road, it would have been Newport and there could be the whole different story just across the bridge. it would have been a whole... So, you know, to put that in perspective, being in Bristol, for me, you know, it was something that I never had a choice in. I have to thank my parents for that, and that is just the road that I live. You were involved with music from school age, right? School for me was very difficult. When they said to me, what do you want to do? I said music. So they put a violin in front of me. Now, if I knew what I knew back then, I would have kept the violin going or I would have played the piano. But it didn't make no sense to me. Violin, you know, reading music from a script never made any sense to me. They didn't really understand what I meant when I said music and it was my calling. So I was always brought up around music in my family. My mum would always use, you know, records at her parties. And my brothers were obviously an important part of my life because they could afford to go out and buy the records, which I could never afford to go. So they would like give me like six pounds. used to run down to Soundsville's record shop and have to go and buy the latest imports so i was fortunate enough to be surrounded by a lot of um influential icons like my brothers and my mum at the time and like i said schools didn't really understand me and and so forth were your brothers djing then so one of my brothers was part of a sound system culture so he was like emceeing which we called djing as well toasting on the mic sing jay he was a part of a band called Freedom City and another band called Restriction and they were pretty well known in Bristol they covered the reggae side of things and then my other brother was a part of a crew called UD4 and back in the day so to speak it was Wild Bunch it was City Rockers it was UD4 it was Plus One it was FBI crew and my brother and a lot of my family were involved in With all these different crews. There was different breakdance crews. There were different graffiti crews. It was all crews. And we're talking... So, I mean, what was this soul hip hop electro? Yeah, we're talking around the time of about 1984. I think I can remember my first real party going out and then it became the norm in Bristol going out to the Red House where you would see guest DJs like Nutriment come down and. You know, there was, I guess, graffiti artists like Goldie and Brim, Bio and Blim. I think that was the names. And... yeah, this was the early 80s and now I'm showing my age, man. It's like, I still feel like I'm 16 at heart because of my history. I've still got this bird's eye view of what it used to be like and I loved every minute of it. But being brought up around all this amalgamation of cultures, just for me, the playground. I could have never asked for. So how did you put it together then? I mean, you know, the violin wasn't any use to you and you were into your brother's records. Well, the thing is, is once school didn't really have anything to offer me, I started to play truancy. You know what I mean? I didn't go. Then I found whilst wandering the streets of Bristol during the daytimes of my days off. I found the basement project or Sefton Park Youth Club and this place rather than you know tell you what to do they asked you what to do You know, they say, oh, what do you want to do? I say, I play basketball. I like sports. I want to play basketball. So, you know, they bought a basketball net and a basketball. So we played that until we got bored. So many hoops you can throw. And plus, I'm only like five foot seven. So it was never going to work for me. And then they said, what else do you want to do? I said, well, I like music. I like dancing. But, you know, the digital age of music started to appear. They said, well, you know, if you want to do music, what is it you want to start with? Well, I said, I saw this drum machine. They said, okay, well, what we'll do then, we'll do a competition, we'll raise some money, we'll do a raffle. and then we'll buy the drum machine and that's how it went so every time we wanted something for the studio we do a raffle raise some money and then we go out and we buy the equipment for the studio at the same time one of my older brothers was still at that point making some money and he was building his studio as well so when I wasn't at the youth club I was at my brother's and when it wasn't on my brothers I was at the youth club As soon as I got myself a Spectrum 48k computer, I tried to make music on it. Couldn't really do that. It was all bleeps and blobs. Then we got a BBC computer. We tried that. And it wasn't until a friend of my brother met two guys from Bath called Absolute. And these two guys were basically had a studio in Bath. And we went to the studio and they basically showed us how to get the set up. The moral of the story is the two guys that we met at the time are responsible for producing all of the Spice Girls records. So these two guys, and they actually knew Brian G because they used to work at Rhythm King. So the story really is, I went to see these guys in Bath who produced the Spice Girls and they were working with Brian G at Rhythm King. They gave my tapes to Brian G at Rhythm King. And then when Brian G got made redundant, he took the tapes with him from Rhythm King. and then approached me because the tapes that he had and that's how V recordings was born what were you making at that point I mean what were these these sounds at that point there it was just funk hip-hop and just raw kind of break sounding music it was some of my early tracks like one of the tracks that was on this tape It's a jazz thing. Wow, okay. So you discovered rave music by this point as well then? So at this point there, it was right at the very beginning when the rave was starting to just cross over slightly into hip-hop and the breaks. But it never had a name. There was no name. It was just people. What was it called? What was the music called back then? It was like house, hip house. Hit house, right. Okay, yeah, yeah. So I remember it, you know, at that time you could hear the tempo starting to speed up in the music. But the first record I actually put out was on a label called WTP Records. And it was a record I'd done with the two guys, Alvin and Bonick. And we were called Freeway Split. And we did just split freeways. It was one record we'd done and we'd never do it again. And it was on a label called WTP Records, which is called Where's the Party Records, which is a... a subsidiary of Circus Warp, which was a massive rave sound system at the time. We hooked up with a guy called Chris Lewis and he helped us to form 4Cycle and Chris was like the head honcho at the time and he helped to run the label. I was going to ask about this, actually, because Circus Warp was really connected to the New Age Traveller thing and free parties and Castle Morton and all that sort of thing. Was there a big connection with that scene in Bristol? Absolutely. Castle Morton and I went to Castle Morton, which is a great eye-opener. You see everything from a totally different perspective. Lech Laid and all these different events that were happening, you could just hear the different styles of music. You'd walk from one tent to another and then you'd get from one tent the flat kick, the doof, doof, doof, doof, from one tent and then you'd hear the breaks from the other tent. And if you stood in the middle, you could kind of almost like self-mix it. And my personal opinion is like the way that the music kind of grew is because you had all these different tents. You can hear that overlap. And it just gave you so many ideas. You can hear the reflections of all the music in the tents. You had to be there. I believe you had to be there. It's the same thing when being at St Paul's Carnival. I live in Bristol. I live on the top of the hill. And you can just hear the bass lines overlapping. If you're musically minded, you can take out what you need and you can be quite creative and remember that vibe. and you can recreate that. So yeah, I was fortunate to have stumbled along Chris, who was someone who was well connected and was funding the label. And he was a friend of myself and he was a friend of Chris and he was a friend of Dai. And we all worked together with the same ideas in mind. And those early records, I mean, you know, more than anyone else, you were bringing this quite complex rhythmic sensibility. You know, other people were bringing breakbeats into rave, but you really kind of created the idea of the roller. You know, for me, what it really came down to, and, you know, not just for me, but for us as a unit, when we used to go out, we used to go to these raves and we used to stand in the middle of the rave and just wait for one certain record to come on in that rave. It wasn't even the record, it was a part of the record because all of the records at that time would be like some crazy stabs and some really four to the four stabs and kick drums. And then the part that we would like where it just dropped just a break beat and a bass. And we were like, you know what? We just want to just make music, take away all the other stuff. We just like that part there. So for us, it wasn't really rocket science just to take away the stuff that you don't like and just elongate the stuff that you do like. And that is where we feel like we made a difference. We tried to make it not so complicated because it got kind of busy at one point where... people were just so in the computers, it just became unlistenable. And we just felt like, well, you know, if we put the kick in and put the snare here, I think it was like house music, you know, you have that boom, boom, boom, boom. But that two-step thing, we felt like that's what we wanted to keep rolling. You know, with Music Box, we put the boom, ket, boom, ket, and we in. felt that that was round about the beginning of when that first sound started to roll in. So, you know, we feel like we have made our mark somewhere in the creation of drum and bass music. So as a group of producers, you were each putting out your own records, sometimes collaborating with each other. You had your own label. When did the idea of becoming a collective... as represent start occurring to you? Well, that's what it was. It was for us, we were, you know, just putting out our own individual records and we were quite prolific in doing that. I think it was at a point where I think myself and Krust, we were already pretty well schooled up and we could produce ourselves. We actually didn't have to have anyone else in the room. And then it was just a matter of time until everyone else started to learn how to use the equipment to use all up to speed. But at that point, I think Krust was more working with inside the Smith & Mighty studio. And I was working at my brother's studio when I was working at the basement. So I was always engineering everyone else's music. The basement being the project that you'd set up yourself at the youth club. Yeah, but it was more the case of working at my brother's studio. And like I said, I could use the equipment already. So I was always hands-on and everyone else was coming in and adding their two pences, which is cool. And then once everyone started to know how to use the equipment, everyone started to become their own person and their own individual, right? It was great. We could all then start releasing music, going out and buying equipment and building our own studios. We were putting out music and then we started to get noticed from the majors. you know, first of all, it was basically putting out music through V and Full Cycle and Dope Dragon. And then once Mo Wax and Talking Now started to get wind of what we were doing, that is when, you know, things started to, you know, take a different turn. We started to realize that, you know, there were people looking in from... you know, people who could make things happen differently. And this was all in the space of really quite a short period of time, looking back on it. I mean, between 93 and 95, really, I guess. We started to get a lot of remixes because a lot of people were searching for the sound. And there was people like myself and there was like, obviously, Goldie. There was Fotech. There was Dylan Germ. There was Adam F. people like DJ Hype and there was a lot of the Raga guys as well and Shy FX and we were all starting to make waves and starting to get our record deals and people were starting to approach us and saw that we had something to offer, Bookum and all these people would come looking for this new sound and let's you know the majors were starting to sign people and we didn't want to miss the boat. So when Talking Loud and Moax came in for us, it was great. It was a time where myself and Cross were fully established producers at that time, knowing what we were doing in the studio. releasing records and when they came in for us it was great it made us feel really more confident about what we was doing and more belief in what we was doing obviously we signed with Talking Loud we put out a couple of remixes with Mo Wax But we started talking loud and it was been a fantastic experience. We learned the ins and outs of a major record company, how it works, what to do, what not to do. It was a magical experience to know that we could release a record and then it could be picked up and it could win awards and it could be toured. It can be something that I can look back on and feel very proud about. But out of anybody from the drum and bass jungle world, you seemed to put together a package that could fit into the major label world, that they could understand and that you could have some control over at the same time. Well, I think, you know, one of the things about... Being involved in new music and a new journey is like, it's very unintentional, you know, what you do. And people recognize that. They can see that when, if you sit on the fence, you're going to get splinters. You know what I mean? That's what I say. And it's like, some people, they don't know whether they're going to be, go for it and sell out or they're just going to keep to their guns and not sell out, to use the word. You know You understand what I mean. And I think people knew that we got to where we were going very unintentionally and we stuck to our heart's content. We did it straight from the heart. We didn't really compromise. We didn't really try to make... radio music we didn't try to make pop arrangements we just did what we knew how to do whereas now I think I look at it like maybe now there is a lot of compromise going on people are making pop arrangements people are compromising their sound a bit but it works look how massive the music is now it's just gigantic it's filling stadiums and it's you know it's number one singles now it's like almost feel like we peaked too soon but at the same time still looking forward to to being a part of the journey sure and how did the journey progress then i mean you signed you signed as represent but you also had breakbeat era so the way that we kind of had it rolling was that When we was working with 4Cycle and Dope Dragon and with V recordings, we always worked sometimes as solo artists and sometimes we worked as pairs. Sometimes we worked as trios. I mean, sometimes we worked as quads. That's just the way it went. Me and Di was known as Scorpio. Myself and Krust was, you know, gang-related and Mask. And then, you know, myself and Suv and the Dope Dragon story. And we had... Different avenues. I was approached by Talking Loud. I knew that I didn't want to do this without my crew, without my people. So no matter what, we was always going to do it together. Myself, Dynamite, you know, Crust. We were all in it because they couldn't sign every one of us individually, but they signed myself and they signed Crust. So just to even it all out, we felt that myself and Dai had something to offer as well. So we approached XL and then we created Breakbeat Era. So we kind of like made sure that we didn't step on anyone's toes, but we had a lot of different avenues for our music as well as keeping our own independence. So for us, it was the master plan at the time. It was the art of being in many places at one time. And it's changed a lot now. There's only one Ronnie Size at the moment. So you can't be in, you know, 10 places at once. You can only be in one place at a time. So whereas before, I think we kind of... quite easy for us to be in different places. I mean, it showed immense faith in your own productivity. I mean, and you were all just rolling out the tunes at that point. So I guess you had a surplus. Me personally, I felt like I was being so prolific that it was almost starting to interfere in the progression of the people around me. And in hindsight, I don't think you should ever take a step back. When you're rolling, you keep rolling. You know what I mean? But as a label manager and as a people manager and someone who really tried to bring out the best of the people around them, then I feel like at the time it was the right thing to do and try to help other artists like Clips and Surge. and Tali and everyone on the label to try and help to get them to the next level. Clips, of course, who's now Red Light. Exactly. As a label manager, it was the right thing to do. But as a producer and as an artist, it was a stretch and I think I lost something along the way. I feel like now I'm playing catch up. you know, because of my commitment to others. And that's just the personal way I feel. And did Represent ever take over as well? Because, I mean, that was obviously the highest public profile. Absolutely. Represent... Took a toll on everyone because it was in the day when we didn't have laptops. So we couldn't really produce while we were away. So when we was away, there was a frustration that was set in. We were all toeing the same line and we had the same goals. But what would happen was we wasn't getting enough studio time. So we'd be away for a month and then by the time you get back, you're still tired from touring and DJing. The last thing you wanted to do was be in the studio. So yeah, it kind of, you know, it took its toll a little bit. Hence why we had to stop. Hence why we had to, you know, get new members in just so other people can continue with what they was doing and to better their... careers and at the end of the day represent was my baby you know I mean it was our baby but it was my name and we you know we we took it as far as we could as a unit but now you know I've got the the ball by the horns and you know, Represent is my baby now and Dynamite and Honorly, this is our babies, you know, that we want to be able to progress forward. Sure. So what was the kind of point where you really had to say, I'm stepping away from Represent? What really led to that? Well, I think the key thing for me was making sure that Crust had his main support. He had his album coming out on Talking Loud and he needed the backing of everyone. And I think when his album came out, we just wanted to support him. Whether it was with remixes, with DJing, we just wanted to make sure that we were behind him. We wanted his album to get the same attention that New Forms did, which was going to be a hard challenge because we'd won the fucking Mercury Prize. You know what I mean? So it was like anything less would have been deemed as pretty much not really a failure, but it was never going to eclipse, you know, what we had done. So just getting to a point where, of course... put his album out we started to put out a lot of compilations started to do a lot of DJing compilations as a unit but not really making an impact in the charts or not making not selling I think when the digital age changed the way that vinyl started to seep away and the whole way the industry changed we started to see a lot of differences. I think a lot of the way that we was DJing changed, so much changed. So that is when things started to really, this band, like when everybody started to focus more on what they were doing and not really focus on us as a unit. I think that's when things really changed. So it's really by the early 2000s? Around about 2004, you know, people wanted to start doing their own things. And that is what happened. I think Dynamite released an album. Daya started his own label. I think, you know, everyone started to just do their own thing. So it was just inevitable that these things was going to happen. Yeah, sure. And I mean, in the meantime as well, it was shortly after that, that kind of dubstep rose up as a new dominant force in bass music, if you like. all sorts of other trends younger generations were coming along and you know minimal techno and all of these well before that German bass was the new thing it was the new kid on the block and then as soon as dubstep came in German bass became old I think that was a culture shock to a lot of people who was making music, especially the whole way that we were selling like, you know, 10, 12,000 vinyls for good cash. And then that turned literally into MP3s for free. It's this transition, whereas dubstep was just rising and rising and rising. And it was like the little brother of German bass, but it was here to stay. I think it was a shock to German bass scene, the way that these crowds were, and some of the producers, some of the toughest producers in German bass scene were crossing over to dubstep. So I think everyone took a hit. But, you know, what goes around comes around. Were you ever tempted to do some 140 BPM? Absolutely. You know, I was, I think, one of the first, you know, German-based DJs to actually play a dubstep record at Brixton Academy. Played a track by Casper. a lot of people are a little bit confused but to me if it's got bass then and breaks i'm in you know it doesn't take much to get me involved but yeah i've been tempted i've i've rolled out some tunes i've not released anything but i've done some some different tempos with new forms i did different tempos with the new forms remix i did a different term so i've always liked messed around with those tempos but at the same time i was supporting joker who was very close to me at the time, it still is. Joker was someone that I've known since he was about eight years old. And I've seen him. He used to come into my studio and sit in the corner and just make tunes for fun. And I wanted to support him and his sound. And just to see it develop and just to see it open up was a great journey for me. and to know that I supported him. So for me, I felt like I was a part of the dubstep scene anyway. Without actually having my two pence in, I still had my involvement. So moving on to what you're producing now, you took a break, you stepped back from the studio, you're now up in London with a studio set up here. How did you start defining the sound that you were going to go for? Because it is quite electronic. It's quite influenced by kind of peak time drum and bass. You don't hear a lot of the old jazzy, ruddy size in it. Well, it's early days. And in this record, it was basically taking a step back. just from the limelight, but always being on my laptop or being in the studio, so to speak, but not with the intention of releasing any music. So for me, I was always making tunes, but not totally satisfied with these records. You know what I mean? Because I'm just that kind of guy. I'm a perfectionist in the sense that when I make a record and release it, I want it to be the best record ever. But I was DJing and I was playing a lot of these tunes out and Brian G was playing some of these tunes out. You know, they were just fillers for my DJing set. But then what would happen was I would get a lot of, you know, punters or a lot of the kids in the crowd or even some DJs come up to me and say, oh Ronnie, what's going on with this tune? Oh, what's going on with that tune? I started to see like a common thread here of something was going on and all the tunes they were asking for I goes well they're never coming out they're just tunes I just made then once I started to put it all together I thought well actually this album is basically you know an album of special requests every track on this record is something which someone has asked me about made in korea but people email ask me about that power you know it's a record that everyone asks me about so many times you know mishmash people ask me about that there's even a couple which i've made which i've just just to email to people Which hasn't come out yet, but hopefully I'll put out on the next Take Control or whatever I decide to call it. But this album became an album of special requests. And it was, for me, the influence of the last 10 years of drum and bass. You know, as well as being a fan of the full cycle sound and the deal-jacking sound, I also like people like... I like some of his early work. I like some of the early Pendulum tunes. I like, you know, some of the stuff that's on Ram and some of the stuff that's on all these other labels and, you know, the modern day sound. I don't love all of it, but what I do like, I get inspired by. And I take it and I try to do my version because everyone has to be inspired by something. You can't just go into a room by yourself and just... just magic something. It's great to be inspired. That's why we live and we breathe on this planet. We want to be, back in the day, we used to inspire each other. We used to put on old hip hop records and old jazz records and get inspired from that. So there was no high concept behind these tunes. They were aimed square at the dance floor then. Absolutely square at the dance floor. Apart from maybe a track on there called Keep On with J. Will Cox. which is just me working with a great singer-songwriter. There's another track called Save Me, which didn't make the album, but is a record which I can't wait for people to hear because it is such a musical journey. It's fantastic. It's a great single record. And yeah, really, this was for the dance floor. And it was a way of me being able to... to reintroduce myself into an audience who's never heard of Ronnie Sides. Let's get it straight. Do you know what I mean? It's like a bunch of 16 to 21 year olds who, you know, you mention my name, they say, who? They go, you got a SoundCloud. I'll give you SoundCloud. Did the decision to start putting these tunes out and the decision to put Represent back together, was that simultaneous? Did one come before the other? I think the bigger question is the decision to actually put Full Cycle to bed. You know, I love Full Cycle and I still hope to reinvent it some way and to bring it back and to bring that sound back again with a new twist and a new modern, you know, energy. I look forward to doing that. But at the moment, my immediate mindset is about... trying to be mansion sounds and trying to get myself back on the stage as a live band because I love that. That is the one thing, you know, it always gets me right in the belly of my stomach. Being up on stage with eight people and all being like-minded and have to become one, a drop of a hat is something which is a real challenge. Putting Full Cycle, leaving my past behind, is very difficult because we spent many years building up a great label and a great palette of music and I don't want it to end. We've got all these DAT tapes on the floor of all this unreleased music still, which I want to try and some way get out to the loyal fans of the label. And hopefully I can do that in some way. And so what's the thing you're most immediately looking forward to getting on the stage? Well, we've got three shows for Represent coming this year, two which have been sold out. We've got one in Manchester, which is a great lineup with Andy C. David Roddigan, Shia Fex. So we have that. And then we have a Bristol show. And, you know, I'm hoping that Bristol is going to come out and they're going to rep and support. So my immediate things at the moment, yeah, is getting up on stage. And we have Take Control, which comes out this week on the 25th of August, which I'm really... you know, I'm happy about, but I'm really hungry and I can't wait for it just to hit the shelves and then to get into the represent. The album's called Do It For The Masses. It's going to be very musical. It's going to be a cross between, you know, the modern day sound and as well, we're going to try and go back and still recreate what we had back then and try and keep it raw and still try and keep it. you know, quite spontaneous. At the same time, we do want to be on main stages at festivals and we want to be selling out clubs and, you know, be headlining shows. So we do have to make sure that we have those radio hits and we do want to be, you know, we want to be up there. We're the best of them. Wow. You still like to set yourself a challenge then. Absolutely. I wouldn't be in this. I wouldn't have come back this way if I didn't. feel it was right. It's taken me a few years just to try and put the right team together. Saying that with no disrespect to the teams that I've used in the past, they've been fantastic and they've all made the journey more worth it. Working with Gerrard from Red Light Management and working with Simon Goff and Heavyweight Management. I've learned a lot and they've been loyal friends as well as being working companions. But now, you know, the reason why take control is take control is because I am now in full control of my own destiny. You know, I'm handpicking everyone that's working with me. very very fortunate to be surrounded by a lot of hungry people and you know i am in full control there is no middleman you know you're talking to the head honcho right here about what it is i'm trying to do there is no no one else down the line if you want to know what's going on come come speak to me that's that's where it is whereas before i think there was probably a bit of a production line of people who we had to go through whereas now I'm taking control and it feels good to be in control of my whole future music music music music
