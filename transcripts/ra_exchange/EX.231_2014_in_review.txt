so I'll be looking for you. Don't look at yourself, come on. Is there a big name that you've ever needed in your life? Okay, so hello welcome to the 2014 year-end review you've hopefully noticed for the past couple of weeks We've been publishing the results of our year-end polls on the site So there are six of these in total and our top DJs and live acts are decided by our readers submitting their top fives of the year And the remainder of the polls, which includes labels, mixes and compilations, albums and tracks, are voted on by RA staff and contributors. In addition to all these lists, a few of us get together at the end of the year, like we are now, to discuss who and what we were feeling over the past 12 months and to generally reflect on the results. So we're in Berlin this afternoon and I'm joined by RA's associate editor, Will Lynch. Hey, Will. Hey. RA's music tech editor, Jordan Rothlein. Hey, how's it going? And one of RA's key contributors, Angus Finlayson. Hello. So generally speaking, speaking we structured this conversation to reflect the way the polls are presented on the site so to begin with we'll be discussing some of our favorite DJs of the year there's something of an inner vision suite this year we had Dixon topping the list came in at number three and there were DJs like Tale of Us and Mano Latuf who are kind of associated with the label also in the top 10 So I wanted to start by asking if we thought that Dixon was a worthy winner for the second year in a row. I would say so. There are DJs who I like more personally, but I really do think that in terms of like... a guy going out there in the world and being sort of tasked with being the world's best DJ. He's done a very good job of it. The music he plays is still quite good, by and large. He seems to kind of like take the crazy schedule in stride and his outfits are still out of control. So I would say he's, I mean, basically he's still Dixon despite being mega Dixon. Yeah, one thing I would say is it's impossible to say if this is because of the number one DJ thing or just like a natural progression. But I feel like in the years I've been seeing Dixon, he's sort of moved further and further into this thing of like. more and more Dixon. The first time I saw him, he was sort of like all over the shop, like in a good way, like playing loads of different stuff and like different labels, different eras. And it all just kind of came together in this, you know, cool dynamic history of different sounds or whatever. And now it's sort of like really homing in on this kind of essence of inner visions. I saw him twice this year at Nocte Cattell Festival and at Space. And both times it was like pretty much everything could have been on inner visions, whether it was or not. I'm sort of tempted to wonder if that's like when you play that often. if it just sort of naturally kind of gets whittled down into like more of a routine or something like that. And I also know he's really, it's very important to him. the transitions all work in this kind of mechanical elegant way that you know very seamless and whatnot i wonder if his rise is almost in turn given rise to this type of music being made so like maybe five ten years ago he just like couldn't get the records that he would want to play and you know just the the success of innovations has meant that more producers are like doubling in this style right like for me it sort of makes him a bit less interesting i feel like for other people this could be part of what gives him a distinct identity and what makes him you know sort of like like when dixon's on it's completely unmistakable that this is dixon djing like that he has such a palpable style it's very much his For me personally, I liked him more when it was a bit more like a few more curveballs and like it felt a little bit dicier. Yeah, I mean, I did. I definitely did too. I think he has potentially less to offer now to big time music nerds. to the guys who were sort of scratching their chins in the back, there aren't as many curveballs. It is a little bit more straightforward and aesthetically consistent. I don't know. I guess maybe he plays like a guy who doesn't necessarily have to prove to himself anymore that he's like a great DJ and plays great music and can do these crazy things. He kind of plays like somebody who is like, okay, I know that I have great taste in music and I'm a good DJ, but I can really give people what they want and I'm going to give that to them. And there's something I kind of like about that, you know? And I think he does it pretty well. Yeah. I mean, I think if you analyze the psychology behind the vote, it seems like his story is one that people would really want to get behind. You know, there's a guy who's known for being like. you know, very careful and professional in what he does. He had this slow build from a local DJ to an international name. And, you know, when he was voted number one last year, it felt like a, you know, a brilliant culmination of that. And I think people, you know, whereas maybe in years past when you've had people like Seth, Jamie, Richie Horton who you know were all worthy winners but I think maybe what you saw in the year following was like a reaction to that whereas I don't think we got this year people weren't like oh god Dixon you know he seems to be like a less polarizing figure maybe than some of the excuse me some of the number ones we've had in recent years yeah there's definitely something to be said for a distinct feeling that Dixon deserves to be number one people that wouldn't go out of their way to see him like i think in most cases would agree um yeah number one material and you can always tell with these things when people can't they maybe won't agree with the number one but in turn they can't offer an alternative number one Right. So what we're going to do now is just to go around the room and talk about some of the kind of like highlight DJ performances for all of us this year. Angus, I was going to start with you as you highlighted a veteran UK. Indeed, which is Sergin. I mean, I often struggle deciding on my favourite. DJ in a given year because with a few exceptions often these are you know people that you've only seen perform once maybe twice in that year and as anyone who kind of goes out regularly will know enjoying a DJ set is about so much more than the DJ and is about many factors that are actually kind of out of their control so I actually saw Surgeon twice this year. I saw him at Deck Mantle playing this kind of hybrid modular synth setup that he's been working on recently and really didn't enjoy it very much at all. But I also saw him on New Year's Eve, or kind of more specifically the small hours of New Year's Day in Amsterdam, where I was living at the time. And it just, everything kind of came together. I mean, I think circumstances were kind of adverse. Amsterdam does a good line in kind of industrial clubbing and this was a huge kind of warehouse on the edge of town you know to get in you kind of walk through miles of metal fencing and then there's like a pat down and a metal detector and then a queue for the clothes lockers and then queue for tokens to go to the toilet and more tokens to get drinks and so on and so on. You know, it's kind of very much this kind of organised fun vibe, which, you know, isn't the best frame of mind to be in. But kind of in spite of that, he just really delivered in this incredibly satisfying way. You know, everything that I'd hoped that surgeon on New Year's Eve would be, it really was. The moment that really stand out to me was... when he played Agnes de Meyers' The Object track, which has this kind of absurd, like, sort of grinding breakdown. And Surgeon, you know, is very impassive behind the decks or behind his laptop most of the time. But at this moment, he kind of raised one arm and, like, slowly clenched his fist. And it was just the most ridiculous, like, silly moment, but it was clearly so sincere, you know. Yeah, that really stayed with me. How much were you finding that he was kind of stepping outside of the techno canon? I didn't see him play a DJ set this year, but I think something that's been notable to me in years past is his, like, the way he cherry picks from bass music and, you know, different areas. Less so. I mean, I don't know if it was because of the setting. You know, Amsterdam is a techno city. Certainly that kind of a night definitely was. And, you know, people have expectations about the sort of 3 to 5 a.m. set on New Year's Eve. He did kind of, just before the lights came up, played like about 10 minutes of Hardcore Rave, which was very satisfying. I saw him a lot a few years ago when he was kind of... drawing in a new generation of fans by playing dubstep and kind of mixing that in with what he was doing but it definitely wasn't as kind of recombinant as that Will your pick or picks were connected to a trip to Detroit you took in the middle of the year? Yeah, it was Carlos Soufrant and Patrick Russell at the No Way Back party. Actually, in a way, it's a funny choice because Mike Servito also played that party and he was kind of the like really, really explosive one at the, I don't know, that night. He just, you know, his set had just kind of a, I don't know, feeling of an incredible sense of occasion. It was just like everyone there would agree that he was probably the best one. But Carlos Souffrant and Patrick Russell, which I guess I should give a bit of background. It's like No Way Back. is this sort of Detroit tradition. I guess I've had it in Detroit and New York. It started by BMG, who runs the label Interdimensional Transmissions. And it's like this crew of five guys or so. It's usually Derek Pleslikow, Patrick Russell, Mike Servito, Carlos Sufrant, BMG. The idea is just like they just all kind of bring their A game. And for each of them, this is the most important set of the year. which it's interesting that you can sort of just, you know, decide that that's the case and everyone thinks of it that way. And I don't know, everyone does a really, really good job. It's basically a tiny, the place is this very small, very, very hot room in the back of a cafe in Detroit, which I don't know if I say coincidentally, but interestingly enough is the former side of the music Institute, which is like the. club where kind of, I guess, Detroit's techno scene sort of first came together and people were seeing Derek May and guys who come from Chicago, Derek Carter and whatnot and play there. Anyway, yeah, there's just kind of a feeling at that party of what I described before is like small room techno where it's like totally techno, but you know, you're playing to a pretty intimate crowd in a small room. And so you can't have this like, you know, in a big venue, you can rely on atmosphere and these long drawn out passages. And this is more like, it's pretty much just like constant delivery. Like there has to be another really exciting hi-hat pattern, you know, every 16 bars or something. And anyway, Carlos Soufrant and Patrick Russell. really was cool to me, or I guess kind of pandered to my personal taste, the way they, it was like party techno in a really interesting way, like just kind of really riotous, just constant pleasure delivery of this like massive techno. And then with these sort of interesting, like new wave tracks thrown in or like kind of like oddly disco-ish or, but, um, It was interesting, you know, I feel like as a DJ, sort of part of the subtle nature of the art is to, I don't know, create this unique sort of tone or something. The way the music was so serious for the most part, but then at the same time had a feeling, like kind of had a sense of humor and was very like fun. oriented or something. I mean, the first track was the IF, I Do Because I Couldn't Care Less. It's just the most like, absurd, like raunchy, almost like offensively harsh techno track. But yeah, and also I love this. One of my favorite mixes ever is Carlos Sufran at this party in New York, Kiss and Tell, where he basically just plays like Wave and Left Field Disco and kind of post-punk records. Yeah, at this party, he was somehow working that sort of stuff in between these just like punishing techno tracks. Yeah, and funny enough, I talked to him later in the night and I told him I love that mix. And I was like, yeah, I know that's kind of a themed mix, but it's like one of my favorite mixes. And he's like, you know, the funny thing is like, it's kind of more like the techno sets are themed sets. Like that one is just me putting on records that I wanted. That was actually more sincere than most of my, you know, techno sets. But yeah, anyway, it was just, yeah, great music, great party. And I think also anything that has a sort of added dimension that like. for the artists themselves this is like they've been looking forward to it all year both in terms of what they're going to play and how fun it's going to be and even just the regular party stuff like who's going to be there and um it's the same thing with like free rotation labyrinth there are these certain events that have this sense of occasion where it's not only that the it's not that it's fun that the crowd likes it it's like for everyone involved this is like you know Christmas or something do either of those guys uh tour internationally not too much they're kind of like I mean there's sort of a fascinating little not little I guess quite big sort of group of DJs from Detroit that are really just like unbelievably talented and for whatever reason um It just, they never got vaulted into, you know, some kind of wider orbit of popularity. Like Mike Servito is kind of an example of it where, um, Like when we did that feature earlier in the year, everyone's response, if you look at the comments, a lot of other DJs are like, all right, finally, like this is, you know, like finally this guy's getting some recognition. Like they've been doing this for decades amazingly well. And it's, they basically, it seems like they mostly just played Detroit, maybe like a bunker party in New York and, you know, a few random gigs like that. Jordan, in many ways, your pick was quite the opposite of Will's. There's someone close to home to you here in Berlin and a kind of new kid on the block. Yeah, yeah, for sure. I picked Cabo Sil, who I guess I had been hearing sort of all year. In fact, I think since the Sylvester party at Berghain, so like last New Year's Eve. I'd heard from a lot of people that sort of since that point on that he's like really one of the guys to see at Bearkind right now. He's great. You know, as it often is with DJs who are playing at Bearkind all the time, it's like finding a moment when you can actually like be in the club at the right time when they're playing because the times are so weird, like 9 p.m. on a Sunday or something. And a couple of months ago, I finally caught him and It was really impressive. He's extremely young and he's from Berlin. He's from Neukölln. Yeah, his set had a fantastic energy to it. There would be some very, very hard techno moments, but then some moments that almost felt like a little poppy or like more fun. older records or like kind of bigger ravey records. You know, the mixing wasn't all completely perfect. Like sometimes it was still obvious that he's like a relatively young DJ. He's kind of still getting his start, but the energy was great. Like the crowd was eating it up and he just had really great presence in the room. I guess. it reminded me a little bit, although musically in a completely different way of when I had first started seeing redhead play around Berlin, like someone who just. gets techno in a way that feels very Berlin and is then just able to deliver that so well. I don't know. He's someone I'm extremely excited to see more of. He's putting out good records too. Where would you put him on the Bergheim Grimm scale? Well, I mean, who's the grimmest person who plays Bear? Definitely Norman Nodge. Yeah, I would put him more at the Detman end. Maybe not quite as much fun as Boris or something, but you know. My pick was Object, who for the second year running was my favourite thing. I saw it free rotation. I actually saw him play twice this year. Once, one of those times was fairly recently at the Pan event at Berghain. We kind of were waiting out till seven in the morning to hear him play like a 140 BPM electro set, which was kind of... thrilling its own way but I think kind of going back to what Will was saying like the sense of occasion connected to it and like evidently how seriously he was taking this set really shone through. It was in the second room, which for a lot of people is like the preferred space. We've definitely talked about it in past exchanges, but it's kind of this rectangular carpeted room with like mirrored surfaces and a huge chandelier. So the weather was very good that weekend. It was extremely hot. I chose to wear tight black jeans for some reason. So it was like in major discomfort throughout the entire thing. He just really had me from the beginning. I think the first 20 to 30 minutes were kind of very strong, but it was kind of going through the motions. But then he built up to this effect where I've seen it through rotation a few times. Someone like Made Up Sam will come to mind, but you get this like a sense of expectation from the crowd where the DJ is like one-upping themselves the entire time. It's not so much like peached and troughs. It's just this like. gradual increasing energy you're able to reflect in real time with the person next to you like how's he going to top that oh man oh no he didn't oh and you know he just keeps doing it but I think his way of resetting the energy and this was definitely the best moment I still haven't figured out quite what he was doing whether he was playing a track just extremely slowly or it was something he produced like for the set but he reduced the tempo to like more than half of what he was playing so it slowed down to a crawl and then he built up with this like enormous rising kind of whooshing sound he did that a couple of times the whole thing probably lasted about five minutes but he completely reset the energy of the room so everybody's kind of scratching their heads but then like slowly started teasing out gansfeld like which at the time like nobody had really heard the way he kind of like pronounced that so like emphatically you know just really really emphasized the power of the track and You know, if anybody's heard the track, it kind of like grinds into gears slowly and kind of in the way that Angus was describing with the... one surgeon played but um yeah when the kick dropped it was just absolute chaos but yeah from there he was getting into more uh classic electro bits lots of like ranked techno and um you know the intensity was just gradually building he was taking care over the tempo a lot as well which is something i think djs kind of forget to do a lot of the time like you know, they're just set on 120 BPM for the entire thing, but it was a definite sense of progression. So yeah, I did vote for him as my mum born DJ and he's definitely one of my favourite producers. I think he's someone who's kind of very cleverly navigated this kind of relationship between productions and his DJing. Because I guess these days, so much of like our relationship with artists is like... You'll hear someone's productions and then you'll go out to see them based on this. And I think he's someone who, well, he doesn't play necessarily like all of his tracks don't sound like his records. He's someone who kind of expands upon and makes sense of his production. It's kind of like, here's what I make and these are the reasons why I make it. You know, these are the producers that kind of feed into this effect. And he came in the top 100 this year, which I was kind of thrilled about. I think he was like 87 or something. I generally think he's a force to be reckoned with. I remember he did a kind of what's in my record bag interview with the Guardian at some point this year, where one of the selections was the record that you would play to save a dance floor, you know, when things are going badly. And he, I don't think through arrogance, said one of my own tracks, because this always seems to be what people are there for. And I feel like there is, with producers like Objects, there is this kind of tension almost between what the crowd want, which often is just like, you know, greatest hits Objects set. And what he wants to do, which as you say, is to kind of contextualize those tracks and use them in a more sparing way. And I think he does navigate that well. Often when I've seen him play, it will be just at the right point, just at that peak moment that he'll play something. of his that you know will really kind of get things going i think it says something that you know when you consider that he's playing like classic electro he's been known to frequently drop things like ortega apex twin and his tracks are still the highlights of the set you know or they're at least comparable to to all these classics that he's kind of incorporating i think really says something about how much he's killing it at the moment yeah i think also he's one of these guys that like kind of what you're saying the relationship between his tracks and his uh dj sets it's like object occupies a very distinct kind of musical universe or something it's like different from everyone else and it's almost it's like everything emanating from him whether it's like from his record bag or from his you know his own productions it all kind of has this you know, certain quality that's kind of hard to put your finger on, but is very, very much his. Yeah, I think for me, that's something that sort of brackets somebody, sets them apart. as something kind of like truly remarkable, truly special in some way. Yeah, I mean, I think even on a bass level, it's important to point out that the kind of basis of his set is electro. I mean, how many electro DJs did he see this year? I saw DJ Stingray at Dimensions play for like 30 minutes or something, but I think the core of his sound is like it does stand apart. from what's out there. Crucially too, it's like electro, for lack of a better term, like DJ Stingray, he's an electro DJ object. It's like electro maybe gets closest to it, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, yeah, I mean, I think, you know, this is a truism really, but... If you're going to DJ all over the world every weekend, I feel like it's kind of important to have something to say, which other people wouldn't be saying, particularly at the moment. This sort of dance music industry being what it is, there are lots of aspirant DJs and lots of people who gig a lot, who maybe have a lot to say in their productions, but as DJs... you know, they deliver to a satisfactory level, but if they never DJed again, the world wouldn't, you know, suffer. It's a means to an end, basically. So it's nice to have somebody who is so known for their productions, but also as a DJ really actually present something. I guess in a way, this is what we were saying about Dixon, where it's like when you offer something, like when you play a certain way. That's unmistakably, you know, you that in itself is, you know, quality. The vast majority of TJs don't have. I think that was the last line of my blurb. That's subconsciously plagiarizing. Okay, so let's move on and talk about some of our favorite live acts of the year. Jordan, I was going to come to you first. You picked Aurora Halal, someone you wrote a breaking through feature on this year. Yeah, well, the whole idea, I mean, the reason that I pitched the feature was basically based on the strength of that live set. Yeah, I saw her play at Stadtbad this summer. That's a club here in Berlin. I had sort of gone into it like having heard of Aurora Hall. I knew that she was starting to put out records. She was starting to tour a bit more. I was aware of her when I was living in New York a couple of years ago. But I just sort of, I don't know, I wasn't really thinking that this would be a good idea. end up being the highlight of the night but it certainly was she was playing techno but it was fun it was like listening to someone making techno sort of who was getting excited about techno who maybe hadn't been into techno for her entire life but that was almost a good thing the rhythms were really fun there was a certain buoyancy to the to the whole set It was like the music was quite dark, but the room felt pretty light. She sort of transitioned at some point into playing a DJ set and it was basically seamless. Like it didn't feel like it was weird that she was doing one thing before and then was immediately moving into the other thing. And I think for me, it just sort of showed that she's a real mastery of this music, but it's also able to come at it from sort of a place of wonder. And I don't know, you just, you don't experience that so much. Like she just didn't seem to be caught up in any particular element of it other than like the pleasure of the thing itself. So what was it from a gay standpoint? Like what was she using? Well... She told me during the interview that she's mostly using like an MPC. There are a lot of samples that she's using. You know, it's definitely kind of has a hardware aesthetic to it. You know, it's not the way that a lot of these sort of hardware producers from New York might sound, which is like kind of rough. dusty, whatever that means, but that's usually something that we seem to use when we're talking about this stuff. It was very direct. It wasn't so much gear. It definitely wasn't like gear porn or anything like that. You got the sense that she had just kind of the right amount of stuff and was squeezing everything she could out of all of it. Well, you've gone for the knife. Yeah, I just saw them on their recent tour. I guess it was their last or so they said. But it was kind of a... I had the same experience when I saw Bjork a few years ago where seeing the knife, hearing the songs they played made me realize whether I knew it or not. They've sort of been with me for like a really long time and they're... kind of one of the key bands of it sounds a bit much just like of our generation or something but like Silent Shout came out when I was um in college and I've never felt like a um to any pronounced extent like a big Knife fan I just like think they're cool or whatever but yeah standing there at that concert um I was sort of surprised at how I knew so many of the songs and really had like a developed relationship with most of them like a sort of like a history with them and um i guess i didn't understand the premise of the tour that that this was in my head i was picturing it to be all stuff from shaking the habitual but it was quite career spanning you know they played um we share our mother's health pass this on and um just kind of like old classics i guess But they all sounded dramatically different to the extent where I think they were kind of teasing you where like you'd have this moment of thinking like, do I know what this is? And like when they played Silent Shout. which is the final track, the melody and the verse was just entirely different, but you recognize the words. And so everyone's in this sort of, in this lurch of like, it was just cool the way they kind of toyed with the crowd, but also the other sort of main, or maybe the most important detail of the whole thing is this sort of theatrical element where they've got this troop of dancers on stage and it's completely unclear i'm sure you could figure it out but which ones are the actual you know the actual duo of the knife and um kind of rotating cast of people will act like the front man or the front woman at various times, again, sort of like intentionally sort of teasing the audience or something. Just before the concert, maybe a couple weeks earlier, I'd done this interview with Fred Friedman, where he was talking about sort of his qualms with live acts in general. He had a point that kind of stuck with me where he said, the reason a stage is a stage like the reason it has the dimensions that it has is for choreography so you know the same way like a podium is the shape of one person because one person can just stand there and speak and they need a little surface for their notes or whatever like the stage was designed just as specifically to have 10 or more people moving around a lot it's sort of a historical accident that like then bands were on stages because they were in theaters where there had been plays and stuff. And now you have a DJ on a stage and it's actually not, you know, so things aren't, yeah, they're not compatible at all. So I thought it was interesting that I have no idea if this is why they did it or, you know, but the fact that then when you're seeing the knife, it makes you realize, um, it's almost like they saw a situation of We're going to be performing in these big venues on a stage. And so they didn't neglect that. They sort of accepted that challenge. How can we really take full advantage of this? And it was just a lot more kind of... rewarding than seeing like, you know, even just a band standing there or something like the whole format of the whole thing was sort of cleverly different from a normal concert. Like they had the guy doing the weird aerobics thing to begin with. And then the knife came on immediately. Like there was no break. Yeah. They finished their set. They played silent shout. And then they just said that a DJ would take over from right then. and the rest would just be like a dance party. So there was never like, there was a last track, but there wasn't this dramatic like, wanting the band to come out for an encore or anything like that. It just went straight into a DJ set and everyone just kept dancing. Anyway, it was just cool. They sort of tweaked the whole scenario of seeing a concert in these, you know, small but effective ways. And they were just sort of, to an impressive extent, kind of thinking clearly about like... what can we do to make this as good as possible, you know, and not taking anything for granted in terms of the tradition of how concert works. Yeah. I mean, it's striking when you take a step back, just how set in stone, the procedures connected to a concert on. Yeah. I don't know. The whole thing was, um, the music was great. All the, the, the visual side of it, the theatrical side of it was also like really fun. And I guess it just kind of left me with a feeling of like, this is a pretty essential group or like, you know, it's, this is one of those groups that is, you know, particularly kind of, I don't know, creatively like it's fucking good, man. It's sort of funny to me that so much of the criticism that's been leveled at them for this live show for as long as they've been doing it, which I guess is like a year and a half or something like that, was, you know, that, oh, they're probably not actually like playing any of the music on stage or something. I could never really believe that. I mean, even from people who were like there, I'm like. But they're doing so much else on stage. And the fact is they made an album that probably was basically, you know, could not be reproduced in the live sphere. So why not? Why not even try? Like, why go through the motions of having like an Ableton set, you know, where basically you. you're just sort of pressing play on like kind of large chunks of the set. Like these guys are actually on stage working, like working their asses off to, to actually deliver this music, to present this music in an incredibly interesting way. And I also like how in their own way, they're quite provocative. Like for instance, with another thing people said was they're like, yeah, it was annoying. Like you couldn't even tell which one was Olaf and which one was Ken. but then when you're watching it and you're like, Oh wait, maybe that's her. Oh no, that's where, maybe that's where the corn rose. And then you're sort of like, why do I actually care? Like what satisfaction would I get? sure like that's the knife that's the two of them you know and um it sort of challenges that notion in kind of a playful way and then also i guess more significantly of any kind of relatively popular band no one has sort of brought up sexuality and gender issues in the way that they have and sort of like you know really thrust it into the center of um you know, their lyrics and the overall presentation and everything, which is also I think fairly significant in its own way. I mean, you know, when, when something appears in art, especially kind of pop culture, that's sort of like validating it as like an issue that's on everyone's minds that everyone is thinking about. And yeah, I think can't think of a band that sort of other than the knife that I don't know, sort of tackled all that or sort of like put that out there. It's interesting too. If you look back. Their older records, those themes are still there, but they just hadn't turned it into like this overt focus yet. Yeah, that stuff has always been this sort of thread through everything they've done. And now they're no more. Yeah. Okay, Angus, do you want to talk us through your pick for this year? Yeah, my pick is a band called Nisen and Mondai, which is a Japanese trio, guitar, bass and drums trio. And I'd been kind of dimly aware of the band for a while. I mean, they'd been around for, I think, going on a decade. And I kind of pegged them as coming from a kind of a post-punk. or a kind of cosmiche angle, I mean, which they do. I mean, they play just these kind of extended, linear, groove-based, sort of riff-based compositions. There's very little to them, but it's very hypnotic, very much in a sort of cam mould or something like that. But I saw them at Sonar, where obviously they were... surrounded by electronic acts and DJs. You know, at the time when they played most of the other stages, it was the day part of the festival, but most of the other stages, there was kind of dance music, you know, pumping out. And in that context, it just suddenly became so clear that sort of on one level, this music is like a kind of a live minimal techno, basically, or something like that. You know, the kind of extremely ascetic, minimalist approach is really exactly the same as the kind of most extreme minimal technique that you can think of. But what was interesting was how the introduction... human error the fact that it was people trying to like hold down these grooves for 15 20 25 minutes the same thing just around and around like really actually kind of enhanced rather than compromised the kind of minimalism of it because that tension between the kind of the physical inability to perfectly repeat this pattern And these kind of incredibly long structures, you know, it's just really dynamic and exciting. You almost find yourself willing them on, don't you? Exactly, yeah, yeah. Because you're waiting for when that snare's going to hit. Well, there was a kind of a, you know, one of those fabled moments where the hi-hat came in and the entire room kind of exploded, you know, because it was just so exciting that this one tiny thing had changed. And it was just really, really exciting. But I think it does need to be seen live. I mean, they were playing material from N, which is the album that came out last year. It's good on record, but I think you have to see it performed to really kind of engage with it and understand it fully. I went for The Bug this year. I think it's been like an extremely important... important artist to me particularly this year I definitely had a relationship or a long-standing relationship with his music I saw him at Unsound I'd seen him actually the year before at Unsound as part of King Midas Sound which is a group whose album I was really feeling about when it was like five years ago now But anyway, the approach he kind of takes with King Midas sound is like, you know, for anybody who doesn't know the album, you know, it's kind of like Smokey Soul and Dubb, Lovers Rock, that kind of thing. And they sort of take that tempate and like extrapolate on it. So, you know, everything's ramped up. There's lots of like feedback and distortion and, you know, it takes the tracks as a basis, but then like amplifies them. Whereas the difference with The Bug is that in the main, like the music that Kevin Martin makes is The Bug is really fricking rowdy. I think the interesting thing with this show in particular was that it was riffing on the album that came out earlier this year, which is his second record is The Bug. And the album was kind of structured in this, was roughly split in two. So you had the kind of like more ambient. kind of relative but like more ambient softer down tempo stuff in the first half of the record and then all of the tear out shit in the second half and by and large the live show was structured in this way so for the first sort of 20-25 minutes you just had this like very gradual like slow build lots of like swirling sounds like no bass at all and um the room was like completely completely filled with smoke so Liz Harris who was the first of I think five guest appearances like you actually couldn't see her while she was performing I think the track's void from the album but it gradually you got the sense that what he was doing okay yeah he was riffing on the album but he was also like really fucking with people you know it was a main stage Friday night performance He just followed Jam City. It all felt a bit flat and the whole room was there for the taking. But people were growing pretty disconcerted. Some of the people around me left. They just couldn't tolerate not being there. not having the immediacy, you know, not going from it from the start, but the payoff was spectacular. You know, anybody who's seen him, any of his groups knows that like he pushes sound systems to within an inch of their life. And, you know, Unsound is one of those festivals that has the infrastructure to handle an artist like him. But he was running through some of the like big tracks, like the one Fat Mac. he was dipping into London Zoo classics but it kind of took on the air of like a DJ performance as well so he's rewinding tracks like you know MC's hyping the crowd and stuff I think probably the most notable thing something I said in my review as well was that like at one point a mosh pit kind of got thrown up like in the front three rows and if you've been to one sound festival like you know, people get quite drunk and, you know, they're definitely into it, but like a mosh pit, something you definitely wouldn't associate with the festival. I think overall, I just, because I wrote a feature on him as well this year and I just came away with like an enormous amount of respect for kind of. of what he tries to achieve and the means that he, you know, he does so. He's someone who's very, very demanding and specific about his live rig. I don't know any of like the specifics of what he requires, but I know he's cancelled shows in the past, just, you know, on the day of the concert because things weren't up to standard. And, you know, when you see these things come together from the way that the strobes are positioned, with the intensity of the strobes, with the volume of smoke, with like the way that the sound is handling. you kind of get why he would be so exact about the way that it's presented. It's interesting because he, I mean, he shares that kind of specificity regarding all aspects of his live setup with the band Sun, who also are kind of famous for being able to supply these incredibly immersive, intense kind of visceral experiences. And I think it's something that's really valuable, but also, you know, I think it's easy to fail to appreciate the sacrifice that these artists are making and doing that because you're constantly alienating the people who've booked you, the crowds that you cancel on, constantly having to like fight with people to get your way, basically. And so, which I think is why the majority of artists understandably, you know, accept that some things are just out of their hands and just work with what they have. You know, the majority of artists will just see it in that way. But, you know, it is nice to know that there are these artists who will kind of go to great lengths to try and control these other aspects of their performance. It's like taking the path of most resistance. Yeah, I mean, I think as well, it's something that kind of gets overlooked. But I think lots of what kind of defines him and drives him is just the simple pleasure of hearing really, really heavy music really loud. Like, how many times do you go to a show and like, that's the central theme? I think why it kind of comes to life is that this isn't just noise for the sake of noise. you know he's a guy who writes killer hooks and you know there's all like great vocal performances like in a way if you if you strip some of the more extreme elements away from it you've got pretty accessible music like you know it gets pretty um stabby and belligerent and stuff in places but you know this has accessible elements i think the collision of those two things is like really impressive that's why it's one of my favorites Alright, let's discuss some of our favourite record labels of the year. Angus, you've gone for Mood Hut, which is a kind of collective and label that's been on a few people's radars this year. Yeah, well maybe... At some angle, that's kind of a clichéd choice for me. I mean, in any given year, us journalists, we have a few labels that we talk about a lot and like to get excited by. This year, Mood Hut was one of those labels. I mean, they actually kind of surfaced last year, and I think arguably, in terms of the records released on the Mood Hut label, they were perhaps slightly stronger last year than they were this year, although... The Jack J record that they released in the summer is one of my favourite records of the year. But as you said, it's a collective, it's not just a label. And what it's been nice to observe this year is the collective kind of expanding outwards and engaging more with the kind of wider dance music world because... When they appeared, what was partly so intriguing about them was that they were incredibly fully formed and this sort of convincing collective aesthetic shared across a lot of different artists that just seemed to suddenly be there, you know, for the taking. It wasn't really clear at all who was behind what. There were sort of more questions than there were answers. And that's kind of still the case. They don't really do press. I tried to interview them once about the label and they wouldn't let me. This year they've kind of, they've released some other labels like PPU, Future Times, All Caps. going good and a few of them pender street steppers and i think hashman dj came over to europe in the summer did a few festivals did a boiler room and so on and kind of began that process of like getting themselves out there but it was nice to see how they didn't there's been no kind of dilution of what they're about in the process of doing that you know all of the records that they released on these other labels have been of a very high quality and it's still very clear what they're trying to do. Outside of the sort of elusiveness, what is it as a journalist that kind of excites you and interests you about? Well, you know, I frequently complain about artists who like cultivate a kind of elusive air. I don't think that in itself is desirable. And actually it kind of annoyed me to an extent that I really wanted to find out about this music and I couldn't. So I don't think it's that that draws me in. It really is just the... the extent to which they've created a convincing kind of hermetic world. I mean, a lot of the aliases that they have, reading between the lines, are kind of shared between actually quite a small pool of producers. You know, they kind of have this like Hall of Mirrors effect where you think there are more artists doing it than there are. But they've kind of created all these different characters that sort of populate this universe. make sense together in a very satisfying way. Yeah, I think with them, the thing that I really like about listening to their music is it's very hard to place in time. There will be some things, like you mentioned, like the Jack Jay record, which has this kind of like Theo Parrish or like disco kind of feel to it. Some of the Pender Street Steppers stuff. also has this feeling like it could have been older dance music from the 80s or 90s or something, but there'll be these little production touches that sound very futuristic, like there'll be some little drum part that's morphing and changing pitch or something, almost in the way that something on PC music would do or something like this. Yeah, you can't say like, this is an old school record and you can't say this is a new school record. It just feels like it kind of came out of nowhere. Yeah, there's a, we actually have a Penn Street Steppers podcast coming out early next year. And I think this is something quite, both what you're talking about is like a, you know, a defined and sort of inclusive aesthetic and what you're talking about, Jordan, with struggling to place these records in time. I found myself when I was listening to the mix, it's quite concise actually, it's probably only about 45 minutes or something, but when you're doing that thing and you're like, oh man, this is a classic, how have I missed this? Assuming it to be some like... you know thing from 94 or something along those lines and you're like shit this is theirs and like the last one was theirs as well and then like the next track comes in it's like shit this is a new one as well it's um yeah it's quite something i think that that is also exciting about them as well as they just seem to have this incredible abundance of material you're just constantly stumbling across mood heart related projects with vast amounts of great music in reserve, ready to come out. And that's really nice to not feel like you're fighting over scraps, the two good tracks that were released by an artist in a year. It's nice to have that feeling of there's just so much to discover. Okay, Will, you've gone for Luxe Wreck. You want to tell us about the label? Basically, it's a Swiss label that has been putting out loads of records the past few years, but I guess it's still kind of under the radar. Yeah, the way I heard about them was a couple years ago, and I wrote that feature about the Golden Poodle in Hamburg. One of the nights that I was there, Helena Half played back. with the guy that runs this label. He goes by the name D Cosmo. It was kind of like, for me, like a game-changing set that sort of turned me on to Helena Houth. Also just this sort of style of DJing that was like pretty much tracks with verses and choruses and lyrics just the whole night. Like there was never this idea that you could DJ a party and never kind of revert to... club material, you know, club tailored tracks and, you know, often beat match sometimes just, you know, fade in something way, way slower and just, you know, everyone goes with it. Anyway, D Cosmo was definitely on par with Helena Half. And then when I wrote the article and I sort of described him DJing. he just got in touch with me and started sending us their records. It's just kind of fascinating. Like they have this crew of artists that a lot of them have actually put out a decent amount of music, but they're all just completely, I've never heard anyone talking about these guys, like names like Joe Drive. Lunar Lodge, Cold Colors. There's this mysterious cast of characters behind this label. The music is really, really consistently good. It's kind of like... It was interesting having that DJ set as sort of the bedrock of my impression of this label because everything they put out is like, it's mostly techno with a bit of some stuff in there that's sort of like Italo, synth poppy, but it all has this sort of, the soul of the music is kind of new wave, dark wave, EBM, whatever. It just kind of has this shadowy. gloomy feel, but not in a way that's like a overt, you know, reference or anything. It's just, that's kind of the... That's the heart of this music. Okay, so Jordan, you've gone for The Bunker, New York. Tell us about the label and the sort of year that they've had. Yeah, they've had an absolutely incredible year. They've put out 10 records, all in 2014. They finished up with this album from Ray Gans, which I guess was... kind of taken from a live set that was played at the Bunker. I mean, maybe I should go back. Listeners will probably know that the Bunker is a techno party in New York that's been running for ages. We did an oral history on them. I guess it was last year, at the beginning of last year. They started a label this year. Like, as a party, you know, they've kind of got some really incredible international acts. sort of in their orbit. Part of it is that beyond booking, the sort of booking arm of the party or the party used to be the party arm of the booking agency or something like this, you know, represents a lot of these people in the United States. So acts like Voices from the Lake, Adam TM. So they had all this talent that they could kind of pull on to release on the label. You know, that's already like a massive leg up for these guys. I mean, I think it's probably pretty hard to get Voices from the Lake to come and do a record for your label. And with them, it's just like kind of a no brainer. I think Neil from Voices of the Lake also does all the mastering. for the label. I don't know. The thing that was cool for me about the label this year was just that they really did have strong records from people that no one had ever heard of before. People who are just sort of going to the party a lot or from this part of the United States who know Brian Kucinich, who does the bunker. And, you know, somebody like Clay Wilson, who's a guy that I guess I know a little bit from New York. seen him out at the party a lot. Like he's someone who sort of came up on techno by going to the bunker. And then he comes and he releases on the bunker's label, puts out like one of their best records. You know, the next record was like on the label. I think he did the second one. And the next one was Voices from the Lake. But everything is just kind of presented like completely flat. You know, like this guy who is a kid basically has been coming to the party for ages is going to be the same as like Voices from the Lake and Marco Shuttle and Adam TM. I think it's not easy to run a label where you're able to do things like that. They did it really well. You know, it doesn't have quite the... maybe the community or the collective feel that you were talking about Angus with mood hut, you could almost see it as something sort of in that direction. I don't know. I think they had an incredibly promising start for this year. Yeah, if they can release another 10 records next year, I mean, they'll be one of the biggest labels in techno, maybe. Would you advise them to keep up the release schedule like they have? I mean, they were prolific, weren't they? Yeah, they were absolutely prolific. I mean, I think for a label, it's a very good thing to make a big impression in your first year. You know, you don't approach that in the next year. I've seen a lot of posts on social media from Brian, you know, talking about rounding up band camp orders. And I would imagine it's just been an insane amount of work doing it. But if they can continue to get the good tracks, if they can bring out more records from some of these guys like Leisure Muffin, Clay Wilson, Lota, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, like that would be huge. Were they doing the party at the same sort of rate this year? Yeah, they were. The party has sort of switched up a little bit. I think when Output opened in Brooklyn, that kind of happened around the same time that they were losing their old venue, Public Assembly, was closing for renovations and then turned into something completely different. So they sort of started doing parties at Output, which in a way was great because they have this incredible sound system at their disposal. But it also gave the party a very, very much took away the underground feeling of the party. You know, what had once been in this kind of pitch black room, you know, where they were bringing their own sound system and felt very rough around the edges. Suddenly you're at this club that's got... the best function one in North America and very sort of nice high-end surroundings. So they've started doing the party at least most of the time now at this other venue, which I believe is in Ridgewood in Queens, that's called Trans Pecos. That place is very small. They can only let in, I think, about 150 people. and they're bringing their own sound system, I think. It's really gone back to the roots of the party, and the bookings have been fantastic. I've gone for Diagonal, which is Powell and Jamie Williams' label. I think it's a label that kind of, maybe I'd built up a certain set of associations and expectations of the label that I subsequently had smashed to pieces this year. I think what really changed my mind on the label or got me to look at it in a new way was actually connected to Unsigned again. So there was a showcase, a diagonal showcase in the second room, and a couple of things stood out, one of which was Powell's live set. This is something I noted in the blurb that we wrote for Diagonal, but... I think it was the first time he played live. I might be wrong on that, but it was certainly like the new iteration of his live show. And I think it was by far my favorite thing I saw at the festival. Actually, maybe the bug was closed, but someone who I didn't exactly know what it was going to be like going into it, I was kind of blown away. But anyway, the thing that he does, if you're not familiar with his music, I mean, it's Lucy connected or it's pretty closely connected to like what you hear on record. And I really, really love Powell's music. Somebody been keeping like close, quite close tabs on since the beginning. But I find it difficult to list to find a time to listen to his music. You know, he's making what I describe as a. form of techno in a way but his influences kind of like stretch back a further 20 years there's lots of like live sounding drumming and kind of like post-punky bass signs and these sorts of things so the translation of this into the live arena just like just really took off basically so what I and everybody else in that room seemed to be getting from the set was that largely what he was doing could be described as techno but it had all of these other elements because rhythmically it's just so messed up so you know if you're thinking about getting off on a good techno set it's within very like you know it's like very fine terms like you know when things are going to happen and like the intensity like waxes and wanes but you kind of know what you're going to get with this when the intensity levels are kind of the same but then the rhythm just everything's up for question you know it like added this just amazing additional element of intensity In a way, his set was like a neat kind of summary of what the label's been doing this year. So he has artists like, he released a Russell Haswell album this year that was supposedly based on the dance floor and rhythms and drum machines and stuff, but just like was comically not that, but was still fantastic. All the same, release a record by Prostitutes, who's someone I've been like. really feeling. It was an album on Digitalis last year, which I thought was excellent and kind of maybe like flew under the radar a little bit, but it was something by, it was a couple of Bronze Teeth EPs. There was the Shit and Shine album. And, you know, I think everything to a, you know, a lesser or greater extent was getting it. this idea of like, you know, club music redefined or through this lens that Oscar and Jamie seem to have like cultivated, connected to the label. I think one of the interesting things in like speaking to Oscar Powell a little bit is that he's definitely not like a product of this scene. Like he's, he's not someone who's like. necessarily uh you know he doesn't subscribe to the techno gospel like he's not indoctrinated into like the dance scene he doesn't he's not really like that connected to club culture i think his like influences are very specific but there's something about like the chemistry of his like his influences and his relationship to techno that gives this kind of like outsiders slant to it i think it's kind of naivety in a way but it's kind of what you were saying with um aurora halal maybe that you know it's not that she doesn't know about the full music but when you're still kind of feeling your way through you're sort of going off down different paths and exploring different things that you maybe wouldn't if you if you knew the rules and you kind of had those hardwired into you i think with powell as well And with diagonal, there's a certain antagonism. So it's perhaps not just that he's sort of coming to these things with a kind of a fresh excitement or a wonder, as you put it, Jordan, but also that he's kind of like being a bit confrontational towards them and, you know, seeing how they break and seeing in what ways he can kind of rub people out the wrong way. But, you know, productively so, in which, you know, it makes complete sense where someone like Russell Haswell who's like a an arch antagonist kind of a lifelong antagonist would like fit in so well on that label yeah I mean it's worth probably pointing out as well that Russell Haswell played that showcase and I guess he represents the extreme edge of what they would do on the label I mean, his set was, it was, I think it was supposedly based on 37 Minute Workout, which was the record he released through Diagonal. But I'll be damned if I heard a rhythm in any of that, you know, we're talking about power electronic. and noise and like kind of theatrics as well you know he threatened to walk off stage like four times he spent probably 50% of the set swearing at the audience you know he was just jabbing his equipment but I think at the time this actually came off the back of me running like an aborted exchange with him an aborted exchange because he refused to hold his microphone but You know, it was the most non-standard interview I've ever conducted. Yeah, it was fantastic. He was drinking throughout. Ended the interview by him playing YouTube videos and just, you know, explaining why basically the majority of music was shit and how like cinema was the highest art form. But I think my takeaway from it was that I'd never seen someone who had such a pure translation of their emotional core into music. It's like, you know, from his perspective, if you're, if you're feeling these things inside, why are you going to, why are you going to bother with like the rules of music? You know, he's interested in sound. He's interested in expression and sound. So what it sounds like in his soul is a bunch of. noise and you know screeching electronics and stuff you know there was nothing in the way of his message i think it was like you know incredible in that way yeah it's something you said about um powell's bringing these influences that are distinctly not dance music like especially post-punk and whatnot i always thought a very key difference between dance music and things like punk and post-punk and whatnot is dance music for the most part is pleasure delivery. Whereas those are the types of music in the, you know, like post-punk bands, if they're not confronting their audience in some kind of serious way, or if they're not challenging you to dislike this, it's almost like they're letting you down. Or like if the whole thing just went down easy, you wouldn't have very much respect for them. I think the past few years, you've seen these examples of probably not the first time this has happened, but people kind of applying that sort of nerve to dance music. And a lot of people get very confused by it. Like even when like Lies came out and it was like, well, why did the kick drum sound so shitty? And, you know, these elements of like sort of putting something in there, not caring if people are going to like this or not. That's a kind of ballsy attitude that that's part of what makes things like punk and post-punk so exciting. But in dance music, it's like a maybe a bit more of a curveball since, you know, the entire thing is meant to be based on the situation of enjoying yourself and whatnot. Like you don't necessarily want to hear. earth shattering feedback, you know, but, um, well, yeah, I mean, I think in a way it's like the ultimate sweet spot for me because I'm coming at that side of things from a total outsider's perspective and the label was coming at like my stuff from an outsider's perspective. You know, it was the same with the bug. Like I've never been in a mosh pit situation before. Like I haven't heard a sound system react in that way. Like. I hadn't heard extremes in sound like I did that night. You know, it was definitely a shock of like, you know, it's kind of wide eyed wonderment if you like, because I just personally hadn't experienced things like that before. Yeah. And even just, the idea of insulting the audience and that's like a punk staple you know and it's like when you think about it it's like pretty strange idea like you know just like throwing abuse to the people that have come to see you but for whatever reason that's a great you know like I loved that like when I was younger and like to some extent I miss it now like I would love to have electronic performer. Yeah, I mean, can you imagine coming away from a punk festival and noting that one of the performers swore at the audience? Yeah, I mean, I guess the kind of precursor here, hanging over all this stuff, is Regis and Serge and the British Murder Boys project that they did, where Regis was basically taking that role of sort of like... writhing about and getting people's backs up and swearing and stuff and you know has told stories about being ejected from the club because the bouncers thought he was just like a drunk patron basically when he was like performing and stuff like this there's definitely a tension between those two tendencies that somebody like regis kind of bodies and that he seems to have these two sides where on the one hand i've seen him play in a club like trow a set of kind of downwardsy techno but essentially it's obvious that he's basically like delivering what people want you know which is what you're there to do and you know by all means but on the other hand there's this kind of discourse of like most techno is quite boring this is something he says routinely and that you know like music has to mean something beyond simply pleasure delivery as you put it will I mean, I have vivid memories of a Blackest Ever Black night at Corsica Studios a couple of years ago where Regis was playing in room two for, he played for quite a long time because I think somebody else pulled out. And at one point, Russell Haswell, who had also performed. got into the booth and was just like stopping the record every now and then and then sort of swearing at Regis and then just stepping back and Regis would have to like start again and try and pick up where he left off and he'd lean in and stop the record again you know it's kind of like it's kind of a great metaphor for this whole thing well quite yeah yeah you know I don't know how Regis felt about that Okay, let's move on through the polls and the next category we're going to be discussing is official mixes. I think I speak for the group when I say we kind of struggle with this a little bit to pick one of our favorites. And this is kind of coming off the back of quite a big feature that Andrew Rice wrote early in the year. just kind of taking the temperature of the mix CD market. Will, it's probably good to come to you first, bearing this in mind, you've gone for Ryan Elliott's Panorama Bar mix. Yeah, I mean, in a way, it's kind of a coincidence that there are two reasons I would choose that mix. The simple one is just that it was my favorite official mix of the year. Just in terms of it was just nicely done. It's fun to listen to. In a way, it's perfectly, I don't know if it's fitting or it's ironic, but that the number one official mix of the year was released for free online. So we're really blurring the lines between what does it mean that it's an official mix for, you know. Like this is, we're kind of entering new territory. And it's interesting that just at a time when we're getting less and less excited by mix CDs, our, you know, favorite mix of the year is this sort of neither one exactly. Like it's an official mix with, you know, everything sorted out with like, you know, tracks commissioned, things like that. It's obviously not a podcast, but it's also free and it's only online. I mean, I guess in general, I'm not sure why this would be true now more so than before. I guess the main thing is when I look at the official mixes that came out this year, even the ones that I like, like Marcel Detman's Fabric, Pangea's Fabric, with each of them, including Ryan's mix, I just, like however good they are, I still have this feeling that this really pales in comparison to like... what they sound like in a club or maybe in some cases even what they would sound like on just a normal podcast or something. For whatever reason, there's something about this format doesn't do justice to the art form that it delivers. And there was obviously kind of a heyday of mix CDs. But yeah, nowadays, it's funny. There's just this kind of when a mix CD comes out by an artist that you like, At least for me, it's like I fully expect that it will be decent at best, no matter how good they are as a DJ or how much I like them. Like my expectations are just very low for any official mix. Hardly ever, you know, pleasantly surprised. I guess this was sort of why I chose the mix that I chose, which was Prince Thomas' Rainbow Disco Club Volume 1. This was a commissioned mix, a mix you could actually go out and buy on CD that did have the feel of a live, like an actual live set in a club. You know, it actually felt maybe like something that you would get on a podcast, whether it was a live recording or just something that he threw together in his bedroom. Some of the mixing was on, you know, a little like less than fully polished. I think Angus, we were talking about this before and he said, you know, it doesn't sound like it, you know, this was the 55th take or something like this was something he had an idea. He recorded it and they then sorted out all the licensing probably. release it on CD. That would be my guess about how it came together. But somehow if a mixed CD during this sort of height of the mixed CD would have been something that was just like labored over, perfectly sequenced, perfectly layered. The fact that somehow he gets something that felt extremely off the cuff and like that's going to be what takes our notice. I mean, I think it kind of speaks to the era. I also love some of the inclusions and the fact. that Prince Thomas is like, quote-unquote, a disco guy, and he opens with a Dazzy track, I think. Like, you know, shows what we know. Yeah, and strangely, my selection, which is Rourish's Fabric Mix, this is an artist for whom the mix CD is the only format that he wants to communicate with his audience in. I think he's released... I think this was his second official mix. I think he put out... some split CD on Cocoon a few years back, but he's not really releasing much music right now. I think for me, it probably, I wouldn't say it was necessarily my favourite mix of the year, but it was one of the mixes I was most interested in hearing. So he's an artist who I've had like quite a long... standing relationship with kind of there when they came around the first time with the wave of interest connected to RPR Raresh Radu and Pedro but he's definitely not a DJ who I've been to see play over the last couple of years he's not someone who's sound I'm necessarily checking out on a regular basis You know, he pushes a style of music that like definitely had its moment in the sun. Like, you know, I'm talking about kind of minimal and stripped back house, kind of like more groove focused textures. So I think it was really nice to kind of come back to him and have the sense that what he's doing wasn't just like of its moment or something. And people aren't just like idly. following him because he knows Ricardo Villalobos you know there's a DJ who doesn't have these other endeavors that are getting in the way he doesn't do interviews barely releases any music I think he's put out like one or two 12 inches ever and he's pretty much it seems just digging for music I wouldn't say there were any necessarily any curveballs in the mix but I think what I liked about it the most was the palette you know I think if you compared it to something like Prosumer's mix that he put out this year which I also enjoyed but was kind of like more acoustically rooted in its sounds and the palette he was using it kind of reminded me Rourish's mix reminded me why I liked these minimal strange in the first place you know I think people took it to like a ridiculous degree with the um you know the clicks and the bleeps and the electronics and stuff but i think if it's done kind of like subtly and elegantly and sort of deployed in a way that doesn't kind of like take it to a caricature of itself it can still be like extremely thrilling music i think as matt sort of noted in his review like he he's a dj who's like very much in control of like pacing and sequencing and stuff like he doesn't have lots of tools to work with you know his palette is very restricted but he really knows how to work up the few elements that he does have I think there's obviously like a tightrope with this stuff in a way you know between like main an interest and getting by on the thrill of just a few elements but I think he's like at this moment in time he's better positioned than most to kind of like you know maneuver that and walk that tightrope I guess I would echo the rest of you in saying that I struggled to pick a favorite I mean actually when I looked back there were very few official mixes this year that I that kind of drew my attention enough for me to listen to you know more than once or twice i mean probably the the prosumer fabric mix was my favorite but um i do think it's interesting to consider as you guys touched on like how different the process of assembling an official licensed mix is to the experience of DJing. And when you consider that most people turning in an official mix in a given year will be probably new, this will be their first official mix. Most people who do a fabric mix or whatever, it's a new experience to them. The way it works, as far as I can tell, is that you compile a massive list of tracks that you possibly like to include. Then there's a lengthy licensing process where... the respective license holders are contacted and you know a proportion of those tracks are approved by that point you're probably already bored of playing them as a DJ because most DJs have quite a fast turnover then you have to like assemble them into this mix that can't have any flaws because, you know, this is your calling card. This is your, this is your like business card you have to impress. And I think, yeah, you know, you can often tell, you know, often official mixes are like very thoughtful, but perhaps not very exciting. I think that's my. Do you still think that there's something to be said for the extra attention that a mix such as this gets though? Like aside from the sort of creative limitations that have to be placed on them, do you think there's something to be said, you know, just for having that press release that says, you know, he's doing this mix on DJ kicks on fabric or compo? I'm sure it opens doors. I mean, there's that from a sort of professional perspective. But also, you know, there's maybe an argument that, you know, we're all presented with like dozens of free mixes per day. And I think we get... quite blasé about them and often you stick something on in the background and listen to it once and then you're like right well I've done that now that's that that'll just languish on my iTunes for the next couple of years and then I'll delete it so maybe there's something to be said for making a mix where people really take it seriously because they recognise the kind of effort that's gone into it and what it represents as a statement so you know maybe people spend more time with it and they kind of listen to it more closely I think that's a really interesting point that you make, that there's a different way that we listen to these things. I mean, with DJs, we're putting out a lot of mixes online or when a lot of their mixes are ending up online, like from live sets or whatever, we can sort of, you know, we can do this thing where we listen to it once and then it sort of is filed away on our iTunes. We never listened to it again. but we might get four or five opportunities over the course of the year to listen to a set from this person. And we're still listening to them a lot, we're just not listening to the same mix of theirs a lot. The idea that there could be a DJ mix that is put together... to be listened to many, many times, to be taken apart, to be really looked at as like, okay, this is how they sequenced it. This is how the story unfolds. You know, just something that you would never really consider from just a ripped club set, from something someone made in their bedroom. I think it is interesting. I think our listening habits have probably been completely changed by SoundCloud. you know, mixed cloud and whatever. I mean, I think a possible middle ground, and this kind of brings me onto the online mix that I picked, a possible middle ground seems to be, it's almost one of perception. So I think a good example of this would be the Solitaire series that one man's been doing. We've ended up writing news about this mix series. Like ostensibly he's releasing a DJ mix online for free, like in the way that you would a podcast. But there's been something in the presentation, whether that's with the artwork, the way the track list is handled, like even just the way that it's presented to the press, that's kind of like giving it this sense of occasion that like you wouldn't. otherwise connect to just like a mix that was thrown out there i mean i guess the ryan elliott sort of panorama mix gets this idea as well it's the the difference is that they've licensed the tracks but you know it was there on soundcloud it was nicely presented it was available there's a wav there were liner notes there were all these different things in a package so i do wonder if this is like enhanced podcast idea it might be like you know one possible future for this Well, the key thing of what you just said is the licensed tracks, like that's under the hood. Like no one really, that's not an upfront detail about the mix itself, but anyone can do this nice presentation with a high res image and a WAV file and all that stuff. There's nothing stopping anyone from just releasing a podcast that way. So you could see, I don't know, sort of podcasts rising to the level of this online official mix and the distinction becoming. much non-existent let's go back to my online mix pick i think um it was ryan hemsworth's cool dj mix and i think this really spoke to like the very off the cuff like freewheeling approach that you can take with these sets like he had like mainstream rap in there he had these like pieces of music that were like i think commissions for some other project that he was doing maybe like a soundtrack or something that the complications in like getting them onto a cd would have been like enormous he probably couldn't have played all of the hip-hop tracks that he included in this mix the reason it stood out to me and uh the reason i was listening to it a few times was just like the additional effort that we're talking about was just like very very evident like he recorded his own like little cute intro and i think that like really set the tone for the mix i'm quoting here but he said i'm ryan hemsworth i'm a young adult who still wears a retainer sometimes because my dentist tells me to you know, it's in this like 15 year old girl's voice. And that kind of like set the tone for, you know, if you hear that at the start, you're placed in a certain frame of mind for a mix, like no matter what comes after that. I think he made sense of a lot of different styles of music that became like incredibly popular this year. Like. like, you know, mainstream rap bangers and their infiltration of different scenes kind of being one. But he was a DJ who I think kind of handled the cute thing, the PC music thing, like better than anybody I heard this year. like playing it among other related tracks and like his own music and sort of interconnected forms kind of like recontextualize it and put it in a light that i thought like made it i know it just you put it in a very favorable light basically but i am a sucker for this kind of thing i mean some people might think of it as a gimmick or something like he plays it in alanis morissette track in the middle Which one? I bet it was Head Over Feet. Deep cut. Yeah, deep. But, you know, it's one of those mixes and it comes in the office and it's like, oh God, Alanis Morissette. It's like, oh shit. But, you know, the way he makes sense of it and like, that's going to stick in my mind. It's going to be the mix with Alanis Morissette on it. Like, I can't. I can't call to mind too many DJ mixes like, oh yeah, it's the one with that on it. And, you know, I think if it's like, okay, that could be seen as a gimmick, but if it's done in the spirit of the mix and you've presented it in a way where the track before it, like... flows perfectly and then the track coming out of it makes perfect sense as well it's like you've maybe seen Alanis Morissette in a whole new light you know there's something to be said for that I think it's the true skill of a DJ I think this is the first RA exchange where we've said Alanis Morissette that's I think that's it certainty Angus, you went for TCF. What was the platform that was on? Well, to be honest, my knowledge is hazy in this area. So the title of the mix is like, as he likes to do, this kind of incomprehensible string of digits. And I think it's a blog called Waves or Bad Waves or something like that. But I just found it on his SoundCloud. kind of a word of mouth thing. And his kind of original productions, I think are interesting and show a lot of promise, but I'm yet to be like completely blown away by them. But this mix really, to me, is just like on another level. I mean, it features a few of his... And also lots of things that were kind of precursors to his sound, like Rastanoton and various kinds of like clicky, abstract computer music stitched together into this incredibly kind of dense collage. And then there's this like undercurrent of, from this quite kind of sterile, cryptic surface, like beneath it, there's this undercurrent of like incredible emotionality and kind of romanticism. So he plays a couple of Ennio Morricone tracks that are just so unexpected, but so sort of spine-tingling almost. He plays some William Basinski, things like this. And I just, I think it's a wonderful combination, but also the reason why it kind of really stayed with me is that... Probably the best example of something that I've been getting increasingly excited about this year, which is free mixes that kind of really probe at the boundaries of the form. And clearly someone's put a lot of work in, you know, it's... in a very involved way. It's not simply blending tracks together, though that's obviously fine too. But by doing that, by being more involved, you can kind of say something else. You can actually present a kind of aesthetic world that's really, that is your own and is very much more than the sum of just the tracks that have gone into it. It's funny, actually, I came from the other side, so I didn't hear that mix and I don't know if you know. DJs but I saw his live set unsound and now I've heard about some of those inclusions like his live set makes a bit more sense like everything had this kind of like ethereality kind of it was kind of trance like in a way you know there were emotions from like very cold digital textures it wasn't like a resounding success but like I could totally see what he was going for Will, tell us about your selection. You went for STL, kind of, I guess it's like a RA favorite at this point. Yeah, STL. He's got a bit of a cult following, I guess, because he has a very specific, you know, signature sound that kind of never gets old, even though he, you know, churns out like a certain number of records per year that... in the end all sound pretty similar, but for some reason, something about, you know, this sort of crunchy drum sounds and eerie melodies, it has so much personality that. it's like we would all be happy for him to just carry on like this forever and ever. But yeah, I guess this mix came from the Something newsletter, but it's just kind of funny how it's like sort of mysterious character doesn't play and is quite cryptic. We did an RE interview with him, but I think it was... A few years ago, Todd did the interview, and it was agreed ahead of time, a few questions he was going to answer. Anyway, so it sort of made it funny and surprising that he just randomly was like, yeah, I felt like doing a mix, so here's my new mix. And then it's all these sort of like rave tunes. He has like Moby Go, and I guess on a nerdy level, it's sort of like... fascinating glimpse into like his weird little you know world he's got but um it's also just funny how it was just he just felt like doing a mix and you know just sent it out but yeah in a way it's it's like uh sometimes it's it's interesting to learn kind of like where artists are at in terms of like what records they listen to and stuff and with him it seems like There's no evidence he's listened to any new records, you know, in the past 10 years or at least. But yeah, everything on there is great. And it kind of has this like hammy sort of like. I don't know, totally unpretentious energy that is totally not what you would have expected from STL. But then it also kind of makes sense given how his records sound. It sort of reminds me in a sort of opposite way of like what I was talking about with Russell Haswell, where there's not really much in the way of his message. Like he could probably only release music on his own label. like it feels like he produces a bunch of tracks and just kind of releases it a couple of weeks later or something. Like, yeah, there's no, you know, record label red tape surrounding what he does. He just kind of like, Oh, I fancy making a mix this afternoon and post it later that day or something. Well, I like these artists that, um, I think Ricardo Villalobos is like this too, maybe Shackleton in a way where it's just like, you almost get the impression that just making these tracks is just like, an activity in their life, you know, and they just sort of like just keep on pumping them out. And this is just a thing that they do. Like you don't get the impression that they're thinking like, what's my next move going to be? It's just like they go in the studio, make some shit. And then they're like, okay, that was pretty good. I'll release that one, I guess. But something about it feels so authentic. Like this is just. Um, the kind of like what you said earlier, like this is just how they express themselves. It's like, for whatever reason, the way that they want to express themselves has sort of gotten, um, honed further and further into this very specific thing. And yeah, it's like they might just make stuff that sounds exactly like this forever, but you know, all the power to them. Jordan, you've gone for a Douglas Sherman beats in space session. Yeah. So, uh, I mean, Douglas Sherman is not like a big name DJ, but he sort of, in my opinion, probably has the biggest gig out there, which is basically that he plays records at the loft now, um, sort of in the stead of David Mancuso, who is still around. And if you. are lucky enough to go to The Loft in New York. You might see him there, but he's mostly sort of hanging off on the side. He actually called a friend of mine once to personally confirm his reservation at the party, which I know my friend got a big kick out of. The way that records are played at The Loft, people probably know about this, there's no beat mixing, there's no beat matching. It's purely you play... one record from the beginning all the way to the end. Everybody claps and then they play the next record. I've been lucky enough to go to the loft maybe four or five times over the last four years, five years. And it's without a doubt the best party I've ever been to almost every time. There's not a whole lot of variation from party to party. At this point, I can really only go once a year, which I think is fine because that gives the party enough time to sort of reset and bring in some new tunes. But the way the music is presented, the way the night is structured, and just the atmosphere in the place. I mean, you have everybody from like, occasionally you'll see like a little kid running around all the way up to like people probably in their 70s, maybe older, who were going to the loft since the very beginning. I've bumped into university professors on the dance floor there. The last one I went to, they were like, I... cried maybe like three times. I mean, it's just, it's that kind of party. It's pretty embarrassing. Yeah. Yeah. And I was in the, taxi on the way home and everybody was just like weeping because the thing was over. It was crazy. But basically, I mean, the loft is obviously a huge influence on Tim Sweeney, who does Beats in Space. Getting Douglas Sherman to come on the show and basically present like a loft style set, I know is a huge get for him. And I was excited about it as well. in part because I might be able to ID some of the tracks that I was hearing at the party the last time I was there, which was in May. And basically the set delivered. I mean, it really showed how sort of vast the range of music that they'll play at the party is, but also how it all seems to fit together. I mean, I'm looking at the track list now. So they played Blath by Telephones, which was a pretty big tune from this year. But then a little bit later on, they played My Rendition by the Martinez Brothers, and also sort of infamously a Deadmau5 and Cascade track, which sort of raised some eyebrows. And there was a good deal. debate between my friends and I about like whether it worked or not. And we still haven't really decided. Which side of the fence do you fall on? Me? I think it worked, but also embarrassing. And directly after the Deadmau5 and Cascade track, he plays like Lord of the Isles. So, but somehow it, yeah, there's a... There's a flow to it and it works. And I would say that like, yeah, being at the party is great. I mean, obviously you can't listen to a podcast and have a balloon drop, you know, in your office while you're wearing your headphones, but, um, or can you, but, but for, for me, um, It was kind of nice to, you know, have this little keepsake of the party and to maybe introduce people to this way of thinking about music, this way of putting music together. It was cool. I was just going to say, how much of the music that's played at the Loft and maybe in the mix, I haven't heard the mix, is like canonical Loft classics? I was surprised that all the tracks you listed were sort of from the last few years. I mean, there's definitely some. canonical stuff that works its way in there. You know, like the Gap Band and like Love is the Message, you know, like that kind of stuff still definitely plays into it. It's funny, like what becomes part of the Loft Canon. So like Inspector Norse is part of the Loft Canon now. You know, they play that at like every party, you know, little fluffy clouds by the orb is part of the Loft Canon. you know, it's pretty cool what actually works in there. I love you. So albums. Andy Stott's come out as the number one album of the year on Resident Advisor. Jordan, you wrote this review. Do you feel as though he was a worthy winner? Yeah, I absolutely stand by that. probably said most of what I wanted to say about it in the review. I don't know that I have a whole lot to add other than that I'm still listening to this record quite a lot now. And sometimes when you finish a review, no matter how good or bad something is, you're just ready to not listen to it for a long time. I think it showed a lot of artistic growth for Andy Stott. I think it really is a great dance music album in addition to being a good album sort of that people might be who aren't so interested in dance music might be more interested in. Yeah, I don't know. It's kind of a dark record, but I found it to just be incredibly pleasurable, which is, I think, the way Andy Stout has always worked, but maybe this record more than the others for me. Yeah, I mean, his kind of pop sensibility, I think, is the reason for his kind of... extraordinary success, extraordinary in the sense that it's not ordinary from a producer of his background and operating out of a label like Modern Love to kind of get the kind of adoration and the broad appeal that he does. For me, the album, I mean, in individual parts, it worked, but I found it quite incoherent, actually. To me, I could hear... traces of the other projects that he's done in the interim since his last kind of body of solo work, which is the Million Andrea album with Miles from Dendike Stare, which is like very much more trying to be a kind of exciting, intense dance record rather than a pop record. And also the Rage kind of jungle revival stuff that the two of them do together as well. To me, the Stott album tried too much to kind of bring those things in. And I kind of wished that it would just be more, you know, Andy Stott, the kind of pop artist, I guess. Yeah, I guess where I disagree is that for me, the last full length felt a little bit more like a genre exercise. You know, you kind of take house and you slow it down and you grease and grime it up. And then you kind of present that. I mean, it was cool. But what I liked about this record was that it was really far reaching. Like maybe what like this incoherence that you found to be sort of distracting or to not be maybe sort of the best way of presenting Stott. To me, it just I was like really happy for that that incoherence, I guess. So I'm guessing there was a level of coherency in what you have picked. Yeah, very much. much so which is Koch the Lee Gamble album which I think I mean it was well received but I think slightly didn't get the kind of response that I feel it deserved I mean he is an artist who kind of emerged came into most people's kind of attention in 2012 when he released two records at pretty much the same time one of which was Diversions which is this kind of ambient deconstruction of rave and jungle and one of which was Dutch to Ashtar plumes which is like a kind of very idiosyncratic techno album where you could really tell he was coming from like a kind of abstract computer music background which is his background Koch like is essentially those two aesthetics like mashed together And I think given the kind of hype around him and the level of expectation, I think people were slightly disappointed that to an extent everything in it was like followed on from things they'd already heard from him. It's also very long. It's like an hour and 20 minutes. or something and in terms of narrative it's incredibly kind of labyrinthine like it goes all over the place it kind of denies you easy moments of like this is the climax of the album or this is where it's trying this is where it's going this is what it's trying to do but for me like weirdly these qualities that at first I thought I found it quite disappointing for these reasons. The more I listened to it, the more I just got kind of completely sucked into it. I mean, he talks a lot about kind of dream states and altered states and things in his interviews. And it's to me that really kind of nails it. It's like it's a kind of a dream logic, basically. And it's just I've really enjoyed kind of getting kind of absorbed in that logic this year. Yeah, I think the same is true of many of the qualities you're describing of my pick, which was the ARCA records. And it's a record that I think in a way, although it was well received in some quarters, kind of wasn't in others. And I think maybe it was a little bit a victim of his earlier success. I think the amount. of hype that kind of attached himself to to him coming off the back of uh the music he had released his work with twigs him making appearances on the Kanye West record there kind of been rumors about his Bjork collaboration swirling around for about a year And I think that what the record kind of lacked maybe was some of the more structured elements of his older music. I mean, I was an enormous fan of the stuff he didn't know, like Stretch 2 in particular. but he was dealing in kind of hip hop forms in a way. It was still the same kind of freewheeling palette, you know, his palette and his sound design has always been like very experimental, very far reaching, but he was loosely basing his ideas within a template. There were more vocals and these sorts of things. So I think when I first sat with the record, I was a little bit underwhelmed and I felt. underwhelmed and overwhelmed by just the sounds and the frequencies you know it's a record that has like a level of there's like a through line for sure there's definitely some coherence in the types of synths that he's using even the frequencies that he's working at very in like the upper mid-range you know it's very like speaking kind of frequency which i think was why i found it quite fatiguing to begin with but i think it started to make more sense when i saw his live show at the ica recently and um i kind of went into it with a certain amount of like you know, trepidation. I wasn't sure what to expect. I'd heard some like pretty bad reports from his US tour. I think Andrew Rice, a colleague of ours, had kind of seen him somewhere and not really enjoyed it. And I'd heard other things about potential like problems with the way that he was working. But I think while it wasn't perfect, it really came together in a way that made sense. You know, he's very, very closely associated with Jesse Kander, who does all his... visual stuff and his videos and his artworks and those sorts of things and it was like an AV show in the truest sense of that like you would have enjoyed one or the other like markedly less you know these things were very much reliant on each other so the show was kind of a hybrid live dj kind of like performance approach so he was singing on a few of the tracks there was like a costume change there were kind of like theatrics and like performative aspects that i don't think anybody was necessarily expecting i still think his stage presence maybe is not like quite as natural as he would hope but He did this number where he was kind of doing this like ultra syncopated, like Spanish speaking slash rapping, which worked extremely well. But I think most people were fairly blown away by the presentation. And I subsequently went back to the record. And I just think that maybe because his style is so open ended and everything is so like up for debate, if you like, because it kind of throws all. ideas of rhythm and sequencing and you know all the other things that we've come to like you know accept as the norm those things kind of go out the window and when nothing's given any longer it can be hard to you know to really grab a hold of And I think that's what I was kind of suffering from. And I think going into a record like this, you almost need to like recalibrate your expectations in a way. I think it was an interesting development with some of like the synthesizer led music that came out this year, stuff like TCF and thinking about Mesh's music as well that he released on Pan. This is music that, you know, it's like a place that I like to inhabit, but when it finishes, I don't really take much away from it because it is working in such a like open-ended way. But I think Arkaia would probably place him at like a level maybe above guys like TCF and Mesh just because... his like application of melody is like when really when you scratch the surface very very striking like there's some really really beautiful melodic passages but they're kind of done in a way that's very cracked you know very cracked and non-standard and kind of like it's just shot through a weird like prism it's very strange but um i think it's a record that's worth revisiting and kind of like removing all of the non-musical elements from it in like your sort of appraisal of it and I'm also very excited about the prospect of the Bjork record that he supposedly produced much of been hearing other rumours about other people kind of working with Bjork and she definitely seems to be like back in the dance world at the moment. She was actually wearing a very striking, like, luminous yellow tennis skirt at the ARCA show, which I was a big fan of, and some, like, six-inch platform shoes. But this is style watch on our way. Yeah, there was definitely an element of that. Jordan, you've picked Dean Blunt's Black Metal. I guess he's an artist who is sort of equally hard to get a handle of and really, you know, understand. Yeah, and he's honestly like not an artist that I would say I'm super into in general. I was actually at a friend's house one night earlier this fall. This guy runs a music blog and he was playing this dream pop record. And I was like, Oh, what is this? And he said, Oh, this is Dean Blunt. And I said, You're kidding me. I mean, it just, I mean, it basically kind of took me back to a lot of the sort of shoegazy, dreamy pop music, you know, almost like sort of twee stuff that I was listening to a lot sort of before I started going out to clubs, like when I was in high school. It was like a college rock record, basically, at least musically. The record came out on Rough Trade, and it actually sounds like a Rough Trade record in the most sort of classical sense. Granted, it has a track called 50 Cent. It has a track called Molly and Awkwafina. These are like references that you're not going to get. on sort of a classic rough trade record. They're also kind of like comically opposed to the music itself. Yeah, the N-word makes like a number of appearances on this record. It's confrontational. I mean, I think what Dean Blunt does is confrontational typically, often in a kind of playful way that leaves you... wondering how serious he is, but if you called him out and said you're not being serious, someone would say no, he is being serious. I mean, you mentioned the kind of usage of the N-word. I feel like the sort of racial dimension in Dean Blunt's music is sort of becoming increasingly pronounced. I mean, I saw him perform in Amsterdam. in a sort of a fairly, I guess, like upscale cultural, like event space. So, you know, it was very much like, it wasn't just like a sort of a gig. It was like, it felt reasonably kind of sophisticated and stayed. And he's a visual artist himself, isn't he? Oh yeah. Yeah. And I mean, the performance was incredible. Like it was, this sadly was in 2013, but it was one of my favorites. favourite live performances of recent times. But it was just striking that, I mean, he always has a black bouncer on stage when he performs and he said, you know, and again, it's hard to tell how tongue in cheek that is, but basically that like, it's nice to have a brother in the room with him because like, you know, this crowd was like 100% white. that he was performing to. And, you know, I feel like he is hyper-conscious of this, like, discrepancy between, like, you know, his kind of experience and perspective as, like, a black person and the audience that seems to have kind of picked up on his music. Yeah, I mean, he's playing music that is completely sort of in a white milieu, you know? And I wonder with this record being on rough trade and sounding like a kind of, to an extent, like a kind of to what extent he's like interrogating that you know but as like you say it's always hard to know to what extent it's sincere and to what extent it's it's not yeah i do like in a way i think jordan our experiences with this record were kind of similar in that he's one of those artists whose music i follow quite closely but i haven't necessarily been like tuned into the soap opera surrounding him and the kind of like media circus and the you know the few interviews that he has given but i was also just blown away by but just the arrangements by the song craft like i think the strings in particular on this record were fantastic i think something that kind of really resonates with me is just like singing voice it kind of reminds me of like a dub vocalist or something um he has that kind of half spoken, half singing kind of thing going on. And somehow it's, it's, I mean, it, even though it does seem to come out of a very different musical tradition than the musical accompaniment, like I think his vocals just fit really, really well with this style of music. Yeah, absolutely. I think there's something I was going to say, there's something very London about what he does as well. It seems like he's a, he's a product and his kind of art is a products that could only have come from London in a way and I know that like just even watching some of his recent videos it's something like you know as a subject matter he seems to be riffing on and feel very connected to if you like as an aside you mentioned the arrangements I don't know to what extent this is true for black metal but with the Redeemer which is a very lush record and feels kind of opulent in the way that like a kind of a 70s like soft rock record would be opulent or something in places but you slowly realize that you know people online as people are wanting to do have like researched this extensively everything on it is a sample there is even like just this little guitar twangs and things like that like sampled from the intros to like records and the sample sources are like unbelievably diverse so the the kind of amazing like kind of Aaron Copland style string intro to the Redeemer is like the intro to like sort of Z-list R&B record from like 1999, stuff like this. So again, there's this level of like, you know, you think he's like painstakingly kind of got studio musicians and like arranged in the traditional way, this kind of... pop music, but actually it's all like stitched together from other sources. Yeah, I think that has to be true here. I mean, I know that there were a couple of points when I was listening to some of it where you can almost hear like a loop click back over just a little bit. Interesting to me that wasn't even question i asked myself like i just took it as a given that you know these were original compositions like you know he pulled it off in such a way where you didn't see the gaps you didn't see the cracks between these things um will tell us about your choices from suzanne craft i think it's a la artist who's been on uh people's radars this year yeah the album uh or mini album miss them I mostly chose it because I thought it was a bit underappreciated, but it's sort of, yeah, just an incredibly nice ambient, I guess you'd say, ambient album. Yeah, a few years ago, Philip Sherburn, in a review of one of Suzanne Craft's house tracks, he used this term SoCal Lyric. in kind of like a tongue-in-cheek way. I think he said, we shouldn't just think of Suzanne Kraft as SoCal Lyric. Obviously, like Southern California Lyric. But yeah, even though this is, it's not like dance music at all, it kind of has the same balmy, kind of like swaying palm trees sort of vibe to it. But there's just something about it that like... when you put it on, it's like within 10 seconds, there's a sort of like feeling of relaxation descends and it just achieves this sort of soothing quality so easily. And it's the kind of record where like anytime I play it for someone pretty quickly, they're like, damn, what is this? Like, even though it's quite subtle, it's quite airy and everything. yeah, it just has a very effect. And in general too, I just, I'm sort of interested by what his deal is. Like he occupies a pretty interesting little sound world. He has a record coming out on animals, dancing, the Australian, it's like a label arm of an Australian party under the name dude energy. And it's kind of like, no idea how to describe it it still has the same sort of like you know balleric for lack of a better term the sort of like sunny breezy thing but also very very strange and kind of and tongue-in-cheek sounding or something but anyway we've also got a mix up coming from him which again sort of like delves into just really fascinatingly sort of varied but also very coherent you know sound that's quite vivid sunny texturally rich but anyway this album in particular it's just about 35 minutes or so of Yeah, just wonderfully immersive, breezy, ambient music that, yeah, that was fantastic. Okay, to, um... finish us off as we don't include RA podcasts in our online mixes poll. I'm going to quickly go around the room and have everybody talk about what they saw was a kind of standout RA mix of the year. So Angus, tell us about your selection. My pick was Marco Shuttle, who I think has had a fantastic year. Sing Like a Bird, which came out on Time to Express earlier this year, was probably my favorite techno track of the year. and he's just released or perhaps still in the process of releasing an album called Vigione which is really good and kind of pushes his aesthetic and interesting new directions but he just has a you can recognise a Marco Shuttle production from a mile off although the mix only actually features kind of three of his tracks and a very broad range of other stuff I feel like it captures what he's about very nicely Well, I chose Low Tech. Basically, Low Tech is kind of an interesting character to me. One of the two principal guys behind Workshop, which is for a long time been one of my favorite labels. And I always heard he was a great DJ, but he doesn't really put himself out there too much. And so, yeah, it was just kind of a pleasant surprise to get this mix from Low Tech, which is very much one of these mixes. I feel like this has been a recurring theme in this discussion. It's like he really has his own, you know, like he occupies his own musical space. And each of these tracks sort of gives you a feeling of like you can't imagine where this came from or what year it's from, what label it's from. It's all just... Yeah, sort of like totally fresh in a way that I feel doesn't happen enough, at least with me. Yeah, I guess there's a Casa Moss track, the second track on there's coming out soon on Honest Johns. It's absolutely incredible. Jordan? I went with the Shanty Celeste podcast. I think more and more when I'm thinking about like favorite DJ sets or favorite times just hearing records played, often it's not at a club. It's not someone famous. It's just like a friend of mine who has really good taste in music. You know, I could be sitting on their couch. They're playing great records. I want to know what all of them are. And this mix kind of felt like that. Shanti works at Idle Hands in Bristol. Again, some of the best DJ sets you'll ever hear from record store employees because they hear everything. This was a mix where when it first came on in the office, I just kept thinking, I want to know what this track is. I want to know what this track is. I want to know what this track is. I think there are two or three tracks that I train spotted from that mix. It was just a really great set. And that's all you can ask for from a mix, I guess. I thought I wanted to mention a few mixes, the first of which was Lena Willikens, who's a DJ who's connected to a club called Salander Amateurs in Dusseldorf. She's someone that I don't think was on the radar of most people this time last year, but she's someone who I think over kind of years of playing is just sort of... emerged seemingly out of nowhere with a kind of style that's very unique to her I think kind of beauty of her mix was that she was playing music from kind of familiar producers but the way that she was doing so kind of totally recontextualize it I liked the pacing of it I liked the overall tempo I think there were enough kind of interesting like standout moments to keep kind of coming back to it I just think although, you know, you wouldn't say anything that she was doing was radically different. It did show just how much like, you know, nuance we can sort of achieve with these styles of music and how just like colouring outside the lines a little bit and really can, you know. help a DJ to stand out we mentioned the Panda Street Steppers mix that we have coming up before so I won't go into that too much but the last one I want to talk about was DJ Tay from the Tech Life crew whose mix we're putting out just before New Year's as a kind of like alternative party mix if you like so obviously Rashad passed away this year and I think Like the collective response from that group has kind of been fantastic in a way. You know, they're increasingly on the radars of people. They're getting footwork out there in a way that's kind of very coherent and very meaningful. There's like 20 of these guys or something now because we'd initially asked for like a tech life crew mix or something. Obviously these guys are playing so much of each other's music anyway that any of them pretty much could have done it. But I think this mix does a great job of just not only encapsulating what they're doing as artists, but just why we're all talking about footwork and why it is becoming a global thing.
