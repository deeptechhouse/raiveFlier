Hello and welcome to Resident Advisor's Exchange, a series of conversations with the artists, labels, and promoters that are shaping the electronic music landscape. My name is Tidal Burns, and I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Resident Advisor. Macro label head Stefan Goldman, it's safe to say, isn't about making money in the electronic music biz. Whether he's releasing an edit of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, a box set of five 7-inches of electroacoustic music, or guitar drones on a limited edition cassette tape, it's clear that the producer loves to challenge listeners as much as he likes to challenge himself. We talked about some of this work, some of his more conventional 4/4 pursuits, and his father, classical composer Friedrich Goldman, late last month. I interviewed you a couple years ago, and one thing you didn't allow me to put in the interview was the fact that your father was a composer. And I wanted to sort of begin there, because I guess people may not know that, but you feel more comfortable now talking about that, it seems like. Things changed in many ways. I'm a bit unfortunate that he passed away two years ago, one and a half years ago. And in the meantime, I feel comfortable enough with my own work to actually allow people to draw the line. I was always afraid that they would just start making like the father-son combo. And now I think I have like a distinctive body of work of my own as far as I can have maybe for my age and he has his achievements. I'm also now actually in charge of the administration of his works. So I actually have to do something about it this way or the other. Well, what else to do then? To bring out a CD with macro is obviously the first thing to happen. What is the CD going to be? It's a CD of his late works, like for the last two years, what he wrote and what was recorded and we're just looking into new ways of distribution and this one will be mainly distributed to The Wire. So it will be a cut-and-mount CD basically, it will be a macro CD, but it will be sent out with this magazine in the UK. And that's just a way to have many people at one point in time to have the chance to hear this music for his 70th birthday, which would have come up this year. Thank you. For those not familiar with his work, how would you characterize it in the classical canon? Was it pretty, with the times, very modern? Yeah, I mean, he was... a student of Stockhausen, a West German avant-garde composer and certainly wasn't a retro classical composer. contemporary classical avant-garde artists who wrote many different things from chamber works up to opera school works, there's an opera. But I don't really like describing it, that's why I'm also doing the CD so people can just listen themselves. and often tags like avant-garde or classical or contemporary classical just distract from music because people expect something and then they might not listen to it or might not listen in a way which they would if they if they're caught unprepared sure so what I want to do is just get the music out to the people and let them just discover it and make their own decisions on it you said he was a student of Stockhausen so you he was German he was German but your mother was Bulgarian my mother is and my father is actually East German and he was studying with Strachausen before the wall was built so he was still allowed to travel from East Germany to West Germany to attend classes and then the wall was built and he had to study at the Dresden Conservatory which back then was maybe like... best place. But still, you know, even under... It's maybe a question which many artists face at some point in their career that even under awful circumstances they have to somehow develop their music and make their career and he could do that even under the circumstances of 60s, 70s East Germany, later going out to Western Europe. When the ball came down he also played in the US and Japan. It kind of worked out for him and we often face this scenario these days too, that people are like: "Well, all the sales go down and all these DJs competing for the one DJ slot of that club and how do I make a living?" There's always a way. That's what we learn from history. I learn from my personal family history sometimes. Did you grow up in Dresden then? No, no. He moved to Berlin in the late 60s, so I was born in East Berlin in Petzloberg, actually. and I grew up between Berlin and Sofia in Bavaria and in the early 90s I moved to West Berlin. Tell me about Sofia. I read a recent interview with you where you talked about Gypsy Musashen and I think he was Bulgarian? No, he's actually Macedonian which is... It's like a big common cultural base between countries like Macedonia, Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Romania even if you want to have a more extended picture and... Roughly this music exists in all of these countries with tiny varieties. At some point I think the first music I actively really enjoyed from the Balkans was Goran Bregovic's music for the Kostorica movies like Underground and Time of the Gypsies. So this was... some music that was like totally different from what I was listening in the West at this point in time but had this incredible appeal and this really very extremely good dance music. Most of the Balkans music I had heard before was music that was produced by the socialist state record labels, which is more supposed to be listening music mostly or like very mild traditional dance music and Goran Gregorievich was just about excess and drinking, heavy drinking and drugs and loud music and just being, well, hedonistic. Something which wasn't promoted by socialist cricket labels at all. What other influence do you feel like the Balkans? a path, spending enough time in the area, does it have on your career or your work? Actually, I think it's much more the personal influence of my friends who went to many different styles of music just enjoying it or playing it actively. I had many friends who were musicians or are musicians at the time. I went away at 12, 13, we listened to heavy metal, Iron Maiden, and then someone started listening to Pink Floyd and that sort of thing, and someone discovered jazz. I always had all the role models in my friends who always pushed me. you know tapes and records into my hands and I check the sound. So I think many of my Bulgarian friends are friends shaped by taste much more than my German friends who were all listening to Depeche Mode, which took me 20 more years to like actually. That's interesting because it's almost invariably the techno Germans that you know are all, it's Depeche Mode, the first artist that they always talk about. It was so big that I couldn't like it really because... I don't know, maybe I wanted to be different when I was growing up. But you did get into dance music. I did get into dance music at some point. Was there a certain artist or a certain type of genre or a certain sound that got you there? I started with the dance music that really grabbed me first was Jungle. There was this very strange Berlin cable TV operator. They had a channel where they put up music videos, but I think they couldn't afford to license more than three. So you had like three videos that have a rotation like for a month. And one was ShyFX with MC Navigator. So this is the first time I was exposed to Django like on some very cheesy German cable TV channel. And I think I was 16. There were like a few clubs where you could actually get in being 16 but... Did you immediately go from seeing that video to being like "I have to go see this in person"? It was just maybe a few months apart. At some point I learned which DJs in Berlin, that there are DJs who play this music, that there are clubs where this music is played. And then at some point I found out that friends who like it as well, who I could convince to go with me and just check it out. I had no clue if they were DJing, they had a flyer which said "Shy FX" and I didn't know if it was live or if it was someone playing records. So I had no clue about how this music is produced or presented at this point in time. And I just came in and saw him behind the DJ mixing desk, obviously, but I thought like, wow, this is a mixer, he's doing it live. But later I saw the record player and I was like, oh, okay, it's just records. Quite a good scene. There were two or three major promoters. One were hard-edged, these are the guys who do Watergate today, the club. Some others did a club called WTF and WMF also. It hosted the hard-hatch parties mostly actually. And there was a club called Toaster. So you had four or five clubs who played ground bass on a very high level, inviting UK DJs and the key artists of that time. And also there were like some... smaller underground clubs who just had local DJs. Do you feel like your DJing style nowadays is somehow influenced by those jungle DJs? Like informed in a way? Rewind selected? Well not you know that consciously but maybe there is some vestige some part of it. still resides in you that doesn't care so much about this like European house idea of one long flow you know Well, I had one experience which was very, very important. I tried to be a drone-based promoter and I failed miserably financially. But a friend of mine and myself, we booked. Matrix, who is Opticus' brother and artist who runs Metro Recordings. And he was like my favorite producer around 1998. and we booked him for a party at the club which we rented for money and thought we could fill it and we didn't fill it but Matrix played an incredible DJ set, like one of the two or three best joint bass DJ sets, even made the best DJ sets ever, I've heard like okay top five. And every record he played was in an incredible track with its own quality. It weren't all just hits, bangers, peak-time tunes, not at all. Every single tune was like, wow, this is such incredible music and where do you get this record? And I was just blown away by it. this selection style of just playing perfect pieces of music for two hours and I hadn't heard that before and I hardly ever hear this until today. So for a long time I had this idea, you know, if the records in my box, if every one of them is an incredible perfect record, you don't even have to bother much more about how to mix them because... It just works on its own and if you can mix them and get them into a sequence that works, you've got to be the best DJ in the world. So that is my philosophy or my point which I try to aim at. And I think this approach, I don't know if I am in between technically and aesthetically the best DJs in the world, but it worked pretty well until 2011. and then things changed that I thought that I can't really work in that style in the clubs at least in Berlin. In what style? In just playing mixing records that are quite different but each one in itself being an incredible record at least in my judgment. and that just people got less tolerant to switches and styles between two tracks. Was there a certain gig that... Yeah, I had a gig at Panorama at the Macro Night where I was just... playing stuff and like every every three records people would just you know dance for three records and then they would just clear the floor for two records and then come back and say okay this doesn't make sense anymore yeah so um i took him on of DJing, just going out and checking out DJs. So what do they do? What do they like about what they don't like about it and how do people react to it? And then I just sat back and just found a method of mixing music that I like that also works well with the crowd. It's still possible, so I think I would never go that far to say, okay, I just play something because people want that. I hate it, but... It's something I heard from so many DJs for the last year. That's really interesting. I mean, they don't say this in front of the press, but they say this to other DJs. Oh, I really can't stand techno anymore. I have to take drugs to play it. It's so awful, I can't listen to it. But people want this and that. It's just strange, you know, when you're in a scene where everyone thinks, it's underground and we do what we like and we do it for fun and we just do something that's different from a commercial world of the mages or of the commercial indies or whatever and then you just find yourself in an environment where people tell you well we actually hate what we do well I think it's an interesting point I think Immediately there's a compromise when you go in front of a crowd at all. Like, it's not much of a compromise of course if there's no one there, but... But, you know, there is this expectation that you want people to have a nice time. You want as many people to dance. And there are more effective ways to get them to dance than others. No, a good DJ is one who... can make the crowd dance to the music he likes actually. I mean otherwise if it's just you know catering to a preset. lists of records you don't need dj it's enough to have an ipod yeah and maybe you can put up some dancing that looks better than the dj but um some of that is due to i guess a forced personality having a name known for something and one of the things that you said in this recent piece that you did was that at a certain point you looked at paraphrasing badly at some point you looked at you know Josh Link and Ricardo Lobos and you decided you didn't want to be the next them you wanted to be the next Stefan Goldman well yeah you can't be the next Ricardo Villalobos because there's just one Ricardo Villalobos and that's that's the point basically But many people who want to be creative, I mean, it's a normal way. You just start out somewhere and you learn by imitating. That's like, I guess, young Ricardo López did the very same thing. And Gang to Swing as well. So that's a normal way to go. But at some point, if you want, I think, it's just, you know, my personal view on things, but if you want to produce... play fulfilling music for yourself and for the people you have to develop a style and view of your own what point do you feel like you had that moment where you were stopped you were not imitating so much anymore or you didn't feel like you were I mean of course you're always no my early records I tried to imitate artists and they ended up sounding entirely different than what I wanted to do. So they just gained some individuality by the pure cause of having limited equipment. Starting out producing with just a sample and one effects unit and one mixer limits your possibilities and then adding one piece of equipment at a time. you just end up sounding like you tweaking the knobs of this specific equipment. Who were you trying to copy in those early days? Well, that's actually different from track to track but there's one of my first tracks which came out in Classic and now I did a reissue in Victoriaville which is called Missing Days. I tried to sound like there's a master at work. It's not just one track actually, but I tried to bring their percussion style. They had a lot of samples of acoustic percussion in the late 90s and I wanted to produce grooves like that and then I just deviated from that idea while producing the track and just started to like the results so it didn't bother. That didn't sound exactly like Monsters at Work. To go back for a moment, how did you get from drum and bass, a failed drum and bass promoter, to a guy who's trying to copy masters at works? That happened through the help of Sophia again. there was a chain of record stores who sold pirated cassettes and CDs which got Unison records and I bought a cassette by Jeff Mills the other day compilation sorry Jeff it's a pirated one and then they bought the original and all the EPs so I think no one can play. And this was still one of my most favorite CDs in techno ever. This just entirely blew me away. And then before I started producing actually I ended up in a house party in Berlin and they played Armin van Helden's "Funk Phenomena" which was just like, okay, I actually do like house. I had bought a sampler by that time, I think a week before I heard this. I think I produced one or two drum and bass tracks and then I was like, okay, let's just go for four-four. I mean, in the beginning I shied away from producing techno. I think because this Jeff Mills CD was so intimidating at that point, it was... It was just perfect in itself for me and I just couldn't imagine ever getting close to that level of composing and producing music at that point. I don't want to say anything against someone for helping with this, but I kind of saw a chance to achieve this rough funk beat quicker than... More quickly. With a sampler. And then you found out quickly that it was quite hard to do what he does. Of course. Was Classic the first label that you were sending stuff to? I tried in Germany, but no one wanted me in Germany. So, actually one of the people I gave a demo to was Dixon, who was a resident DJ then at WMF, I believe. He exists already. And he didn't want it for his... He had a sub-label of Sonar Collective then and he said, "Well, that's not for this." but why don't you send it just to the top labels worldwide? I was like okay which are the top labels? And he gave me a list. So I sent demos, one was the classic and one day I came home and had a message from Luke Solomon on my answering machine. So that is... Oh, a much quicker result than I had expected. The very first track came out on a Luke Solomon and a Riccardo Mix CD on Classic. Later they pressed it on vinyl as well. Did you know much of Classic? I mean you said you didn't know. I had no clue. I had heard DJ Sneak. They had like two or three singles with Sneak. Then I went out to the record shops to check the labels which Dixon had. recommended to me. And I was like, okay, I like this Salt Sandvary. It seems like classic, obviously. quirky vibe to it and I can kind of see how you would fit on there. I think they were very very open to many different styles in house music and they have this you know Derek Carter, arty, Chicago, funky house style but on the other hand they had some very deep records as well, some quite experimental stuff within house. So I think they were just basically open to anything within house music. Why did you go to Dixon first with your music? I went also to others, but I was the only one to actually bother. It's funny because I mean if you imagine like Germany in 1999 there were like maybe two or three record labels that were in house music actually respected outside of Germany. It's just Perlman Playhouse. Basically, that's it, you know, I don't know. few more maybe but actually releasing on a label in the UK or the US or in France was something that seemed out of reach in 99. Very very few people from Germany had done that and some were just licensed like Isolates, Bonopatch got licensed to Classic. There was a track by Low Soul, but very very few German producers had released outside of Germany at that point, maybe not more than 10 to 15 people. Was there a good scene for that stuff in Berlin at the time? I mean, Dixon was quite... I mean, WMF had two top nights. One was Dixon's night with Matthew Prince and the other was by Haifisch and Deringer. Haifisch is with White is Boy Alive today, being the bass player, but he was one of the important house music residents in Berlin. And Steve Buck and Clay were always... active at that time in Berlin. Yeah, that's what I remember. There were like many cheesy French filter house or commercial parties. There were some quite respectable events. Would you regard then Sleepy Hollow as sort of the breakthrough? It's the commercial breakthrough at least. It's the best seller. Maybe what happened to me is that with Classic at some point they wanted me to do an album and I got into that and produced this album for over a year and lost myself quite a bit in this task. And then just before they were ready to release it, they went bankrupt at that point. So everything just fell apart instantly. I took this chance to just say, okay, what do you really want to do? Because I think with the album which I had started producing, I had... try to do something that would work for Classic. Then I just actually thought: "Well, maybe I don't want to sound like that." So I scrapped everything, basically, which I had done on that project and set back and produced in a very distinctively different style at that point. And the first result was an EP which came out in Poland called "Blood". which is way less sample based than what I had done before and very very electronically sounding in terms of the drum sounds and the synthesizers. Was there a particular year that you sort of changed the way you were thinking about or gave you the ability to? Oh, I had one of my best friends works for Native Instruments and he gave me... birthday present a collection of custom-made drum sounds so I had like my very own collection of well yeah drums which only I had and no one no one else had done to use them I like them so much that I change my whole style around these tiny bits of percussion and later on i bought a synthesizer which is not actually a few years before that but i had to use it with classic just doing bass lines and later i use it for everything basically which is the microwave by waldorf and that also changed a lot. And then with Sleepy Hollow I actually took the step of abandoning samples completely. It's the first entirely electronic track which has no samples at all. And I developed even more very specific growl sounds which I hadn't heard anywhere before I don't use any classical equipment like Roland drum machines and stuff like that. I just use synthesizers that are not even considered to be drum machines at all and tweak them in a way that they sound recursively. That's an active decision to make sure that you're not sounding like anyone else. Well, that's where it started maybe, I wasn't conscious about it, but I was like, oh, this sounds so good and I should push in that direction and use these sounds more often. And that's when Sleepy Hollow happened. And I think people could just feel that, especially in the rhythms of it. It was very, very lively and dynamic. I had managed to program a hi-hat sound. which keep changing with every single hit, which is very hard to achieve. So it sounded very, very electronic, very artificial, but very lively at the same time. So it wasn't like, you know, emulating a live drummer, but... making electronic percussion very lively and that's something that appealed very much obviously I think together with the melody of the trick which is kind of catchy and having this feedback I felt very comfortable in continuing in that direction of just exploring new sides of sound. Bye. To go back, I guess, for a moment, your father is this classical composer and you're sitting there making this dance music for clubs. Were you going to him with the stuff that you were making and saying... take a listen to this, what do you think? I didn't do this for a long time, I just, I think the first thing I really replayed in a whole length to him was the Voices of the Dead album I did later on, which was more experimental, but it came together as a CD double package with, well, my then available like 10 tracks of modern... music, post-mobile technology, whatever you want to call it. And I gave him this two-CD set. While I was growing up, when I was a child, my father and all of his friends were totally against anything that is outside of the realm of avant-garde classical music, basically. I mean, they considered rock music down. they considered pop dumb and jazz was like well sort of you know sometimes sometimes it can get interesting so they were very very arrogant and cocky about any other music than their own and so Maybe that's also something that pushes you to something like techno when you want to do the exact opposite of what these people do. But I think in the last years he opened up very much also... He taught composition at the Conservatory in Berlin, the Universität der Künste, and one of his students was Paul Frick of... Brandbauer Fried and I think he played him to him a huge deal of techno and yeah, the father opened up to different kinds of music finally after turning 60 years of age I think when he was 15 or 16 he was listening to anything I guess it probably I don't know if it was Paul specifically he was like the only one but I guess it took someone like Paul who was classically trained and could sort of show him that you know there is complexity there is worth there is possibilities definitely so how did you get to macro from doing singles you know on different labels um What was the classic reason of, you know, I'm getting some of my tracks. There's no place for them. I want to start my own outlet. Yeah, that's something that happens that you recognize that everyone who does a label with Husen A&R, and I'm not excluding myself, just has its own preferences and it's all... schedule and its own priorities. It was fantastic releasing a classic and it was fantastic releasing an Obelman, Perner and all these labels but you're always just one out of many artists, especially when the labels get bigger and it's always a hard thing for a very small label to handle 50 artists. So what happens is that you have this new track and you're very excited about it and then the end artist says "well yeah, you know, I love it but the schedule is full for the next 16 months or one and a half years" or something like that. and that happened a lot. With Classic, or maybe with Classic not that much, but with Ovum I had to really shout to them over the telephone, otherwise the records which I did there would have been on the shelf for like two years or more. But yeah, A&Rs have their own preferences and they say "We like this track and we don't like the B-side" or "We do like the B-side but we don't like... the long ending of the A-side, can you cut this? And many labels work on a basis where they push a certain sound. And when you deviate from that sound, you just, well, do music that doesn't work for them. That doesn't mean that they don't like them personally, but it doesn't work with the label concept. And I was tired of basically being forced to... find new labels for every new track I was doing. That's what happened a lot. Sleepy Hollow also ended up on Innovisions because Perlin couldn't put it out within a reasonable time of you know, just month. So they said, well, the schedule is full like for a year. And I was like, no, come on. Then I thought, well, actually, maybe with not that much effort, I can do a label that makes sense where I can release not just my own tracks, but also the tracks of other people who maybe have the same difficulties in finding a label with that stuff like I had at that point. So gradually, Macro was supposed to open up to other artists. You work with a Berlin-based DJ, among other things, Finn Johansen. What does Finn bring to the label? What do you bring to the label, would you say? Finn brings many years of expertise in a field where I'm missing expertise and vice versa. Finn has been a DJ for a very long time. He grew up in Hamburg around the famous Front Club and has a huge record collection and knows a lot about Stars of Music which I don't know about. know much about and I mean as I said I grew up more on heavy metal and then maybe jazz and other pretentious things. And Finn has just this, you know, real like, well, knowledge and life in dance music. So we had this combined experience making it possible for us to actually not just produce the music of now or... trying to create directions for the future, but also go back in time with this combined experience so he could point out names. and I could point out names that we think might be worth reconsidering. I mean there's so much music that is really good but it's not really new anymore and it was kind of neglected or it's forgotten and we also wanted to bring back Burton. certain records and have someone remix them so we could combine an artist who is very good in what he does now with an artist who did something incredible 10 or 15 or 20 years ago or more. Talking about like the Slap record. Yeah, the Slap record is a classic example of someone who basically almost no one knew until... We decided to put him out and have his tracks remixed by Ricardo Villalobos. There's a joke I see you every once in a while around town. every single time I see you I'm like okay like what's the new concept like what's the project yeah with Finn we call it the concept of the week but I feel you have to do it somehow I mean it's not enough anymore to just do good music or great music even because there's so much music out there that you actually have to justify what you do I mean gone are the days where you could Just turn on some drum machine and program a 4/4 beat and say like, "Wow, I just invented techno." That's not enough anymore. You have to have a secondary, a level of actually justifying why you are polluting the planet with even more music than we already have. Because we do have more music than we can ever listen to. And it's all available. There are very few things that fade away out of availability. Well, there were at some point, but... just now for the moment, like every week, I don't know how many new releases are just labeled Minimal Tech House from Mannheim. You have thousands of records competing for our time and if it's just a cool beat or just, you know, that's a good song, I feel it's not enough anymore. You have to have an incredible... incredible beat and an incredible song and an incredible bassline to it and it has to have a top story, you know, why you should actually care about it. And we're just trying to apply this. principle on everything we release to just actually know why are we releasing this record now. Your productions that do stand out, obviously sometimes reviewers or audiences are completely turned off by it. And I was wondering... you know when you get when you get bad reviews I don't want to play psychologist but I mean is that secretly a good thing too? Well, the only thing that really worries me if I get like indifferent reviews because it means I haven't actually done something right because I mean basically a very good record will have opinions go either to the one extreme or to the other. are indifferent about it it means you know it has no nothing to really appeal to anyone so If you get a very very bad review, at least, I mean, you have to trust your own capabilities that you are able to produce at least on a basically good level. So, you know, if you just produce the most awful, really awful record, objectively awful record of all time, if that's possible, and you get a bad review, that's kind of natural. But if you know actually you're capable of producing good music and then people hate it. Usually it's not because it's just awfully produced that you're not capable of producing a good record but because people are offended by its aesthetics and that's a good thing I think. So every new step in music has always found a position. I mean I don't claim that I invent like an entirely new style of music but within what I'm working on, if I get very hard reactions, if it's supportive or not, it's just a good sign. for me, but actually I get reactions. One of the records, not to talk too much about reviews and reviewing, but one of the records I found the hardest to write about that you did was the Stravinsky. edit because it seemed just like a conceptual exercise potentially and nothing more. I don't know. What was the basic thought process behind that first of all, this Stravinsky thing? First of all, Well, there was this fashion of recent years of remixing and editing everything one could get one's hands on. And so you had all these releases of disco edits and old school house edits and every new track being edited. to death and see all these DJs running around with their CDRs and everything they can. They cut it into one layout. On the other hand you have this fashion of people remixing classical music and actually turning it into something entirely different. And having these two developments in my head, I didn't feel comfortable with both of them. And if you think about it for a long time, you just come up with an idea like doing an edit that doesn't change the edited track at all. And you can only do this with classical music because you have all these different recorded versions of one composition. So you have one composition which is laid out in a score and then you have hundreds of recordings of Stravinsky's Sacré-Déprintemps. enables you to edit without changing the composition which you can't do with disco music because you just have one recording which is the recording and the composition in the same thing. So it was basically a statement first that there are originals and they have a worth to them and also lining out that there's this fascinating world of classical recording and interpretation where why are there different recordings of one piece of music. So there must be some subtle differences at least. And this edit is just flicking through this world in high speed basically because every eight seconds you can just judge for yourself if there is a difference or not in the room which you hear, in the interpretation, in the microphone positioning and all these parameters which are subject to change if you just edit the recordings. Not the score. Did you feel like people got that? Yeah. I mean, at first I thought everyone would say, okay, what the fuck. But even the distributor was surprised that actually there was an interest in this. I mean, at first when I described to Markus' distributor what we were about to do, they were like, oh, okay, don't press too many CDs. And then we had to repress two or three times. I mean, we didn't sell like tens of thousands, but it... it did sell and people were interested and I even I got booked for performing the edit live in Austria so how do you perform an edit live that was quite a task but I managed to find the way to do this and then people would come to me oh excuse me at the you know 14th minute was this the recording by Sir George Sholty. No? Oh, okay, I thought it was. So it's so funny that people actually try to identify the recordings and... It was also a chance for me to get exposure in a different world of music, which is not dance music. So I've always wanted not to limit myself just within one tiny genre of music. you
